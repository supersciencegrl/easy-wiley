         <title>Advancing Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Isoreticular Cluster Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trigonal planar M3(O/OH) trimers are among the most important clusters in inorganic chemistry and are the foundational features of multiple high&#8208;impact MOF platforms. Here we introduce a concept called isoreticular cluster series and demonstrate that M3(O/OH), as the first member of a supertrimer series, can be combined with a higher hierarchical member (double&#8208;deck trimer here) to advance isoreticular chemistry. We report here an isoreticular series of pore&#8208;space&#8208;partitioned MOFs called M3M6pacs made from co&#8208;assembly between M3 single&#8208;deck trimer and M3x2 double&#8208;deck trimer. Important factors were identified on this multi&#8208;modular MOF platform to guide optimization of each module, which enables the phase selection of M3M6pacs by overcoming the formation of previously&#8208;always&#8208;observed same&#8208;cluster phases. The new pacs materials exhibit high surface area and high uptake capacity for CO2 and small hydrocarbons, as well as selective adsorption properties relevant to separation of industrially important mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4. Furthermore, new M3M6pacs materials show electrocatalytic properties with high activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Regulating D&#8208;orbital Spin&#8208;electron Filling in Single&#8208;atom Iron Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst has shown great promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), yet the intrinsic activity is not satisfactory. There is a pressing need to gain a deeper understanding of the charge configuration of the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst and to develop rational modulation strategies. Herein, we have prepared a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst with the co&#8208;coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe&#8208;N/O&#8208;C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d&#8208;orbital spin&#8208;electron filling of Fe sites by fine&#8208;tuning the first coordination shell. The Fe&#8208;N/O&#8208;C exhibits significantly better ORR activity compared to its Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C counterpart and commercial Pt/C, with a much more positive half&#8208;wave potential (0.927 V) and higher kinetic current density. Moreover, using the Fe&#8208;N/O&#8208;C catalyst, the Zn&#8208;air battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cell achieve peak power densities of up to 490 and 1179 mW cm&#8208;2, respectively. Theoretical studies and in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy reveal that Fe&#8208;N/O&#8208;C undergoes charge redistribution and negative shifting of the d&#8208;band center compared to Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C, thus optimizing the adsorption free energy of ORR intermediates. This work demonstrates the feasibility of introducing an asymmetric first coordination shell for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a new optimization direction for their practical application.</dc:description>

Herein, we have prepared a single-atom Fe catalyst with the co-coordination of N and O (denoted as Fe-N/O-C) and adjacent defect, proposing a strategy to optimize the d-orbital spin-electron filling of Fe sites by fine-tuning the first coordination shell.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Grafted Single&#8208;Atomic Pt&#8208;Nx Complex with a Precisely Regulating Coordination Sphere for Efficient Electron Acceptor&#8208;Inducing Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of the Pt(bpy)Cl2 molecule, a simple post&#8208;modification amide reaction was firstly used to graft it onto the surface of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125, which formed a highly efficient electron acceptor that induced the conversion of the photoinduced charge migration pathway from internal BDC&#8594;TiOx migration to external BDC&#8594;PtNx migration, significantly improving the efficiency of photoinduced electron transfer and separation. Furthermore, precise control over the first coordination sphere of Pt single atoms was achieved using further post&#8208;modification with additional bipyridine to investigate the effect of Pt&#8208;Nx coordination numbers on reaction activity. The as&#8208;synthesized NML&#8208;PtN2 exhibited superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of 7.608 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, a remarkable improvement of 225 and 2.26 times compared to pristine NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and NML&#8208;PtN4, respectively. In addition, the superior apparent quantum yield of 4.01% (390 nm) and turnover frequency of 190.3 h&#8722;1 (0.78 wt% Pt SA; 129 times compared to Pt nanoparticles/NML) revealed the high solar utilization efficiency and hydrogen evolution activity of the material. And macroscopic color changes caused by the transition of carrier migration paths was first observed. It holds profound significance for the design of MOF&#8208;Molecule catalysts with efficient charge carrier separation and precise regulation of single&#8208;atom coordination sphere.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;propanol from CO2 Electroreduction on Bicontinuous Cu2O/Cu Nanodomains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>n&#8208;propanol is an important pharmaceutical and pesticide intermediate. To produce n&#8208;propanol by electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising way, but is largely restricted by the very low selectivity and activity. How to promote the coupling of *C1 and *C2 intermediates to form the *C3 intermediate for n&#8208;propanol formation is challenging. Here, we propose the construction of bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu electrocatalyst, which consists of ultra&#8208;small Cu2O nanodomains, Cu nanodomains and large amounts of grain boundaries between Cu2O and Cu nanodomains. The n&#8208;propanol current density is as high as 101.6 mA cm&#8722;2 at the applied potential of &#8722;1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in flow cell, with the Faradaic efficiency up to 12.1%. Moreover, the catalyst keeps relatively stable during electrochemical CO2 reduction process. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the bicontinuous structure of Cu2O/Cu can facilitate the *CO formation, *CO&#8208;*CO coupling and *CO&#8208;*OCCO coupling for the final generation of n&#8208;propanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Desymmetrization of Cyclic Sulfonimidamides by Asymmetric Allylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the first transition metal&#8208;catalyzed approach to the enantioenriched synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides relying on commercially available palladium catalysts and ligands. High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) was employed to identify the optimal catalyst system and solvent. &#160;The method is applied to a variety of saturated and unsaturated rings and exhibits the highest selectivity for 2&#8208;substituted allyl electrophiles. The products are further elaborated to complex, tricyclic scaffolds. DFT experiments presented herein highlight the key ligand substrate interactions leading to the high levels of enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive Optimization of Lanthanide Nanoparticle Scintillators for Enhanced Triple&#8208;Activated Radioluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) scintillators exhibit huge potential in achieving radionuclide&#8208;activated luminescence (radioluminescence, RL). However, their structure&#8211;activity relationship remains largely unexplored. Herein, progressive optimization of LnNP scintillators is presented to unveil their structure&#8208;dependent RL property and enhance their RL output efficiency. Benefiting from the favorable host matrix and the luminescence&#8208;protective effect of core&#8211;shell engineering, NaGdF4:15%Eu@NaLuF4 nanoparticle scintillators with tailored structures emerged as the top candidates. Living imaging experiments based on optimal LnNP scintillators validated the feasibility of laser&#8208;free continuous RL activated by clinical radiopharmaceuticals for tumor multiplex visualization. This research provides unprecedented insights into the rational design of LnNP scintillators, which would enable efficient energy conversion from Cerenkov luminescence, &#947;&#8208;radiation, and &#946;&#8208;electrons into visible photon signals, thus establishing a robust nanotechnology&#8208;aided approach for tumor&#8208;directed radio&#8208;phototheranostics.</dc:description>

         <title>Adaptive Response to Solvation in Flexible Molecules: Oligo Hydrates of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural changes induced by water play a pivotal role in chemistry and biology but remain challenging to predict, measure, and control at molecular level. Here we explore size&#8208;governed gas&#8208;phase water aggregation in the flexible molecule&#160;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone, modeling the conformational adaptability of flexible substrates to host water scaffolds and the preference for sequential droplet growth. The experiment was conducted using broadband rotational spectroscopy, rationalized with quantum chemical calculations. Two different isomers were observed experimentally from the di&#8208; to the pentahydrates (4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone&#8208;(water)n = 2&#8208;5), including the 18O isotopologues for the di&#8208; and trihydrates. Interestingly, to accommodate water molecules effectively, the heavy atom skeleton of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone reshapes in every observed isomer and does not correspond to the stable conformer of the free monomer. All solvates initiate from the (proton donor) alcohol group but retain the carbonyl group as secondary binding point. The water scaffolds closely resemble those found in the pure water clusters, balancing&#160;between the capability of 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;butanone for steering the orientation and position of the water molecules and the ability of water to modulate the monomer's conformation. The present work thus provides&#160;an accurate molecular answer on how torsionally flexible molecules dynamically adapt to water along progressing solvation.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Twisting&#8208;induced Helical Structures from Polyvinyl Alcohol&#8208;based Fibers Containing Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Dyes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have garnered significant attention owing to its distinctive optical characteristics and broad range of potential applications.  However,  the challenge remains in producing RTP materials with more simplicity, versatility, and practicality on a large scale, particularly in achieving chiral signals within a single system. Herein, we show that a straightforward and effective combination of wet spinning and twisting technique enables continuously fabricating RTP fibers with twisting&#8208;induced helical chirality. By leveraging the hydrogen bonding interactions between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and quinoline derivatives, along with the rigid microenvironment provided by PVA chains, typically, Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber demonstrates outstanding phosphorescent characteristics with RTP lifetime of 1.08 s and phosphorescence quantum yield of 24.6%, and the improved tensile strength being 1.7 times than pure PVA fiber (172 &#177; 5.82 vs 100 &#177; 5.65 MPa). Impressively, the transformation from RTP to circularly polarized room temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;RTP) is readily achieved by imparting left&#8208; or right&#8208;hand helical structure through simply twisting, enabling large&#8208;scale production of chiral Q&#8208;NH2@PVA fiber with dissymmetry factor of 10&#8208;2. Besides, an array of displays and encryption patterns are crafted by weaving or seaming to exemplify the promising applications of these PVA&#8208;based fibers with outstanding adaptivity in cutting&#8208;edge anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Paper&#8208;in&#8208;Tip Bipolar Electrospray Mass Spectrometry for Real&#8208;Time Chemical Reaction Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capturing short&#8208;lived intermediates at the molecular level is key to understanding the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions. Here, we have developed a paper&#8208;in&#8208;tip bipolar electrolytic electrospray mass spectrometry platform, in which a piece of triangular conductive paper incorporated into a plastic pipette tip serves not only as an electrospray emitter but also as a bipolar electrode (BPE), thus triggering both electrospray and electrolysis simultaneously upon application of a high voltage. The bipolar electrolysis induces a pair of redox reactions on both sides of BPE, enabling both electro&#8208;oxidation and electro&#8208;reduction processes regardless of the positive or negative ion mode, thus facilitating access to complementary structural information for mechanism elucidation. Our method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of transient intermediates (such as N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline radical cation, dopamine o&#8208;quinone (DAQ) and sulfenic acid with half&#8208;lives ranging from microseconds to minutes) and transient processes (such as DAQ cyclization with a rate constant of 0.15 s&#8722;1). This platform also provides key insights into electrocatalytic reactions such as Fe (III)&#8208;catalyzed dopamine oxidation to quinone species at physiological pH for neuromelanin formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Self&#8208;Assembly of Dissipative Structures Sustained by Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coupling between energy&#8208;consuming molecular processes and the macroscopic dimension plays an important role in nature and in the development of active matter. Here, we study the temporal evolution of a macroscopic system upon the local activation of a dissipative self&#8208;assembly process. Injection of surfactant molecules in a substrate&#8208;containing hydrogel results in the local substrate&#8208;templated formation of assemblies, which are catalysts for the conversion of substrate into waste. We show that the system develops into a macroscopic (pseudo&#8208;)non&#8208;equilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by the local presence of energy&#8208;dissipating assemblies and persistent substrate and waste concentration gradients. For elevated substrate concentrations, this state can be maintained for more than 4 days. The studies reveal an interdependence between the dissipative assemblies and the concentration gradients: catalytic activity by the assemblies results in sustained concentration gradients and, vice versa, continuous diffusion of substrate to the assemblies stabilizes their size. The possibility to activate dissipative processes with spatial control and create long lasting non&#8208;equilibrium steady states enables dissipative structures to be studied in the space&#8208;time domain, which is of relevance for understanding biological systems and for the development of active matter.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanisms of Hypohalous Acid Formation and Electrophilic Halogenation by Non&#8208;Native Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic halogenases in nature are typically not efficient. Guided by flavin&#8208;dependent halogenase mechanisms and taking advantage of the versatile reactivity of a flavin hydroperoxide adduct and in situ generation of H2O2 by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, it was possible to promote the formation of a hypohalous acid&#8212;which is key for electrophilic halogenation&#8212;in various non&#8208;native halogenases by rerouting the flavin&#8208;generated peroxide.







Abstract
Enzymatic electrophilic halogenation is a mild tool for functionalization of diverse organic compounds. Only a few groups of native halogenases are capable of catalyzing such a reaction. In this study, we used a mechanism&#8208;guided strategy to discover the electrophilic halogenation activity catalyzed by non&#8208;native halogenases. As the ability to form a hypohalous acid (HOX) is key for halogenation, flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases/oxidases capable of forming C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin (FlC4a&#8208;OOH), such as dehalogenase, hydroxylases, luciferase and pyranose&#8208;2&#8208;oxidase (P2O), and flavin reductase capable of forming H2O2 were explored for their abilities to generate HOX in situ. Transient kinetic analyses using stopped&#8208;flow spectrophotometry/fluorometry and product analysis indicate that FlC4a&#8208;OOH in dehalogenases, selected hydroxylases and luciferases, but not in P2O can form HOX; however, the HOX generated from FlC4a&#8208;OOH cannot halogenate their substrates. Remarkably, in situ H2O2 generated by P2O can form HOI and also iodinate various compounds. Because not all enzymes capable of forming FlC4a&#8208;OOH can react with halides to form HOX, QM/MM calculations, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and structural analysis were carried out to elucidate the mechanism underlying HOX formation and characterize the active site environment. Our findings shed light on identifying new halogenase scaffolds besides the currently known enzymes and have invoked a new mode of chemoenzymatic halogenation.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Multidimensional Functional Materials from Sequence&#8208;Defined Peptoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between microscopic molecular structures of sequenced&#8208;defined peptoids and their resultant macroscopic assemblies was explored. By incorporating tetraphenylethylene and its derivative as functional groups at the termini of peptoid sequences, three&#8208;dimensional twisted bundles were evolved from discrete nanotubes or nanosheets, further enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system.







Abstract
Hierarchical self&#8208;assembly represents a powerful strategy for the fabrication of functional materials across various length scales. However, achieving precise formation of functional hierarchical assemblies remains a significant challenge and requires a profound understanding of molecular assembly interactions. In this study, we present a molecular&#8208;level understanding of the hierarchical assembly of sequence&#8208;defined peptoids into multidimensional functional materials, including twisted nanotube bundles serving as a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and analyzing single crystal structures of model compounds, we elucidated the molecular packing and mechanisms underlying the assembly of peptoids into multidimensional nanostructures. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating aromatic functional groups, such as tetraphenyl ethylene (TPE), at the termini of assembling peptoid sequences promotes the formation of twisted bundles of nanotubes and nanosheets, thus enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system. This research exemplifies the potential of leveraging sequence&#8208;defined synthetic polymers to translate microscopic molecular structures into macroscopic assemblies. It holds promise for the development of functional materials with precisely controlled hierarchical structures and designed functions.

&lt;p&gt;The correlation between microscopic molecular structures of sequenced-defined peptoids and their resultant macroscopic assemblies was explored. By incorporating tetraphenylethylene and its derivative as functional groups at the termini of peptoid sequences, three-dimensional twisted bundles were evolved from discrete nanotubes or nanosheets, further enabling the creation of a highly efficient artificial light harvesting system.

         <title>Enantiopure Corral[4]BINOLs as Ultrastrong Receptors for Recognition and Differential Sensing of Steroids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of enantiomeric macrocycles, RRRR&#8208; and SSSS&#8208;C[4]BINOL, demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) towards 16 important steroidal compounds in aqueous solutions, establishing them the most effective known steroid receptors. The two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids in biofluids.







Abstract
The precise recognition and sensing of steroids, a type of vital biomolecules, hold immense practical value across various domains. In this study, we introduced corral[4]BINOLs (C[4]BINOLs), a pair of enantiomeric conjugated deep&#8208;cavity hosts, as novel synthetic receptors for binding steroids. Due to the strong hydrophobic effect of their deep nonpolar, chiral cavities, the two enantiomers of C[4]BINOLs demonstrated exceptionally high recognition affinities (up to 1012&#8197;M&#8722;1) for 16 important steroidal compounds as well as good enantioselectiviy (up to 15.5) in aqueous solutions, establishing them as the most potent known steroid receptors. Harnessing their ultrahigh affinity, remarkable enantioselectivity, and fluorescence emission properties, the two C[4]BINOL enantiomers were employed to compose a fluorescent sensor array which achieved discrimination and sensing of 16 structurally similar steroids at low concentrations.

         <title>The CF3 Group as a Synthon of the CF+ Unit in Palladium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulling fluorine off: The unusually high activity of the C&#8722;F bond found in the homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; is correlated to the very low fluoride&#8208;ion affinity of the conjugate difluorocarbene complex [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722;, which is experimentally detected. Selective single, double or triple defluorination of a CF3 group is achieved under very mild conditions.







Abstract
The homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; (1) is shown to be highly active towards amines. Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH2, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF3 ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CNR)]&#8722; (R=aryl). In this process the original CF3 group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of 1 with secondary amines R2NH proceeds with loss of just two F&#8208;substituents, whereby the Fischer&#8208;type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CFNR2)]&#8722; are formed (R=Et, Ph). The reaction of 1 with diamines affords different [(CF3)3Pd(NHC)]&#8722; complexes containing sterically non&#8208;demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene rings as well as the expanded&#8208;ring perimidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. This metal&#8208;tailored synthetic route, where a CF3 group acts as a pre&#8208;carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC&#8208;chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non&#8208;isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722; is experimentally detected.

         <dc:description>
A novel tetraphenylethene&#8208;based octacationic spirobicycle has been easily synthesized via one&#8208;step bicyclization based on the size&#8208;matching strategy. Through host&#8211;guest interaction with d(GpC) dinucleotide, the spirobicycle can capture a biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex within its dual cavities in the crystalline state and show the adaptive chirality sensing in the aqueous solution.







Abstract
In biological systems, nucleotide quadruplexes (such as G&#8208;quadruplexes) in DNA and RNA that are held together by multiple hydrogen bonds play a crucial functional role. The biomimetic formation of these hydrogen&#8208;bonded quadruplexes captured by artificial systems in water poses a significant challenge but can offer valuable insights into these complex functional structures. Herein, we report the formation of biomimetic hydrogen&#8208;bonded G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex captured by a tetraphenylethene (TPE) based octacationic spirobicycle (1). The spirobicyclic compound possesses a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crossing dual&#8208;cavity structure, which enables the encapsulation of four d(GpC) dinucleotide molecules, thereby realizing 1&#8201;:&#8201;4 host&#8211;guest complexation in water. The X&#8208;ray structure reveals that four d(GpC) molecules further form a two&#8208;layer G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C quadruplex with Watson&#8211;Crick hydrogen bonds, which are stabilized within the dual hydrophobic cavities of 1 through the cooperative non&#8208;covalent interactions of hydrogen bonds, CH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions, and hydrophobic effect. Due to the dynamically&#8208;rotational propeller chirality of TPE units, 1 with adaptive chirality can further serve as a chiroptical sensor to exhibit opposite Cotton effects with mirror&#8208;image CD spectra for the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies of d(GpC) including the Watson&#8211;Crick G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C (pH&#8197;9.22) and Hoogsteen G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;G&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;C+ (pH&#8197;5.74) quartets through the host&#8211;guest chirality transfer in water.

Exposure to gaseous molecules can induce characteristic electrical and magnetic property changes of a semiconductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF). The underlying interaction mechanism responsible for the electrical and magnetic modulation is found related to the intrinsic physical and chemical properties of the participating molecules which cause specific electronic and structural changes of the MOF.







Abstract
Controlled modulation of electronic and magnetic properties in stimuli&#8208;responsive materials provides valuable insights for the design of magnetoelectric or multiferroic devices. This paper demonstrates the modulation of electrical and magnetic properties of a semiconductive, paramagnetic metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2 with small gaseous molecules, NH3, H2S, and NO. This study merges chemiresistive and magnetic tests to reveal that the MOF undergoes simultaneous changes in electrical conductance and magnetization that are uniquely modulated by each gas. The features of response, including direction, magnitude, and kinetics, are modulated by the physicochemical properties of the gaseous molecules. This study advances the design of multifunctional materials capable of undergoing simultaneous changes in electrical and magnetic properties in response to chemical stimuli.

         <title>Functionalization of Supramolecular Polymers by Dynamic Covalent Boroxine Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronic acid self&#8208;condensation provides ready access to boroxine&#8208;based, C3&#8208;symmetrical monomer architectures that can cooperatively assemble into helical supramolecular polymers. The dynamic boroxine scaffold enables fast intermolecular exchange of boronic acid between different monomers and facilitates the introduction of functionality into assembled structures by co&#8208;condensation with functional boronic acids.







Abstract
Molecular scaffolds that enable the combinatorial synthesis of new supramolecular building blocks are promising targets for the construction of functional molecular systems. Here, we report a supramolecular scaffold based on boroxine that enables the formation of chiral and ordered 1D supramolecular polymers, which can be easily functionalized for circularly polarized luminescence. The boroxine monomers are quantitatively synthesized in situ, both in bulk and in solution, from boronic acid precursors and cooperatively polymerize into 1D helical aggregates stabilized by threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. We then demonstrate amplification of asymmetry in the co&#8208;assembly of chiral/achiral monomers and the co&#8208;condensation of chiral/achiral precursors in classical and in situ sergeant&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers experiments, respectively, showing fast boronic acid exchange reactions occurring in the system. Remarkably, co&#8208;condensation of pyrene boronic acid with a hydrogen&#8208;bonding chiral boronic acid results in chiral pyrene aggregation with circularly polarized excimer emission and g&#8208;values in the order of 10&#8722;3. Yet, the electron deficiency of boron in boroxine makes them chemically addressable by nucleophiles, but also sensitive to hydrolysis. With this sensitivity in mind, we provide first insights into the prospects offered by boroxine&#8208;based supramolecular polymers to make chemically addressable, functional, and adaptive systems.

         <title>Germaaluminocenes&#8212;Masked Heterofulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity pattern of germaaluminocenes is determined by the dichotomy of the electron&#8208;deficient aluminum atom and the electron&#8208;rich germanium center. The analysis of the product spectra obtained from the reaction with standard reagents reveals the role of these main group sandwich complexes as synthetic equivalents of otherwise not accessible aluminagermapentafulvenes.







Abstract
Germaaluminocenes are formed by salt metathesis reactions of dipotassium germacyclopentadienediides with pentamethylcyclopentadienylaluminum dichloride. The reactivity pattern of these sandwich complexes is determined by the electrophilic central aluminum atom and by the nucleophilic dicoordinated germanium center. Surprisingly, the products formed by reactions with Lewis acids, Lewis bases, amphiphiles and compounds with polar double bonds are those expected from the reaction of a hypothetical aluminagermapentafulvene with these types of reagents. This suggests that germaaluminocenes are synthetic equivalents to these pentafulvenes.

         <title>A 2D Acridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Selective Detection and Efficient Extraction of Gold from Complex Aqueous&#8208;Based Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) was prepared for the selective detection and efficient capture of gold. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the a&#8208;photoinduced electron transfer, selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0) are the possible sensing and adsorption mechanisms. Furthermore, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh capture efficiency (&gt;96&#8201;%) for gold in real water environments including river water, seawater and CPU leaching solutions.







Abstract
Developing candidate materials which possess the ability of both selective detection and efficient capture of precious metal gold is highly desirable for environment and economy. However, most of reported materials only focus on single function, which seriously restricts their practical application as probes or adsorbents. Herein, a two dimensional (2D) acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) is prepared via the linkage of imine bonds for gold detection and adsorption. The synthesized COF can achieve both fluorescence and colorimetric dual sensing for Au3+ in a low concentration range (0.1&#8211;1.5&#8197;ppm) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.036&#8197;ppm. Impressively, the selectivity of TpDa&#8208;COF for the detection of Au3+ is admirable (Fe3+, Fe2+ and Cu2+ for negligible influence on its fluorescence). In addition, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 982.5&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for gold at pH=4, which is attributed the synergistic effect of both selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0). Meanwhile, both positive entropy change (&#916;S=76.07&#8197;J&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K&#8722;1) and high distribution coefficient (Kd=12484.8&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) confirm the good affinity between TpDa&#8208;COF framework and gold. This work gives us a new insight to prepare COF with pyridine nitrogen sites for gold detection and adsorption.

         <title>Strategies for Achieving Ultra&#8208;Long ORR Durability&#8212;Rh Activates Interatomic Interactions in Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modulating the interatomic interactions between the constituent atoms of the catalyst, a novel approach has been introduced to prevent the dissolution of transition metals, resulting in ultra&#8208;long durability in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalysts demonstrate high activity and excellent durability with low platinum group metal (PGM) loading.







Abstract
The stability of platinum&#8208;based alloy catalysts is crucial for the future development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, considering the potential dissolution of transition metals under complex operating conditions. Here, we report on a Rh&#8208;doped Pt3Co alloy that exhibits strong interatomic interactions, thereby enhancing the durability of fuel cells. The Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C catalyst demonstrates exceptional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (1.31&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and maintaining 92&#8201;% of its mass activity after 170,000 potential cycles). Long&#8208;term testing has shown direct inhibition of Co dissolution in Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C. Furthermore, tests on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) have shown excellent performance and long&#8208;term durability with low Pt loading. After 50,000&#8197;cycles, there was no voltage loss at 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for Rh&#8722;Pt3Co/C, while Pt3Co/C experienced a loss of 200&#8197;mV. Theoretical calculations suggest that introducing transition metal atoms through doping creates a stronger compressive strain, which in turn leads to increased catalytic activity. Additionally, Rh doping increases the energy barrier for Co diffusion in the bulk phase, while also raising the vacancy formation energy of the surface Pt. This ensures the long&#8208;term stability of the alloy over the course of the cycle.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Linearizable Cyclization/Coupling with Detachable Silicon&#8208;Oxygen Linker: Access to 1,2&#8208;Oxasilolanes, 3&#8208;Hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;Arylalkanols</title>

         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/coupling has been developed in which the products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes.







Abstract
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/alkylmetal interception reaction in which products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. This method offers a convenient route to access 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles, 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;arylalkanols with the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds at primary and secondary alkyl carbon centers. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8722;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes. A silicon motif in the cyclic C(sp3)&#8722;Si&#8722;O construct in 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles can also be selectively deleted by Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrodesilylation affording Si&#8208;ablated linear alcohol products reminiscent of vicinal ethylene dicarbofunctionalization with C(sp3) and C(sp2) carbon sources.

         <title>A Computational Pipeline for Accurate Prioritization of Protein&#8208;Protein Binding Candidates in High&#8208;Throughput Protein Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a computational pipeline that identifies peptide epitopes that bind a particular receptor from a library of possible protein sequences (e.g., coming from high&#8208;throughput experiments). The pipeline uses an AlphaFold&#8208;Competitive Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to rank order different plausible epitopes and select the most likely one.







Abstract
Identifying the interactome for a protein of interest is challenging due to the large number of possible binders. High&#8208;throughput experimental approaches narrow down possible binding partners but often include false positives. Furthermore, they provide no information about what the binding region is (e.g., the binding epitope). We introduce a novel computational pipeline based on an AlphaFold2 (AF) Competitive Binding Assay (AF&#8208;CBA) to identify proteins that bind a target of interest from a pull&#8208;down experiment and the binding epitope. Our focus is on proteins that bind the Extraterminal (ET) domain of Bromo and Extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, but we also introduce nine additional systems to show transferability to other peptide&#8208;protein systems. We describe a series of limitations to the methodology based on intrinsic deficiencies of AF and AF&#8208;CBA to help users identify scenarios where the approach will be most useful. Given the method&#8216;s speed and accuracy, we anticipate its broad applicability to identify binding epitope regions among potential partners, setting the stage for experimental verification.

         <title>Regiodivergent Hydrosilylation of Polar Enynes to Synthesize Site&#8208;Specific Silyl&#8208;Substituted Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, regiodivergent hydrosilylation reactions of enynoates were developed using platinum and ruthenium catalysts. Through meticulous substrate and catalyst design, high yields and stereoselectivities were achieved in obtaining silyl&#8208;substituted dienoates at various positions. Detailed DFT calculations identified the key factors governing regiocontrol in all three instances, which were consistent with experimental findings.







Abstract
Herein, we present catalyst&#8208;regulated switchable site&#8208;selective hydrosilylation of enynes, which are suitable for a wide range of alkyl and aryl substituted polar enynes and exhibit excellent functional group compatibility. Under the optimized conditions, silyl groups can be precisely installed at various positions of 1,3&#8208;dienes. While &#945;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;silylation products were obtained under platinum&#8208;catalytic systems, &#946;&#8208;silylation products were delivered with [Cp*RuCl]4 as catalyst. This process lead to the formation of 1,3&#8208;dienoates with diverse substitutions, which would pose challenges with other methodologies.

         <dc:description>
The unprecedented ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage functionalization with easily accessible sulfonium salts enabled the C&#8722;H arylation of medicinally relevant N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles.







Abstract
The late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients is a key challenge in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles are important structural motifs with the potential to boost the activity of diverse drug molecules. Using easily accessible dibenzothiophenium salts for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation, these scaffolds were introduced into a variety of bioactive compounds. Our methodology uses cost&#8208;efficient ruthenium, KOAc as a mild base and gives access to a plethora of highly decorated triazole and tetrazole containing drug derivatives.

         <title>Breaking the Scaling Relationship in C&#8722;N Coupling via the Doping Effects for Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a strategy to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding via the doping engineering, which minimizes the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling, thereby achieving excellent performance in urea electrosynthesis.







Abstract
Electrochemical C&#8722;N coupling reaction based on carbon dioxide and nitrate have been emerged as a new &#8220;green synthetic strategy&#8221; for the synthesis of urea, but the catalytic efficiency is seriously restricted by the inherent scaling relations of adsorption energies of the active sites, the improvement of catalytic activity is frequently accompanied by the decrease in selectivity. Herein, a doping engineering strategy was proposed to break the scaling relationship of intermediate binding and minimize the kinetic barrier of C&#8722;N coupling. A thus designed SrCo0.39Ru0.61O3&#8722;&#948; catalyst achieves a urea yield rate of 1522&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 and faradic efficiency of 34.1&#8201;% at &#8722;0.7&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. A series of characterizations revealed that Co doping not only induces lattice distortion but also creates rich oxygen vacancies (OV) in the SrRuO3. The oxygen vacancies weaken the adsorption of *CO and *NH2 intermediates on the Co and Ru sites respectively, and the strain effects over the Co&#8722;Ru dual sites promoting the occurrence of C&#8722;N coupling of the two monomers instead of selective hydrogenating to form by&#8208;products. This work presents an insight into molecular coupling reactions towards urea synthesis via the doping engineering on SrRuO3.

         <title>Organic Donor&#8211;Acceptor Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photocatalysts in the Photoinduced Dehalogenation of Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds based on DMAC&#8208;TRZ and containing aryl subtituents on the DMAC donor have been applied as photocatalysts in the dehalogenation of aryl halides having Ered up to &#8722;2.72&#8197;V vs SCE. Mechanistic studies indicate that these DMAC&#8208;TRZ based compounds act as pre&#8208;photocatalysts and photodegrade under the reaction conditions, with the photodecomposition product responsible for the photocatalysis.







Abstract
We report a family of donor&#8208;acceptor thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) compounds based on derivatives of DMAC&#8208;TRZ, that are strongly photoreducing. Both Eox and thus E*ox could be tuned via substitution of the DMAC donor with a Hammett series of p&#8208;substituted phenyl moieties while Ered remained effectively constant. These compounds were assessed in the photoinduced dehalogenation of aryl halides, and analogues bearing electron withdrawing groups were found to produce the highest yields. Substrates of up to Ered=&#8722;2.72&#8197;V could be dehalogenated at low PC loading (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and under air, conditions much milder than previously reported for this reaction. Spectroscopic and chemical studies demonstrate that all PCs, including literature reference PCs, photodegrade, and that it is these photodegradation products that are responsible for the reactivity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered and Self&#8208;Recoverable Multimodal Force Sensors Based on Trap State and Interfacial Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal force sensor: A self&#8208;powered and self&#8208;recoverable force sensor based on trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer is presented. The magnitude of force can be converted into electrical responses, and force distribution can be visualized by optical signals simultaneously, without any power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. It has promising applications in a wide range of artificial intelligence systems.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing that combines intensity, location, area and the like could gather a wealth of information from mechanical stimuli. Developing materials with force&#8208;induced optical and electrical dual responses would provide unique opportunities to multi&#8208;dimensional force sensing, with electrical signals quantifying the force amplitude and the luminescence output providing spatial distribution of force. However, the reliance on external power supply and high&#8208;energy excitation source brings significant challenges to the applicability of multi&#8208;dimensional force sensors. Here we reported the mechanical energy&#8208;driven and sunlight&#8208;activated materials with force&#8208;induced dual responses, and investigated the underlying mechanisms of self&#8208;sustainable force sensing. Theoretical analysis and experimental data unraveled that trap&#8208;controlled luminescence and interfacial electron transfer play a major role in force&#8208;induced optical and electrical output. These materials were manufactured into pressure sensor with renewable dual&#8208;mode output for quantifying and visualization of pressures by electrical and optical output, respectively, without power supply and high&#8208;energy irradiation. The quantification of tactile sensation and stimuli localization of mice highlighted the multi&#8208;dimensional sensing ability of the sensor. Overall, this self&#8208;powered pressure sensor with multimodal output provides more modalities of force sensing, poised to change the way that intelligent devices sense with the world.

         <title>Stabilizing Zn/electrolyte Interphasial Chemistry by a Sustained&#8208;release Drug Inspired Indium&#8208;chelated Resin Protective Layer for High&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity Zn//V2O5 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For zinc&#8208;metal batteries, the instable chemistry at Zn/electrolyte interphasial region results in severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, significantly impairing Zn anode reversibility. Moreover, an often&#8208;overlooked aspect is this instability can be further exacerbated by the interaction with dissolved cathode species in full batteries. Here, inspired by sustained&#8208;release drug technology, an indium&#8208;chelated resin protective layer (Chelex&#8208;In), incorporating a sustained&#8208;release mechanism for indium, is developed on Zn surface, stabilizing the anode/electrolyte interphase to ensure reversible Zn plating/stripping performance throughout the entire lifespan of Zn//V2O5 batteries. The sustained&#8208;release indium onto Zn electrode promotes a persistent anticatalytic effect against HER and fosters uniform heterogeneous Zn nucleation. Meanwhile, on the electrolyte side, the residual resin matrix with immobilized iminodiacetates anions can also repel H2O and detrimental anions (SO42&#8208; and polyoxovanadate ions dissolved from V2O5 cathode) outside the electric double layer. This dual synergetic regulation on both electrode and electrolyte sides culminates a more stable interphasial environment, effectively enhancing Zn anode reversibility in practical high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity full battery systems. Consequently, the bio&#8208;inspired Chelex&#8208;In protective layer enables an ultralong lifespan of Zn anode over 2800 h, which is also successfully demonstrated in ultrahigh areal capacity Zn//V2O5 full batteries (4.89 mAh cm&#8208;2).</dc:description>

         <title>&#173;&#173;&#173;&#173;A Bioorthogonal Dual Fluorogenic Probe for the Live&#8208;Cell Monitoring of Nutrient Uptake by Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cells rely heavily on the uptake of exogenous nutrients for survival, growth, and differentiation. Yet quantifying the uptake of small molecule nutrients at the single cell level is difficult. Here we present a new approach to studying the nutrient uptake in live single cells using Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels Alder (IEDDA) chemistry. We have modified carboxyfluorescein&#8208;diacetate&#8208;succinimidyl esters (CFSE) &#8211; a quenched fluorophore that can covalently react with proteins and is only turned on in the cytosol of a cell following esterase activity &#8211; with a tetrazine. This tetrazine serves as a second quencher for the pendant fluorophore. Upon reaction with nutrients modified with an electron&#8208;rich or strained dienophile in an IEDDA reaction, this quenching group is destroyed, thereby enabling the probe to fluoresce. This has allowed us to monitor the uptake of a variety of dienophile&#8208;containing nutrients in live primary immune cell populations using flow cytometry and live&#8208;cell microscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy is an anti&#8208;cancer treatment that requires illumination of photosensitizers to induce local cell death. Current near&#8208;infrared organic photosensitizers are built from large and non&#8208;modular structures that cannot be tuned to improve safety and minimize off&#8208;target toxicity. This work describes a novel chemical platform to generate enzyme&#8208;activatable near&#8208;infrared photosensitizers. We optimized the Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanine scaffold to include caging groups and biocompatible moieties, and generated cathepsin&#8208;triggered photosensitizers for effective ablation of human glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that enzyme&#8208;activatable Se&#8208;bridged hemicyanines are effective photosensitizers for the safe ablation of microtumors in vivo, creating new avenues in the chemical design of targeted anti&#8208;cancer photodynamic therapy agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Helically Chiral &#960;&#8208;Expanded Azocines Through Regioselective Beckmann Rearrangement and Their Charged States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a synthetic approach to p&#8208;expanded [6]helicenes incorporating tropone and azocine units in combination with a 5&#8208;membered ring, which exhibit intriguing structural, electronic, and chiroptical properties. The regioselective Beckmann rearrangement allows the isolation of helical scaffolds containing 8&#8208;membered lactam, azocine, and amine units. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, the incorporation of tropone or azocine units leads to highly distorted [6]helicene moieties, with distinct packing motifs in the solid state. The compounds exhibit promising optoelectronic properties with considerable photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable emission wavelengths depending on the relative position of the nitrogen center within the polycyclic framework. Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#160;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.</dc:description>

Separation of the enantiomers by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) allowed characterization of their chiroptical properties by circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy. The azocine compounds feature manifold redox chemistry, allowing for the characterization of the corresponding radical anions and cations as well as the dications and dianions, with near-infrared (NIR) absorption bands extending beyond 3000&#160;nm. Detailed theoretical studies provided insights into the aromaticity evolution upon reduction and oxidation, suggesting that the steric strain prevents the azocine unit from undergoing aromatization, while the indene moiety dominates the observed redox chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the NIR&#8208;II AIEgen for High Brightness through Intramolecular Electrostatic Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent imaging and biosensing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for non&#8208;invasive, radiation&#8208;free, and rapid&#8208;response clinical diagnosis. However, it&#8217;s still challenging to develop bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. In this study, we report a new strategy to enhance the brightness of NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking. By introducing sulfur atoms into the side chains of the thiophene bridge in TSEH molecule, the molecular motion of the conjugated backbone can be locked through intramolecular interactions between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. This leads to enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescent emission of TSEH in both solution and aggregation states. Notably, the encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) of TSEH show enhanced brightness, which is 2.6&#8208;fold higher than TEH NPs with alkyl side chains. The in vivo experiments reveal the feasibility of TSEH NPs in vascular and tumor imaging with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and precise resection for tiny tumors. In addition, polystyrene nanospheres encapsulated with TSEH are utilized for antigen detection in lateral flow assays, showing a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio 1.9&#8208;fold higher than the TEH counterpart in detecting low&#8208;concentration antigens. This work highlights the potential for developing bright NIR&#8208;II fluorophores through intramolecular electrostatic locking and their potential applications in clinical diagnosis and biomedical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembly of &#960;&#8208;conjugated [B3O6] Units by Mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra to Design a UV Nonlinear Optical Material, Cs2YB3O6F2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving the extreme balance of the key performance requirements is the crucial to breakthrough the application bottleneck for nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. Herein, by assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated&#160;[B3O6] functional species with the aid of structure&#8208;directing property of mer&#8208;isomer [YO3F3] octahedra, a new ultraviolet (UV) NLO material, Cs2YB3O6F2 with aligned arrangement of coplanar [B3O6] groups has been synthesized. The polar material exhibits the rare coexistence of the largest second harmonic generation response of 5.6 &#215; KDP, the largest birefringence of 0.091 at 532 nm, the shortest Type I phase&#8208;matching down to 200.5 nm and deep&#8208;ultraviolet transparency among reported acentric rare&#8208;earth borates with [B3O6] groups. Remarkably, benefiting from the enhanced bonding force among functional units [B3O6], a firm three&#8208;dimensional framework is constructed, which facilitates the growth of large crystals. This can be proved by a block shape crystal with dimensional of 6 &#215; 5 &#215; 4 mm3, indicating that it was a promising UV NLO crystal. This work provides a powerful strategy to design UV NLO materials with good performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascaded *CO&#8208;*COH Intermediates on a Nonmetallic Plasmonic Photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 with 90.6% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen vacancies (OV) in nonmetallic plasmonic photocatalysts can decrease the energy barrier for CO2 reduction, boosting C1 intermediate production for potential C2 formation. However, their susceptibility to oxidation weakens C1 intermediate adsorption. Herein we proposed a "photoelectron injection" strategy to safeguard OV in W18O49 by creating a W18O49/ZIS (W/Z) plasmonic photocatalyst. Moreover, photoelectrons contribute to the local multi&#8208;electron environment of W18O49, enhancing the intrinsic excitation of its hot electrons with extended lifetimes, as confirmed by in&#8208;situ XPS and femtosecond transient absorption analysis. Density functional theory calculations revealed that W/Z with Ov enhances CO2 adsorption, activating *CO production, while reducing the energy barrier for *COH production (0.054 eV) and subsequent *CO&#8208;COH coupling (0.574 eV). Successive hydrogenation revealed that the free energy for *CH2CH2 hydrogenation (0.108 eV) was lower than that for *CH2CH2 desorption for C2H4 production (0.277 eV), favouring C2H6 production. Consequently, W/Z achieves an efficient C2H6 activity of 653.6 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 under visible light, with an exceptionally high selectivity of 90.6%. This work offers a new strategy for the rational design of plasmonic photocatalysts with high selectivity for C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;electron oxidative addition is one of the most important elementary reactions for d&#8208;block transition metals but it is uncommon for f&#8208;block elements. Here, we report the first examples of intermolecular oxidative addition of E&#8208;H (E = C, N) bonds to uranium(II) centers. The transient U(II) species was formed in&#8208;situ by reducing a heterometallic cluster featuring U(IV)&#8208;Pd(0) bonds with potassium&#8208;graphite (KC8). Oxidative addition of C&#8208;H or N&#8208;H bonds to the U(II) centers was observed when this transient U(II) species was treated with benzene, carbazole or 1&#8208;adamantylamine, respectively. The U(II) centers could also react with tetracene, biphenylene or N2O, leading to the formation of arene reduced U(IV) products and uranyl(VI) species via two&#8208; or four&#8208;electron processes. This study demonstrates that the intermolecular two&#8208;electron oxidative addition reactions are viable for actinide elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Formation of Charge Transfer Trions at Molecular&#8208;Functionalized 2D MoS2 Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we investigate trion dynamics occurring at the heterojunction between organometallic molecules and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with transient electronic sum frequency generation (tr&#8208;ESFG) spectroscopy. By pumping at 2.4 eV with laser pulses, we have observed an ultrafast hole transfer, succeeded by the emergence of charge&#8208;transfer trions. This observation is facilitated by the cancellation of ground state bleach and stimulated emission signals due to their opposite phases, making tr&#8208;ESFG especially sensitive to the trion formation dynamics. The presence of charge&#8208;transfer trion at molecular functionalized TMD monolayers suggests the potential for engineering the local electronic structures and dynamics of specific locations on TMDs and offers the potential for transferring unique electronic attributes of TMD to the molecular layers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Sialosides Terminated with 8&#8208;N&#8208;Substituted Sialic Acid as Selective Substrates for Sialidases from Bacteria and Influenza Viruses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sialosides containing C8&#8208;modified sialic acids are challenging synthetic targets but potentially useful probes for diagnostic substrate profiling of sialidases and elucidating the binding specificity of sialic acid&#8208;interacting proteins. Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing para&#8208;nitrophenol&#8208;tagged a2&#8211;3&#8208; and a2&#8211;6&#8208;linked sialyl galactosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido, C8&#8208;azido, or C8&#8208;amino derivatized N&#8208;acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). High&#8208;throughput substrate specificity studies showed that the C8&#8208;modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, various bacteria, and different influenza A and B viruses. Sialosides carrying Neu5Ac with a C8&#8208;azido modification were generally well tolerated by all the sialidases we tested, whereas sialosides containing C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were only cleaved by selective bacterial sialidases. In contrast, sialosides with C8&#8208;amino&#8208;modified Neu5Ac were cleaved by a combination of selective bacterial and influenza A virus sialidases. These results indicate that sialosides terminated with a C8&#8208;amino or C8&#8208;acetamido&#8208;modified sialic acid can be used with other sialosides for diagnostic profiling of disease&#8208;causing sialidase&#8208;producing pathogens.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate efficient chemoenzymatic methods for synthesizing para-nitrophenol-tagged a2&#8211;3- and a2&#8211;6-linked sialyl galactosides containing C8-acetamido, C8-azido, or C8-amino derivatized N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). High-throughput substrate specificity studies showed that the C8-modification of sialic acid significantly changes its recognition by sialidases from humans, various bacteria, and different influenza A and B viruses. Sialosides carrying Neu5Ac with a C8-azido modification were generally well tolerated by all the sialidases we tested, whereas sialosides containing C8-acetamido-modified Neu5Ac were only cleaved by selective bacterial sialidases. In contrast, sialosides with C8-amino-modified Neu5Ac were cleaved by a combination of selective bacterial and influenza A virus sialidases. These results indicate that sialosides terminated with a C8-amino or C8-acetamido-modified sialic acid can be used with other sialosides for diagnostic profiling of disease-causing sialidase-producing pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly Frameworks(SAFs): Shaping the Future of Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular assembly frameworks (SAFs) represent a new category of porous materials, utilizing non&#8208;covalent interactions, setting them apart from metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). This category includes but is not restricted to hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks. SAFs stand out for their outstanding porosity, crystallinity, and stability, alongside unique dissolution&#8208;recrystallization dynamics that enable significant structural and functional modifications. Crucially, their non&#8208;covalent assembly strategies allow for a balanced manipulation of porosity, symmetry, crystallinity, and dimensions, facilitating the creation of advanced crystalline porous materials unattainable through conventional covalent or coordination bond synthesis. Despite their considerable promise in overcoming several limitations inherent to MOFs and COFs, particularly in terms of solution&#8208;processability, SAFs have received relatively little attention in recent literature. This Minireview aims to shed light on standout SAFs, exploring their design principles, synthesis strategies, and characterization methods. It emphasizes their distinctive features and the broad spectrum of potential applications across various domains, aiming to catalyze further development and practical application within the scientific community.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel gold(I)&#8208;cluster&#8208;based twin&#8208;cage is constructed by post&#8208;clustering covalent modification of a hexa&#8208;aldehyde cluster precursor with triaminotriethylamines. The cages&#8208;on&#8208;cluster structure have double cavities and four binding sites, showing site discriminative binding for silver(I) and copper(I) guests. The guests in the tripodal hats affect the luminescence of the cluster: tetra&#8208;silver(I) host&#8208;guest complex is weak red emissive, while bis&#8208;copper(I)&#8208;bis&#8208;silver(I) one is non&#8208;emissive but a stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecule. The copper(I) ion inside the tri&#8208;imine cavity is oxidation sensitive, which enable the release of the bright emissive precursor cluster triggered by H2O2 solution. The hybridization of a cluster with cavities to construct a cluster&#8208;based cage presents an innovative concept for functional cluster design, and the post&#8208;clustering covalent modification opens up new avenues of finely tuning the properties of clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Lattice Mismatch at the Heterojunction of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lattice mismatch significantly influences microscopic transport in semiconducting devices, affecting interfacial charge behavior and device efficacy. This atomic&#8208;level disordering, often overlooked in previous research, is crucial for device efficiency and lifetime. Recent studies have highlighted emerging challenges related to lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells, especially at heterojunctions, revealing issues like severe tensile stress, increased ion migration, and reduced carrier mobility. This review systematically discusses the effects of lattice mismatch on strain, material stability, and carrier dynamics. It also includes detailed characterizations of these phenomena and summarizes the current strategies including epitaxial growth and buffer layer, as well as explores future solutions to mitigate mismatch&#8208;induced issues. We also provide the challenges and prospects for lattice mismatch, aiming to enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells, and contribute to renewable energy technology advancements.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Stable Water&#8208;Soluble Supratomic Silver Clusters Utilizing A Polyoxoniobate&#8208;Protected Strategy: Giant Core&#8208;Shell&#8208;Type Ag8@Nb162 Fluorescent Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise low&#8208;nuclearity (n&lt;10) silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) have garnered significant interest due to their size&#8208;dependent optical properties and diverse applications. However, their synthesis has remained challenging, primarily due to their inherent instability. The present study introduces a new feasible approach for clustering silver ions utilizing highly negative and redox&#8208;inert polyoxoniobates (PONbs) as all&#8208;inorganic ligands. This strategy not only enables the creation of novel Ag&#8208;PONb composite nanoclusters but also facilitates the synthesis of stable low&#8208;nuclearity AgNCs. Using this method, we have successfully synthesized a small octanuclear rhombic [Ag8]6+ AgNC stabilized by six highly negative [LiNb27O75]14&#8208; polyoxoanions. This marks the first PONb&#8208;protected superatomic AgNC, designated as {Ag8@(LiNb27O75)6} (Ag8@Nb162), with an aesthetically spherical core&#8208;shell structure.     The crystalline Ag8@Nb162 is stable under ambient conditions, What&#8217;s more, it is water&#8208;soluble and able to maintain its molecular cluster structure intact in water. Further, the stable small [Ag8]6+ AgNC has interesting temperature&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent reversible fluorescence response, based on which a multiple optical encryption mode for anti&#8208;counterfeit technology was demonstrated. This work offers a promising avenue for the synthesis of fascinating and stable PONb&#8208;protected AgNCs and sheds light on the development of new&#8208;type optical functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>ON&#8208;OFF Control of Marangoni Self&#8208;propulsion via A Supra&#8208;amphiphile Fuel and Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Marangoni self&#8208;propulsion refers to motions of liquid or solids driven by a surface tension gradient, and has applications in soft robots/devices, cargo delivery, self&#8208;assembly etc. However, two problems remain to be addressed for motion control (e.g., ON&#8208;OFF) with conventional surfactants as Marangoni fuel: (1) limited motion lifetime due to saturated interfacial adsorption of surfactants; (2) in&#8208; situ motion stop is difficult once Marangoni flows are triggered. Instead of covalent surfactants, supra&#8208;amphiphiles with hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts linked noncovalently, hold promise to solve these problems owing to its dynamic and reversible surface activity responsively. Here, we propose a new concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; based on the facile synthesis of disodium&#8208;4&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;amino&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedisulfonate (DABS) linked by a Schiff base, which has amphiphilicity for self&#8208;propulsion, hydrolyzes timely to avoid saturated adsorption and provides pH&#8208;responsive control over ON&#8208;OFF motion. The self&#8208;propulsion lifetime is extended by 50&#8208;fold with DABS and motion control is achieved. The mechanism is revealed with coupled interface chemistry involving two competitive processes of interfacial adsorption and hydrolysis of DABS based on both experiments and simulation. The concept of &#8216;supra&#8208;amphiphile fuel and switch&#8217; provides an active solution to prolong and control Marangoni self&#8208;propulsive devices for the advance of intelligent material systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyses Oxetane Ring Formation in Paclitaxel Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxetane synthase (TmCYP1), a novel cytochrome P450 enzyme from Taxus &#215; media cell cultures, has been functionally characterized to efficiently catalyse the formation of the oxetane ring in tetracyclic taxoids. Transient expression of TmCYP1 in Nicotiana benthamiana using 2&#945;,5&#945;,7&#946;,9&#945;,10&#946;,13&#945;&#8208;hexaacetoxytaxa&#8208;4(20),11(12)&#8208;diene (1) as a substrate led to the production of a major oxetane derivative, 1&#946;&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1a), and a minor 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide derivative, baccatin I (1b). However, feeding the substrate decinnamoyltaxinine J (2), a 5&#8208;deacetylated derivative of 1, yielded only 5&#945;&#8208;deacetylbaccatin I (2b), a 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide. A possible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of substrate&#8208;feeding, 2H and 18O isotope labelling experiments, and density functional theory calculations. This reaction could be an intramolecular oxidation&#8208;acetoxyl rearrangement and the construction of the oxetane ring may occur through a concerted process; however, the 4&#946;,20&#8208;epoxide might be a shunt product. In this process, the C5&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group in substrate is crucial for the oxetane ring formation but not for the 4(20)&#8208;epoxy ring formation by TmCYP1. These findings provide a better understanding of the enzymatic formation of the oxetane ring in paclitaxel biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic Cellulose&#8208;based Polymer Electrolyte Enabled by Aqueous Solution Casting for High&#8208;performance Solid&#8208;state Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries hold great promise as the next&#8208;generation batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, PEO&#8208;based electrolytes encounter certain limitations, including inferior ionic conductivity, low Li+ transference number, and poor mechanical strength. Herein, we aim to simultaneously address these issues by utilizing one&#8208;dimensional zwitterionic cellulose nanofiber (ZCNF) as fillers for PEO&#8208;based electrolytes using a simple aqueous solution casting method. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the unique zwitterionic structure imparts ZCNF with various functions, such as disrupting PEO crystallization, dissociating lithium salts, anchoring anions through cationic groups, accelerating Li+ migration by anionic groups, as well as its inherent reinforcement effect. As a result, the prepared PL&#8208;ZCNF electrolyte exhibits remarkable ionic conductivity (5.37 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1) and Li+ transference number (0.62) at 60 &#176;C without sacrificing mechanical strength (9.2 MPa), together with high critical current density of 1.1 mA cm&#8722;2. Attributed to these merits of PL&#8208;ZCNF, the LiFePO4|PL&#8208;ZCNF|Li solid&#8208;state full&#8208;cell delivers exceptional rate capability and cycling performance (900 cycles at 5 C). Notably, the assembled pouch&#8208;cell can maintain steady operation over 1000 cycles with an impressive 93.7% capacity retention at 0.5 C and 60 &#176;C, highlighting the great potential of PL&#8208;ZCNF for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electric Double Layer Regulator Design through a Functional Group Assembly Strategy towards Long&#8208;lasting Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the electric double layer (EDL) structure of the zinc metal anode by using electrolyte additives is an efficient way to suppress interface side reactions and facilitate uniform zinc deposition. Nevertheless, there are no reports investigating the proactive design of EDL&#8208;regulating additives before the start of experiments. Herein, a functional group assembly strategy is proposed to design electrolyte additives for modulating the EDL, thereby realizing a long&#8208;lasting zinc metal anode. Specifically, by screening ten common functional groups, N, N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonamide (IS) is designed by assembling an imidazole group, characterized by its high adsorption capability on the zinc anode, and a sulfone group, which exhibits strong binding with Zn2+ ions. Benefiting from the adsorption functionalization of the imidazole group, the IS molecules occupy the position of H2O in the inner Helmholtz layer of the EDL, forming a molecular protective layer to inhibit H2O&#8208;induced side reactions. Meanwhile, the sulfone group in IS, acting as a binding site to Zn2+, promotes the de&#8208;solvation of Zn2+ ions, facilitating compact zinc deposition. Consequently, the utilization of IS significantly extending the cycling stability of Zn||Zn and Zn||NaV3O8&#183;1.5H2O full cell. This study offers an innovative approach to the design of EDL regulators for high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Best Practices for Experiments and Reports in Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review intends to establish standardized practices for experimental procedures and reporting metrics in photocatalytic CH4 conversion. It is structured into sections that focus on reactor design, products measurement and definition of performance metrics. We provide comprehensive insights into the field of photocatalytic CH4 conversion, and envision that this overview will promote the transition of solar fuel technology from laboratory to manufacture.







Abstract
Efficiently converting methane into valuable chemicals via photocatalysis under mild condition represents a sustainable route to energy storage and value&#8208;added manufacture. Despite continued interest in this area, the achievements have been overshadowed by the absence of standardized protocols for conducting photocatalytic methane oxidation experiments as well as evaluating the corresponding performance. In this review, we present a structured solution aimed at addressing these challenges. Firstly, we introduce the norms underlying reactor design and outline various configurations in the gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;solid&#8211;liquid reaction systems. This discussion helps choosing the suitable reactors for methane conversion experiments. Subsequently, we offer a comprehensive step&#8208;by&#8208;step protocol applicable to diverse methane&#8208;conversion reactions. Emphasizing meticulous verification and accurate quantification of the products, this protocol highlights the significance of mitigating contamination sources and selecting appropriate detection methods. Lastly, we propose the standardized performance metrics crucial for evaluating photocatalytic methane conversion. By defining these metrics, the community could obtain the consensus of assessing the performance across different studies. Moving forward, the future of photocatalytic methane conversion necessitates further refinement of stringent experimental standards and evaluation criteria. Moreover, development of scalable reactor is essential to facilitate the transition from laboratory proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to potentially industrial production.

         <title>Responsive Organic Fluorescent Aggregates Based on Ion&#8208;&#960; Interactions Away from Fluorescent Conjugated Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Responsive organic luminescent aggregates have a wide range of application fields, but currently there is still a lack of reasonable molecular design strategies. Introducing ion&#8208;&#960; interactions into molecules can effectively alter their luminescent properties. However, current research typically focuses on ion localization at luminescent conjugated groups with the strong interaction forces. In this work, we introduce the flexible alkoxy chain spacers between fluorescent conjugated groups and ion&#8208;&#960; interaction sites, and then adjust the fluorescence performance of the molecule by changing the strength of ion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Bromine ion&#8208;based molecules with strong ion&#8208;&#960; interactions exhibit high and stable fluorescence quantum yields in crystals and amorphous powders under the external stimuli. Hexafluorophosphate ion&#8208;based molecules with weak ion&#8208;&#960; interactions have the high fluorescence quantum yield in crystals and very low fluorescence quantum yield in amorphous powders, showing variable fluorescence intensities under external stimuli. This demonstrates a new class of responsive organic luminescent solid&#8208;state materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Imidazole&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Hydroxide Enabling the Li+ Desolvation/Diffusion Reaction and Flame Retardant Catalytic Dynamics for Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of intercalated small organic molecules in the anode material was proposed to enhance the capacity and cycle stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The introduction of imidazole molecules provides more binding sites for lithium ions, which also can participate in the generation of SEI and maintain the stability of cobalt hydroxide structure. Moreover, the anode material has the function of smoke suppression and toxicity reduction when thermal runaway occurs, which can improve the thermal safety of lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have found extensive applications due to their high energy density and low self&#8208;discharge rates, spanning from compact consumer electronics to large&#8208;scale energy storage facilities. Despite their widespread use, challenges such as inherent capacity degradation and the potential for thermal runaway hinder sustainable development. In this study, we introduce a unique approach to synthesize anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, specifically imidazole&#8208;intercalated cobalt hydroxide. This innovative material significantly enhances the Li+ desolvation/diffusion reaction and flame&#8208;retardant dynamics through complexing and catalytic synergetic effects. The lithium&#8208;ion batteries incorporating these materials demonstrate exceptional performance, boasting an impressive capacity retention of 997.91&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles. This achievement can be attributed to the optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interface engineering, effectively mitigating anode degradation and minimizing electrolyte consumption. Experimental and theoretical calculations validate these improvements. Importantly, imidazole intercalated Co(OH)2 (MI&#8722;Co(OH)2) exhibits a remarkable catalytic effect on electrolyte carbonization and the conversion of CO to CO2. This dual action suppresses smoke and reduces toxicity significantly. The presented work introduces a novel approach to realizing high&#8208;performance and safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing key challenges in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Beyond 900&#8197;nm from Stable Radicals in Nonconjugated Poly(diphenylmethane)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;spectrum emission, spanning from blue to near&#8208;infrared (beyond 900&#8197;nm), is attainable in poly(diphenylmethane) through adjustments in both concentration and excitation wavelength, which is attributed to the formation of stable radicals within the polymer and through&#8208;space conjugation. This study not only confirms the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals but also introduces a pioneering method for producing nonconjugated near&#8208;infrared emitters.







Abstract
Organic radicals with narrow energy gaps are highly sought&#8208;after for the production of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores. However, the current repertoire of developed organic radicals is notably limited, facing challenges related to stability and low fluorescence efficiency. This study addresses these limitations by achieving stable radicals in nonconjugated poly(diphenylmethane) (PDPM). Notably, PDPM exhibits a well&#8208;balanced structural flexibility and rigidity, resulting in a robust intra&#8208;/inter&#8208;chain through&#8208;space conjugation (TSC). The stable radicals within PDPM, coupled with strong TSC, yield a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum emission spanning from blue to NIR beyond 900&#8197;nm. This extensive tunability is achieved through careful adjustments of concentration and excitation wavelength. The findings highlight the efficacy of polymerization in stabilizing radicals and introduce a novel approach for developing nonconjugated NIR emitters based on triphenylmethane subunits.

         <title>Commercializable Naphthalene Diimide Anolytes for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed the hydrothermal synthesis methodology for the preparation of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide materials on a hundred&#8208;gram scale, and showed great commercial potential offering cost&#8208;effective production. Under the synergistic effects of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, naphthalene diimide delivered excellent battery performance including high capacity/power, and long lifetime.







Abstract
Neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) hold the potential to facilitate the transition of renewable energy sources from auxiliary to primary energy, the commercial production of anolyte materials still suffers from insufficient performance of high&#8208;concentration and the high cost of the preparation problem. To overcome these challenges, this study provides a hydrothermal synthesis methodology and introduces the charged functional groups into hydrophobic naphthalene diimide cores, and prepares a series of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide anolytes. Under the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, the naphthalene diimide exhibits excellent structural stability and the highest water solubility (1.85&#8197;M for dex&#8208;NDI) reported to date. By employing the hydrothermal method, low&#8208;cost naphthalene diimides are successfully synthesized on a hundred&#8208;gram scale of $0.16&#8197;g&#8722;1 ($2.43&#8197;Ah&#8722;1), which is also the lowest price reported to date. The constructed full battery achieves a high electron concentration of 2.4&#8197;M, a high capacity of 54.4&#8197;Ah&#8201;L&#8722;1, and a power density of 318&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with no significant capacity decay observed during long&#8208;duration cycling. These findings provide crucial support for the commercialization of AORFBs and pave the way for revolutionary developments in neutral AORFBs.

         <title>Operando Spectroscopic Monitoring of Metal Chalcogenides for Overall Water Splitting: New Views of Active Species and Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined operando XAS and electrochemical characterizations unravel a divergent structural optimization of cobalt sulfide catalysts toward overall water splitting in different media. Our results highlight the crucial influence of in situ formed active species on the catalytic performance, and we show that these transient coordination environments are not evident from ex situ characterizations.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based chalcogenides exhibit great promise for overall water splitting, yet their intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanisms remain to be fully understood. In this work, we employed operando X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure&#8211;activity relationships of low&#8208;crystalline cobalt sulfide (L&#8722;CoS) catalysts toward overall water splitting. The operando results for L&#8722;CoS catalyzing the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in S&#8722;Co&#8722;Co&#8722;S moieties as the true catalytically active species. In comparison, during the acidic HER, L&#8722;CoS undergoes local structural optimization of Co centers, and H2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the Co&#8722;S&#8722;Co configurations. Further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high&#8208;valent Co4+ species in L&#8722;CoS for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the formation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline Co3O4 and Co&#8208;LDH references. These insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation in different media, and demonstrate how their restructuring influences the catalytic activity.

&lt;p&gt;Combined operando XAS and electrochemical characterizations unravel a divergent structural optimization of cobalt sulfide catalysts toward overall water splitting in different media. Our results highlight the crucial influence of in situ formed active species on the catalytic performance, and we show that these transient coordination environments are not evident from ex situ characterizations.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Induced by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in a One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Manganese(II) Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new one&#8208;dimensional (1D) hybrid chiral manganese chloride with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and high&#8208;thermal stability is presented. It is extremely promising for applications in red circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;LED) and X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides hold great potential as circularly polarized luminescence light sources. Herein, we have obtained two enantiomeric pairs of one&#8208;dimensional hybrid chiral manganese(II) chloride single crystals, R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl piperidine)MnCl3 (R/S&#8208;1) and R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine)MnCl3 (R/S&#8208;2), crystallizing in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P212121. In comparison to R/S&#8208;1, R/S&#8208;2 single crystals not only show red emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high resistance to thermal quenching but also exhibit circularly polarized luminescence with an asymmetry factor (glum) of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;3, which can be attributed to the enhanced crystal rigidity resulting from the hydrogen bonding networks between R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine) cations and [MnCl6]4&#8722; chains. The circularly polarized luminescence activities originate from the asymmetric [MnCl6]4&#8722; luminophores induced by N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl hydrogen bonding with R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine). Moreover, these samples demonstrate great application potential in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes and X&#8208;ray scintillators. This work shows a highly efficient photoluminescent Mn&#8208;based halide and offers a strategy for designing multifunctional chiral metal halides.

         <title>A Stapled Peptide Inhibitor Targeting the Binding Interface of N6&#8208;Adenosine&#8208;Methyltransferase Subunits METTL3 and METTL14 for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a stapled peptide inhibitor, RSM3, of the N6&#8208;adenosine&#8208;methyltransferase subunit METTL3, discovered from the METTL3&#8211;METTL14 structure. This inhibitor induces METTL3 degradation and suppresses m6A mRNA methylation, differently from the mechanism of small molecule STM2457. RSM3 exhibits remarkable anticancer efficacy in a PC3 prostate cancer cell line xenograft tumor model, highlighting the potential of drug design targeting METTL3.







Abstract
METTL3, a primary methyltransferase catalyzing the RNA N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modification, has been identified as an oncogene in several cancer types and thus nominated as a potentially effective target for therapeutic inhibition. However, current options using this strategy are limited. In this study, we targeted protein&#8211;protein interactions at the METTL3&#8211;METTL14 binding interface to inhibit complex formation and subsequent catalysis of the RNA m6A modification. Among candidate peptides, RM3 exhibited the highest anti&#8208;cancer potency, inhibiting METTL3 activity while also facilitating its proteasomal degradation. We then designed a stapled peptide inhibitor (RSM3) with enhanced peptide stability and formation of the &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure required for METTL3 interaction. Functional and transcriptomic analysis in vivo indicated that RSM3 induced upregulation of programmed cell death&#8208;related genes while inhibiting cancer&#8208;promoting signals. Furthermore, tumor growth was significantly suppressed while apoptosis was enhanced upon RSM3 treatment, accompanied by increased METTL3 degradation, and reduced global RNA methylation levels in two in vivo tumor models. This peptide inhibitor thus exploits a mechanism distinct from other small&#8208;molecule competitive inhibitors to inhibit oncogenic METTL3 activity. Our findings collectively highlight the potential of targeting METTL3 in cancer therapies through peptide&#8208;based inhibition of complex formation and proteolytic degradation.

         <title>Strategies to Diversification of the Mechanical Properties of Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the effects of halogenation on the mechanical and photomechanical behavior of organic crystals. Starting with (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, the brittle photoinert crystals evolve into mechanically flexible, photochemically reactive crystals via double and quadruple halogenation, an approach that advocates for combined chemical and crystal engineering strategies to determine the key factors determining the solid&#8208;state response dynamics.







Abstract
Structurally ordered soft materials that respond to complementary stimuli are susceptible to control over their spatial and temporal morphostructural configurations by intersectional or combined effects such as gating, feedback, shape&#8208;memory, or programming. In the absence of general and robust design and prediction strategies for their mechanical properties, at present, combined chemical and crystal engineering approaches could provide useful guidelines to identify effectors that determine both the magnitude and time of their response. Here, we capitalize on the purported ability of soft intermolecular interactions to instigate mechanical compliance by using halogenation to elicit both mechanical and photochemical activity of organic crystals. Starting from (E)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diphenylbut&#8208;2&#8208;ene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione, whose crystals are brittle and photoinert, we use double and quadruple halogenation to introduce halogen&#8208;bonded planes that become interfaces for molecular gliding, rendering the material mechanically and photochemically plastic. Fluorination diversifies the mechanical effects further, and crystals of the tetrafluoro derivative are not only elastic but also motile, displaying the rare photosalient effect.

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Electron Migration Inside Polymer Electrolyte on Li+ Transport and Interphase Reconfiguration for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8722;&#948; (LSC) enriched with high valence&#8208;state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn3N2&#8208;functionalized polyimide nanofiber framework to establish Li+ transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits.







Abstract
The development of highly producible and interfacial compatible in situ polymerized electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) have been plagued by insufficient transport kinetics and uncontrollable dendrite propagation. Herein, we seek to explore a rationally designed nanofiber architecture to balance all the criteria of SSLMBs, in which La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8722;&#948; (LSC) enriched with high valence&#8208;state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn3N2&#8208;functionalized polyimide (Zn&#8208;PI) nanofiber framework for the first time, to establish Li+ transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate (PVC) electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits. Revealed by characterization and theoretical calculation under electric field, the positive&#8208;negative electrical dipole layer in LSC derived from electron migration between Co and O atoms aids in accelerating Li+ diffusion kinetics through densified electric field around filler particle, featuring a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.50&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and a high Li+ transference number of 0.91 without the risk of electron leakage. Integrating with the preferential sacrifice of ZnO/Zn3N2 on PI nanofiber upon immediate detection of dendritic Li, which takes part in reconfiguring hierarchical SEI chemistry dominated by LixNy/Li&#8722;Zn alloy inner layer and LiF outer layer, SSLMBs are further endowed with prolonged cycling lifespan and exceptional rate capability.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, La&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (LSC) enriched with high valence-state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-functionalized polyimide nanofiber framework to establish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of highly producible and interfacial compatible in situ polymerized electrolytes for solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) have been plagued by insufficient transport kinetics and uncontrollable dendrite propagation. Herein, we seek to explore a rationally designed nanofiber architecture to balance all the criteria of SSLMBs, in which La&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (LSC) enriched with high valence-state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-functionalized polyimide (Zn-PI) nanofiber framework for the first time, to establish Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate (PVC) electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits. Revealed by characterization and theoretical calculation under electric field, the positive-negative electrical dipole layer in LSC derived from electron migration between Co and O atoms aids in accelerating Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics through densified electric field around filler particle, featuring a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.50&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25&#8201;&#176;C and a high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.91 without the risk of electron leakage. Integrating with the preferential sacrifice of ZnO/Zn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on PI nanofiber upon immediate detection of dendritic Li, which takes part in reconfiguring hierarchical SEI chemistry dominated by Li&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;/Li&#8722;Zn alloy inner layer and LiF outer layer, SSLMBs are further endowed with prolonged cycling lifespan and exceptional rate capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite Nanosheets with Tunable Silanol Nest Contents across an Ultra&#8208;wide pH Range and Their Catalytic Validation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for synthesizing ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets via aggregation crystallization of zeolite subcrystals within a broad pH range, detailing its crystallization process. pH manipulation enables precise control of silanol nest content, opening new avenues in zeolite engineering. Catalytic results in furfuryl alcohol etherification highlight the positive impact of regulating silanol nest content on catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Zeolite synthesis under acidic conditions has always presented a challenge. In this study, we successfully prepared series of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite nanosheets (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X) over a broad pH range (4 to 13) without the need for additional supplements. This achievement was realized through aggregation crystallization of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite subcrystal (Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC) with highly short&#8208;range ordering and ultrasmall size extracted from the synthetic system of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Furthermore, the crystallization behavior of Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC was investigated, revealing its non&#8208;classical crystallization process under mildly alkaline and acidic conditions (pH&lt;10), and the combination of classical and non&#8208;classical processes under strongly alkaline conditions (pH&#8805;10). What's particularly intriguing is that, the silanol nest content in the resultant Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X samples appears to be dependent on the pH values during the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SC crystallization process rather than its crystallinity. Finally, the results of the furfuryl alcohol etherification reaction demonstrate that reducing the concentration of silanol nests significantly enhances the catalytic performance of the Z&#8208;5&#8208;SCA&#8208;X zeolite. The ability to synthesize zeolite in neutral and acidic environments without the additional mineralizing agents not only broadens the current view of traditional zeolite synthesis but also provides a new approach to control the silanol nest content of zeolite catalysts.

Cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of gyroid&#8208;, diamond&#8208;, and primitive&#8208;type carbon schwarzites are reported by Qing&#8208;Hui Guo et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202402255). The cover picture describes the facile and efficient synthesis of three nanorings employing a naturally bent dibenzo[a,e]&#8208;cyclooctatetraene scaffold. These nanorings are believed to represent the first step toward the precise syntheses of carbon schwarzites.

CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems are activated by the formation of a ribonucleoprotein and its binding to the target nucleic acid sequence. Both binding processes are important for the overall performance. In their Communication (e202404069) Hongquan Zhang, X.&#8197;Chris Le et&#8197;al. describe a new method to study the binding kinetics and report the rate constants (kon and koff) and dissociation constant (Kd) for the activation of Cas13a by its RNA target. The method can unravel and quantify the kinetics of activation and enzymatic cleavage in a dynamic system. Artwork created by Jeffrey Tao.

Bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) strategy opens a new window to develop essential enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical products. In their&#160;Communication&#160;(e202402886), Weiwei Tang et&#8197;al. report a novel crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization method using BCA that demonstrates the dual functions of cocrystallization and catalytic racemization. This BCA strategy could address the incompatibility between cocrystallization and racemization reaction conditions.

Using a two&#8208;boron&#8208;doping/two&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fusion strategy anchored on the perylene scaffold, comprehensive structure generation followed by DFT calculations produces promising candidates. The validity of this approach is underscored by the experimental synthesis of dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene, showcasing intense NIR&#8208;emission.

         <dc:description>Interfacial engineering of perovskite films has been the main strategies in improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, three new donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;type interfacial dipole (DAID) molecules with hole&#8208;transporting and different anchoring units are designed and employed in PSCs. The formation of interface dipoles by the DAID molecules on the perovskite film can efficiently modulate the energy level alignment, improve charge extraction, and reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination. Among the three DAID molecules, TPA&#8208;BAM with amide group exhibits the best chemical and optoelectrical properties, achieving a champion PCE of 25.29% with the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.174 V and fill factor of 84.34%, due to the reduced defect density and improved interfacial hole extraction. Meanwhile, the operational stability of the unencapsulated device has been significantly improved. Our study provides a prospect for rationalized screening of interfacial dipole materials for efficient and stable PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Using Covalent Organic Frameworks to Stabilize Metal Anodes for Highly&#8208;Efficient Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali metals (Li, Na, and K) and multivalent metals (Zn, Mg, Ca, and Al) have become star anodes for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and excellent conductivity. However, the inevitable dendrites and unstable interfaces of metal anodes pose challenges to the safety and stability of batteries. To address these issues, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as emerging materials, have been widely investigated due to their regular porous structure, flexible molecular design, and high specific surface area. In this minireview, we summarize the research progress of COFs in stabilizing metal anodes. First, we present the research origins of metal anodes and delve into their advantages and challenges as anodes based on the physical/chemical properties of alkali and multivalent metals. Then, special attention has been paid to the application of COFs in the host design of metal anodes, artificial solid electrolyte interfaces, electrolyte additives, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and separator modifications. Finally, a new perspective is provided for the research of metal anodes from the molecular design, pore modulation, and synthesis of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Ortho/Ipso C&#8208;H Difunctionalizations of Arenes using Thianthrene as a Leaving Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective ortho/ipso C&#8208;H difunctionalizations of aromatic compounds were designed to afford polyfunctionalized arenes including challenging 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted ones (62 examples, up to 97% yields). To ensure the excellent regioselectivity of the process while keeping high efficiency, an original strategy based on a &#8220;C&#8208;H thianthenation/Catellani&#8208;type reaction&#8221; sequence was developed starting from simple arenes. Non&#8208;prefunctionalized arenes were first regioselectively converted into the corresponding thianthrenium salts. Then, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed, norbornene (NBE)&#8208;mediated process allowed the synthesis of ipso&#8208;olefinated/ortho&#8208;alkylated polyfunctionalized arenes using a thianthrene as a leaving group (revisited Catellani reaction). Pleasingly, using a commercially available norbornene (NBE) and a unique catalytic system, synthetic challenges known for the Catellani reaction with aryl iodides were smoothly and successfully tackled with the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; approach. The protocol was robust (gram&#8208;scale reaction) and was widely applied to the two&#8208;fold functionalization of various arenes including bio&#8208;active compounds. Moreover, a panel of olefins and alkyl halides as coupling partners was suitable. Pleasingly, the &#8220;thianthrenium&#8221; strategy was successfully further applied to the incorporation of other groups at the ipso (CN/alkyl/H, aryl) and ortho (alkyl, aryl, amine, thiol) positions, showcasing the generality of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89%, 99:1 er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5)&#8208; and C(6)&#8208;position, as well as benzannulation (&gt;35 examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1 g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8208;C=O&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and highly enantioselective method for the preparation of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide esters via isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is reported. Using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5 mol%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&gt;40 examples, up to 99%, 99:1 er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3)&#8208;, is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computation, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;acyl&#8208;isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineered Phenylalanine Ammonia&#8208;Lyases for the Enantioselective Synthesis of Aspartic Acid Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic hydroamination of alkenes is an efficient and selective method to synthesize natural and unnatural amino acids. Phenylalanine ammonia&#8208;lyases (PALs) have been previously engineered to access a range of substituted phenylalanines and heteroarylalanines, but their substrate scope remains limited, typically including only arylacrylic acids. Moreover, the enantioselectivity in the hydroamination of electron&#8208;deficient substrates is often poor. Here, we report the structure&#8208;based engineering of PAL from Planctomycesbrasiliensis (PbPAL), enabling preparative&#8208;scale enantioselective hydroaminations of previously inaccessible yet synthetically useful substrates, such as amide&#8208; and ester&#8208;containing fumaric acid derivatives. Through the elucidation of cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) PbPAL structure and screening of the structure&#8208;based mutagenesis library, we identified the key active site residue L205 as pivotal for dramatically enhancing the enantioselectivity of hydroamination reactions involving electron&#8208;deficient substrates. Our engineered PALs demonstrated exclusive a&#8208;regioselectivity, high enantioselectivity, and broad substrate scope. The potential utility of the developed biocatalysts was further demonstrated by a preparative&#8208;scale hydroamination yielding tert&#8208;butyl protected l&#8208;aspartic acid, widely used as intermediate in peptide solid&#8208;phase synthesis.</dc:description>

The potential utility of the developed biocatalysts was further demonstrated by a preparative-scale hydroamination yielding tert-butyl protected l-aspartic acid, widely used as intermediate in peptide solid-phase synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size and Polarizability of Boron Cluster Carriers Modulate Chaotropic Membrane Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perhalogenated&#160;closo&#8208;borates represent a new class of membrane carriers. They owe this activity to their chaotropicity, which enables the transport of hydrophilic molecules across model membranes and into living cells. The transport efficiency of this new class of cluster carriers depends on a careful balance between their affinity to membranes and cargo, which varies with chaotropicity. However, the structure&#8208;activity parameters that define chaotropic transport remain to be elucidated. Here, we have studied the modulation of chaotropic transport by decoupling the halogen composition from the boron core size. The binding affinity between perhalogenated decaborate and dodecaborate clusters carriers was quantified with different hydrophilic model cargos, namely a neutral and a cationic peptide, phalloidin and (KLAKLAK)2. The transport efficiency, membrane&#8208;lytic properties, and cellular toxicity, as obtained from different vesicle and cell assays, increased with the size and polarizability of the clusters. These results validate the chaotropic effect as the driving force behind the membrane transport propensity of boron clusters. This work advances our understanding of the structural features of boron cluster carriers and establishes the first set of rational design principles for chaotropic membrane transporters.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis&#8208;Ortho&#8208;Donor&#8208;Modification of Boracyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems beyond Steric Protection to Produce Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds that contain tricoordinate boron atoms at their periphery represent an attractive class of materials with electron&#8208;accepting character. Their molecular design generally requires the introduction of a bulky aryl group onto the boron atom, where it provides predominantly kinetic stabilization. The addition of extra functionality to the aryl group on the boron atom can be expected to further expand the potential utility of this class of materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of boracyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules with firm ortho B&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N nonbonding interactions by introducing N&#8208;containing electron&#8208;donors at the ortho&#8208;positions of the aryl group on the boron atom. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the combination of a planar boracyclic &#960;&#8208;skeleton with only sp2 carbons and a strong electron&#8208;donating phenothiazine moiety results in a particularly short B&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N distance. Theoretical study provided insights into the inherent nature of the B&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N interaction. Owing to their donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, these molecules exhibit substantially red&#8208;shifted fluorescence in solution, albeit that the fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are low. In contrast, when incorporated into films, these compounds exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with improved &#934;F values. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated using the ortho&#8208;donor&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit orange&#8208;red electroluminescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence from C64 Nanographene Tetraimide by &#960;&#8208;Stacking Complexation with Platinum Porphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at room temperature is challenging to achieve for organic molecules due to negligible spin&#8211;orbit coupling and a low energy gap leading to fast non&#8208;radiative transitions. Here, we show a supramolecular host&#8211;guest strategy to harvest the energy from the low&#8208;lying triplet state of C64 nanographene tetraimide 1. 1H NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis confirmed the 1:2 stoichiometric binding of a Pt(II) porphyrin on the two &#960;&#8208;surfaces of 1. While the free 1 does not show emission in the NIR, the host&#8211;guest complex solution shows NIR phosphorescence at 77 K. Further, between 860&#8211;1100 nm, room temperature NIR phosphorescence (&#955;max = 900 nm, &#964;avg = 142 &#181;s) was observed for a solid&#8208;state sample drop&#8208;casted from a preformed complex in solution. Theoretical calculations reveal a non&#8208;zero spin&#8211;orbit coupling between isoenergetic S1 and T3 of &#960;&#8208;stacked [1&#183;Pt(II) porphyrin] complex. External heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit coupling along with rigidification and protection from oxygen in the solid&#8208;state promotes both the intersystem crossing from the first excited singlet state into the triplet manifold and the NIR phosphorescence from the lowest triplet state of 1.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Life Cycle of Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries in Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries are gaining significant attention due to their low&#8208;cost, high safety and high theoretical capacity. Nevertheless, their long cycle and durability have been hampered due to the use of aqueous media that overtime lead to Zn dendrite formation, hydrogen evolution reaction, and polyiodide dissolution. Xiao et. al., recently reported the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL), to an aqueous electrolyte, that plays a key role in modifying the solvation of Zn2+ ions in the bulk electrolyte and the inner Helmotlz plane, which eliminates free H2O molecules to be present on the Zn anode surface. UV/Vis and NMR spectroscopy also indicates a strong interaction between imidazolium cation [EMIM]+ and I3&#8208;, thereby reducing polyiodide shuttling and enhancing the cycle life of the battery. Overall, a capacity decay rate of only 0.01 % per cycle after over 18,000 cycles at 4 Ag&#8208;1, is observed making the use of IL additives in aqueous electrolytes highly promising candidates for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to finely tune/balance the structure and rigidity of enzymes to realize both high enzymatic activity and long&#8208;term stability is highly desired but highly challenging. In this work, we propose a new concept of silica&#8208;enzyme, referred to as &#8220;silicazyme&#8221;, where solid inorganic silica was controlled hybridization with fragile enzyme under moderate condition at single&#8208;enzyme level, realizing simultaneous structure augmentation, long&#8208;term stability, and high enzymatic activity preservation. A multivariate silicification approach was utilized and occurred around individual enzymes to allow conformal coating. To realize a high activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off the structure flexibility/rigidity of silicazyme was optimized by a component&#8208;adjustment&#8208;ternary (CAT) plot method. Moreover, the multivariate organosilica frameworks bring great advantages including surface microenvironment adjustability, reversible modification capability, and functional extensibility through the rich chemistry of silica. Overall silicazymes represent a new class of enzymes that promise to broaden their utilization in catalysis, separations, and nanomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Mechanistic Role of Chiral Palladacycles in Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization reactions has attracted considerable attention due to its ability for the synthesis of enantiomerically enriched molecules and stimulation of novel retrosynthetic disconnections. Understanding the reaction mechanism, especially the stereochemical process of the reaction, is crucial for the rational design of more efficient catalytic systems. Previously, we developed a Pd(II)/sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) catalytic system for asymmetric C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization reactions. In this study, we focused on unraveling the chemistry of chiral palladacycles involved in the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization. We have isolated key palladacycle intermediates involved in the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H arylation of carboxylic acids catalyzed by the Pd(II)/SOHP system. These palladacycles, exhibiting ligand&#8208;induced chirality, provided a significant opportunity to investigate the stereochemical process and the ligand effect in this asymmetric C&#8208;H functionalization. Our investigation provided direct evidence for the C&#8208;H palladation step as the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step, which forms diastereomeric palladacycles that exhibited preservation of chirality in the functionalization step. DFT calculations provided insights into the chiral induction in palladacycle formation. This work highlights the value of chiral palladacycle chemistry in offering mechanistic insights into the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalization reactions.</dc:description>

We have isolated key palladacycle intermediates involved in the enantioselective &#946;-C(sp3)-H arylation of carboxylic acids catalyzed by the Pd(II)/SOHP system. These palladacycles, exhibiting ligand-induced chirality, provided a significant opportunity to investigate the stereochemical process and the ligand effect in this asymmetric C-H functionalization. Our investigation provided direct evidence for the C-H palladation step as the enantioselectivity-determining step, which forms diastereomeric palladacycles that exhibited preservation of chirality in the functionalization step. DFT calculations provided insights into the chiral induction in palladacycle formation. This work highlights the value of chiral palladacycle chemistry in offering mechanistic insights into the Pd(II)-catalyzed asymmetric C(sp3)-H functionalization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unnatural Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer Enabled by Living Cell&#8208;Cell Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is essential for maintaining the function and stability of anaerobic microbial consortia. However, only limited natural DIET modes have been identified and DIET engineering remains highly challenging. Here, an unnatural DIET between Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 (SO, electron donating partner) and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RP, electron accepting partner) was artificially established by a facile living cell&#8208;cell click chemistry strategy. By introducing alkyne&#8208; or azide&#8208;modified monosaccharides onto the cell outer surface of the target species, precise covalent connections between different species in high proximity were realized via a fast click chemistry reaction. Remarkably, upon covalent connection, outer cell surface C&#8208;type cytochromes mediated DIET between SO and RP was achieved and identified, although this was never realized naturally. Moreover, this connection directly shifted the natural H2 mediated interspecies electron transfer (MIET) to DIET between SO and RP, which delivered superior interspecies electron exchange efficiency. Therefore, this work demonstrated a naturally unachievable DIET and an unprecedented MIET shift to DIET accomplished by cell&#8208;cell distance engineering, offering an efficient and versatile solution for DIET engineering, which would extend our understanding of DIET and open up new avenue for DIET exploration and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Strain Induces and Increases Vesicular Release Monitored by Microfabricated Stretchable Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exocytosis involving the fusion of intracellular vesicles with cell membrane, is thought to be modulated by the mechanical cues in the microenvironment. Single&#8208;cell electrochemistry can offer unique information about the quantification and kinetics of exocytotic events, however, the effects of mechanical force on vesicular release has been poorly explored. Herein, we developed a stretchable microelectrode with excellent electrochemical stability under mechanical deformation by microfabrication of functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) conductive ink, which achieved real&#8208;time quantitation of strain&#8208;induced vesicular exocytosis from a single cell for the first time. We found that mechanical strain could cause calcium influx via the activation of Piezo1 channel in chromaffin cell, initiating the vesicular exocytosis process. Interestingly, mechanical strain increases the amount of catecholamines release by accelerating the opening and prolonging the closing of fusion pore during exocytosis. This work is expected to provide a revealing insight on the regulatory effects of mechanical stimuli on vesicular exocytosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Acoustic Levitation Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;Density Spherical Nucleic Acid Architectures for Specific SERS Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an acoustic levitation reactor for universal, green, and container&#8208;free synthesis of SNAs with ultra&#8208;high DNA density. In addition to the dehydration effect, we reveal for the first time that ultra&#8208;high density DNA grafting derived from acoustic waves reconfigures the ligands on the colloidal surface. Such architectures enable the in situ untargeted SERS tracking of cell events and targeted biomarker diagnosis, facilitated by the DNA shell's ability to construct a 3D SERS hotspot matrix with tunable and controllable nanogaps.







Abstract
Controllably regulating the electrostatic bilayer of nanogold colloids is a significant premise for synthesizing spherical nucleic acid (SNA) and building ordered plasmonic architectures. We develop a facile acoustic levitation reactor to universally synthesize SNAs with an ultra&#8208;high density of DNA strands, which is even higher than those of various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Results reveal a new mechanism of DNA grafting via acoustic wave that can reconfigure the ligands on colloidal surfaces. The acoustic levitation reactor enables substrate&#8208;free three&#8208;dimentional (3D) spatial assembly of SNAs with controllable interparticle nanogaps through regulating DNA lengths. This kind of architecture may overcome the plasmonic enhancement limits by blocking electron tunneling and breaking electrostatic shielding in dried aggregations. Finite element simulations support the architecture with 3D spatial plasmonic hotspot matrix, and its ultrahigh surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) capability is evidenced by in situ untargeted tracking of biomolecular events during photothermal stimulation (PTS)&#8208;induced cell death process. For biomarker diagnosis, the conjugation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer onto SNAs enables in situ targeted tracking of ATP during PTS&#8208;induced cell death process. Particularly, the CD71 receptor and integrin &#945;3&#946;1 protein on PL45&#8197;cell membrance could be well distinguished by label&#8208;free SERS fingerprints when using specific XQ&#8208;2d and DML&#8208;7 aptamers, respectively, to synthesize SNA architectures. Our current acoustic levitation reactor offers a new method for synthesizing SNAs and enables both targeted and untargeted SERS analysis for tracking molecular events in living systems. It promises great potentials in biochemical synthesis and sensing in future.

         <title>Carrier Protein Interaction with Competing Adenylation and Epimerization Domains in a Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase Analyzed by FRET</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nonribosomal peptide synthetases, the peptidyl&#8208;carrier&#8208;protein (PCP) of each module tethers the amino acid to be incorporated into the peptide product. Its interaction with multiple catalytic domains is barely studied. We reveal a surprising competition of the adenylation (A) and epimerization (E) domains for the PCP in an A&#8208;PCP&#8208;E module. New principles of conformational equilibria emerge that can contrast the anticipated catalytic logic.







Abstract
In multi&#8208;domain nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) the order of domains and their catalytic specificities dictate the structure of the peptide product. Peptidyl&#8208;carrier proteins (PCPs) bind activated amino acids and channel elongating peptidyl intermediates along the protein template. To this end, fine&#8208;tuned interactions with the catalytic domains and large&#8208;scale PCP translocations are necessary. Despite crystal structure snapshots of several PCP&#8208;domain interactions, the conformational dynamics under catalytic conditions in solution remain poorly understood. We report a FRET reporter of gramicidin S synthetase 1 (GrsA; with A&#8208;PCP&#8208;E domains) to study for the first time the interaction between PCP and adenylation (A) domain in the presence of an epimerization (E) domain, a competing downstream partner for the PCP. Bulk FRET measurements showed that upon PCP aminoacylation a conformational shift towards PCP binding to the A domain occurs, indicating the E domain acts on its PCP substrate out of a disfavored conformational equilibrium. Furthermore, the A domain was found to preferably bind the D&#8208;Phe&#8208;S&#8208;Ppant&#8208;PCP stereoisomer, suggesting it helps in establishing the stereoisomeric mixture in favor of the D&#8208;aminoacyl moiety. These observations surprisingly show that the conformational logic can deviate from the order of domains and thus reveal new principles in the multi&#8208;domain interplay of NRPSs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polymerized Spiro&#8208;Type Interfacial Molecule toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;polymerized spiro&#8208;type interfacial molecule, v&#8208;spiro is designed and exhibit superior intermolecular interactions and intrinsic hole mobility compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. The resulting polymeric protective layer successfully mitigated moisture degradation and ion migration in perovskite film. Poly&#8208;v&#8208;spiro&#8208;treated PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 24.54&#8201;% with voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, accompanied by improved stability.







Abstract
In the pursuit of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, spiro&#8208;OMeTAD has demonstrated recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), however, the stability issue remains one of the bottlenecks constraining its commercial development. In this study, we successfully synthesize a novel self&#8208;polymerized spiro&#8208;type interfacial molecule, termed v&#8208;spiro. The linearly arranged molecule exhibits stronger intermolecular interactions and higher intrinsic hole mobility compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Importantly, the vinyl groups in v&#8208;spiro enable in situ polymerization, forming a polymeric protective layer on the perovskite film surface, which proves highly effective in suppressing moisture degradation and ion migration. Utilizing these advantages, poly&#8208;v&#8208;spiro&#8208;based device achieves an outstanding efficiency of 24.54&#8201;%, with an enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and a fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, owing to the reduced defect density, energy level alignment and efficient interfacial hole extraction. Furthermore, the operational stability of unencapsulated devices is significantly enhanced, maintaining initial efficiencies above 90&#8201;% even after 2000&#8197;hours under approximately 60&#8201;% humidity or 1250&#8197;hours under continuous AM&#8197;1.5G sunlight exposure. This work presents a comprehensive approach to achieving both high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in PSCs through innovative interfacial design.

Poly-v-spiro-treated PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 24.54&#8201;% with voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, accompanied by improved stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, spiro-OMeTAD has demonstrated recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), however, the stability issue remains one of the bottlenecks constraining its commercial development. In this study, we successfully synthesize a novel self-polymerized spiro-type interfacial molecule, termed v-spiro. The linearly arranged molecule exhibits stronger intermolecular interactions and higher intrinsic hole mobility compared to spiro-OMeTAD. Importantly, the vinyl groups in v-spiro enable in situ polymerization, forming a polymeric protective layer on the perovskite film surface, which proves highly effective in suppressing moisture degradation and ion migration. Utilizing these advantages, poly-v-spiro-based device achieves an outstanding efficiency of 24.54&#8201;%, with an enhanced open-circuit voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and a fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, owing to the reduced defect density, energy level alignment and efficient interfacial hole extraction. Furthermore, the operational stability of unencapsulated devices is significantly enhanced, maintaining initial efficiencies above 90&#8201;% even after 2000&#8197;hours under approximately 60&#8201;% humidity or 1250&#8197;hours under continuous AM&#8197;1.5G sunlight exposure. This work presents a comprehensive approach to achieving both high efficiency and long-term stability in PSCs through innovative interfacial design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Birch Reduction with Low Reactive Alkaline Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical activation boosts reducing power of magnesium and calcium, allowing to utilize these metals as expedient reductants in ammonia&#8208;free Birch reaction in a ball mill at ambient conditions.







Abstract
Birch reduction and similar dissolved metal&#8208;type transformations hold significant importance in the organic synthesis toolbox. Historically, the field has been dominated by alkali metal reductants. In this study, we report that largely neglected, low&#8208;reactive alkaline earth metals can become powerful and affordable reductants when used in a ball mill under essentially solvent&#8208;free conditions, in the presence of ethylenediamine and THF as liquid additives. Calcium can reduce both electron&#8208;deficient and electron&#8208;rich arenes, with yields of products similar to those obtained with lithium metal. Magnesium reveals enhanced reducing power, enabling the reduction of benzoic acids while keeping electron&#8208;rich aromatic moieties intact and allows for chemoselective transformations. The developed mechanochemical approach uses readily available and safer&#8208;to&#8208;handle metals, operates under air and ambient temperature conditions, and can be used for gram&#8208;scale preparations. Finally, we demonstrate that the developed conditions can be used for other dissolved metal&#8208;type reductive transformations, including reductive amination, deoxygenation, dehalogenation, alkene and alkyne reductions.

         <title>Control of the Hydroquinone/Benzoquinone Redox State in High&#8208;Mobility Semiconducting Conjugated Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel synthetic strategy to modulate the electronic band structure of conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) through control of the redox state of hydroquinone/benzoquinone ligands during synthesis. We successfully synthesized two distinct semiconducting c&#8208;CPs, Ag4TTBQ(TTBQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolbenzoquinone) and Ag4TTHQ(TTHQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolhydroquinone), by reacting TTHQ with silver nitrate and silver acetate, respectively. 







Abstract
Conjugated coordination polymers (c&#8208;CPs) are unique organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid semiconductors with intrinsically high electrical conductivity and excellent charge carrier mobility. However, it remains a challenge in tailoring electronic structures, due to the lack of clear guidelines. Here, we develop a strategy wherein controlling the redox state of hydroquinone/benzoquinone (HQ/BQ) ligands allows for the modulation of the electronic structure of c&#8208;CPs while maintaining the structural topology. The redox&#8208;state control is achieved by reacting the ligand TTHQ (TTHQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolhydroquinone) with silver acetate and silver nitrate, yielding Ag4TTHQ and Ag4TTBQ (TTBQ=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolbenzoquinone), respectively. In spite of sharing the same topology consisting of a two&#8208;dimensional Ag&#8722;S network and HQ/BQ layer, they exhibit different band gaps (1.5&#8197;eV for Ag4TTHQ and 0.5&#8197;eV for Ag4TTBQ) and conductivities (0.4 S/cm for Ag4TTHQ and 10 S/cm for Ag4TTBQ). DFT calculations reveal that these differences arise from the ligand oxidation state inhibiting energy band formation near the Fermi level in Ag4TTHQ. Consequently, Ag4TTHQ displays a high Seebeck coefficient of 330&#8197;&#956;V/K and a power factor of 10&#8197;&#956;W/m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K2, surpassing Ag4TTBQ and the other reported silver&#8208;based c&#8208;CPs. Furthermore, terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates high charge mobilities exceeding 130&#8197;cm2/V&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s in both Ag4TTHQ and Ag4TTBQ.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Metabolic Glycosylation Reporters Enable Detection of Protein O&#8722;GlcNAcylation in Living Cells without S&#8208;Glyco Modification</title>

Norbornene&#8208;modified glycosyl phosphates with suitable protecting groups enable labeling of O&#8722;GlcNAcylated proteins by metabolic glycoengineering without artificial modification of cysteine residues. A subsequent inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is used to introduce a fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) label at O&#8722;GlcNAc sites allowing the imaging of protein&#8208;specific O&#8722;GlcNAcylation within living cells.







Abstract
Protein O&#8722;GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in numerous fundamental regulation processes. Investigation of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) has been carried out for two decades with peracetylated N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine derivatives modified with varying reporter groups. Recently, it has been shown that these derivatives can result in non&#8208;specific protein labeling termed S&#8208;glyco modification. Here, we report norbornene&#8208;modified GlcNAc derivatives with a protected phosphate at the anomeric position and their application in MGE. These derivatives overcome two limitations of previously used O&#8722;GlcNAc reporters. They do not lead to detectable S&#8208;glyco modification, and they efficiently react in the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which can be carried out even within living cells. Using a derivative with an S&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioethyl&#8208;protected phosphate, we demonstrate the protein&#8208;specific detection of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation of several proteins and the protein&#8208;specific imaging of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation inside living cells by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) visualized by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Synthetic Peptides with Genetic&#8208;Codon&#8208;Tailored Affinity for Assembling Tetraspanin CD81 at Cell Interfaces and Inhibiting Cancer Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first peptidyl ligand targeting the intrinsically disordered region of tetraspanin CD81 has been identified. By forming steric complementarity with CD81, the peptide enables in situ tracking of the dynamic distribution of CD81 at cell&#8208;contact interfaces. Further blockage of cell migration highlights the key role of the target motif of CD81 in cell communication, which presents the peptide as a functional inhibitor against cancer growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Probing biomolecular interactions at cellular interfaces is crucial for understanding and interfering with life processes. Although affinity binders with site specificity for membrane proteins are unparalleled molecular tools, a high demand remains for novel multi&#8208;functional ligands. In this study, a synthetic peptide (APQQ) with tight and specific binding to the untargeted extracellular loop of CD81 evolved from a genetically encoded peptide pool. With tailored affinity, APQQ flexibly accesses, site&#8208;specifically binds, and forms a complex with CD81, enabling in&#8208;situ tracking of the dynamics and activity of this protein in living cells, which has rarely been explored because of the lack of ligands. Furthermore, APQQ triggers the relocalization of CD81 from diffuse to densely clustered at cell junctions and modulates the interplay of membrane proteins at cellular interfaces. Motivated by these, efficient suppression of cancer cell migration, and inhibition of breast cancer metastasis were achieved in vivo.

In this study, a synthetic peptide (APQQ) with tight and specific binding to the untargeted extracellular loop of CD81 evolved from a genetically encoded peptide pool. With tailored affinity, APQQ flexibly accesses, site-specifically binds, and forms a complex with CD81, enabling in-situ tracking of the dynamics and activity of this protein in living cells, which has rarely been explored because of the lack of ligands. Furthermore, APQQ triggers the relocalization of CD81 from diffuse to densely clustered at cell junctions and modulates the interplay of membrane proteins at cellular interfaces. Motivated by these, efficient suppression of cancer cell migration, and inhibition of breast cancer metastasis were achieved in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fundamental Structural and Electronic Understanding of Palladium Catalysts on Nitride and Oxide Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the support type (nitride and oxide) on the charge state of isolated Pd sites has been explored in this work. Furthermore, a correlation was established between the formal oxidation state, the vibrational frequency of adsorbed CO, and the computed Bader charge based on the periodic trends in electronegativity, allowing the identification of appropriate models for the understanding of the coordination structure of Pd center.







Abstract
The nature of the support can fundamentally affect the function of a heterogeneous catalyst. For the novel type of isolated metal atom catalysts, sometimes referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts, systematic correlations are still rare. Here, we report a general finding that Pd on nitride supports (non&#8208;metal and metal nitride) features a higher oxidation state compared to that on oxide supports (non&#8208;metal and metal oxide). Through thorough oxidation state investigations by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO&#8208;DRIFTS, and density functional theory (DFT) coupled with Bader charge analysis, it is found that Pd atoms prefer to interact with surface hydroxyl group to form a Pd(OH)x species on oxide supports, while on nitride supports, Pd atoms incorporate into the surface structure in the form of Pd&#8722;N bonds. Moreover, a correlation was built between the formal oxidation state and computational Bader charge, based on the periodic trend in electronegativity.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Viral Detection Using Electrochemical Kinetic Profiling of Aptamer&#8208;Antigen Recognition in Clinical Samples and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>

Multimeric aptamers, real&#8208;time kinetic profiling, and machine learning enable high precision analysis of viruses in a single pot directly in clinical samples.







Abstract
High&#8208;precision viral detection at point of need with clinical samples plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of infectious diseases and the control of a global pandemic. However, the complexity of clinical samples that often contain very low viral concentrations makes it a huge challenge to develop simple diagnostic devices that do not require any sample processing and yet are capable of meeting performance metrics such as very high sensitivity and specificity. Herein we describe a new single&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step electrochemical method that uses real&#8208;time kinetic profiling of the interaction between a high&#8208;affinity aptamer and an antigen on a viral surface. This method generates many data points per sample, which when combined with machine learning, can deliver highly accurate test results in a short testing time. We demonstrate this concept using both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza A viruses as model viruses with specifically engineered high&#8208;affinity aptamers. Utilizing this technique to diagnose COVID&#8208;19 with 37 real human saliva samples results in a sensitivity and specificity of both 100&#8201;% (27 true negatives and 10 true positives, with 0 false negative and 0 false positive), which showcases the superb diagnostic precision of this method.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrofunctionalization of Cyclobutenones: Total Synthesis of gem&#8208;Dimethylcyclobutane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential enantioselective reduction/trapping/cross&#8208;coupling reaction of cyclobutenones furnished an array of chiral trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;4,4&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanones. The developed strategy was applied in the syntheses of several gem&#8208;dimethylcyclobutane&#8208;containing natural products, including (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, (&#8722;)&#8208;rumphellanones A&#8722;C, (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#946;,9&#945;H&#8208;5&#8208;linoleoyloxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;secocaryophyllen&#8208;4&#8208;one, and (&#8722;)&#8208;raikovenal.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes with a gem&#8208;dimethyl group are common motifs in natural products. However, strategies for constructing enantioenriched gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutanes are still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enantioselective approach to synthesize a broad group of chiral 2,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanones through sequential 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/trapping/cross&#8208;coupling of readily available cyclobutenones. The intermediate 2&#8208;bromocyclobutanone provides a valuable synthetic handle for further coupling transformations. In addition, this strategy was successfully utilized to synthesize gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutane&#8208;containing natural products, including (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, (&#8722;)&#8208;raikovenal, (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#946;,9&#945;H&#8208;5&#8208;linoleoyloxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;secocaryophyllen&#8208;4&#8208;one, and (&#8722;)&#8208;rumphellanones A&#8722;C.

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Toughening of Interpenetrated Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive networks are synthesized with distinct polymer arrangements of the polymers. The structure of the network impacts the materials properties in both the resting state, and in the presence of carbodiimide fuels which transiently form anhydride crosslinks. Interpenetrated materials in the fueled state have superior fracture and compressive properties.







Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated that temporary crosslinks in polymer networks generated by chemical &#8220;fuels&#8221; afford materials with large, transient changes in their mechanical properties. This can be accomplished in carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polymer hydrogels using carbodiimides, which generate anhydride crosslinks with lifetimes on the order of minutes to hours. Here, the impact of the polymer network architecture on the mechanical properties of transiently crosslinked materials was explored. Single networks (SNs) were compared to interpenetrated networks (IPNs). Notably, semi&#8208;IPN precursors that give IPNs on treatment with carbodiimide give much higher fracture energies (i.e., resistance to fracture) and superior resistance to compressive strain compared to other network architectures. A precursor semi&#8208;IPN material featuring acrylic acid in only the free polymer chains yields, on treatment with carbodiimide, an IPN with a fracture energy of 2400&#8197;J/m2, a fourfold increase compared to an analogous semi&#8208;IPN precursor that yields a SN. This resistance to fracture enables the formation of macroscopic complex cut patterns, even at high strain, underscoring the pivotal role of polymer architecture in mechanical performance.

Six racemic copper nanoclusters (NCs) alloyed with Pd0 or Pt0 were synthesized, showing a distorted hexagonal antiprism Pd0/Pt0@Cu12 cage. Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; can replace one or two alkynyl ligands through ligand exchange. All the NCs exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence with emission peaks (705&#8211;755&#8197;nm), lifetimes (6.630&#8211;9.662&#8197;&#956;s), and absolute quantum yields (1.75&#8201;%&#8211;2.52&#8201;%) in their crystalline state.







Abstract
Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) has emerged as a widely explored and versatile strategy for tailoring tunable properties, facilitating in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level investigations of structure&#8208;property correlations. In this study, we have successfully synthesized six atomically precise copper NCs alloyed with Group 10 metals (Pd or Pt). Notably, the Pd0 or Pt0 atom situated at the center of the distorted hexagonal antiprism Pd0/Pt0@Cu12 cage, coordinated with twelve Cu+ and two tBuC&#8801;C&#8722; ligands. Moreover, ligand exchange strategies demonstrated the potential for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; to replace one or two alkynyl ligands positioned at the top or side of the NCs. The chirality exhibited by these racemic NCs is primarily attributed to the involvement of halogens and a chiral (Pd/Pt)@Cu18 skeleton. Furthermore, all the NCs exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence, characterized by emission peaks at 705&#8211;755&#8197;nm, lifetimes ranging from 6.630 to 9.662&#8197;&#956;s, and absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 1.75&#8201;%&#8211;2.52&#8201;% in their crystalline state. The experimental optical properties of these NCs are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of theoretical calculations. These alloy NCs not only offer valuable insights into the synthesis of Pd0/Pt0&#8208;Cu alloy NCs, but also bridge the gap in understanding the structure&#8208;luminescence relationships of Pd0/Pt0&#8208;Cu molecules.

         <title>Exploring Pyroelectricity, Thermal and Photochemical Switching in a Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Crystal by In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>

         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials based on known molecular photoswitches show great potential for the rational design of new pyro&#8208; and ferroelectric photoswitches. This article shows how in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction using thermal, photochemical and electrical stimuli can explore structure&#8211;property relationships in the novel pyroelectric (FA)[NaFe(CN)6(NO]).H2O, enabling a deeper understanding of its complex energy landscape via structural&#8208;dynamics calculations.







Abstract
The switching behavior of the novel hybrid material (FA)Na[Fe(CN)5(NO)].H2O (1) in response to temperature (T), light irradiation and electric field (E) is studied using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Crystals of 1 display piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, second and third harmonic generation. XRD shows that the FA+ are disordered at room&#8208;temperature, but stepwise cooling from 273&#8211;100&#8197;K induces gradual ordering, while cooling under an applied field (E=+40&#8197;kVcm&#8722;1) induces a sudden phase change at 140&#8197;K. Structural&#8208;dynamics calculations suggest the field pushes the system into a region of the structural potential&#8208;energy surface that is otherwise inaccessible, demonstrating that application of T and E offers an effective route to manipulating the crystal chemistry of these materials. Photocrystallography also reveals photoinduced linkage isomerism, which coexists with but is not correlated to other switching behaviors. These experiments highlight a new approach to in situ studies of hybrid materials, providing insight into the structure&#8211;property relationships that underpin their functionality.

         <title>Enhanced Proximity of Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn Ensembles Encaged in UiO&#8208;67 Boosting Catalytic Conversion of Syngas to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 was prepared for direct syngas conversion. With the enhanced proximity of the dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles formed spontaneously in the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, we obtained, for the first time, a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0&#8201;% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4&#8201;% on the monometallic Rh catalyst.







Abstract
Maintaining high conversion under the premise of high oxygenates selectivity in syngas conversion is important but a formidable challenge in Rh catalysis. Monometallic Rh catalysts provide poor oxygenate conversion efficiency, and efforts have been focused on constructing adjacent polymetallic sites; however, the one&#8208;pass yields of C2+ oxygenates over the reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts were mostly &lt;20&#8201;%. In this study, we constructed a monometallic Rh catalyst encapsulated in UiO&#8208;67 (Rh/UiO&#8208;67) with enhanced proximity to dual&#8208;site Rh1,2&#8208;Rhn ensembles. Unexpectedly, this catalyst exhibited high efficacy for oxygenate synthesis from syngas, giving a high oxygenate selectivity of 72.0&#8201;% with a remarkable CO conversion of 50.4&#8201;%, and the one&#8208;pass yield of C2+ oxygenates exceeded 25&#8201;%. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterizations further revealed the spontaneous formation of an ensemble of Rh single atoms/dimers (Rh1,2) in the proximity of ultrasmall Rh clusters (Rhn) confined within the nanocavity of UiO&#8208;67, providing adjacent Rh+&#8208;Rh0 dual sites dynamically during the reaction that promote the relay of the undissociated CHO species to the CHx species. Thus, our results open a new route for designing highly efficient Rh catalysts for the conversion of syngas to oxygenates by precisely tuning the ensemble and proximity of the dual active sites in a confined space.

         <title>Elaborate Modulating Binding Strength of Intermediates via Three&#8208;component Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed with electron&#8208;rich diarylamine unit and electron&#8208;deficient benzothiazole and Co&#8208;porphyrin units, thus overcoming the weak or strong interactions between COFs and intermediates, improving the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance.







Abstract
The catalytic performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the binding strength of the reactants and intermediates. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been adopted to catalyze CO2RR, and their binding abilities are tuned via constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (DA) systems. However, most DA COFs have single donor and acceptor units, which caused wide&#8208;range but lacking accuracy in modulating the binding strength of intermediates. More elaborate regulation of the interactions with intermediates are necessary and challenge to construct high&#8208;efficiency catalysts. Herein, the three&#8208;component COF with D&#8208;A&#8208;A units was first constructed by introducing electron&#8208;rich diarylamine unit, electron&#8208;deficient benzothiazole and Co&#8208;porphyrin units. Compared with two&#8208;component COFs, the designed COF exhibit elevated electronic conductivity, enhanced reducibility, high efficiency charge transfer, further improving the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance with the faradic efficiency of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and high activity with the partial current density of 27.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V which exceed other two&#8208;component COFs. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that catalytic sites in three&#8208;component COF have suitable binding ability of the intermediates, which are benefit for formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of multi&#8208;component COFs, enabling modulated charge transfer to improve the CO2RR activity.

An ultra&#8208;stable two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II)&#8208;organic assembly NKU&#8208;123 for efficient photothermal conversion is reported. Under 808&#8197;nm light, the temperature of NKU&#8208;123 rapidly increases from 25.5 to 215.1&#8201;&#176;C in 6&#8197;seconds. NKU&#8208;123 exhibits a solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation rate of 1.442 and 1.299&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation with a water evaporation efficiency of 97.8 and 87.9&#8201;% for pure water and seawater, respectively. The role of light&#8208;generated radicals to the photothermal conversion was revealed.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation is a promising strategy for clean water production, which needs the development of solar&#8208;thermal conversion materials with both high efficiency and high stability. Herein, we reported an ultra&#8208;stable cobalt(II)&#8208;organic assembly NKU&#8208;123 with light&#8208;generated radicals, exhibiting superior photothermal conversion efficiency and high stability. Under the irradiation of 808&#8197;nm light, the temperature of NKU&#8208;123 rapidly increases from 25.5 to 215.1&#8201;&#176;C in 6&#8197;seconds. The solar water evaporator based on NKU&#8208;123 achieves a high solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation rate of 1.442 and 1.299&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation with a water evaporation efficiency of 97.8 and 87.9&#8201;% for pure water and seawater, respectively. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the formation of light&#8208;generated radicals leads to an increase of spin density of NKU&#8208;123 for enhancing the photothermal effect, which provides insights into the design of highly efficient photothermal materials.

         <title>Enhancing Ni/Co Activity by Neighboring Pt Atoms in NiCoP/MXene Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Ni/Co can be improved by neighboring Pt atoms in alkaline electrolyte, which can increase water adsorption and decrease dramatically water dissociation energy barrier by interface electron transfer, and even change catalytic route from Heyrovsky to faster Tafel step.







Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate neighboring Pt atoms can enhance the metal activity of NiCoP for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, it remains a great challenge to link Pt and NiCoP. Herein, we introduced curvature of bowl&#8208;like structure to construct Pt/NiCoP interface by adding a minimal 1&#8201;&#8240;&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio Pt. The as&#8208;prepared sample only requires an overpotential of 26.5 and 181.6&#8197;mV to accordingly achieve the current density of 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH. The water dissociation energy barrier (Ea) has a ~43&#8201;% decrease compared with NiCoP counterpart. It also shows an ultrahigh stability with a small degradation rate of 10.6&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at harsh conditions (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 50&#8201;&#176;C) after 3000&#8197;hrs. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) verify the interface electron transfer lowers the valence state of Co/Ni and activates them. DFT calculations also confirm the catalytic transition step of NiCoP can change from Heyrovsky (2.71&#8197;eV) to Tafel step (0.51&#8197;eV) in the neighborhood of Pt, in accord with the result of the improved Hads at the interface disclosed by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) tests.

         <title>Metabolic&#8208;Glycoengineering&#8208;Enabled Molecularly Specific Acoustic Tweezing Cytometry for Targeted Mechanical Stimulation of Cell Surface Sialoglycans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DBCO&#8208;functionalized microbubbles were attached to azide&#8208;tagged sialoglycans on the cell surface generated by cell metabolic engineering to enable molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry. This novel technology was utilized to study the roles of sialoglycans in mechanotransduction, revealing different mechanical properties and mechanoregulatory activities of sialoglycans from protein sensors like integrins.







Abstract
In this study, we developed a novel type of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)&#8208;functionalized microbubbles (MBs) and validated their attachment to azide&#8208;labelled sialoglycans on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE). This enabled the application of mechanical forces to sialoglycans on hPSCs through molecularly specific acoustic tweezing cytometry (mATC), that is, displacing sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs using ultrasound (US). It was shown that subjected to the acoustic radiation forces of US pulses, sialoglycan&#8208;anchored MBs exhibited significantly larger displacements and faster, more complete recovery after each pulse than integrin&#8208;anchored MBs, indicating that sialoglycans are more stretchable and elastic than integrins on hPSCs in response to mechanical force. Furthermore, stimulating sialoglycans on hPSCs using mATC reduced stage&#8208;specific embryonic antigen&#8208;3 (SSEA&#8208;3) and GD3 expression but not OCT4 and SOX2 nuclear localization. Conversely, stimulating integrins decreased OCT4 nuclear localization but not SSEA&#8208;3 and GD3 expression, suggesting that mechanically stimulating sialoglycans and integrins initiated distinctive mechanoresponses during the early stages of hPSC differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrated that MGE&#8208;enabled mATC uncovered not only different mechanical properties of sialoglycans on hPSCs and integrins but also their different mechanoregulatory impacts on hPSC differentiation, validating MGE&#8208;based mATC as a new, powerful tool for investigating the roles of glycans and other cell surface biomolecules in mechanotransduction.

         <title>From Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2 to Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2: Controlling Sulfur Content in Thiocyanate Systems Significantly Improves the Overall Performance of UV Nonlinear Optical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first UV NLO crystalline material thiocyanate Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2, with a phase&#8208;matching ability non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) structure was obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2, achieving the process from 0 (CS) to 1 (NCS) and unprecedented improvement in comprehensive performance, suggesting Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 is an excellent UV NLO candidate, demonstrating the modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy to develop UV NLO crystals.







Abstract
Combining a strong second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) effect (&gt;1&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP)), a large band gap (&gt;4.2&#8197;eV), and a moderate birefringence in ultraviolet (UV) NLO crystals remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2, the first example of a thiocyanate capable of realizing a phase&#8208;matched UV NLO crystal material, is obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2. Compared to the &#8220;shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder&#8221; one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2, Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 has a different sawtooth 1D chain structure. Cd(SCN)2(CH4N2S)2 has second harmonic generation (SHG) inertia with a band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a UV cutoff edge of 342&#8197;nm, however, it possesses a large birefringence (0.35@546&#8197;nm). In contrast, the symmetry center breaking of Cd(SCN)2(C4H6N2)2 leads to remarkably strong SHG intensity (10&#8197;times that of KDP). Furthermore, it has a wide band gap (4.74&#8197;eV), short UV cutoff edge (234&#8197;nm), and moderate birefringence capable of phase matching (0.17@546&#8197;nm). This research indicates that thiocyanates are a promising class of UV NLO crystal materials, and that modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy for the development of UV NLO crystals with excellent overall performances.

&lt;p&gt;Combining a strong second-order nonlinear optical (NLO) effect (&amp;gt;1&#215;KH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (KDP)), a large band gap (&amp;gt;4.2&#8197;eV), and a moderate birefringence in ultraviolet (UV) NLO crystals remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Cd(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the first example of a thiocyanate capable of realizing a phase-matched UV NLO crystal material, is obtained by reducing the sulfur (S) content in the centrosymmetric (CS) structure of Cd(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Compared to the &#8220;shoulder-to-shoulder&#8221; one-dimensional (1D) chain of Cd(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cd(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a different sawtooth 1D chain structure. Cd(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has second harmonic generation (SHG) inertia with a band gap of 3.90&#8197;eV and a UV cutoff edge of 342&#8197;nm, however, it possesses a large birefringence (0.35@546&#8197;nm). In contrast, the symmetry center breaking of Cd(SCN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to remarkably strong SHG intensity (10&#8197;times that of KDP). Furthermore, it has a wide band gap (4.74&#8197;eV), short UV cutoff edge (234&#8197;nm), and moderate birefringence capable of phase matching (0.17@546&#8197;nm). This research indicates that thiocyanates are a promising class of UV NLO crystal materials, and that modulation of the sulfur content of CS thiocyanates is an effective strategy for the development of UV NLO crystals with excellent overall performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Isolable One&#8208;Coordinate Lead(I) Radical with Strong g&#8208;Factor Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first lead&#8208;centered radical containing a one&#8208;coordinate Pb atom was isolated and fully characterized. It possesses two&#8208;fold orbital pseudo&#8208;degeneracy and hence substantial unquenched orbital angular momentum, as manifested by hitherto strongest g&#8208;factor anisotropy amongst main group radicals.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;based radicals in the oxidation state of +1 are elusive species and are highly challenging to isolate in the condensed phase. In this study, we present the synthesis and characterization of the first isolable free plumbylyne radical 2 bearing a one&#8208;coordinate Pb(I) atom. It reacts with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to afford a two&#8208;coordinate NHC&#8208;ligated Pb(I) radical 3. 2 and 3 represent the first isolable Pb(I)&#8208;based radicals. Theoretical calculations and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that the unpaired electron mainly resides at the Pb 6p orbital in both radicals. Owing to the unique one&#8208;coordinate nature of the Pb atom in 2, it possesses two&#8208;fold orbital pseudo&#8208;degeneracy and substantial unquenched orbital angular momentum, and exhibits hitherto strongest g&#8208;factor anisotropy (gx,y,z=1.496, 1.166, 0.683) amongst main group radicals. Preliminary investigations into the reactivity of 2 unveiled its Pb&#8208;centered radical nature, and plumbylenes were isolated as products.

         <title>Stabilizing Lattice Oxygen through Mn Doping in NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; Spinel Electrocatalysts for Efficient and Durable Acid Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8208;&#948; electrocatalyst with stable lattice oxygen was designed and fabricated by co&#8208;electrochemical deposition method. The results demonstrate lattice Mn species can enhance the formation energy of oxygen vacancy leading to a significant increase in lattice oxygen stability. The Mn&#8722;O structure adjacent Co octahedral sites show synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) and promote the formation of *OO from *OOH.







Abstract
Design the electrocatalysts without noble metal is still a challenge for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid media. Herein, we reported the manganese (Mn) doping method to decrease the concentration of oxygen vacancy (VO) and form the Mn&#8722;O structure adjacent octahedral sites in spinel NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; (NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8208;&#948;), which highly enhanced the activity and stability of spinel NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; with a low overpotential (&#951;) of 280&#8197;mV at j=10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability of 80&#8197;h in acid media. The isotopic labelling experiment based on differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) clearly demonstrated the lattice oxygen in NiMn1.5Co3O4&#8208;&#948; is more stable due to strong Mn&#8722;O bond and shows synergetic adsorbate evolution mechanism (SAEM) for acid OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal highly increased oxygen vacancy formation energy (EVO) of NiCo2O4&#8208;&#948; after Mn doping. More importantly, the highly hydrogen bonding between Mn&#8722;O and *OOH adsorbed on adjacent Co octahedral sites promote the formation of *OO from *OOH due to the greatly enhanced charge density of O in Mn substituted sites.

         <title>Alkoxycarbonyl Groups in Metalloesters Showing Oxocarbenium&#8208;like Structure and Alkylating Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of Co/Ni bimetallic metalloesters bearing the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups are synthesized and characterized. As triggered by the long O&#8722;Calkyl bonds (1.522(11)~1.607(15)&#8197;&#197;), the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups toward a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism was examined at ambient conditions.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;documented acylating reactivity, the alkylating reactivity of the alkoxycarbonyl group, as signified by its oxocarbenium&#8208;like resonance structure, remains almost unexplored. Herein, the first series of Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters exhibiting the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups were synthesized and characterized. In these deformed alkoxycarbonyl groups, the Ccarbonyl&#8722;Oalkoxyl bonds were contracted to 1.177(11)~1.191(9)&#8197;&#197; with the elongations of the Ccarbonyl=Ocarbonyl bonds to 1.368(13)~1.441(9)&#8197;&#197;. Meanwhile, the O&#8722;Calkyl bonds were also elongated to 1.522(11) ~1.607(15)&#8197;&#197;, and were by far the longest O&#8722;Calkyl bonds reported for alkoxycarbonyl groups. As triggered by the long O&#8722;Calkyl distances, the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like methoxycarbonyl group towards a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism at ambient conditions was examined. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;etherifications of alcohols mediated by the Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters were investigated. The yields followed the trend ethanol&#8811;n&#8208;propanol&#8811;n&#8208;butanol &#8776;n&#8208;pentanol, that closely related to the structure features of the alkoxycarbonyl groups in corresponding metalloesters: while the ethoxycarbonyl group showed the reactive oxocarbenium&#8208;like framework, the n&#8208;propoxycarbonyl group displayed the dioxocarbenium&#8208;like skeleton with a shorter O&#8722;Calkyl bond; In comparison, the classical frameworks with unactivated alkyl moieties were observed for n&#8208;butoxycarbonyl and n&#8208;pentoxycarbonyl groups.

         <title>Cancer Cell&#8208;Selective PD&#8208;L1 Inhibition via a DNA Safety Catch to Enhance Immunotherapy Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>

The &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, a duplex DNA strand, was assembled on PD&#8722;L1 to control its accessibility by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reagent. ICB reagent was a retractable DNA nanostring (DNS), whose contraction drove PD&#8722;L1 clustering and corresponding degradation. 4T1&#8197;cell membrane protein c&#8208;Met controlled ICB reagent binding and achieved cancer cell selective PD&#8722;L1 inhibition. This strategy enhanced immunotherapeutic specificity.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint protein blockade (ICB) has emerged as a powerful immunotherapy approach, but suppressing immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) for noncancerous cells and normal tissues remains challenging. Activatable ICB has been developed with tumor microenvironment highly&#8208;expressed molecules as stimuli, but they still lack precision and efficiency considering the diffusion of stimuli molecules in whole tumor tissue. Here we assemble PD&#8722;L1 with a duplex DNA strand, termed as &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, to regulate its accessibility for ICB. The safety catch remains at &#8220;on&#8221; status for noncancerous cells to prevent ICB binding to PD&#8722;L1. Cancer cell membrane protein c&#8208;Met acts as a trigger protein to react with safety catch, which selectively exposes its hybridization region for ICB reagent. The ICB reagent is a retractable DNA nanostring with repeating hairpin&#8208;structural units, whose contraction drives PD&#8722;L1 clustering with endocytosis&#8208;guided degradation. The safety catch, even remained at &#8220;safety on&#8221; status, is removed from the cell membrane via a DNA strand displacement reaction to minimize its influence on noncancerous cells. This strategy demonstrates selective and potent immunotherapeutic capabilities only against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and shows effective suppression of irAEs in normal tissues, therefore would become a promising approach for precise immunotherapy in mice.

With the assistance of a commercially available L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid ligand, the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols via the Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation has been realized.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Fluorescent Polymer Dyes with Tunable Emission Spectra for Flow Cytometry Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of water&#8208;soluble fluorescent polymer dyes was developed. All &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers are excited by a 405&#8197;nm laser, but are distinguishable by their emission spectra. The emission can be tuned by covalently binding of small&#8208;molecule dyes (F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer). The dyes were bioconjugated to antibodies and used as reagents for multiparameter flow cytometric analysis.







Abstract
The application of spectrally unique, bright, and water&#8208;soluble fluorescent dyes is indispensable for the analysis of biological systems. Multiparameter flow cytometry is a powerful tool for characterization of mixed cell populations. To discriminate the different cell populations, they are typically stained by a set of fluorescent reagents, e.g., antibody&#8208;fluorophore conjugates. The number of parameters which can be studied simultaneously strongly depends on the availability of reagents which can be differentiated by their spectral properties. In this study a series of fluorescent polymer dyes was developed, that can be excited with a single violet laser (405&#8197;nm) but distinguished by their unique emission spectra. The polyfluorene&#8208;based polymers can be used on their own, or in combination with covalently bound small&#8208;molecule dyes to generate energy transfer constructs to red&#8208;shift the emission wavelength based on F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The polymer dyes were utilized in a biological flow cytometry assay by conjugating several of them to antibodies, demonstrating their effectiveness as reagents. This report represents the first systematic investigation of structure&#8211;property relationships for this type of fluorescent dyes.

         <title>Helical Nanographenes Bearing Pentagon&#8208;Heptagon Pairs by Stepwise Dehydrocyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units provides a facile and feasible method for the synthesis of helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs. The presence of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs has proven to be quite effective in modulating the electrochemical and photophysical properties of the resulting nanographenes, including enhanced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
The incorporation of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs into helical nanographenes lacks a facile synthetic route, and the impact of these pairs on chiroptical properties remains unclear. In this study, a method for the stepwise construction of pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs in helical nanographenes by the dehydrogenation of [6]helicene units was developed. Three helical nanographenes containing pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs were synthesized and characterized using this approach. A wide variation in the molecular geometries and photophysical properties of these helical nanographenes was observed, with changes in the helical length of these structures and the introduction of the pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs. The embedded pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs reduced the oxidation potential of the synthesized helical nanographenes. The high isomerization energy barriers enabled the chiral resolution of the helicene enantiomers. Chiroptical investigations revealed remarkably enhanced circularly polarized luminescence and luminescence dissymmetry factors with an increasing number of the pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymer with Low Crystallinity for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with low crystallinity has been synthesized that has a high power factor of up to 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in solution&#8208;processed flexible organic thermoelectrics. The flexible devices also show good resistance to bending strain, with only marginal changes in the electrical conductivity after 600 bending cycles.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low crystallinity are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures of these CPs can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. However, n&#8208;doped CPs usually exhibit poor thermoelectric performance, which hinders the development of high&#8208;performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n&#8208;type CP (ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz) comprising two acceptor units: a thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and a cyano&#8208;functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz shows a low LUMO energy level of below &#8722;4.20&#8197;eV and features low crystallinity, enabling high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual&#8208;acceptor design enhances polaron delocalization, resulting in good thermoelectric performance. After n&#8208;doping, ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz exhibits an average electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 50.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a maximum power factor (PF) of 126.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2, which is among the highest values reported for solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;type CPs to date. Additionally, a solution&#8208;processed flexible OTE device based on doped ThDPP&#8208;CNBTz exhibits a maximum PF of 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2; the flexible device also shows remarkable resistance to bending strain, with only a marginal change in &#963; after 600 bending cycles. The findings presented in this work will advance the development of n&#8208;type CPs for OTE devices, and flexible devices in particular.

&lt;p&gt;Conjugated polymers (CPs) with low crystallinity are promising candidates for application in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), particularly in flexible devices, because the disordered structures of these CPs can effectively accommodate dopants and ensure robust resistance to bending. However, n-doped CPs usually exhibit poor thermoelectric performance, which hinders the development of high-performance thermoelectric generators. Herein, we report an n-type CP (ThDPP-CNBTz) comprising two acceptor units: a thiophene-flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and a cyano-functionalized benzothiadiazole. ThDPP-CNBTz shows a low LUMO energy level of below &#8722;4.20&#8197;eV and features low crystallinity, enabling high doping efficiency. Moreover, the dual-acceptor design enhances polaron delocalization, resulting in good thermoelectric performance. After n-doping, ThDPP-CNBTz exhibits an average electrical conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;) of 50.6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum power factor (PF) of 126.8&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is among the highest values reported for solution-processed n-type CPs to date. Additionally, a solution-processed flexible OTE device based on doped ThDPP-CNBTz exhibits a maximum PF of 70&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; the flexible device also shows remarkable resistance to bending strain, with only a marginal change in &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt; after 600 bending cycles. The findings presented in this work will advance the development of n-type CPs for OTE devices, and flexible devices in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A single&#8208;atomic Al&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts is developed for ORR, featuring a well&#8208;designed Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No active center with the axial pyrrolyl N ligands (No). The dynamic covalency competition of axial Al&#8208;No and Al&#8208;O bonding could endow the Al center with moderate hybridization between Al 3p orbital and O 2p orbital, alleviating the binding energy of ORR intermediates. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No catalysts exhibit excellent ORR activity, selectivity, and durability







Abstract
The main group metals are commonly perceived as catalytically inert in the context of oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) due to the delocalized valence orbitals. Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (M&#8208;Nx) is a promising approach to accelerate catalytic dynamics. Herein, we, for the first time, report the atomically dispersed Al catalysts coordinated with N and C atoms for 4&#8208;electron ORR. The axial coordinated pyrrolyl N group (No) is constructed in the Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No moiety to regulate the p&#8208;band structure of Al center, effectively steering the local environment and structure of the square planar Al&#8208;N4 sites, which typically exhibit too strong interaction with ORR intermediates. The dynamic covalency competition of axial Al&#8208;No and Al&#8208;O bonding could endow the Al center with moderate hybridization between Al 3p orbital and O 2p orbital, alleviating the binding energy of ORR intermediates. The as&#8208;prepared Al&#8208;N4&#8208;No electrocatalyst exhibits excellent ORR activity, selectivity, and durability, along with the rapid kinetics as demonstrated by in situ Raman spectroscopy. This work offers a fundamental comprehension of the fine regulation on p&#8208;band and guides the rational design of main&#8208;group metal&#8208;based single atom catalysts.

         <title>Mechanism Behind the Programmed Biosynthesis of Heterotrimeric Fungal Depside Thielavin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyketide synthase ThiA that forms the heterotrimeric fungal depside thielavin A (1) has been identified and characterized. The thioesterase (TE) domain of ThiA was found to perform two consecutive esterification reactions as well as subsequent hydrolysis, and a plausible reaction mechanism for the TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions has been proposed. Furthermore, this study provides insights into how ThiA selectivity yields the heterotrimeric product.







Abstract
Thielavin A (1) is a fungal depside composed of one 3&#8208;methylorsellinic acid and two 3,5&#8208;dimethylorsellinic acid units. It displays diverse biological activities. However, the mechanism underlying the assembly of the heterotrimeric structure of 1 remains to be clarified. In this study, we identified the polyketide synthase (PKS) involved in the biosynthesis of 1. This PKS, designated as ThiA, possesses an unusual domain organization with the C&#8208;methyltransferase (MT) domain situated at the C&#8208;terminus following the thioesterase (TE) domain. Our findings indicated that the TE domain is solely responsible for two rounds of ester bond formation, along with subsequent chain hydrolysis. We identified a plausible mechanism for TE&#8208;catalyzed reactions and obtained insights into how a single PKS can selectively yield a specific heterotrimeric product. In particular, the tandem acyl carrier protein domains of ThiA are critical for programmed methylation by the MT domain. Overall, this study highlighted the occurrence of highly optimized domain&#8211;domain communication within ThiA for the selective synthesis of 1, which can advance our understanding of the programming rules of fungal PKSs.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Direct Air Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing a high&#8208;entropy mechanism, this study uncovers an abnormal phenomenon where oxygen adsorption elongates the N&#8801;N bond, boosting the activation of N2 molecules. The high entropy also significantly reduces the competitive oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in an unprecedented ammonia yield rate. This discovery opens an avenue for high&#8208;entropy research toward practical applications.







Abstract
According to the principles of chemical thermodynamics, the catalytic activation of small molecules (like N2 in air and CO2 in flue gas) generally exhibits a negative activity dependence on O2 owning to the competitive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nevertheless, some catalysts can show positive activity dependence for N2 electrofixation, an important route to produce ammonia under ambient condition. Here we report that the positive activity dependence on O2 of (Ni0.20Co0.20Fe0.20Mn0.19Mo0.21)3S4 catalyst arises from high&#8208;entropy mechanism. Through experimental and theoretical studies, we demonstrate that under the reaction condition in the mixed N2/O2, the adsorption of O2 on high&#8208;entropy catalyst contributes to activating N2 molecules characteristic of elongated N&#8801;N bond lengths. As comparison to the low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy counterparts, high entropy can play the second role of attenuating competitive ORR by displaying a negative exponential entropy&#8208;ORR activity relationship. Accordingly, benefiting from the O2, the system for direct air electrofixation has demonstrated an ammonia yield rate of 47.70&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is even 1.5&#8197;times of pure N2 feedstock (31.92&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2), overtaking all previous reports for this reaction. We expect the present finding providing an additional dimension to high entropy that leverages systems beyond the constraint of traditional rules.

         <title>Intramolecular Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions Organize Bowl&#8208;Shaped, Luminescent Molecular Containers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular multiple cation&#8208;&#960; interactions and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8722; hydrogen bonds have been used to generate bowl&#8208;shaped molecular containers that show high binding affinities for halide ions and luminescent properties. This efficient approach opens up a new avenue for exploring the synthesis of functional molecules.







Abstract
Molecules with nonplanar architectures are highly desirable due to their unique topological structures and functions. We report here the synthesis of two molecular containers (1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Br&#8722; and 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Cl&#8722;), which utilize intramolecular cation&#8208;&#960; interactions to enforce macrocylic arrangements and exhibit high binding affinity and luminescent properties. Remarkably, the geometry of the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction can be flexibly tailored to achieve a precise ring arrangement, irrespective of the angle of the noncovalent bonds. Additionally, the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&#8722; hydrogen bonds within the container are also conducive to stabilizing the bowl&#8208;shaped conformation. These bowl&#8208;shaped conformations were confirmed both in solution through NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray studies. 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Br&#8722; shows high binding affinity and selectivity: F&#8722;&gt;Cl&#8722;, through C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X&#8722; (X=F, Cl) hydrogen bonds. Additionally, these containers exhibited blue fluorescence in solution and yellow room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state. Our findings illustrate the utility of cation&#8208;&#960; interactions in designing functional molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Intramolecular multiple cation-&#960; interactions and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen bonds have been used to generate bowl-shaped molecular containers that show high binding affinities for halide ions and luminescent properties. This efficient approach opens up a new avenue for exploring the synthesis of functional molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecules with nonplanar architectures are highly desirable due to their unique topological structures and functions. We report here the synthesis of two molecular containers (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), which utilize intramolecular cation-&#960; interactions to enforce macrocylic arrangements and exhibit high binding affinity and luminescent properties. Remarkably, the geometry of the cation-&#960; interaction can be flexibly tailored to achieve a precise ring arrangement, irrespective of the angle of the noncovalent bonds. Additionally, the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen bonds within the container are also conducive to stabilizing the bowl-shaped conformation. These bowl-shaped conformations were confirmed both in solution through NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X-ray studies. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; shows high binding affinity and selectivity: F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, through C&#8722;H&lt;b&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&lt;/b&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X=F, Cl) hydrogen bonds. Additionally, these containers exhibited blue fluorescence in solution and yellow room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state. Our findings illustrate the utility of cation-&#960; interactions in designing functional molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters demonstrate dynamic reversible piezochromic luminescent (PCL) behavior by the modulation of inter/intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, and their single crystals exhibit full&#8208;color PCL process spanning a wide range of 170 nm at high pressure. These TADF emitters also show radioluminescence, with promising potential in X&#8208;ray scintillator imaging.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) can be excellent candidates for piezochromic luminescent (PCL) materials due to their structural dynamics. Spatial donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) stacking arrangements enable the modulation of inter&#8208; and intramolecular D&#8722;A interactions, as well as spatial charge transfer states, under varying pressure conditions. Herein, we demonstrate an effective approach toward dynamic reversible full&#8208;color PCL materials with TSCT&#8208;TADF characteristics. Their single crystals exhibit a full&#8208;color&#8208;gamut PCL process spanning a range of 170&#8197;nm. Moreover, the TSCT&#8208;TADF&#8208;PCL emitters display a unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and show promising application in X&#8208;ray scintillator imaging.

         <title>Manipulation of the Self&#8208;Assembly Morphology by Side&#8208;Chain Engineering of Quinoxaline&#8208;Substituted Organic Photothermal Molecules for Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion and Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Two organic molecules BQC and BQE with different substituents on the quinoxaline unit have been designed, with BQE having an ethyl group exhibiting efficient nonradiative decay. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembly property of BQE results in a textured surface and thus an efficient light&#8208;trapping system. A water&#8208;electricity cogeneration device based on BQE was fabricated and showed a water evaporation efficiency of 68&#8201;%.







Abstract
Organic photothermal materials have attracted increasing attention because of their structural diversity, flexibility, and compatibility. However, their energy conversion efficiency is limited owing to the narrow absorption spectrum, strong reflection/transmittance, and insufficient nonradiative decay. In this study, two quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A&#8208;D&#8211;A&#8208;D&#8208;type molecules with ethyl (BQE) or carboxylate (BQC) substituents were synthesized. Strong intramolecular charge transfer provided both molecules with a broad absorption range of 350&#8211;1000&#8197;nm. In addition, the high reorganization energy and weak molecular packing of BQE resulted in efficient nonradiative decay. More importantly, the self&#8208;assembly of BQE leads to a textured surface and enhances the light&#8208;trapping efficiency with significantly reduced light reflection/transmittance. Consequently, BQE achieved an impressive solar&#8208;thermal conversion efficiency of 18.16&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;kW&#8201;m&#8722;2 irradiation with good photobleaching resistance. Based on this knowledge, the water evaporation rate of 1.2&#8197;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 was attained for the BQE&#8208;based interfacial evaporation device with an efficiency of 83&#8201;% under 1.0&#8197;kW&#8201;m&#8722;2 simulated sunlight. Finally, the synergetic integration of solar&#8208;steam and thermoelectric co&#8208;generation devices based on BQE was realized without significantly sacrificing solar&#8208;steam efficiency. This underscores the practical applications of BQE&#8208;based technology in effectively harnessing photothermal energy. This study provides new insights into the molecular design for enhancing light&#8208;trapping management by molecular self&#8208;assembly, paving the way for photothermal&#8208;driven applications of organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Copper Nanodrugs by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several copper (Cu) complexes with anticancer activity were employed as catalysts for miniemulsion atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in aqueous medium, producing Cu&#8208;loaded nanodrugs with simple steps and precise physiochemical property. The product showed prolonged blood circulation&#160;and&#160;improved&#160;tumor accumulation,&#160;with&#160;superior anticancer efficacy compared&#160;to cisplatin, showing great potential for clinical transition.







Abstract
In this study, some copper catalysts used for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) were explored as efficient anti&#8208;tumor agents. The aqueous solution of copper&#8208;containing nanoparticles with uniform spheric morphology was in situ prepared through a copper&#8208;catalyzed activator generated by electron transfer (AGET) ATRP in water. Nanoparticles were then directly injected into tumor&#8208;bearing mice for antitumor chemotherapy. The copper nanodrugs had prolonged blood circulation time and enhanced accumulation at tumor sites, thus showing potent antitumor activity. This work provides a novel strategy for precise and large&#8208;scale preparation of copper nanodrugs with high antitumor activity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Aromatic Cation&#8208;&#960; Driven Dimensional Polymorphism in Supramolecular Polymers for the Photocatalytic Oxidation and Separation of Aromatic/Cyclic Aliphatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise assembly of molecular building blocks is essential for designing polymorphism in supramolecular assemblies (SAs). A self&#8208;adaptive aromatic cation&#8208;&#960; binding motif has been developed to steer the self&#8208;assembly directionality of monomers to facilitate the creation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) crystalline supramolecular structures. These polymorphic SAs will have applications in various fields.







Abstract
The phenomenon of polymorphism is ubiquitous in nature, the controlled manipulation of which not only increases our ontological understanding of nature but also facilitates the conceptualization and realization of novel functional materials. However, achieving targeted polymorphism in supramolecular assemblies (SAs) remains a formidable challenge, largely because of the constraints inherent in controlling the specific binding motifs of noncovalent interactions. Herein, we propose self&#8208;adaptive aromatic cation&#8208;&#960; binding motifs to construct polymorphic SAs in both the solid and solution states. Using distinct discrete cation&#8208;&#960;&#8208;cation and long&#8208;range cation&#8208;&#960; binding motifs enables control of the self&#8208;assembly directionality of a C2h&#8208;symmetric bifunctional monomer, resulting in the successful formation of both two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional crystalline SAs (2D&#8208;CSA and 3D&#8208;CSA). The differences in the molecular packing of 3D&#8208;CSA compared with that of 2D&#8208;CSA significantly improve the charge separation and carrier mobility, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide (yield of 99&#8201;% vs 57&#8201;%). 2D&#8208;CSA, which has a vertical extended structure with favorable stronger interaction with toluene though face&#8208;to&#8208;face cation&#8208;&#960; interactions than methylcyclohexane, shows higher toluene/methylcyclohexane separation efficiency than 3D&#8208;CSA (96.9&#8201;% for 2D&#8208;CSA vs 56.3&#8201;% for 3D&#8208;CSA).

The differences in the molecular packing of 3D-CSA compared with that of 2D-CSA significantly improve the charge separation and carrier mobility, leading to enhanced photocatalytic activity for the aerobic oxidation of thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide (yield of 99&#8201;% vs 57&#8201;%). 2D-CSA, which has a vertical extended structure with favorable stronger interaction with toluene though face-to-face cation-&#960; interactions than methylcyclohexane, shows higher toluene/methylcyclohexane separation efficiency than 3D-CSA (96.9&#8201;% for 2D-CSA vs 56.3&#8201;% for 3D-CSA).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Linkable Fullerene Enables Elastic and Conductive Grain Boundaries for Efficient and Wearable Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;linkable fullerene (FTAI) is applied to regulate grain boundary conductivity and elasticity for the tin&#8208;based perovskite. The introduction of FTAI not only improves the perovskite quality, passivates the grain boundary defects, and facilitates charge transfer, but also effectively enhances the mechanical stability of perovskite film, achieving high&#8208;performance rigid and wearable tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) have received increasing attention due to their low toxicity, high theoretical efficiency, and potential applications as wearable devices. However, the inherent fast and uncontrollable crystallization process of tin&#8208;based perovskites results in high defect density in the film. Meanwhile, when fabricated into flexible devices, the prepared perovskite film exhibits inevitable brittleness and high Young's modulus, seriously weakening the mechanical stability. In this work, we design and synthesize a cross&#8208;linkable fullerene, thioctic acid functionalized C60 fulleropyrrolidinium iodide (FTAI), which has multiple interactions with perovskite components and can finely regulate the crystallization quality of perovskite film. The obtained perovskite film shows an increased grain size and a more matched energy level with the electron transport material, effectively improving the carrier extraction efficiency. The FTAI&#8208;based rigid device achieves a champion efficiency of 14.91&#8201;% with enhanced stability. More importantly, the FTAI located at the perovskite grain boundaries could spontaneously cross&#8208;link during the perovskite annealing process, which effectively improves the conductivity and elasticity of grain boundaries, thereby giving the film excellent bending resistance. Finally, the FTAI&#8208;based wearable device yields a record efficiency of 12.35&#8201;% and displays robust bending durability, retaining about 90&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after 10,000 bending times.

         <title>Boryl Ancillary Ligands: Influencing Stability and Reactivity of Amidinato&#8208;Silanone and Germanone Systems in Ammonia Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue) is formed from the corresponding tetrylene under an N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2).







Abstract
While the nucleophilic addition of ammonia to ketones is an archetypal reaction in classical organic chemistry, the reactivity of heavier group 14 carbonyl analogues (R2E=O; E=Si, Ge, Sn, or Pb) with NH3 remains sparsely investigated, primarily due to the synthetic difficulties in accessing heavier ketone congeners. Herein, we present a room&#8208;temperature stable boryl&#8208;substituted amidinato&#8208;silanone {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si=O (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) (together with its germanone analogue), formed from the corresponding silylene under a N2O atmosphere. This system reacts cleanly with ammonia in 1,2&#8208;fashion to give an isolable sila&#8208;hemiaminal complex {(HCDippN)2B}{PhC(tBuN)2}Si(OH)(NH2). Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the formation of this sila&#8208;hemiaminal is crucially dependent on the nature of the ancillary ligand scaffold. It is facilitated thermodynamically by the hemi&#8208;lability of the amidinate ligand (which allows for the formation of an energetically critical intramolecular N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HO hydrogen bond within the product) and is enabled mech&#8208;anistically by a process in which the silanone initially acts in umpolung fashion as a base (rather than an acid), due to the strongly electron&#8208;releasing and sterically bulky nature of the ancillary boryl ligand.

         <title>Precise Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Heterometal&#8208;Organic Capsules for Selectively Encapsulating Tetrahedral Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of PdII ions with metalloligand CuL1 gives a heterometallic Pd3Cu6L16 capsule, which can undergo precise post&#8208;synthetic modification with two tridentate anionic ligands to form a bicapped Pd3Cu6L16L22 capsule. Reversible post&#8208;synthetic modification between Pd3Cu6L16L22, Pd3Cu6L16L2, and Pd3Cu6L16 can be achieved by varying the reaction conditions. These capsules are able to selectively encapsulate tetrahedral anions.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthetic modification plays a crucial role in precisely adjusting the structure and functions of advanced materials. Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of a tubular heterometallic Pd3Cu6L16 capsule that incorporates Pd(II) and CuL1 metalloligands. This capsule undergoes further modification with two tridentate anionic ligands (L2) to afford a bicapped Pd3Cu6L16L22 capsule with an Edshammer polyhedral structure. By employing transition metal ions, acid, and oxidation agents, the bicapped capsule can be converted into an uncapped one. This uncapped form can then revert back to the bicapped structure on the addition of Br&#8722; ions and a base. Interestingly, introducing Ag+ ions leads to the removal of one L2 ligand from the bicapped capsule, yielding a mono&#8208;capped Pd3Cu6L16L2 structure. Furthermore, the size of the anions critically influences the precise control over the post&#8208;synthetic modifications of the capsules. It was demonstrated that these capsules selectively encapsulate tetrahedral anions, offering a novel approach for the design of intelligent molecular delivery systems.

         <title>F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Dynamic B&#8722;N bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a reversible capture&#8208;release strategy using dynamic B/N Lewis pairs for the construction of stimulus&#8208;responsive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. RTP of the Lewis acid of BrBA can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base of TPAPy and reactivated by dissociation of the B&#8722;N bond to release BrBA. During this process, RTP properties can be regulated by exposure to HCl and NH3.







Abstract
Recently, stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties have attracted significant attention owing to their potential applications in chemical sensing, anticounterfeiting, and displays. However, molecular design currently lacks systematicity and effectiveness. Herein, we report a capture&#8208;release strategy for the construction of reversible RTP via B/N Lewis pairs. Specifically, the RTP of the Lewis acid of 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracene (BrBA) can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base, N,N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)aniline (TPAPy), and reactivated by dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds to release BrBA. Reversible RTP is attributed to the exceptional self&#8208;assembly capability of BrBA, whereas the tunable RTP colors are derived from distinct F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes.

&lt;p&gt;We report a reversible capture-release strategy using dynamic B/N Lewis pairs for the construction of stimulus-responsive room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. RTP of the Lewis acid of BrBA can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base of TPAPy and reactivated by dissociation of the B&#8722;N bond to release BrBA. During this process, RTP properties can be regulated by exposure to HCl and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, stimulus-responsive organic materials with room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties have attracted significant attention owing to their potential applications in chemical sensing, anticounterfeiting, and displays. However, molecular design currently lacks systematicity and effectiveness. Herein, we report a capture-release strategy for the construction of reversible RTP via B/N Lewis pairs. Specifically, the RTP of the Lewis acid of 7-bromo-5,9-dioxa-13b-boranaphtho[3,2,1-de]anthracene (BrBA) can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-diphenyl-4-(pyridin-4-yl)aniline (TPAPy), and reactivated by dissociation of B&#8722;N bonds to release BrBA. Reversible RTP is attributed to the exceptional self-assembly capability of BrBA, whereas the tunable RTP colors are derived from distinct F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes. The potential applications of RTP materials in information storage and anti-counterfeiting were also experimentally validated. The capture-release approach proposed in this study offers an effective strategy for designing stimulus-responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Azo&#8208;free Mitsunobu&#8208;type Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, featuring azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope, is reported. This practical method allows facial enantiospecific coupling of diverse heterepcycles and chiral alcohols. This useful method is readily used in the modification of diverse bioactive natural products and multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.







Abstract
The classic chemical Mitsunobu reaction suffers from the need of excess alcohol activation reagents and the generation of significant by&#8208;products. Efforts to overcome these limitations have resulted in numerous creative solutions, but the substrate scope of these catalytic processes remains limited. Here we report an electrochemical Mitsunobu&#8208;type reaction, which features azo&#8208;free alcohol activation and broad substrate scope. This user&#8208;friendly technology allows a vast collection of heterocycles as the nucleophile, which can couple with a series of chiral cyclic and acyclic alcohols in moderate to high yields and excellent ee's. This practical reaction is scalable, chemoselective, uses simple Electrasyn setup with inexpensive electrodes and requires no precaution to exclude air and moisture. The synthetic utility is further demonstrated on the structural modification of diverse bioactive natural products and pharmaceutical derivatives and its straightforward application in a multiple&#8208;step synthesis of a drug candidate.

         <title>Pt&#8208;Decorated Gold Nanoflares for High&#8208;Fidelity Phototheranostics: Reducing Side&#8208;Effects and Enhancing Cytotoxicity toward Target Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, photodynamic nanoflares constructed on Pt&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Pt PDNF) were communicated to avoid false&#8208;positive therapeutic signals caused by intracellular biothiol. Compared to conventional nanoflares, the Au@Pt PDNF exhibited high&#8208;fidelity theranostics while reducing side&#8208;effects. Furthermore, the Pt&#8208;shell was confirmed to generate oxygen which relieved hypoxia&#8208;related photodynamic resistance and enhanced the antitumor effect.







Abstract
Functionalized with the Au&#8722;S bond, gold nanoflares have emerged as promising candidates for theranostics. However, the presence of intracellular abundantly biothiols compromises the conventional Au&#8722;S bond, leading to the unintended release of cargoes and associated side&#8208;effects on non&#8208;target cells. Additionally, the hypoxic microenvironment in diseased regions limits treatment efficacy, especially in photodynamic therapy. To address these challenges, high&#8208;fidelity photodynamic nanoflares constructed on Pt&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (Au@Pt PDNF) were communicated to avoid false&#8208;positive therapeutic signals and side&#8208;effects caused by biothiol perturbation. Compared with conventional photodynamic gold nanoflares (AuNP PDNF), the Au@Pt PDNF were selectively activated by cancer biomarkers and exhibited high&#8208;fidelity phototheranostics while reducing side&#8208;effects. Furthermore, the ultrathin Pt&#8208;shell catalysis was confirmed to generate oxygen which alleviated hypoxia&#8208;related photodynamic resistance and enhanced the antitumor effect. This design might open a new venue to advance theranostics performance and is adaptable to other theranostic nanomaterials by simply adding a Pt shell.

         <title>A Triply&#8208;Periodic&#8208;Minimal&#8208;Surface Structured Interphase based on Fluorinated Polymers Strengthening High&#8208;energy Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we pioneer the incorporation of Triple Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures into lithium battery designs, successfully aligning safety with energy density&#8208;crucial for advanced electric vehicles. Leveraging the biomimetic design inspired by sea urchin skeletons, TPMS enhances Li+ conductivity and mechanical robustness, curtailing dendrite growth and intrusion. Employing a LiFePO4 cathode at a low N/P ratio of ~3, our approach yields a remarkably low capacity fade rate of just 0.002&#8201;% per cycle at a 1&#8197;C rate. 







Abstract
The challenge of constructing a mechanically robust yet lightweight artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on lithium (Li) anodes highlights a trade&#8208;off between high battery safety and high energy density. Inspired by the intricate microstructure of the white sea urchin, we first develop a polyvinyl fluoride&#8208;hexafluoropropylene (PVDF&#8208;HFP) interfacial layer with a triple periodic minimal surface structure (TPMS) that could offer maximal modulus with minimal weight. This design endows high mechanical strength to an ordered porous structure, effectively reduces local current density, polarization, and internal resistance, and stabilizes the anode interface. At a low N/P ratio of ~3, using LiFePO4 as the cathode, Li anodes protected by TPMS&#8208;structured PVDF&#8208;HFP achieve an extremely low capacity&#8208;fading&#8208;rate of approximately 0.002&#8201;% per cycle over 200 cycles at 1&#8197;C, with an average discharge capacity of 142&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the TPMS porous structure saves 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% of the interfacial layer mass, thereby enhancing the energy density of the battery. The TPMS structure is conducive to large&#8208;scale additive manufacturing, which will provide a reference for the future development of lightweight, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density secondary batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique structural and electronic properties of two one&#8208;dimensional (1D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely COF&#8208;MDA and COF&#8208;ODA, were rationally designed to assess their capabilities in multilevel memory devices. This study further explored the potential of these COF&#8208;based memristors in realizing energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density memory devices, and also showcased their potential for neuromorphic applications for the first time.







Abstract
Memristors are essential components of neuromorphic systems that mimic the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neurons. In this study, a novel approach employing one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (1D COF) films was explored to enhance the performance of memristors. The unique structural and electronic properties of two 1D COF films (COF&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA) and COF&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxydianiline (ODA)) offer advantages for multilevel resistive switching, which is a key feature in neuromorphic computing applications. By further introducing a TiO2 layer on the COF&#8208;ODA film, a built&#8208;in electric field between the COF&#8208;TiO2 interfaces could be generated, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing COFs as a platform for constructing memristors with tunable resistive states. The 1D nanochannels of these COF structures contributed to the efficient modulation of electrical conductance, enabling precise control over synaptic weights in neuromorphic circuits. This study also investigated the potential of these COF&#8208;based memristors to achieve energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density memory devices.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Ethylene Epoxidation by Single Atom Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse single atom Ru&#8208;doped KIr4O8 nanowire catalyst, with electronic structures of adjacent Ir sites being modulated by single Ru atoms, is developed for electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO). It achieves an EO partial current density up to 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of ethylene oxide (EO) using ethylene and water under ambient conditions presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative to existing industrial production process. Yet, the electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation route is currently hindered by largely insufficient activity, EO selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Here we report a single atom Ru&#8208;doped hollandite structure KIr4O8 (KIrRuO) nanowire catalyst for efficient EO production via a chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene epoxidation process. The KIrRuO catalyst exhibits an EO partial current density up to 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0&#8201;%. The impressive electrocatalytic performance towards ethylene epoxidation is ascribed to the modulation of electronic structures of adjacent Ir sites by single Ru atoms, which stabilizes the *CH2CH2OH intermediate and facilitates the formation of active Cl2 species during the generation of 2&#8208;chloroethanol, the precursor of EO. This work provides a single atom modulation strategy for improving the reactivity of adjacent metal sites in heterogeneous electrocatalysts.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Donating Conjugation Effect Modulated Zn2+ Reduction Reaction for Separator&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interphase engineering still requires a thick separator (i.e. glass fiber, 250&#8211;700&#8197;&#956;m) to resist the puncture of inevitable dendrites, which prejudices the energy density of an aqueous battery. We pivot from the traditional interphase plus extra separator categories, proposing an all&#8208;in&#8208;one ligand buffer layer (ca. 20&#8197;&#956;m) to modulate the Zn2+ transfer and deposition behaviors effectively. The catechol groups of the buffer layer can also accelerate the Zn2+ reduction reaction based on their electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;&#960; conjugation effect, decreasing the negative charge in the coordination environment.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs) are attracting extensive attention due to the low cost, high capacity, and environmental benignity of the zinc anode. However, their application is still hindered by the undesired zinc dendrites. Despite Zn&#8208;surface modification being promising in relieving dendrites, a thick separator (i.e. glass fiber, 250&#8211;700&#8197;&#956;m) is still required to resist the dendrite puncture, which limits volumetric energy density of battery. Here, we pivot from the traditional interphase plus extra separator categories, proposing an all&#8208;in&#8208;one ligand buffer layer (ca. 20&#8197;&#956;m) to effectively modulate the Zn2+ transfer and deposition behaviors proved by in situ electrochemical digital holography. Experimental characterizations and density functional theory simulations further reveal that the catechol groups in the buffer layer can accelerate the Zn2+ reduction reaction (ZRR) through the electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;&#960; conjugation effect, decreasing the negative charge in the coordination environment. Without extra separators, the elaborated system endows low polarization below 28.2&#8197;mV, long lifespan of 4950&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in symmetric batteries, and an unprecedented volumetric energy density of 99.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 based on the whole pouch cells. The concomitantly &#8220;separator&#8208;free&#8221; and &#8220;dendrite&#8208;free&#8221; conjugation effect with an accelerated ZRR process could foster the progression of metallic anodes and benefit energetic aqueous batteries.

         <title>Dimeric Giant Molecule Acceptors Featuring N&#8208;type Linker: Enhancing Intramolecular Coupling for High&#8208;Performance Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant molecular acceptors are typically designed with different linkers to tune their intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. Unlike prior approaches using p&#8208;type linkers, here we explore an n&#8208;type linker, notably the benzothiadiazole unit, affording BT&#8208;DL via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation. It exhibits stronger intramolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling compared to its benzene&#8208;linked counterpart, leading to better device efficiency.







Abstract
Giant molecular acceptors (GMAs) are typically designed through the conjugated linking of individual small molecule acceptors (SMAs). This design imparts an extended molecular size, elevating the glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to their SMA counterparts. Consequently, it effectively suppresses the thermodynamic relaxation of the acceptor component when blended with polymer donors to construct stable polymer solar cells (PSCs). Despite their merits, the optimization of their chemical structure for further enhancing of device performance remains challenge. Different from previous reports utilizing p&#8208;type linkers, here, we explore an n&#8208;type linker, specifically the benzothiadiazole unit, to dimerize the SMA units via a click&#8208;like Knoevenagel condensation, affording BT&#8208;DL. In comparison with B&#8208;DL with a benzene linkage, BT&#8208;DL exhibits significantly stronger intramolecular super&#8208;exchange coupling, a desirable property for the acceptor component. Furthermore, BT&#8208;DL demonstrates a higher film absorption coefficient, redshifted absorption, larger crystalline coherence, and higher electron mobility. These inherent advantages of BT&#8208;DL translate into a higher power conversion efficiency of 18.49&#8201;% in PSCs, a substantial improvement over the 9.17&#8201;% efficiency observed in corresponding devices with B&#8208;DL as the acceptor. Notably, the BT&#8208;DL based device exhibits exceptional stability, retaining over 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after enduring 1000&#8197;hours of thermal stress at 90&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides a cost&#8208;effective approach to the synthesis of n&#8208;type linker&#8208;dimerized GMAs, and highlight their potential advantage in enhancing intramolecular coupling for more efficient and durable photovoltaic technologies.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Single&#8208;Copper&#8208;Site Catalysts for Room&#8208;Temperature Benzene Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper single&#8208;atom catalysts (Cu SACs, designated as Cu/NPC) with the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Cu sites on the nitrogen (N)&#8208;phosphorus (P)&#8208;carbon (C) support were synthesized using an in situ phosphorous&#8208;immitting method. The P&#8208;rich coordinated Cu sites of the Cu/NPC were responsible for the direct C&#8722;H activation of benzene to phenol conversion.







Abstract
Crafting single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) that possess &#8220;just right&#8221; modulated electronic and geometric structures, granting accessible active sites for direct room&#8208;temperature benzene oxidation is a coveted objective. However, achieving this goal remains a formidable challenge. Here, we introduce an innovative in situ phosphorus&#8208;immitting strategy using a new phosphorus source (phosphorus nitride, P3N5) to construct the phosphorus&#8208;rich copper (Cu) SACs, designated as Cu/NPC. These catalysts feature locally protruding metal sites on a nitrogen (N)&#8208;phosphorus (P)&#8208;carbon (C) support (NPC). Rigorous analyses, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), validate the coordinated bonding of nitrogen and phosphorus with atomically dispersed Cu sites on NPC. Crucially, systematic first&#8208;principles calculations, coupled with the climbing image nudged&#8208;elastic&#8208;band (CI&#8208;NEB) method, provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of the distorted Cu&#8722;N2P2 centers in Cu/NPC for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol production. Interestingly, Cu/NPC has shown more energetically favorable C&#8722;H bond activation compared to the benchmark Cu/NC SACs in the direct oxidation of benzene, resulting in outstanding benzene conversion (50.3&#8201;%) and phenol selectivity (99.3&#8201;%) at room temperature. Furthermore, Cu/NPC achieves a remarkable turnover frequency of 263&#8197;h&#8722;1 and mass&#8208;specific activity of 35.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art benzene&#8208;to&#8208;phenol conversion catalysts to date.

Crucially, systematic first-principles calculations, coupled with the climbing image nudged-elastic-band (CI-NEB) method, provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure-property-activity relationship of the distorted Cu&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; centers in Cu/NPC for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol production. Interestingly, Cu/NPC has shown more energetically favorable C&#8722;H bond activation compared to the benchmark Cu/NC SACs in the direct oxidation of benzene, resulting in outstanding benzene conversion (50.3&#8201;%) and phenol selectivity (99.3&#8201;%) at room temperature. Furthermore, Cu/NPC achieves a remarkable turnover frequency of 263&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and mass-specific activity of 35.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing the state-of-the-art benzene-to-phenol conversion catalysts to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Modification and Degradation of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented within is a selective electrochemical decarboxylative route to synthesize olefin&#8208;acrylate copolymers by post&#8208;polymerization modification, which are difficult to synthesize by direct polymerization. In addition, the electrochemical decarboxylative methodology provides a targeted approach to the degradation of polymethacrylates. This approach provides an attractive route to the modification and chemical recyclability of polymers.







Abstract
We demonstrate that electrochemical&#8208;induced decarboxylation enables reliable post&#8208;polymerization modification and degradation of polymers. Polymers containing N&#8208;(acryloxy)phthalimides were subjected to electrochemical decarboxylation under mild conditions, which led to the formation of transient alkyl radicals. By installing these redox&#8208;active units, we systematically modified the pendent groups and chain ends of polyacrylates. This approach enabled the production of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) and poly(propylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) copolymers, which are difficult to synthesize by direct polymerization. Spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques reveal these transformations are near&#8208;quantitative on several polymer systems. Electrochemical decarboxylation also enables the degradation of all&#8208;methacrylate poly(N&#8208;(methacryloxy)phthalimide&#8208;co&#8208;methyl methacrylate) copolymers with a degradation efficiency of &gt;95&#8201;%. Chain cleavage is achieved through the decarboxylation of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission of the backbone radical. Electrochemistry is thus shown to be a powerful tool in selective polymer transformations and controlled macromolecular degradation.

         <title>A Conjugated Phenylene Nanocage with a Guest&#8208;Adaptive Deformable Cavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated phenylene nanocage featuring a highly deformable cavity has been constructed from a pliable calix[6]arene moiety and a strained phenylene moiety. The cage contains a guest&#8208;adaptive cavity, the volume of which can expand by as much as 85&#8201;% upon complexation with fullerene guests of different sizes.







Abstract
The highly strained, phenylene&#8208;derived organic cages are typically regarded as very rigid entities, yet their deformation potential and supramolecular properties remain underexplored. Herein, we report a pliable conjugated phenylene nanocage by synergistically merging rigid and flexible building blocks. The anisotropic cage molecule contains branched phenylene chains capped by a calix[6]arene moiety, the delicate conformational changes of which endow the cage with a remarkably deformable cavity. When complexing with fullerene guests, the cage showcases excellent guest&#8208;adaptivity, with its cavity volume capable of swelling by as much as 85&#8201;%.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Strategy Tailoring Molecular Structures of Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DTTP&#8208;ThSO is designed by dual&#8208;strategy method combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering, which can construct six&#8208;membered ring through S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent conformation lock. DTTP&#8208;ThSO exhibits high hole mobility, good energy level matching, and strong defect passivation ability. The dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs achieve an impressive PCE of 23.3&#8201;% with an FF of 82.3&#8201;%, among the highest performance n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs) are ideal materials for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but most current design strategies for tailoring the molecular structures of HTMs are limited to single strategy. Herein, four HTMs based on dithienothiophenepyrrole (DTTP) core are devised through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering. DTTP&#8208;ThSO with ester alkyl chain that can form six&#8208;membered ring by the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent conformation lock with thiophene in the backbone shows good planarity, high&#8208;quality film, matching energy level and high hole mobility, as well as strong defect passivation ability. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3&#8201;% with a nice long&#8208;term stability is achieved by dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs, representing one of the highest values for un&#8208;doped organic HTMs based PSCs. Especially, the fill factor (FF) of 82.3&#8201;% is the highest value for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs to date. Moreover, DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based devices have achieved an excellent PCE of 20.9&#8201;% in large&#8208;area (1.01&#8197;cm2) devices. This work clearly elucidates the structure&#8208;performance relationships of HTMs and offers a practical dual&#8208;strategy approach to designing dopant&#8208;free HTMs for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Induced Formation of Surface Acid Sites on Pt/Al(PO3)3 Enables Remarkably Efficient Hydrogenolysis of C&#8722;O Bonds in Alcohols and Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum metaphosphate&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles have been developed for the hydrogenolysis of a wide range of alcohols and ethers under exceptionally mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;atm of H2, as low as 70&#8201;&#176;C). The key for the high performance of the catalyst is H2&#8208;induced formation of surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites, which efficiently activate C&#8722;O bonds in alcohols and ethers.







Abstract
The hydrogenolysis of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers is central to the biomass valorization and also a valuable transformation in organic synthesis. However, a mild and efficient catalyst system for the hydrogenolysis of a large variety of alcohols and ethers with various functional groups is still underdeveloped. Here, we report an aluminum metaphosphate&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Al(PO3)3) for the hydrogenolysis of a wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl and benzylic alcohols, and dialkyl, aryl alkyl, and diaryl ethers, including biomass&#8208;derived furanic compounds, under mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;atm of H2, as low as 70&#8201;&#176;C). Mechanistic studies suggested that H2 induces formation of the surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites via its cleavage by supported Pt nanoparticles. Accordingly, the high efficiency and the wide applicability of the catalyst system are attributed to the activation and cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds by the hydrogen&#8208;induced Br&#248;nsted acid sites with the assistance of Lewis acidic Al sites on the catalyst surface. The high efficiency of the catalyst implies its potential application in energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization or fine chemical synthesis.

         <title>Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Direct Oxidation of Methane under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers a contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis technique for converting methane to formaldehyde and methanol under ambient conditions, using electrified fluorinated ethylene propylene with water. Achieving high yield of HCHO, this method significantly advances the field of catalysis by efficiently activating methane with reactive oxygen.







Abstract
The conversion of methane under ambient conditions has attracted significant attention. Although advancements have been made using active oxygen species from photo&#8208; and electro&#8208; chemical processes, challenges such as complex catalyst design, costly oxidants, and unwanted byproducts remain. This study exploits the concept of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis, initiating chemical reactions through charge exchange at a solid&#8211;liquid interface, to report a novel process for directly converting methane under ambient conditions. Utilizing the electrification of commercially available Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) with water under ultrasound, we demonstrate how this interaction promote the activation of methane and oxygen molecules. Our results show that the yield of HCHO and CH3OH can reach 467.5 and 151.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1, respectively. We utilized electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) to confirm the evolution of hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) and superoxide radicals (&#8901;OOH). Isotope mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to analyze the elemental origin of CH3OH, which can be further oxidized to HCHO. Additionally, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) simulations to assess the reaction energies of FEP with H2O, O2, and CH4 under these conditions. The implications of this methodology, with its potential applicability to a wider array of gas&#8208;phase catalytic reactions, underscore a significant advance in catalysis.

         <title>Intrinsic RNA Targeting Triggers Indiscriminate DNase Activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the intrinsic RNA&#8208;activated cleavage activity of Cas12a and developed the &#8220;Universal Nuclease for Identification of Virus Empowered by RNA&#8208;Sensing&#8221; (UNIVERSE) assay for protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;free nucleic acid testing with improved specificity. We validated its clinical utility by detecting both HIV RNA and HPV 16 DNA in clinical samples, achieving comparable performance with the PCR/RT&#8208;PCR method.







Abstract
The CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system has emerged as a powerful tool for next&#8208;generation nucleic acid&#8208;based molecular diagnostics. However, it has long been believed to be effective only on DNA targets. Here, we investigate the intrinsic RNA&#8208;enabled trans&#8208;cleavage activity of AsCas12a and LbCas12a and discover that they can be directly activated by full&#8208;size RNA targets, although LbCas12a exhibits weaker trans&#8208;cleavage activity than AsCas12a on both single&#8208;stranded DNA and RNA substrates. Remarkably, we find that the RNA&#8208;activated Cas12a possesses higher specificity in recognizing mutated target sequences compared to DNA activation. Based on these findings, we develop the &#8220;Universal Nuclease for Identification of Virus Empowered by RNA&#8208;Sensing&#8221; (UNIVERSE) assay for nucleic acid testing. We incorporate a T7 transcription step into this assay, thereby eliminating the requirement for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in the target. Additionally, we successfully detect multiple PAM&#8208;less targets in HIV clinical samples that are undetectable by the conventional Cas12a assay based on double&#8208;stranded DNA activation, demonstrating unrestricted target selection with the UNIVERSE assay. We further validate the clinical utility of the UNIVERSE assay by testing both HIV RNA and HPV 16 DNA in clinical samples. We envision that the intrinsic RNA targeting capability may bring a paradigm shift in Cas12a&#8208;based nucleic acid detection and further enhance the understanding of CRISPR&#8208;Cas biochemistry.

         <title>A Fluorous Peptide Amphiphile with Potent Antimicrobial Activity for the Treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced Sepsis and Chronic Wound Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorous peptide amphiphile R6F shows high antibacterial effect via permeabilizing bacteria membrane, disrupting the respiratory reaction and antioxidant defense system of bacteria, and destroying the peptidoglycan in cell wall. R6F was further prepared into lipid nanoparticles and efficiently treated the MRSA&#8208;induced sepsis and wound infections with minimal side effects.







Abstract
The rising prevalence of global antibiotic resistance evokes the urgent need for novel antimicrobial candidates. Cationic lipopeptides have attracted much attention due to their strong antimicrobial activity, broad&#8208;spectrum and low resistance tendency. Herein, a library of fluoro&#8208;lipopeptide amphiphiles was synthesized by tagging a series of cationic oligopeptides with a fluoroalkyl tail via a disulfide spacer. Among the lipopeptide candidates, R6F bearing six arginine moieties and a fluorous tag shows the highest antibacterial activity, and it exhibits an interesting fluorine effect as compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated lipopeptides. The high antibacterial activity of R6F is attributed to its excellent bacterial membrane permeability, which further disrupts the respiratory chain redox stress and cell wall biosynthesis of the bacteria. By co&#8208;assembling with lipid nanoparticles, R6F showed high therapeutic efficacy and minimal adverse effects in the treatment of MRSA&#8208;induced sepsis and chronic wound infection. This work provides a novel strategy to design highly potent antibacterial peptide amphiphiles for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>The Stability of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ion&#8208;Pair Complex Unexpectedly Increases with Increasing Solvent Polarity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The general trend of a decrease in the stability of the Hydrogen(H)&#8208;bonded complexes with an increase in solvent polarity is being challenged in this work for the ion&#8208;pair H&#8208;bonded complexes. Our investigations of the binding free energy show an increase in the stability of the ion&#8208;pair H&#8208;bonded complex with an increase in solvent polarity. The findings are confirmed by experimental NMR, IR and quantum chemical micro&#8208;solvation, slow&#8208;growth molecular dynamics methods.







Abstract
The generally observed decrease of the electrostatic energy in the complex with increasing solvent polarity has led to the assumption that the stability of the complexes with ion&#8208;pair hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing solvent polarity. Besides, the smaller solvent&#8208;accessible surface area (SASA) of the complex in comparison with the isolated subsystems results in a smaller solvation energy of the latter, leading to a destabilization of the complex in the solvent compared to the gas phase. In our study, which combines Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Infrared Spectroscopy experiments, quantum chemical calculations, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we question the general validity of this statement. We demonstrate that the binding free energy of the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex between 2&#8208;fluoropropionic acid and n&#8208;butylamine (CH3CHFCOO&#8722;&#8230;NH3But+) increases with increased solvent polarity. This phenomenon is rationalized by a substantial charge transfer between the subsystems that constitute the ion&#8208;pair hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex. This unexpected finding introduces a new perspective to our understanding of solvation dynamics, emphasizing the interplay between solvent polarity and molecular stability within hydrogen&#8208;bonded systems.

         <title>Stabilizing Diluted Active Sites of Ultrasmall High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics for Efficient Formic Acid Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the synthesis of ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles using sintering&#8208;tolerance dopant elements. The diluted active sites on HEI promote the formic acid oxidation reaction and deliver superior poisoning tolerance due to the weak binding of carbon monoxide intermediates and the sluggish diffusion behavior.







Abstract
The poisoning of undesired intermediates or impurities greatly hinders the catalytic performances of noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, high&#8208;entropy intermetallics i&#8208;(PtPdIrRu)2FeCu (HEI) are constructed to inhibit the strongly adsorbed carbon monoxide intermediates (CO*) during the formic acid oxidation reaction. As probed by multiple&#8208;scaled structural characterizations, HEI nanoparticles are featured with partially negative Pt oxidation states, diluted Pt/Pd/Ir/Ru atomic sites and ultrasmall average size less than 2&#8197;nm. Benefiting from the optimized structures, HEI nanoparticles deliver more than 10&#8197;times promotion in intrinsic activity than that of pure Pt, and well&#8208;enhanced mass activity/durability than that of ternary i&#8208;Pt2FeCu intermetallics counterpart. In situ infrared spectroscopy manifests that both bridge and top CO* are favored on pure Pt but limited on HEI. Further theoretical elaboration indicates that HEI displayed a much weaker binding of CO* on Pt sites and sluggish diffusion of CO* among different sites, in contrast to pure Pt that CO* bound more strongly and was easy to diffuse on larger Pt atomic ensembles. This work verifies that HEIs are promising catalysts via integrating the merits of intermetallics and high&#8208;entropy alloys.

         <title>Abiotic Methane Production Driven by Ubiquitous Non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Type Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We elucidate a ubiquitous yet previously unappreciated source of abiotic CH4 production via non&#8208;Fenton chemistry reactions, which not only substantially broadens CH4 production in complex natural environments, but also offers an innovative, simple and sustainable approach for engineering CH4 production as a high&#8208;value energy resources.







Abstract
Abiotic CH4 production driven by Fenton&#8208;type reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been confirmed to be an indispensable component of the atmospheric CH4 budget. While the chemical reactions independent of Fenton chemistry to ROS are ubiquitous in nature, it remains unknown whether the produced ROS can drive abiotic CH4 production. Here, we first demonstrated the abiotic CH4 production at the soil&#8208;water interface under illumination. Leveraging this finding, polymeric carbon nitrides (CNx) as a typical analogue of natural geobattery material and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a natural methyl donor were used to unravel the underlying mechanisms. We revealed that the ROS, photocatalytically produced by CNx, can oxidize DMSO into CH4 with a high selectivity of 91.5&#8201;%. Such an abiotic CH4 production process was further expanded to various non&#8208;Fenton&#8208;type reaction systems, such as electrocatalysis, pyrocatalysis and sonocatalysis. This work provides insights into the geochemical cycle of abiotic CH4, and offers a new route to CH4 production via integrated energy development.

         <title>Metalloradical Catalysis: General Approach for Controlling Reactivity and Selectivity of Homolytic Radical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloradical catalysis (MRC) represents a versatile approach for controlling reactivity and selectivity in radical chemistry. By harnessing metalloradicals as one&#8208;electron catalysts, MRC facilitates the homolytic activation of substrates, leading to the generation of metal&#8208;entangled organic radicals as pivotal intermediates. The distinctive stepwise radical mechanism in MRC paves the way for innovative advancements in the field of organic synthesis.







Abstract
Since Friedrich W&#246;hler's groundbreaking synthesis of urea in 1828, organic synthesis over the past two centuries has predominantly relied on the exploration and utilization of chemical reactions rooted in two&#8208;electron heterolytic ionic chemistry. While one&#8208;electron homolytic radical chemistry is both rich in fundamental reactivities and attractive with practical advantages, the synthetic application of radical reactions has been long hampered by the formidable challenges associated with the control over reactivity and selectivity of high&#8208;energy radical intermediates. To fully harness the untapped potential of radical chemistry for organic synthesis, there is a pressing need to formulate radically different concepts and broadly applicable strategies to address these outstanding issues. In pursuit of this objective, researchers have been actively developing metalloradical catalysis (MRC) as a comprehensive framework to guide the design of general approaches for controlling over reactivity and stereoselectivity of homolytic radical reactions. Essentially, MRC exploits the metal&#8208;centered radicals present in open&#8208;shell metal complexes as one&#8208;electron catalysts for homolytic activation of substrates to generate metal&#8208;entangled organic radicals as the key intermediates to govern the reaction pathway and stereochemical course of subsequent catalytic radical processes. Different from the conventional two&#8208;electron catalysis by transition metal complexes, MRC operates through one&#8208;electron chemistry utilizing stepwise radical mechanisms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Friedrich W&#246;hler's groundbreaking synthesis of urea in 1828, organic synthesis over the past two centuries has predominantly relied on the exploration and utilization of chemical reactions rooted in two-electron heterolytic ionic chemistry. While one-electron homolytic radical chemistry is both rich in fundamental reactivities and attractive with practical advantages, the synthetic application of radical reactions has been long hampered by the formidable challenges associated with the control over reactivity and selectivity of high-energy radical intermediates. To fully harness the untapped potential of radical chemistry for organic synthesis, there is a pressing need to formulate radically different concepts and broadly applicable strategies to address these outstanding issues. In pursuit of this objective, researchers have been actively developing metalloradical catalysis (MRC) as a comprehensive framework to guide the design of general approaches for controlling over reactivity and stereoselectivity of homolytic radical reactions. Essentially, MRC exploits the metal-centered radicals present in open-shell metal complexes as one-electron catalysts for homolytic activation of substrates to generate metal-entangled organic radicals as the key intermediates to govern the reaction pathway and stereochemical course of subsequent catalytic radical processes. Different from the conventional two-electron catalysis by transition metal complexes, MRC operates through one-electron chemistry utilizing stepwise radical mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This minireview provides a timely review of emerging BSBs in next&#8208;generation energy storage, deciphering their underlying principles, research paradigms, outcomes, and challenges.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale energy storage devices play pivotal roles in effectively harvesting and utilizing green renewable energies (such as solar and wind energy) with capricious nature. Biphasic self&#8208;stratifying batteries (BSBs) have emerged as a promising alternative for grid energy storage owing to their membraneless architecture and innovative battery design philosophy, which holds promise for enhancing the overall performance of the energy storage system and reducing operation and maintenance costs. This minireview aims to provide a timely review of such emerging energy storage technology, including its fundamental design principles, existing categories, and prototype architectures. The challenges and opportunities of this undergoing research topic will also be systematically highlighted and discussed to provide guidance for the subsequent R&amp;D of superior BSBs while conducive to bridging the gap for their future practical application.

         <dc:description>
Dienes are valued for their abundance, ease of preparation, and unique properties, as they play a crucial role in synthesizing complex, bioactive molecules. This review focuses on the past decade's advances and challenges in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving diene substrates, emphasizing their versatility and the emergence of novel reactivity patterns.







Abstract
Dienes have been of great interest to synthetic chemists as valuable substrates due to their abundance and ease of synthesis. Their unique stereoelectronic properties enable broad reactivity with a wide range of transition metals to construct molecular complexity facilitating synthesis of biologically active compounds. In addition, structural diene variation can result in substrate&#8208;controlled reactions, providing valuable mechanistic insights into reactivity and selectivity patterns. The last decade has seen a wealth of new methodologies involving diene substrates through the power of transition metal catalysis. This review summarizes recent advances and remaining opportunities for transition metal&#8208;catalyzed transformations involving dienes.

         <title>Synthetic Peptides: Promising Modalities for the Targeting of Disease&#8208;Related Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acids play pivotal roles in life processes. Their dysregulation is implicated in numerous diseases while therapeutic compounds targeting them remain limited. In this review we focus on synthetic peptides which offer potential solutions for targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes and non&#8208;coding RNAs.







Abstract
DNA and RNA play pivotal roles in life processes by storing and transferring genetic information, modulating gene expression, and contributing to essential cellular machinery such as ribosomes. Dysregulation and mutations in nucleic acid&#8208;related processes are implicated in numerous diseases. Despite the critical impact on health of nucleic acid mutations or dysregulation, therapeutic compounds addressing these biomolecules remain limited. Peptides have emerged as a promising class of molecules for biomedical research, offering potential solutions for challenging drug targets. This review focuses on the use of synthetic peptides to target disease&#8208;related nucleic acids. We discuss examples of peptides targeting double&#8208;stranded DNA, including the clinical candidate Omomyc, and compounds designed for regulatory G&#8208;quadruplexes. Further, we provide insights into both library&#8208;based screenings and the rational design of peptides to target regulatory human RNA scaffolds and viral RNAs, emphasizing the potential of peptides in addressing nucleic acid&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle and Single&#8208;Molecule Characterization of Immobilized Enzymes: A Multiscale Path toward Optimizing Heterogeneous Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the operando characterization of immobilized enzymes at the single&#8208;particle (SP) and single&#8208;molecule (SM) levels reveal valuable information about their functional properties, thus unlocking the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysis for biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Heterogeneous biocatalysis is highly relevant in biotechnology as it offers several benefits and practical uses. To leverage the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysts, the establishment of well&#8208;crafted protocols, and a deeper comprehension of enzyme immobilization on solid substrates are essential. These endeavors seek to optimize immobilized biocatalysts, ensuring maximal enzyme performance within confined spaces. For this aim, multidimensional characterization of heterogeneous biocatalysts is required. In this context, spectroscopic and microscopic methodologies conducted at different space and temporal scales can inform about the intraparticle enzyme kinetics, the enzyme spatial distribution, and the mass transport issues. In this Minireview, we identify enzyme immobilization, enzyme catalysis, and enzyme inactivation as the three main processes for which advanced characterization tools unveil fundamental information. Recent advances in operando characterization of immobilized enzymes at the single&#8208;particle (SP) and single&#8208;molecule (SM) levels inform about their functional properties, unlocking the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysis toward biotechnological applications.

         <title>A High&#8208;Yielding Active Template Click Reaction (AT&#8722;CuAAC) for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precursor to a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine embedded [9]cycloparaphenylene (bipy[9]CPP) has been used to generate mechanically interlocked [2]rotaxane molecules in high yield through an active template azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8722;CuAAC) reaction. These [2]rotaxanes then serve as key intermediates to nanohoop[2]catenane structures.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) represent an exciting yet underexplored area of research in the context of carbon nanoscience. Recently, work from our group and others has shown that small carbon nanotube fragments&#8212;[n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related nanohoop macrocycles&#8212;may be integrated into mechanically interlocked architectures by leveraging supramolecular interactions, covalent tethers, or metal&#8208;ion templates. Still, available synthetic methods are typically difficult and low yielding, and general methods that allow for the creation of a wide variety of these structures are limited. Here we report an efficient route to interlocked nanohoop structures via the active template Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8722;CuAAC) reaction. With the appropriate choice of substituents, a macrocyclic precursor to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl embedded [9]CPP (bipy[9]CPP) participates in the AT&#8722;CuAAC reaction to provide [2]rotaxanes in near&#8208;quantitative yield, which can then be converted into the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated catenane structures. Through this approach, two nanohoop[2]catenanes are synthesized which consist of a bipy[9]CPP catenated with either Tz[10]CPP or Tz[12]CPP (where Tz denotes a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety replacing one phenylene ring in the [n]CPP backbone).

         <title>A Vitrimer Acts as a Compatibilizer for Polyethylene and Polypropylene Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer can compatibilize a polymer blend. By adding a relatively small amount of a vitrimer made of siloxane&#8208;crosslinked high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), we successfully compatibilized unmodified HDPE and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend exhibited enhanced elongation at break (120&#8201;%) and smaller iPP domain sizes (0.4&#8197;&#956;m) compared to the control blend (22&#8201;% elongation at break, 0.9&#8197;&#956;m iPP droplet size).







Abstract
Polymer compatibilization plays a critical role in achieving polymer blends with favorable mechanical properties and enabling efficient recycling of mixed plastic wastes. Nonetheless, traditional compatibilization methods often require tailored designs based on the specific chemical compositions of the blends. In this study, we propose a new approach for compatibilizing polymer blends using a dynamically crosslinked polymer network, known as vitrimers. By adding a relatively small amount (1&#8211;5&#8197;w/w%) of a vitrimer made of siloxane&#8208;crosslinked high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), we successfully compatibilized unmodified HDPE and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend exhibited enhanced elongation at break (120&#8201;%) and smaller iPP domain sizes (0.4&#8197;&#956;m) compared to the control blend (22&#8201;% elongation at break, 0.9&#8197;&#956;m iPP droplet size). Moreover, the vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend showed significantly improved microphase stability during annealing at 180&#8201;&#176;C. This straightforward method shows promise for applications across various polymer blend systems.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pallamolides A&#8722;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential Michael addition reactions formed the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core of pallamolides A&#8722;E in the first total synthesis of these densely functionalized natural products. The approach also featured a SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization to generate the oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade to assemble the tetracyclic skeleton of the pallamolides.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E. Of these compounds, pallamolides B&#8722;E possess intriguing tetracyclic skeletons with novel intramolecular transesterifications. Key transformations include highly diastereoselective sequential Michael addition reactions to construct the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core with the simultaneous generation of two quaternary carbon centers, a one&#8208;pot SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization/ketone reduction to generate the key oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety, and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade sequence to assemble the tetracyclic pallamolide skeleton. Kinetic resolution of ketone 14 through Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata reduction enabled the asymmetric synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E.

         <title>Heterodyne&#8208;Detected Sum&#8208;Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Aqueous Molecular Structure at the Suspended Graphene/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using surface&#8208;specific HD&#8208;SFG vibrational spectroscopy, we examine water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface, finding that the SFG response mainly arises from the topmost 1&#8211;2&#8197;water layers, with minimal contribution from the graphene itself. Graphene weakly interacts with the interfacial water by lowering the vibrational frequency of the dangling O&#8722;H group, with a very slight impact on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;H group.







Abstract
Graphene, a transparent two&#8208;dimensional conductive material, has brought extensive new perspectives and prospects to various aqueous technological systems, such as desalination membranes, chemical sensors, energy storage, and energy conversion devices. Yet, the molecular&#8208;level details of graphene in contact with aqueous electrolytes, such as water orientation and hydrogen bond structure, remain elusive or controversial. Here, we employ surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) vibrational spectroscopy to re&#8208;examine the water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface. We compare the response from the air/graphene/water system to that from the air/water interface. Our results indicate that the 
 spectrum recorded from the air/graphene/water system arises from the topmost 1&#8211;2&#8197;water layers in contact with the graphene, with the graphene itself not generating a significant SFG response. Compared to the air/water interface response, the presence of monolayer graphene weakly affects the interfacial water. Graphene weakly affects the dangling O&#8722;H group, lowering its frequency through its interaction with the graphene sheet, and has a very small effect on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;H group. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm our experimental observation. Our work provides molecular insight into the interfacial structure at a suspended graphene/water interface, relevant to various technological applications of graphene.

Enhance immune&#8208;killing: A ultra&#8208;galactocation to sialic acid strategy is designed by using a penta&#8208;functional dendritic probe (Den@5F) to simultaneously block sialic acid and hugely introduce galactose on tumor cells in vivo for the enhancement of immune&#8208;killing.







Abstract
Glycans on tumor cell surface have significant impacts in the immune&#8208;killing process. Here an ultra&#8208;galactocation to sialic acid (Sia) strategy is designed to hugely introduce galactose (Gal) to Sia and on tumor cells in vivo by using a penta&#8208;functional dendritic probe (Den@5F), which efficiently enhances the immune&#8208;killing of tumor cells. The Den@5F contains five different kinds of functional groups, including Gal, Cy5, amino, phenylboronic acid (PBA) and 4&#8208;(4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;nitrophenoxy) butanoate (mNB), which can be conveniently prepared through a two&#8208;step reaction. After injecting into the tumor&#8208;bearing mouse, Den@5F can efficiently block Sia through the specific recognition between PBA and Sia on tumor cells and hugely introduce Gal through the subsequent photo&#8208;crosslinking between mNB and amino groups to multiply conjugate excessive Den@5Fs. The comprehensively blocked Sia can prevent the immune escape, and the hugely introduced Gal can promote the immune stimulation of the immune cells, which lead to an efficient enhancement of the immune&#8208;killing. The proposed strategy provides a significant and promising tool to promote the clinical immunotherapy of tumor.

The intrinsic instability of dynamic covalent bonds in vitrimers leads to an inherent propensity for creep. A catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;acetyl cinnamate/acetoacetate exchange reaction featuring high energy barrier in bulk was developed, enabling the production of vitrimers with high creep resistance and reprocessability.







Abstract
Vitrimers represent an emerging class of polymeric materials that combine the desirable characteristics of both thermoplastics and thermosets achieved through the design of dynamic covalent bonds within the polymer networks. However, these materials are prone to creep due to the inherent instability of dynamic covalent bonds. Consequently, there are pressing demands for the development of robust and stable dynamic covalent chemistries. Here, we report a catalyst&#8208;free &#945;&#8208;acetyl cinnamate/acetoacetate (&#945;&#8208;AC/A) exchange reaction to develop vitrimers with remarkable creep resistance. Small&#8208;molecule model studies revealed that the &#945;&#8208;AC/A exchange occurred at temperatures above 140&#8201;&#176;C in bulk, whereas at 120&#8201;&#176;C, this reaction was absent. For demonstration in the case of polymers, copolymers derived from common vinyl monomers were crosslinked with terephthalaldehyde to produce &#945;&#8208;AC/A vitrimers with tunable thermal and mechanical performance. All resulting &#945;&#8208;AC/A vitrimers exhibited high stability, especially in terms of creep resistance at 120&#8201;&#176;C, while retaining commendable reprocessability when subjected to high temperatures. This work showcases the &#945;&#8208;AC/A exchange reaction as a novel and robust dynamic covalent chemistry capable of imparting both reprocessability and high stability to cross&#8208;linked networks.

         <title>Droplet&#8208;Based Microfluidics Reveals Insights into Cross&#8208;Coupling Mechanisms over Single&#8208;Atom Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing recyclable heterogeneous catalysts for organic synthesis requires a deep understanding of active site architectures during surface&#8208;catalyzed reactions. Our approach, combining in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and droplet&#8208;based microfluidics, investigates Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling over palladium single&#8208;atoms on carbon nitride. The results highlight the need for distinct design criteria compared to traditional homogeneously catalyzed processes.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) hold promise as sustainable alternatives to metal complexes in organic transformations. However, their working structure and dynamics remain poorly understood, hindering advances in their design. Exploiting the unique features of droplet&#8208;based microfluidics, we present the first in&#8208;situ assessment of a palladium SAC based on exfoliated carbon nitride in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results confirm a surface&#8208;catalyzed mechanism, revealing the distinct electronic structure of active Pd centers compared to homogeneous systems, and providing insights into the stabilizing role of ligands and bases. This study establishes a valuable framework for advancing mechanistic understanding of organic syntheses catalyzed by SACs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Heme Iron Enzymes Catalyze Heterobicyclic and Spirocyclic Isoquinolone Core Formation in Piperazine Alkaloid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of newly identified alkaloids featuring unique heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, arizonamides and arizolidines, has been characterized. Notably, the non&#8208;heme iron enzyme ParG demonstrated catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction. This study has elucidated efficient strategies used by Nature to construct complex multicyclic heterocycle scaffolds.







Abstract
We report the discovery and biosynthesis of new piperazine alkaloids&#8208;arizonamides, and their derived compounds&#8208;arizolidines, featuring heterobicyclic and spirocyclic isoquinolone skeletons, respectively. Their biosynthetic pathway involves two crucial non&#8208;heme iron enzymes, ParF and ParG, for core skeleton construction. ParF has a dual function facilitating 2,3&#8208;alkene formation of helvamide, as a substrate for ParG, and oxidative cleavage of piperazine. Notably, ParG exhibits catalytic versatility in multiple oxidative reactions, including cyclization and ring reconstruction. A key amino acid residue Phe67 was characterized to control the formation of the constrained arizonamide B backbone by ParG.

A concise synthetic approach to mugineic acid and 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was established. Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8722;N bonds without redox reactions. Mugineic acid was synthesized on a gram scale, and the dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were taken up by oocytes overexpressing transporters ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human).

Unlike all other synthetic methods, this approach utilized epoxide ring&#8208;opening reactions to form two C&#8722;N bonds and is characterized by the absence of redox reactions. Mugineic acid was synthesized from three readily available fragments on a gram scale in 6 steps. The protected 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxynicotianamine was also synthesized in 4 steps, and the dansyl group, serving as a fluorophore, was introduced through a click reaction after propargylation of the 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy group. The dansyl&#8208;labeled nicotianamine (NA) iron complexes were internalized by oocytes overexpressing ZmYS1 (from maize) or PAT1 (from human) transporters, indicating successful transport of the synthesized NA&#8208;probe through these transporters.

         <dc:description>
Based on a computer&#8208;aided ligand design, the first chiral Os(II)/Salox catalytic system is realized to address the appealing yet challenging asymmetric &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of dioxazolones with precise site&#8208;/enantioselectivity control and diverse functionality. The catalytic energy profile and the chiral induction mode of the developed chiral Os(II)/Salox system are also further clarified by integrated experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
Herein, multiple types of chiral Os(II) complexes have been designed to address the appealing yet challenging asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, among which the Os(II)/Salox species is found to be the most efficient for precise stereocontrol in realizing the asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation. As exemplified by the enantioenriched pyrrolidinone synthesis, such tailored Os(II)/Salox catalyst efficiently enables an intramolecular site&#8208;/enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation in the &#947;&#8208;position of dioxazolone substrates, in which benzyl, propargyl and allyl groups bearing various substituted forms are well compatible, affording the corresponding chiral &#947;&#8208;lactam products with good er values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and diverse functionality (&gt;35&#8197;examples). The unique performance advantage of the developed chiral Os(II)/Salox system in terms of the catalytic energy profile and the chiral induction has been further clarified by integrated experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Synthesis and Structure of Protonated Sulfur Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hemi&#8208; and monoprotonated SO2 cations have been isolated as Sb2F11&#8722; salts. The preparation of the salts was achieved by recrystallization of [FS(OH)2][SbF6] in weakly basic, aprotic solvents at low temperatures. The elusive structures of both cationic species have been investigated by X&#8208;ray structure analysis and Raman spectroscopy.







Abstract
Salts of protonated sulfur dioxide were synthesized by recrystallization of [FS(OX)2][SbF6] (X=H, D) in aprotic solvents at low temperatures. Hemiprotonated sulfur dioxide [(SO2)2H][Sb2F11] was obtained from the solvent SO2 and the monoprotonated sulfur dioxide [OSOD][Sb2F11], using 1,1,1,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethane as solvent. For both compounds, single crystals were obtained and an X&#8208;ray structure analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the salts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and the results were discussed together with quantum chemical calculations on the M06&#8208;2X/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory.

         <title>Light&#8208;Regulated Nucleation for Growing Highly Uniform Single&#8208;Crystalline Microrods</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of light&#8208;regulated nuclei generation as seeds for living self&#8208;assembly is presented, which is in contrast to conventional methods of restricting spontaneous nucleation and adding seeds. By simply increasing photoirradiation duration or intensity, the number of nuclei can be produced in a controlled manner, thus yielding uniform microrods of varying sizes through seeded growth.







Abstract
We report a light&#8208;irradiation method to control the synchronous nucleation of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) fluorophore for growing highly uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods, which is in sharp contrast to the prevailing methods of restricting spontaneous nucleation and additionally adding seeds. The D&#8208;A fluorophore was observed to undergo photoinduced electron transfer to CrCl3, leading to the generation of HCl and the subsequent protonation of the D&#8208;A fluorophore. By intensifying photoirradiation or prolonging its duration, the concentration of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores can be rapidly increased to a high supersaturation level. This results in the formation of a controlled number of nuclei in a synchronous manner, which in turn kickstart the epitaxial growth of protonated D&#8208;A fluorophores towards uniform single&#8208;crystalline microrods of controlled sizes. The light&#8208;regulated synchronous nucleation and uniform growth of microrods are a unique phenomenon that can only be achieved by specific Lewis acids, making it a novel probing method for sensitively detecting strong Lewis acids such as chromium chloride.

         <title>Simultaneous Inside and Outside Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with positively charged disulfide macrocycles has led to a unique material, in which the SWCNTs are decorated from the outside with macrocycles and on the inside contain polyiodide chains. The wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of such SWCNT peapod materials is an important step toward uses that require macroscopic amounts.







Abstract
Functionalizing single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a robust way that does not affect the sp2 carbon framework is a considerable research challenge. Here we describe how triiodide salts of positively charged macrocycles can be used not only to functionalize SWCNTs from the outside, but simultaneously from the inside. We employed disulfide exchange in aqueous solvent to maximize the solvophobic effect and therefore achieve a high degree of macrocycle immobilization. Characterization by Raman spectroscopy, EDX&#8208;STEM and HR&#8208;TEM clearly showed that serendipitously this wet&#8208;chemical functionalization procedure also led to the encapsulation of polyiodide chains inside the nanotubes. The resulting three&#8208;shell composite materials are redox&#8208;active and experience an intriguing interplay of electrostatic, solvophobic and mechanical effects that could be of interest for applications in energy storage.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of the [NCCCO]&#8722; Cyanoketenate Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of the fundamental cyanoketenate anion from the functionalization of CO with simple reagents in &gt;90&#8201;% yields on a multigram scale. The reactivity with electrophiles is explored, which lead to dimeric products. The neutral cyanoketene, which is actively being sought in the interstellar medium, could also be isolated stabilized by a carbene.







Abstract
Cyanoketene is a fundamental molecule that is actively being searched for in the interstellar medium. Its deprotonated form (cyanoketenate) is a heterocumulene that is isoelectronic to carbon suboxide whose structure has been the subject of debate. However, the investigation of cyanoketene and its derivatives is hampered by the lack of practical synthetic routes to these compounds. We report the first synthesis of the cyanoketenate anion in [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][NCCCO] (1) as a stable molecule on a multigram scale in excellent yields (&gt;90&#8201;%). The structure of this molecule is probed crystallographically and computationally. We also explore the protonation of 1, and its reaction with triphenylsilylchloride and carbon dioxide. In all cases, anionic dimers are formed. The cyanoketene could be synthesized and crystallographically characterized when stabilized by a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. The cyanoketenate is a very useful unsaturated building block containing N, C and O atoms that can now be explored with relative ease and will undoubtedly unlock more interesting reactivity.

         <title>Alkyl&#8211;&#960; Functional Molecular Gels: Control of Elastic Modulus and Improvement of Electret Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the development of alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gels (FMGs), in which the addition of a 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator can increase the elastic modulus of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Furthermore, gelation improved the performance of mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices compared to liquid&#8208;based ones.







Abstract
The development of optoelectronically&#8208;active soft materials is drawing attention to the application of soft electronics. A room&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free liquid obtained by modifying a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with flexible yet bulky alkyl chains is a promising functional soft material. Tuning the elastic modulus (G&#8242;) is essential for employing optoelectronically&#8208;active alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids in deformable devices. However, the range of G&#8242; achieved through the molecular design of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids is limited. We report herein a method for controlling G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by gelation. Adding 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator formed the alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gel (FMG) and increased G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Because alkyl&#8211;&#960; FMGs have functional &#960;&#8208;moieties in the gel medium, this new class of gels has a much higher content of &#960;&#8208;moieties of up to 59&#8197;wt&#8201;% compared to conventional &#960;&#8208;gels of only a few wt&#8201;%. More importantly, the gel state has a 23&#8201;% higher charge&#8208;retention capacity than the liquid, providing better performance in deformable mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices. The strategy used in this study is a novel approach for developing next&#8208;generation optoelectronically&#8208;active FMG materials.

Tuning the elastic modulus (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;) is essential for employing optoelectronically-active alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids in deformable devices. However, the range of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&#8242; achieved through the molecular design of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids is limited. We report herein a method for controlling &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by gelation. Adding 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% low-molecular-weight gelator formed the alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gel (FMG) and increased &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Because alkyl&#8211;&#960; FMGs have functional &#960;-moieties in the gel medium, this new class of gels has a much higher content of &#960;-moieties of up to 59&#8197;wt&#8201;% compared to conventional &#960;-gels of only a few wt&#8201;%. More importantly, the gel state has a 23&#8201;% higher charge-retention capacity than the liquid, providing better performance in deformable mechanoelectric generator-electret devices. The strategy used in this study is a novel approach for developing next-generation optoelectronically-active FMG materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rim&#8208;Based Binding of Perfluorinated Acids to Pillararenes Purifies Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8722;P5s) show unprecedent binding towards perfluoroalkyl acids with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 ratio and K&#8805;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment shows that DAF&#8722;P5s immobilized on silica can purify perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) polluted water down to 13&#8197;ng/L.







Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a rapidly increasing global problem as their widespread use and high stability lead worldwide to water contamination, with significant detrimental health effects.[1] Supramolecular chemistry has been invoked to develop materials geared towards the specific capture of PFAS from water,[2] to reduce the concentration below advisory safety limits (e.g., 70&#8197;ng/L for the sum of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA). Scale&#8208;up and use in natural waters with high PFAS concentrations has hitherto posed a problem. Here we report a new type of host&#8211;guest interaction between deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8722;P5s) and perfluoroalkyl acids. DAF&#8722;P5 complexes show an unprecedented 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 stoichiometry, as confirmed by isothermal calorimetry and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies, and high binding constants (up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1) to various polyfluoroalkyl acids. In addition, non&#8208;fluorinated acids do not hamper this process significantly. Immobilization of DAF&#8722;P5s allows a simple single&#8208;time filtration of PFAS&#8208;contaminated water to reduce the PFOS/PFOA concentration 106&#8197;times to 15&#8211;50&#8197;ng/L level. The effective and fast (&lt;5&#8197;min) orthogonal binding to organic molecules without involvement of fluorinated supramolecular hosts, high breakthrough capacity (90&#8197;mg/g), and robust performance (&gt;10&#8197;regeneration cycles without decrease in performance) set a new benchmark in PFAS&#8208;absorbing materials.

         <title>Dynamic Entwined Topology in Helical Covalent Polymers Dictated by Competing Supramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies have uncovered a metal&#8208;coordinated helical covalent polymer (m&#8208;HCP), where the polymer chains intertwine through metal coordination bonds. The reticulation of this entwining topology is illustrated through the incorporation of sodium and potassium ions. Furthermore, ion exchange can lead to a hydrogen&#8208;bonded HCP undergoing conversion into the m&#8208;HCP structure.







Abstract
Naturally occurring polymeric structures often consist of 1D polymer chains intricately folded and entwined through non&#8208;covalent bonds, adopting precise topologies crucial for their functionality. The exploration of crystalline 1D polymers through dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) and supramolecular interactions represents a novel approach for developing crystalline polymers. This study shows that sub&#8208;angstrom differences in the counter&#8208;ion size can lead to various helical covalent polymer (HCP) topologies, including a novel metal&#8208;coordination HCP (m&#8208;HCP) motif. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis of HCP&#8722;Na revealed that double helical pairs are formed by sodium ions coordinating to spiroborate linkages to form rectangular pores. The double helices are interpenetrated by the unreacted diols coordinating sodium ions. The reticulation of the m&#8208;HCP structure was demonstrated by the successful synthesis of HCP&#8722;K. Finally, ion&#8208;exchange studies were conducted to show the interconversion between HCP structures. This research illustrates how seemingly simple modifications, such as changes in counter&#8208;ion size, can significantly influence the polymer topology and determine which supramolecular interactions dominate the crystal lattice.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Regulated Synthetic Channels: Enabling Reversible Ion Transport by Modulating the Ion&#8208;Permeation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible redox&#8208;regulated ion transport has been achieved by rebuilding the gating module of natural redox&#8208;regulated channel proteins within an artificial system. The disulfide bonds in these artificial channels can serve as redox&#8208;tunable switches to regulate the formation and disruption of ion&#8208;permeation pathways, thereby achieving a transition of the transmembrane transport process between ON and OFF states.







Abstract
Natural redox&#8208;regulated channel proteins often utilize disulfide bonds as redox sensors for adaptive regulation of channel conformations in response to diverse physiological environments. In this study, we developed novel synthetic ion channels capable of reversibly switching their ion&#8208;transport capabilities by incorporating multiple disulfide bonds into artificial systems. X&#8208;ray structural analysis and electrophysiological experiments demonstrated that these disulfide&#8208;bridged molecules possess well&#8208;defined tubular cavities and can be efficiently inserted into lipid bilayers to form artificial ion channels. More importantly, the disulfide bonds in these molecules serve as redox&#8208;tunable switches to regulate the formation and disruption of ion&#8208;permeation pathways, thereby achieving a transition in the transmembrane transport process between the ON and OFF states.

         <title>The Cyanoketenyl Anion [NC3O]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 20, May 13, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and gram&#8208;scale isolation of the elusive cyanoketenyl anion [NC3O]&#8722; is reported. Despite its cumulene&#8208;like structure, it exhibits a bent geometry in the solid state, which is also confirmed by computational studies. The cyanoketenyl anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules such as CO2, H2O or NH3 to form more complex organic compounds, including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate.







Abstract
Cumulenes and heterocumulenes with three or more cumulative multiple bonds are usually reactive species that serve as valuable building blocks for more complex molecules but tend to isomerize or cyclize and therefore are difficult to isolate. Using a mild ligand exchange reaction at the carbon in &#945;&#8208;metalated ylides, we have now succeeded in the synthesis and gram&#8208;scale isolation of the elusive cyanoketenyl anion [NC3O]&#8722;. Despite its assumed cumulene&#8208;like structure and the delocalization of the negative charge across the whole 5&#8208;atom molecule, it features a bent geometry with a nucleophilic central carbon atom. Computational studies reveal an ambiguous bonding situation in the anion, which can be illustrated only by a combination of different resonance structures. Nonetheless, the anion features remarkable stability, thus allowing the storage of its potassium&#8208;crown ether salt and its application as a highly functional synthetic building block. The cyanoketenyl anion readily reacts with a series of small molecules to form more complex organic compounds, including industrially valuable compounds such as cyanoacetate. This work demonstrated that reactive species can be generated by novel synthesis methods and open up atom&#8208;economic pathways to complex compounds from small abundant molecules.

         <title>Tailoring Electric Double Layer by Cation Specific Adsorption for High&#8208;voltage Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interfacial instability of high&#8208;nickel layered oxides severely plagues practical application of high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a uniform and highly oxidation&#8208;resistant polymer layer within inner Helmholtz plane is engineered by in&#8208;situ polymerizing 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;ethylimidazolium (VEIM) cations preferentially adsorbed on LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM83) surface, inducing formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with fast interfacial kinetics. Meanwhile, the copolymerization of [VEIM][BF4] and vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC) endows P(VEC&#8208;IL) copolymer with the positively&#8208;charged imidazolium moieties, providing positive electric fields to facilitate Li+ transport and desolvation process. Consequently, the Li||NCM83 cells with a cut&#8208;off voltage up to 4.5 V exhibit excellent reversible capacity of 130 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 25 &#176;C and considerable discharge capacity of 134 mAh g&#8722;1 without capacity decay within 100 cycles at &#8722;20 &#176;C. This work provides deep understanding on tailoring electric double layer by cation specific adsorption for high&#8208;voltage quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Allyl&#8208;Allyl Coupling Promoted by Catalyst Systems with two Palladium Atoms &#8211; A Plethora of Potentially Pericyclic Processes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, Huang and co&#8208;workers reported a catalytic reaction that utilizes H2 as the sole reductant for a C&#8208;C coupling of allyl groups with yields up to 96%. Here we use computational quantum chemistry to identify several key features of this reaction that provide clarity on how it proceeds. We propose the involvement of a precatalyst Pd&#8208;Pd bound dimer, demonstrate the importance of ligand &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and counterions, and identify a new, energetically viable, mechanism involving two dimerized, outer&#8208;sphere reductive elimination transition structures that determine both the rate and selectivity. Although we rule out the previously proposed transmetalation step on energetic grounds, we show it to have an unusual aromatic transition structure in which two Pd atoms support rearranging electrons. The prevalence of potential metal&#8208;supported pericyclic reactions in this system suggests that one should consider such processes regularly, but the results of our calculations also indicate that one should do so with caution.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Spin Density using TEMPOL Molecules for Enhanced CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion by HKUST&#8208;1 Framework Derived Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selectivity of multicarbon products in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the spin alignment of neighboring active sites, which requires a spin catalyst that facilitates electron transfer with antiparallel spins for enhanced C&#8208;C coupling. Here, we design a radical&#8208;contained spin catalyst (TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1) to enhance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene conversion, in which spin&#8208;disordered (SDO) and spin&#8208;ordered (SO) phases co&#8208;exist to construct an asymmetric spin configuration of neighboring active sites. The replacement of axially coordinated H2O molecules with TEMPOL radicals introduces spin&#8208;spin interactions among the Cu(II) centers to form localized SO phases within the original H2O&#8208;mediated SDO phases. Therefore, TEMPOL@HKUST&#8208;1 derived catalyst exhibited an approximately two&#8208;fold enhancement in ethylene selectivity during the CO2RR at &#8208;1.8&#8201;V versus Ag/AgCl compared to pristine HKUST&#8208;1. In situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS spectra indicate that the spin configuration at asymmetric SO/SDO sites significantly reduces the kinetic barrier for *CO intermediate dimerization toward the ethylene product. The performance of the spin catalyst is further improved by spin alignment under a magnetic field, resulting in a maximum ethylene selectivity of more than 50%. The exploration of the spin&#8208;polarized kinetics of the CO2RR provides a promising path for the development of novel spin electrocatalysts with superior performance.</dc:description>

Here, we design a radical-contained spin catalyst (TEMPOL@HKUST-1) to enhance CO2-to-ethylene conversion, in which spin-disordered (SDO) and spin-ordered (SO) phases co-exist to construct an asymmetric spin configuration of neighboring active sites. The replacement of axially coordinated H2O molecules with TEMPOL radicals introduces spin-spin interactions among the Cu(II) centers to form localized SO phases within the original H2O-mediated SDO phases. Therefore, TEMPOL@HKUST-1 derived catalyst exhibited an approximately two-fold enhancement in ethylene selectivity during the CO2RR at -1.8&#8201;V versus Ag/AgCl compared to pristine HKUST-1. In situ ATR-SEIRAS spectra indicate that the spin configuration at asymmetric SO/SDO sites significantly reduces the kinetic barrier for *CO intermediate dimerization toward the ethylene product. The performance of the spin catalyst is further improved by spin alignment under a magnetic field, resulting in a maximum ethylene selectivity of more than 50%.

         <title>Giant ab&#8208;Plane Birefringence in Quasi&#8208;1D Fibrous Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) van der Waals crystal fibrous red phosphorus (RP) exhibits pronounced in&#8208;plane optical anisotropy, positioning it as a potential candidate for polarization&#8208;related micro&#8208;nano devices. Unfortunately, a comprehensive investigation into the complex refractive index of fibrous RP and the structure&#8208;activity relationship connecting the distinctive quasi&#8208;1D structure with optical anisotropy is currently deficient. Herein, we have collectively determined the complex refractive index of the fibrous RP flakes within the ab&#8208;plane through Kramers&#8211;Kronig (KK) analysis and theoretical calculation. Notably, the maximum birefringence of fibrous RP reaches 0.642@475 nm with an absolute extinction coefficient of only 0.08, superior to the reported traditional optical crystals and the emerging low&#8208;dimensional materials as well. The remarkable birefringence can be attributed to the synergistic influence of the large electronic dipole polarizability, anisotropic electron density distribution and the distortion of stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP).&#160;This work demonstrates the potential of fibrous RP for polarization&#8208;sensitive devices, illuminating possibilities to exploit novel giant birefringent crystals based on the structure&#8208;activity relationship.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving a Deeply Desodiated Stabilized Cathode Material by the High Entropy Strategy for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manganese&#8208;based layered oxides are currently of significant interest as cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their low toxicity and high specific capacity. However, the practical applications are impeded by sluggish intrinsic Na+ migration and poor structure stability as a result of Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and complicated phase transition. In this study, a high&#8208;entropy strategy is proposed to enhance the high&#8208;voltage capacity and cycling stability. The designed P2&#8208;Na0.67Mn0.6Cu0.08Ni0.09Fe0.18Ti0.05O2 achieves a deeply desodiation and delivers charging capacity of 158.1 mA h g&#8208;1 corresponding to 0.61 Na with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 98.2%. The charge compensation is attributed to the cationic and anionic redox reactions conjunctively. Moreover, the crystal structure is effectively stabilized, leading to a slight variation of lattice parameters. This research carries implications for the expedited development of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

To address these issues, herein, we report an innovative non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design strategy that leverages an optimal moderate solvation phosphate&#8208;based solvent which strikes a balance between solvation capability and salt dissociation ability, leading to superior electrochemical performance. The formulated electrolyte simultaneously exhibits the advantages of low salt concentration (only 0.6 M), low viscosity, high ionic conductivity, high oxidative stability, and safety. Our electrolyte also promotes the formation of self&#8208;limiting inorganic&#8208;rich interphases at the anode surface, alongside robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase on iron&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues, mitigating electrode/electrolyte side reactions and preventing Fe dissolution. Notably, the PIBs employing our electrolyte exhibit exceptional durability, with 80% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at high&#8208;voltage of 4.2 V in a coin cell. Impressively, in a larger scale pouch cell, it maintains over 81% of its initial capacity after 1,400 cycles at 1C&#8208;rate with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. This work represents a significant advancement toward the realization of safe, sustainable, and high&#8208;performance PIBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hybrid metal halides are an extraordinary class of optoelectronic materials with extensive applications.

         <title>Deciphering Anion&#8208;Modulated Solvation Structure for Calcium Intercalation into Graphite for Ca&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrostatic interactions between Ca ions and anions can regulate the solvated&#8208;Ca&#8208;ion configurations in the dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolytes, which govern the Ca ion storage capacities and reaction kinetics for graphite anodes in Ca ion batteries.







Abstract
Co&#8208;intercalation reactions make graphite a feasible anode in Ca ion batteries, yet the correlation between Ca ion intercalation behaviors and electrolyte structure remains unclear. This study, for the first time, elucidates the pivotal role of anions in modulating the Ca ion solvation structures and their subsequent intercalation into graphite. Specifically, the electrostatic interactions between Ca ion and anions govern the configurations of solvated&#8208;Ca&#8208;ion in dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolytes and graphite intercalation compounds. Among the anions considered (BH4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, TFSI&#8722; and [B(hfip)4]&#8722;), the coordination of four solvent molecules per Ca ion (CN=4) leads to the highest reversible capacities and the fastest reaction kinetics in graphite. Our study illuminates the origins of the distinct Ca ion intercalation behaviors across various anion&#8208;modulated electrolytes, employing a blend of experimental and theoretical approaches. Importantly, the practical viability of graphite anodes in Ca&#8208;ion full cells is confirmed, showing significant promise for advanced energy storage systems.

         <title>Mechanistic Approach Toward the C4&#8208;Selective Amination of Pyridines via Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored pyridine reagents undergo nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH) reactions with activated pyridines to afford pyridyl pyridinium salts in C4&#8208;selectivity. These salts can be in situ converted to 4&#8208;aminopyridines by aqueous ammonia or utilized as synthetic linchpins for general pyridine C4&#8208;functionalization. The elucidation of the selectivity principles has further guided the C4&#8208;selective functionalization of other (di)azines.







Abstract
The development of site&#8208;selective functionalization of N&#8208;heteroarenes is highly desirable in streamlined synthesis. In this context, direct amination of pyridines stands as an important synthetic methodology, with particular emphasis on accessing 4&#8208;aminopyridines, a versatile pharmacophore in medicinal chemistry. Herein, we report a reaction manifold for the C4&#8208;selective amination of pyridines by employing nucleophilic substitution of hydrogen (SNH). Through 4&#8208;pyridyl pyridinium salt intermediates, 4&#8208;aminopyridine products are obtained in reaction with aqueous ammonia without intermediate isolation. The notable regioselectivity was achieved by the electronic tuning of the external pyridine reagents along with the maximization of polarizability in the proton elimination stage. Further mechanistic investigations provided a guiding principle for the selective C&#8722;H pyridination of additional N&#8208;heteroarenes, presenting a strategic avenue for installation of diverse functional groups.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic C&#8722;H Zincation and Alumination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal free catalytic C&#8722;H zincation and C&#8722;H alumination of heteroarenes using (&#946;&#8208;diketiminate)&#8208;metal complexes, where the only by&#8208;products are H2 or CH4, is reported. This is achieved by coupling endergonic C&#8722;H metalation with subsequent exergonic dehydrocoupling, with the latter process proceeding by metal&#8208;specific pathways.







Abstract
C&#8722;H metalation is the most efficient method to prepare aryl&#8211;zinc and &#8211;aluminium complexes that are ubiquitous nucleophiles. Virtually all C&#8722;H metalation routes to form Al/Zn organometallics require stoichiometric, strong Br&#248;nsted bases with no base&#8208;catalyzed reactions reported. Herein we present a catalytic in amine/ammonium salt (Et3N/[(Et3N)H]+) C&#8722;H metalation process to form aryl&#8208;zinc and aryl&#8208;aluminium complexes. Key to this approach is coupling an endergonic C&#8722;H metalation step with a sufficiently exergonic dehydrocoupling step between the ammonium salt by&#8208;product of C&#8722;H metalation ([(Et3N)H]+) and a Zn&#8722;H or Al&#8722;Me containing complex. This step, forming H2/MeH, makes the overall cycle exergonic while generating more of the reactive metal electrophile. Mechanistic studies supported by DFT calculations revealed metal&#8208;specific dehydrocoupling pathways, with the divergent reactivity due to the different metal valency (which impacts the accessibility of amine&#8208;free cationic metal complexes) and steric environment. Notably, dehydrocoupling in the zinc system proceeds through a ligand&#8208;mediated pathway involving protonation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminate C&#947; position. Given this process is applicable to two disparate metals (Zn and Al), other main group metals and ligand sets are expected to be amenable to this transition metal&#8208;free, catalytic C&#8722;H metalation.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coordination space properties (size and shape) and environment (solvents: water and DMF) were regulated to decrease the MOF nucleation and growth rate during membrane formation process, alleviating the preferential generation of MOF in the bulk solution and facilitating the intergrowth of MOF crystals into integrated membrane layer with progressively eliminating defects, which endows the MOF membrane with intrinsic angstrom&#8208;sized lattice apertures showing excellent H2/CO2 separation and water desalination performance.

Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes with rich functionality and tunable pore system are promising for precise molecular separation; however, it remains a challenge to develop defect&#8208;free high&#8208;connectivity MOF membrane with high water stability owing to uncontrollable nucleation and growth rate during fabrication process. Herein, we report on a confined&#8208;coordination induced intergrowth strategy to fabricate lattice&#8208;defect&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOF membrane towards precise molecular separation. The confined&#8208;coordination space properties (size and shape) and environment (water or DMF) were regulated to slow down the coordination reaction rate via controlling the counter&#8208;diffusion of MOF precursors (metal cluster and ligand), thereby inter&#8208;growing MOF crystals into integrated membrane. The resulting Zr&#8208;MOF membrane with angstrom&#8208;sized lattice apertures exhibits excellent separation performance both for gas separation and water desalination process. It was achieved H2 permeance of ~1200 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of ~67; water permeance of ~8&#8197;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;bar&#8722;1 and MgCl2 rejection of ~95&#8201;%, which are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The molecular transport mechanism related to size&#8208;sieving effect and transition energy barrier differential of molecules and ions was revealed by density functional theory calculations. Our work provides a facile approach and fundamental insights towards developing precise molecular sieving membranes.

         <title>Boryl Radical as a Catalyst in Enabling Intra&#8208; and Intermolecular Cascade Radical Cyclization Reactions: Construction of Polycyclic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical catalyzes cascade cyclization reactions to construct polycyclic compounds both intra&#8208; and intermolecularly. This catalytic cascade radical reaction allows rapid construction of complex molecular architectures through the formation of two or three bonds in a single operation, respectively.







Abstract
Cascade radical cyclization constitutes an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic route for rapid assembly of polycyclic molecular skeletons. Although an array of redox&#8208;active metal catalysts has recently shown robust applications in enabling various catalytic cascade radical processes, the use of free organic radical as the catalyst, which is capable of triggering strategically distinct cascades, has rarely been developed. Here, we disclosed that the benzimidazolium&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;boryl radical is capable of catalyzing cascade cyclization reactions in both intra&#8208; and intermolecular pathways, assembling [5,5] fused bicyclic and [6,6,6] fused tricyclic molecules, respectively. The catalytic reactions start with the chemo&#8208; and regioselective addition of the boryl radical catalyst to a tethered alkene or alkyne moiety, followed by either an intramolecular formal [3+2] or an intermolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition process to construct bicyclo[3.3.0]octane or tetrahydrophenanthridine skeletons, respectively. Eventually, a &#946;&#8208;elimination occurs to release the boryl radical catalyst, completing a catalytic cycle. High to excellent diastereoselectivity is achieved in both catalytic reactions under substrate control.

         <title>Synergistic Al&#8722;Al Dual&#8208;Atomic Site for Efficient Artificial Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;metal bonded dual&#8208;atomic Al&#8722;Al site was designed and synthesized on a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix for the electrocatalytic conversion of N2 to NH3. The catalyst with the bonded Al2&#8208;pair site exhibited high Faradaic efficiency and selective NH3 generation. The mechanism follows a six&#8208;electrons transfer pathway for the selective generation of NH3, as revealed by operando surface&#8208;enhanced IR spectroelectrochemistry.







Abstract
Synthesis of ammonia by electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it is commonly obstructed by the high activation energy. Here, we report the design and synthesis of an Al&#8722;Al bonded dual atomic catalyst stabilized within an amorphous nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix (Al2NC) with high NRR performance. The dual atomic Al2&#8208;sites act synergistically to catalyze the complex multiple steps of NRR through adsorption and activation, enhancing the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This Al2NC catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of 16.56&#177;0.3&#8201;% with a yield rate of 29.22&#177;1.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1. The dual atomic Al2NC catalyst shows long&#8208;term repeatable, and stable NRR performance. This work presents an insight into the identification of synergistic dual atomic catalytic site and mechanistic pathway for the electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3.

         <title>Novel Photocatalyst Based on Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Induced Intersystem Crossing Enables Rapid and Efficient Polymerization Under Low&#8208;Power Excitation Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the novel strategy of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC), a photocatalyst (NI&#8208;1) with the properties of satisfactory ISC efficiency, long triplet lifetime and robust excited state reduction ability was obtained. This photocatalyst was used in polymerization/ lithography, an efficient and fast polymerization was achieved under the conditions of low power excitation and without electron donor.







Abstract
Currently, most photoredox catalysis polymerization systems are limited by high excitation power, long polymerization time, or the requirement of electron donors due to the precise design of efficient photocatalysts still poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach: the creation of efficient photocatalysts having low ground state oxidation potentials and high excited state energy levels, along with through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) induced intersystem crossing (ISC) properties. A cabazole&#8208;naphthalimide (NI) dyad (NI&#8208;1) characterized by long triplet excited state lifetime (&#964;T=62&#8197;&#956;s), satisfactory ISC efficiency (&#934;&#916;=54.3&#8201;%) and powerful reduction capacity [Singlet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;1.93&#8197;eV, Triplet: E1/2 (PC+1/*PC)=&#8722;0.84&#8197;eV] was obtained. An efficient and rapid polymerization (83&#8201;% conversion of 1&#8197;mM monomer in 30&#8197;s) was observed under the conditions of without electron donor, low excitation power (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and low catalyst (NI&#8208;1) loading (&lt;50&#8197;&#956;M). In contrast, the conversion rate was lower at 29&#8201;% when the reference catalyst (NI&#8208;4) was used for photopolymerization under the same conditions, demonstrating the advantage of the TSCT photocatalyst. Finally, the TSCT material was used as a photocatalyst in practical lithography for the first time, achieving pattern resolutions of up to 10&#8197;&#956;m.

         <title>On&#8208;Water Surface Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Cationic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Films as the Anion&#8208;Selective Electrode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked cationic 2DPs (V&#8208;C2DPs) are synthesized on the water surface via Knoevenagel reaction, presenting as fully crystalline and highly oriented thin films. The obtained V&#8208;C2DPs exhibit well&#8208;defined cationic sites and 1D channels, facilitating the anion&#8208;selective transport. The integration of V&#8208;C2DPs as graphite cathode coatings into zinc&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (ZDIBs) enables to improve its specific capacity and cycling life.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional polymers (V&#8208;2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D COFs) featuring high in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and robust frameworks have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;related applications. However, current synthetic approaches are restricted to producing V&#8208;2D COF powders that lack processability, impeding their integration into devices, particularly within membrane technologies reliant upon thin films. Herein, we report the novel on&#8208;water surface synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked cationic 2DPs films (V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 and V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;2) via Knoevenagel polycondensation, which serve as the anion&#8208;selective electrode coating for highly&#8208;reversible and durable zinc&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (ZDIBs). Model reactions and theoretical modeling revealed the enhanced reactivity and reversibility of the Knoevenagel reaction on the water surface. On this basis, we demonstrated the on&#8208;water surface 2D polycondensation towards V&#8208;C2DPs films that show large lateral size, tunable thickness, and high chemical stability. Representatively, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 presents as a fully crystalline and face&#8208;on oriented film with in&#8208;plane lattice parameters of a=b&#8776;43.3&#8197;&#197;. Profiting from its well&#8208;defined cationic sites, oriented 1D channels, and stable frameworks, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 film possesses superior bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8722;)&#8208;transport selectivity (transference, t_=0.85) for graphite cathode in high&#8208;voltage ZDIBs, thus triggering additional TFSI&#8722;&#8208;intercalation stage and promoting its specific capacity (from ~83 to 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and cycling life (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles, 95&#8201;% capacity retention).

&lt;p&gt;Two vinylene-linked cationic 2DPs (V-C2DPs) are synthesized on the water surface via Knoevenagel reaction, presenting as fully crystalline and highly oriented thin films. The obtained V-C2DPs exhibit well-defined cationic sites and 1D channels, facilitating the anion-selective transport. The integration of V-C2DPs as graphite cathode coatings into zinc-based dual-ion batteries (ZDIBs) enables to improve its specific capacity and cycling life.

&lt;p&gt;Vinylene-linked two-dimensional polymers (V-2DPs) and their layer-stacked covalent organic frameworks (V-2D COFs) featuring high in-plane &#960;-conjugation and robust frameworks have emerged as promising candidates for energy-related applications.

         <title>Atomically Precise Nanometer&#8208;Sized Pt Catalysts with an Additional Photothermy Functionality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected, ambient&#8208;stable Pt23 nanoclusters (~1&#8197;nm) are synthesized using a mixed ligand protection strategy and structurally resolved by single&#8208;crystal XRD and ESI&#8208;MS. The nanoclusters exhibit far higher activity than commercial Pt/C catalysts in catalyzing ORR without calcination before use and additional photothermal properties, which are attributed to the special size and structure by DFT and d&#8208;band center calculations.







Abstract
Atomically precise ~1&#8208;nm Pt nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) with ambient stability are important in fundamental research and exhibit diverse practical applications (catalysis, biomedicine, etc.). However, synthesizing such materials is challenging. Herein, by employing the mixture ligand protecting strategy, we successfully synthesized the largest organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;protected (~1&#8208;nm) Pt23 NCs precisely characterized with mass spectrometry and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Interestingly, natural population analysis and Bader charge calculation indicate an alternate, varying charge &#8208;layer distribution in the sandwich&#8208;like Pt23 NC kernel. Pt23 NCs can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction under acidic conditions without requiring calcination and other treatments, and the resulting specific and mass activities without further treatment are sevenfold and eightfold higher than those observed for commercial Pt/C catalysts, respectively. Density functional theory and d&#8208;band center calculations interpret the high activity. Furthermore, Pt23 NCs exhibit a photothermal conversion efficiency of 68.4&#8201;% under 532&#8208;nm laser irradiation and can be used at least for six cycles, thus demonstrating great potential for practical applications.

         <title>Recycling Valuable Alkylbenzenes from Polystyrene through Methanol&#8208;Assisted Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methanol&#8208;assisted depolymerization of PS (PS&#8208;MAD) process was developed for effectively converting PS into value&#8208;added alkylbenzenes. Methanol is regarded as a hydrogen carrier decomposed in situ to provide moderate pressure of hydrogen which prevents benzene rings hydrogenation and promotes the depolymerization of PS. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of virgin PS over Ru/SiO2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h.







Abstract
The vast bulk of polystyrene (PS), a major type of plastic polymers, ends up in landfills, which takes up to thousands of years to decompose in nature. Chemical recycling promises to enable lower&#8208;energy pathways and minimal environmental impacts compared with traditional incineration and mechanical recycling. Herein, we demonstrated that methanol as a hydrogen supplier assisted the depolymerization of PS (denoted as PS&#8208;MAD) into alkylbenzenes over a heterogeneous catalyst composed of Ru nanoparticles on SiO2. PS&#8208;MAD achieved a high yield of liquid products which accounted for 93.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% of virgin PS at 280&#8201;&#176;C for 6&#8197;h with the production rate of 118.1&#8197;mmolcarbon&#8201;gcatal.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. The major components were valuable alkylbenzenes (monocyclic aromatics and diphenyl alkanes), the sum of which occupied 84.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of liquid products. According to mechanistic studies, methanol decomposition dominates the hydrogen supply during PS&#8208;MAD, thereby restraining PS aromatization which generates by&#8208;products of fused polycyclic arenes and polyphenylenes.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Complementary Multicomponent Assembly of Low&#8208;Symmetry Co(III)Salphen&#8208;Based Coordination Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable, low&#8208;symmetry cages can be assembled by completing the octahedral coordination spheres of dinuclear Co(III)salphen macrocycles with shape&#8208;complementary bis&#8208;pyridyl bridges, starting from labile Co(II) precursors under aerobic conditions.







Abstract
While metal&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is a popular technique to construct discrete nanosized objects, highly symmetric structures, built from one type of ligand at a time, are dominating reported systems. The tailored integration of a set of different ligands requires sophisticated approaches to avoid narcissistic separation or formation of statistical mixtures. Here, we demonstrate how the combination of three structure&#8208;guiding effects (metal&#8208;templated macrocyclization, additional bridging ligands and shape&#8208;complementarity) based on Co(III)salphen metal nodes allows for a rational and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of structurally complex, lantern&#8208;shaped cages with up to four differentiable bridges. Three new heteroleptic coordination cages based on dinuclear Co(III)salphen macrocycles were synthesized in a one&#8208;pot reaction approach and fully characterized, including single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses. One cage groups two of the same ligands, another two different ligands around a symmetric Co2&#8208;bis&#8208;salphen ring. In the most complex structure, this ring is unsymmetric, rendering all four connections between the two metal centers distinguishable. While heteroleptic assembly around Pd(II) nodes has been shown to be dynamic, beneficial for cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformations, assembly cascades and adaptive systems, the herein introduced cages based on kinetically more inert Co(III)salphen will be advantageous for applications in enzyme&#8208;like catalysis and molecular machinery that require enhanced structural and chemical stability.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Triggered Cascade Lactate Depletion by Semiconducting Polymer Nanoreactors for Cuproptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high level of lactate in tumor microenvironment not only promotes tumor development and metastasis, but also induces immune escape, which often leads to failures of various tumor therapy strategies. We here report a sono&#8208;triggered cascade lactate depletion strategy by using semiconducting polymer nanoreactors (SPNLCu) for cancer cuproptosis&#8208;immunotherapy. The SPNLCu mainly contain a semiconducting polymer as sonosensitizer, lactate oxidase (LOx) conjugated via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;cleavable linker and chelated Cu2+. Upon ultrasound (US) irradiation, the semiconducting polymer generates singlet oxygen (1O2) to cut ROS&#8208;cleavable linker to allow the release of LOx that catalyzes lactate depletion to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The Cu2+ will be reduced to Cu+ in tumor microenvironment, which reacts with the produced H2O2 to obtain hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) that further improves LOx release via destroying ROS&#8208;cleavable linkers. As such, sono&#8208;triggered cascade release of LOx achieves effective lactate depletion, thus relieving immunosuppressive roles of lactate. Moreover, the toxic Cu+ induces cuproptosis to cause immunogenic cell death (ICD) for activating antitumor immunological effect. SPNLCu are used to treat both subcutaneous and deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer with observably enhanced efficacy in restricting the tumor growths. This study thus provides a precise and effective lactate depletion tactic for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

The Cu2+ will be reduced to Cu+ in tumor microenvironment, which reacts with the produced H2O2 to obtain hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) that further improves LOx release via destroying ROS-cleavable linkers. As such, sono-triggered cascade release of LOx achieves effective lactate depletion, thus relieving immunosuppressive roles of lactate. Moreover, the toxic Cu+ induces cuproptosis to cause immunogenic cell death (ICD) for activating antitumor immunological effect. SPNLCu are used to treat both subcutaneous and deep-tissue orthotopic pancreatic cancer with observably enhanced efficacy in restricting the tumor growths. This study thus provides a precise and effective lactate depletion tactic for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Photoreforming of Waste Plastics into Diesel Olefins via Single Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The accumulation of plastic waste poses a pressing environmental challenge. Catalytic conversion stands out as an ideal approach for plastics upcycling, particularly through solar&#8208;driven plastics photoreforming. However, due to the common effects of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS), selectively generating high&#8208;value chemicals becomes challenging.&#160;In this study, we developed a universal strategy to achieve &gt;85% selective production of diesel olefins (C15&#8208;C28) from polyolefin waste plastics&#160;via&#160;single ROS.&#160;Using tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin supramolecular (TCPP) with different central metals as an example to regulate single ROS generation, results show Ni&#8208;TCPP facilitates triplet exciton production, yielding&#160;1O2, while Zn&#8208;TCPP generates &#8226;O2&#8722;&#160;due to its strong built&#8208;in electric field (IEF).&#160;1O2&#160;directly dechlorinates polyvinyl chloride (PVC) due to the electro&#8208;negativity of chlorine atoms and the low dissociation energy of C&#8208;Cl bonds, while &#8226;O2&#8722;&#160;promotes direct dehydrogenation of polyethylene (PE) due to the electro&#8208;positivity of hydrogen atoms and the high dissociation energy of C&#8208;H bonds. This method is universally applicable to various single ROS systems.&#160;Installation&#160;experiments further affirm the application potential, achieving the highest diesel olefin production of 76.1 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1. Such a universally adaptive approach holds promise for addressing the global plastic pollution problem.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality, a fundamental principle in chemistry, biology, and medicine, is prevalent in nature and in organisms. Chiral molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, are crucial in biomolecular synthesis, as well as in the development of functional materials. Among these, 1,1&#180;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;diol (BINOL) stands out for its stable chiral configuration, versatile functionality, and commercial availability. BINOL is widely employed in asymmetric catalysis and chiral materials. This review mainly focuses on recent research over the past five years concerning the use of BINOL derivatives for constructing chiral macrocycles and cages. Their contributions to chiral luminescence, enantiomeric separation, transmembrane transport, and asymmetric catalysis were examined.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep Red Light Driven Hydrogen Evolution by Heterojunction Polymer Dots for Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe small heterojunction polymer dots (Pdots) with deep&#8208;red light catalyzed H2 generation for diabetic skin wound healing. The Pdots with donor/acceptor heterojunctions showed remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity as compared to the donor or acceptor nanoparticles alone. We encapsulate the Pdots and ascorbic acid into liposomes to form Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors, which selectively scavenge &#8226;OH radicals in live cells and tissues under 650 nm light illumination. The antioxidant capacity of the heterojunction Pdots is ~10 times higher than that of the single&#8208;component Pdots described previously. Under a total light dose of 360 J/cm2, the Lipo&#8208;Pdots nanoreactors effectively scavenged &#8226;OH radicals and suppressed the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in skin tissues, thereby accelerating the healing of skin wounds in diabetic mice. This study provides a feasible solution for safe and effective treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.</dc:description>

Abstract
Bottlebrush networks (BBNs) are an exciting new class of materials with interesting physical properties derived from their unique architecture. While great strides have been made in our fundamental understanding of bottlebrush polymers and networks, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for the field to accelerate advancements. This review aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application (LengthScale), enabling bottlebrush physics to be more approachable. We conclude by addressing several topical issues and asking a series of pointed questions to stimulate conversation within the community.

         <title>Tuning Ion Mobility in Lithium Argyrodite Solid Electrolytes via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of improved solid electrolytes (SEs) plays a crucial role in the advancement of bulk&#8208;type solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) technologies. Recently, multicomponent or high&#8208;entropy SEs are gaining increased attention for their advantageous charge transport and (electro)chemical properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of how configurational entropy affects ionic conductivity is largely lacking. Herein we have investigated a series of multication&#8208;substituted lithium argyrodites with the general formula Li6+x[M1aM2bM3cM4d]S5I, with M being P, Si, Ge, and Sb. Structure&#8208;property relationships related to ion mobility were probed using a combination of diffraction techniques, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and charge&#8208;transport measurements. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental evidence of a direct correlation between occupational disorder in the cationic host lattice and lithium transport. By controlling the configurational entropy through the composition, high bulk ionic conductivities up to 18 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature were achieved for optimized lithium argyrodite compositions. Our results indicate the possibility of improving ionic conductivity in ceramic ion conductors via entropy engineering, unlocking the compositional limitations for the design of advanced electrolytes and opening up new avenues in the field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorinated Chaperone Gives X&#8208;ray Crystal Structures of Acyclic Natural Product Derivatives up to 338 Molecular Weight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallizing molecules with long flexible chains is a challenge, making it difficult to perform X&#8208;ray crystallography. Chaperones can assist in the crystallization of compounds that do not crystallize by themselves by producing solvate crystals that contain the analyte in their three&#8208;dimensional lattices. Among the most versatile chaperones for liquid analytes are tetraaryladamantanes (TAAs), but the size of the compounds that can be encapsulated is limited, and attempts to surpass this limit with known TAAs were unsuccessful. Here we report that 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)adamantane (TFM) is a crystallization chaperone for acyclic molecules up to the molecular weight of phytyl acetate (338 g/mol). Encapsulation of such a large acyclic compound was achieved when the analyte was esterified and when a two&#8208;step temperature protocol was used for crystallization. Exploratory work indicates that a drop to &#8208;20 &#176;C allows for encapsulation of squalene (Mr 411 g/mol), albeit with positional disorder of the analyte. Our X&#8208;ray crystal structures of solvates with flexible analytes shed light on how crystalline order can be imposed on large acyclic analytes. The new, fluorinated TAA gives access to crystal structures that were inaccessible thus far.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultralow Catalytic Loading for Optimised Electrocatalytic Performance of AuPt Nanoparticles to Produce Hydrogen and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution and nitrite reduction reactions are key to producing green hydrogen and ammonia. Antenna&#8211;reactor nanoparticles hold promise to improve the performances of these transformations under visible&#8208;light excitation, by combining plasmonic and catalytic materials. However, current materials involve compromising either on the catalytic activity or the plasmonic enhancement and also lack control of reaction selectivity. Here, we demonstrate that ultralow loadings and non&#8208;uniform surface segregation of the catalytic component optimize catalytic activity and selectivity under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Taking Pt&#8208;Au as an example we find that fine&#8208;tuning the Pt content produces a 6&#8208;fold increase in the hydrogen evolution compared to commercial Pt/C as well as a 6.5&#8208;fold increase in the nitrite reduction and a 2.5&#8208;fold increase in the selectivity for producing ammonia under visible light excitation relative to dark conditions. Density functional theory suggests that the catalytic reactions are accelerated by the intimate contact between nanoscale Pt&#8208;rich and Au&#8208;rich regions at the surface, which facilitates the formation of electron&#8208;rich hot&#8208;carrier puddles associated with the Pt&#8208;based active sites. The results provide exciting opportunities to design new materials with improved photocatalytic performance for demanding sustainable energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous Developable and CO2&#8208;Sourced Chemical Amplification Photoresist with High Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seeking high&#8208;performance photoresist is an important item for semiconductor industry due to the continuous miniaturization and intelligentization of integrated circuits. Polymer resin containing carbonate group has many desirable properties, such as high transmittance, acid sensitivity and chemical formulation, thus serving as potential photoresist material. In this work, a series of aqueous developable CO2&#8208;sourced polycarbonate (CO2&#8208;PC) were produced via alternating copolymerization of CO2 and epoxides bearing acid&#8208;cleavable cyclic acetal groups in the presence of tetranuclear organoborane catalyst. The produced CO2&#8208;PCs were investigated as chemical amplification resists in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. Under the catalysis of photoacid, the acetal (ketal) groups in CO2&#8208;PC were hydrolysed into two equivalents of hydroxyl groups, which changes the exposed areas from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity, thus enabling the exposed regions to be developed in water. Through normalized remaining thickness analysis, the optimal CO2&#8208;derived resist achieved a remarkable sensitivity of 1.9 mJ/cm2, a contrast of 7.9, a favorable resolution (750 nm, half pitch), and etching resistance (38% higher than poly(tert&#8208;butyl acrylate)). Such performances outperforming commercial KrF and ArF chemical amplification resists (i.e., polyhydroxystyrene&#8208;derived and polymethacrylate&#8208;based resists), which endows broad application prospects in the field of DUV (248 nm and 193 nm) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography and nanomanufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Pulsed Electroreduction for Boosting the Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. We developed a stable CuSiOx catalyst with abundant atomic Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfacial sites toward urea electrosynthesis, in which Cu species are uniformly dispersed in the silica matrix. Besides, we adopt pulsed electroreduction to overcome electrostatic interaction, promoting nitrate adsorption and reduction to urea.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic urea synthesis under ambient conditions offers a promising alternative strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea industry protocol. Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system is not easily achievable. Here, we propose a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via pulsed electroreduction. We found that the reconstruction&#8208;resistant CuSiOx nanotube, with abundant atomic Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfacial sites, exhibits ultrastability in the electrosynthesis of urea from nitrate and CO2. Under a pulsed potential approach with optimal operating conditions, the Cu&#8722;O&#8722;Si interfaces achieve a superior urea production rate (1606.1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1) with high selectivity (79.01&#8201;%) and stability (the Faradaic efficiency is retained at 80&#8201;% even after 80&#8197;h of testing), outperforming most reported electrocatalytic synthesis urea catalysts. We believe our strategy will incite further investigation into pulsed electroreduction increasing substrate transport, which may guide the design of ambient urea electrosynthesis and other energy conversion systems.

         <title>A Nonlinear Photochromic Reaction Based on Sensitizer&#8208;Free Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in a Perylene&#8208;Substituted Rhodamine Spirolactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear photochromic reaction has been achieved in a perylene&#8208;substituted rhodamine spirolactam, which is easily synthesized from rhodamine B. Direct excitation with UV or blue light causes charge transfer and intersystem crossing, followed by triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation without triplet sensitizers to cause nonlinear behavior. In addition, using sensitizers enables the extension of the photoresponsivity from the blue to red region.







Abstract
Nonlinear photochromic reactions that work with weak incoherent light are important for molecular operations with high spatial resolution and multiple photofunctions based on single molecules. However, nonlinear photochromic compounds generally require complex molecular design, restricting accessibility in various fields. Herein, we report nonlinear photochromic properties in a perylene&#8208;substituted rhodamine spirolactam derivative (Rh&#8722;Pe), which is synthesized from rhodamine B in facile procedures. Direct excitation of Rh&#8722;Pe produces the triplet excited state via the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The triplet excited state causes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation to bring the generation of the intensely colored ring&#8208;open form with nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, green&#8208; and red&#8208;light&#8208;induced photochromism was achieved in Rh&#8722;Pe using triplet sensitizers, although Rh&#8722;Pe can be directly excited only by ultraviolet and blue light. Our findings are expected to contribute to the development of photofunctional materials showing nonlinear behavior and low&#8208;energy light responsivity.

Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy was proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, guiding the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged groups. While the negatively charged groups reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions, enabling AZMBs with high reversibility and extra&#8208;long lifespans.







Abstract
Unstable Zn interface with serious detrimental parasitic side&#8208;reactions and uncontrollable Zn dendrites severely plagues the practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The interface stability was closely related to the electrolyte configuration and Zn2+ depositional behavior. In this work, a unique Zn&#8208;ion anchoring strategy is originally proposed to manipulate the coordination structure of solvated Zn&#8208;ions and guide the Zn&#8208;ion depositional behavior. Specifically, the amphoteric charged ion additives (denoted as DM), which act as zinc&#8208;ion anchors, can tightly absorb on the Zn surface to guide the uniform zinc&#8208;ion distribution by using its positively charged &#8722;NR4+ groups. While the negatively charged &#8722;SO3&#8722; groups of DM on the other hand, reduces the active water molecules within solvation sheaths of Zn&#8208;ions. Benefiting from the special synergistic effect, Zn metal exhibits highly ordered and compact (002) Zn deposition and negligible side&#8208;reactions. As a result, the advanced Zn||Zn symmetric cell delivers extraordinarily 7000&#8197;hours long lifespan (0.25&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 0.25&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Additionally, based on this strategy, the NH4V4O10||Zn pouch&#8208;cell with low negative/positive capacity ratio (N/P ratio=2.98) maintains 80.4&#8201;% capacity retention for 180&#8197;cycles. A more practical 4&#8197;cm*4&#8197;cm sized pouch&#8208;cell could be steadily cycled in a high output capacity of 37.0&#8197;mAh over 50&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Heteroatom Substitution Strategy Modulates Thermodynamics Towards Chemically Recyclable Polyesters and Monomeric Unit Sequence by Temperature Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new monomer design strategy in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system, coined as heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS), is proposed for a) the synthesis of chemically recyclable polyesters, and b) the sequence control in copolyesters by temperature switching.







Abstract
In this paper, we proposed a heteroatom substitution strategy (HSS) in the &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) system to modulate thermodynamics toward chemically recyclable polyesters. Three VL&#8208;based monomers containing different heteroatoms (M1 (N), M2 (S), and M3 (O)), instead of C&#8208;5 carbon, were designed and synthesized to verify our proposed HSS. All three monomers undergo organocatalytic living/controlled ROP and controllable depolymerization. Impressively, the resulting P(M1) achieved over 99&#8201;% monomer recovery under both mild solution depolymerization and high vacuum pyrolysis conditions without any side reactions, and the recycled monomers can be polymerized again forming new polymers. The systematic study of the relationship between heteroatom substitution and recyclability shows that introducing heteroatoms does change the thermodynamics of the monomers (&#916;Hpo, &#916;Spo and Tc values), thereby adjusting the polymerizability and depolymerizability. DFT calculations found that the introduction of heteroatoms adjusts the ring strain by changing the angular strain of the monomers, and the order of their angular strain (M2&gt;M1&gt;M3) is consistent with the order of the experimentally obtained enthalpy change. Notably, the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step copolymerization of two of each of the three monomers enables the synthesis of sequence&#8208;controlled copolymers from gradient to random to block structures, by simply switching the copolymerization temperature.

         <title>Design of 3D&#8208;Printed Heterogeneous Reactor Systems To Overcome Incompatibility Hurdles when Combining Metal and Enzyme Catalysis in a One&#8208;Pot Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction in one reactor in spite of the use of incompatible catalysts is demonstrated. The chemoenzymatic process is based on embedding enzyme&#8208;deactivating Cu ions in a 3D&#8208;printed ceramic scaffold, which then &#8220;shields&#8221; the enzyme from the critical Cu component. By such compartmentalization, the desired product was obtained with 80&#8201;% overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity (99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Combining chemo&#8208; and biocatalysis enables the design of novel economic and sustainable one&#8208;pot processes for the preparation of industrial chemicals, preferably proceeding in water. While a range of proofs&#8208;of&#8208;concept for the compatibility of such catalysts from these two different &#8220;worlds of catalysis&#8221; have recently been demonstrated, merging noncompatible chemo&#8208; and biocatalysts for joint applications within one reactor remained a challenge. A conceptual solution is compartmentalization of the catalytic moieties by heterogenization of critical catalyst components, thus &#8220;shielding&#8221; them from the complementary noncompatible catalyst, substrate or reagent. Exemplified for a one&#8208;pot process consisting of a metal&#8208;catalyzed Wacker oxidation and enzymatic reduction as noncompatible individual reactions steps, we demonstrate that making use of 3D printing of heterogeneous materials containing Cu as a critical metal component can overcome such incompatibility hurdles. The application of a 3D&#8208;printed Cu&#8208;ceramic device as metal catalyst component allows an efficient combination with the enzyme and the desired two&#8208;step transformation of styrene into the chiral alcohol product with high overall conversion and excellent enantioselectivity. This compartmentalization concept based on 3D printing of heterogenized metal catalysts represents a scalable methodology and opens up numerous perspectives to be used as a general tool also for other related chemoenzymatic research challenges.

         <title>Preserving Mesoporosity in Type III Porous Liquids through Dual&#8208;layer Surface Weaving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reported a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to realize Type III porous liquids (PLs) with apertures larger than the solvent molecules. The 1st polymer layer, cross&#8208;linked poly (t&#8208;butyl methacrylate), serves as a physical barrier to block the solvent molecules from entering the MOF pore. The 2nd layer uses a solvent&#8208;compatible polymer to reduce PL viscosity. As a result, a PL bearing a 3.1&#8197;nm aperture was successfully constructed.







Abstract
The fundamental limitation for pore preservation in a Type III porous liquid (T3PL) is the need for a small aperture from the porous filler to realize size exclusion of a bulky solvent. We present a dual&#8208;layer surface weaving strategy that can disregard this limitation and achieve micro&#8208; and mesoporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based T3PLs even with apertures much larger than the solvent molecules. By first weaving a tight network of poly(tert&#8208;butyl methacrylate) on the MOF surface, the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) solvent can be effectively excluded from the pores while smaller guest molecules such as CO2, C2H4, and H2O can freely access the interior, as confirmed by low&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherms. Further application of a PDMS&#8208;containing polymer coating helps lower the viscosity of the PL due to increased particle dispersibility. This strategy has resulted in the successful construction of T3PLs with aperture sizes up to 3.1&#8197;nm.

         <title>Beyond Tertiary Amines: Introducing Secondary Amines by Palladium/Norbornene&#8208;Catalyzed Ortho Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of secondary amines at the aryl iodide ortho position by the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis has been developed, which leads to versatile synthetic applications, such as primary amino group installation and concise heterocycle formations.







Abstract
Since the discovery of the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE)&#8208;catalyzed ortho amination in 2013, escaping the limitation of only yielding tertiary anilines has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we describe that, by carefully choosing the phosphine ligand and NBE mediator, the installation of a N&#8208;mono&#8208;alkylamino group becomes feasible. The reaction tolerates a wide range of aryl iodide substrates and various N&#8208;mono&#8208;tertiary alkylamine&#8208;derived electrophiles. Both ipso alkenylation and alkynylation can be realized. The synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the formation of primary amino group via selective deprotection and streamlined access to N&#8208;heterocycles. Preliminary success of installing a bulky N&#8208;secondary alkylamino group and a mechanistic understanding of the decomposition pathways of mono N&#8208;alkylamine electrophiles have been obtained.

The reaction tolerates a wide range of aryl iodide substrates and various &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-mono-tertiary alkylamine-derived electrophiles. Both ipso alkenylation and alkynylation can be realized. The synthetic utility of this method is exemplified by the formation of primary amino group via selective deprotection and streamlined access to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles. Preliminary success of installing a bulky &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-secondary alkylamino group and a mechanistic understanding of the decomposition pathways of mono &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylamine electrophiles have been obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oversaturating Liquid Interfaces with Nanoparticle&#8208;Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Explore the intriguing world of nanoparticle&#8208;surfactants at liquid interfaces. This study delves into how external electric fields can form and influence nanoparticle assemblies, leading to explosive emulsification behavior. It unveils a fascinating interplay between electrostatic forces and physiochemical conditions, offering a glimpse into the untapped possibilities of nanotechnology.







Abstract
Assemblies of nanoparticles at liquid interfaces hold promise as dynamic &#8220;active&#8221; systems when there are convenient methods to drive the system out of equilibrium via crowding. To this end, we show that oversaturated assemblies of charged nanoparticles can be realized and held in that state with an external electric field. Upon removal of the field, strong interparticle repulsive forces cause a high in&#8208;plane electrostatic pressure that is released in an explosive emulsification. We quantify the packing of the assembly as it is driven into the oversaturated state under an applied electric field. Physiochemical conditions substantially affect the intensity of the induced explosive emulsification, underscoring the crucial role of interparticle electrostatic repulsion.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization to Prepare Recylable Micro&#8208;Adjuvants for Dendritic Cell Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of P(MAG&#8208;co&#8208;DMC) based micro&#8208;adjuvants. The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation.







Abstract
In the development of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, the maturation of DCs is a critical stage. Adjuvants play a pivotal role in the maturation of DCs, with a major concern being to ensure both efficacy and safety. This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of micro&#8208;adjuvants grafted with copolymers of 2&#8208;(methacrylamido) glucopyranose (MAG) and methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC). The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. These micrometer&#8208;sized adjuvants surpass the optimal size range for cellular endocytosis, enabling the retrieval and reuse of them during the ex vivo maturation process, mitigating potential toxicity concerns associated with the endocytosis of non&#8208;metabolized nanoparticles. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation. This effect is influenced by the shape of the particle, as evidenced by the distinct promotion effects of rod&#8208;like and spherical micro&#8208;adjuvants with comparable sizes. Furthermore, the porous structure of the adjuvants enables them to function as cargo&#8208;carrying &#8220;micro&#8208;shuttles&#8221;, releasing antigens upon binding to DCs to facilitate efficient antigen delivery.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Responsive Colorimetric and Fluorometric Red&#8208;Shift in Triarylborane Derivatives: Dual Role of Phenazaborine as Lewis Acid and Electron Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of modulating photophysical properties by balancing the contradictory role of phenazaborine as a Lewis acid and an electron donor has been used to synthesize anion&#8208;responsive triarylborane compounds that displayed significant red&#8208;shift in their absorption and photoluminescence spectra in solution. This approach has also been successfully applied to modulate the emission color in polymer films.







Abstract
Photophysical modulation of triarylboranes (TABs) through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions is a fundamental approach for sensing anions. Yet, design principles for anion&#8208;responsive TABs displaying significant red&#8208;shift in absorption and photoluminescence (PL) have remained elusive. Herein, a new strategy for modulating the photophysical properties of TABs in a red&#8208;shift mode has been presented, by using a nitrogen&#8208;bridged triarylborane (1,4&#8208;phenazaborine: PAzB) with a contradictory dual role as a Lewis acid and an electron donor. Following the strategy, PAzB derivatives connected with an electron&#8208;deficient azaaromatic have been developed, and these compounds display a distinct red&#8208;shift in their absorption and PL in response to an anion. Spectroscopic analyses and quantum chemical calculations have revealed the formation of a tetracoordinate borate upon the addition of fluoride, narrowing the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap and enhancing the charge&#8208;transfer character in the excited state. This approach has also been demonstrated in modulating the photophysical properties of solid&#8208;state films.

         <title>Layer&#8208;Controllable &#8220;2.5D&#8221; DNA Origami Crystals Synthesized by a Hierarchical Assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical assembly strategy for fabricating &#8220;2.5D&#8221; (2.5 dimensional) DNA origami crystals with customizable layer properties and achieve various 2.5D assemblies with different layer numbers, interlayer distances and surface morphologies.







Abstract
The finite periodic arrangement of functional nanomaterials on the two&#8208;dimensional scale enables the integration and enhancement of individual properties, making them an important research topic in the field of tuneable nanodevices. Although layer&#8208;controllable lattices such as graphene have been successfully synthesized, achieving similar control over colloidal nanoparticles remains a challenge. DNA origami technology has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in programmed nanoparticle assembly. Based on this technology, we proposed a hierarchical assembly strategy to construct a universal DNA origami platform with customized layer properties, which we called 2.5&#8208;dimensional (2.5D) DNA origami crystals. Methodologically, this strategy divides the assembly procedure into two steps: 1) array synthesis, and 2) lattice synthesis, which means that the layer properties, including layer number, interlayer distance, and surface morphology, can be flexibly customized based on the independent designs in each step. In practice, these synthesized 2.5D crystals not only pioneer the expansion of the DNA origami crystal library to a wider range of dimensions, but also highlight the technological potential for templating 2.5D colloidal nanomaterial lattices.

         <title>Tensile Strain&#8208;Mediated Bimetallene Nanozyme for Enhanced Photothermal Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.







Abstract
Nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential in combating malignant tumor proliferation through catalytic therapy. However, the therapeutic effect is often limited by insufficient catalytic performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of strain engineering in metallenes to fully expose the active regions due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we present the first report on a novel tensile strain&#8208;mediated local amorphous RhRu (la&#8208;RhRu) bimetallene with exceptional intrinsic photothermal effect and photo&#8208;enhanced multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Through geometric phase analysis, electron diffraction profile, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, it is revealed that crystalline&#8208;amorphous heterophase boundaries can generate approximately 2&#8201;% tensile strain in the bimetallene. The ultrathin structure and in&#8208;plane strain of the bimetallene induce an amplified strain effect. Both experimental and theoretical evidence support the notion that tensile strain promotes multiple enzyme&#8208;like activities. Functioning as a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanozyme, la&#8208;RhRu exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the tremendous potential of atomic&#8208;scale tensile strain engineering strategy in enhancing tumor catalytic therapy.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Thermal and Hydrolytic Resistance in Chemically Circular Polyesters via In&#8208;Chain 1,3&#8208;Cyclobutane Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyesters P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), with 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone, have been developed to demonstrate exceptional thermal stability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) and resistance to hydrolysis (intact in pH&#8197;0&#8211;14). Distinguished from classic polyesters, they exhibit good chemical circularity and offer adjustable material performances comparable to those of non&#8208;degradable syndiotactic polystyrene and low&#8208;density polyethylene.







Abstract
Polyesters, a highly promising class of circular polymers for achieving a closed&#8208;loop sustainable plastic economy, inherently exhibit material stability defects, especially in thermal and hydrolytic instability. Here, we introduce a class of polyesters, P(4R&#8208;BL) (R=Ph, Bu), featuring conformationally rigid 1,3&#8208;cyclobutane rings in the backbone. These polyesters not only exhibit superior thermostability (Td,5%=376&#8211;380&#8201;&#176;C) but also demonstrate exceptional hydrolytic resistance with good integrity even after 1 year in basic and acidic aqueous solutions, distinguishing themselves from typical counterparts. Tailoring the flexibility of the side group R enables the controlled thermal and mechanical performance of P(4Ph&#8208;BL) and P(4Bu&#8208;BL) to rival durable syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS) and low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), respectively. Significantly, despite their high stability, both polyesters can be effectively depolymerized into pristine monomers, establishing a circular life cycle.
