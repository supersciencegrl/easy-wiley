         <title>Precisely Patterned Channels in a Vertical Organic Electrochemical Transistor with a Diazirine Photo&#8208;Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#160;rely on both efficient ionic doping/de&#8208;doping process and carrier transport in the mixed ionic&#8208;electronic channel under the modulation of gate bias. Moreover, channels that hold photopatterning capability are highly desired to minimize parasitic capacitance and simplify the fabrication process/cost. However, yielding photo&#8208;patternable channels with both precise/robust patterning capability and controllable ionic&#8208;electronic coupling is still challenging. Herein, double&#8208;end trifluoromethyl diazirines (DtFDA) with different chain lengths are introduced in the OECT channel to act as both photo&#8208;crosslinker and medium to regulate ionic&#8208;electronic transport. Specifically, high&#8208;resolution patterns with a minimum line width/gap of 2 &#181;m are realized in p(g2T&#8208;T) or Homo&#8208;gDPP based channels by introducing DtFDA. Maximum transconductances of 68.6 mS and 81.6 mS, current on/off ratio of 106 and 107 (under a drain voltage of only &#177;0.1 V),&#160;are achieved in p&#8208; and n&#8208;type vertical OECTs (vOECTs), respectively, along with current densities exceeding 1 kA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability of more than 100,000 cycles (2000 seconds). This work provides a new and facile strategy for the fabrication of vOECT channels with high resolution and high performance via the introduction of a simple and efficient crosslinker.</dc:description>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Organogold(III) Complexes Enable High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillation and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic scintillators have recently attracted growing attention for X&#8208;ray detection in industrial and medical applications. However, these materials still face critical obstacles of low attenuation efficiency and/or inefficient triplet exciton utilization. Here we developed a new category of organogold(III) complexes, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;1 and Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2, through adopting a through&#8208;space interaction motif to realize high X&#8208;ray attenuation efficiency and efficient harvesting of triplet excitons for emission. Thanks to the efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer process, this panel of complexes achieved higher photoluminescence quantum yield and shorter radiative lifetimes compared with the through&#8208;bond reference complexes. Inspiringly, these organogold(III) complexes exhibited polarity&#8208;dependent emission origins: thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, Tp&#8208;Au&#8208;2 manifested intense radioluminescence together with a record&#8208;high scintillation light yield of 77,600 photons MeV&#8208;1 for organic scintillators. The resulting scintillator screens demonstrated high&#8208;quality X&#8208;ray imaging with &gt;16.0 line pairs mm&#8211;1 spatial resolution, outstripping most organic and inorganic scintillators. This finding provides a feasible strategy for the design of superior organic X&#8208;ray scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphine Boranes via Crystallization&#8208;Induced Dynamic Resolution of Lithiated Intermediate by Understanding the Underlying Epimerization Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Described herein is the successful crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic resolution (CIDR) of an &#945;&#8208;lithiated phosphine borane utilizing the easily accessible and inexpensive ligand (R,R)&#8208;TMCDA. Starting from the essential P&#8208;prochiral building block dimethyl phenyl phosphine borane we were able to obtain phosphine boranes in yields up to 80% and e.r. up to 98:2 by crystallization of the lithiated intermediate prior to the trapping reaction. NMR&#8208;based deuterium labeling experiments indicate that the epimerization in solution is based on the intermolecular proton transfer between nonlithiated phosphine borane and the corresponding lithiated intermediate, rendering the presence of the remaining starting compound in an optimized solvent mixture the main factor for successful enantioselective synthesis. Quantum chemical calculations using different model systems based on solid state structures confirm these experimental results. By gaining insights into the epimerization mechanism, essential principles for CIDR of lithiated phosphine boranes are elucidated that may be expanded to other important P&#8208;stereogenic compounds and simple chiral amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkoxycarbonyl Groups in Metalloesters Showing Oxocarbenium&#8208;like Structure and Alkylating Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the well&#8208;documented acylating reactivity, the alkylating reactivity of the alkoxycarbonyl group, as signified by its oxocarbenium&#8208;like resonance structure, remains almost&#160;unexplored. Herein, the first series of Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters exhibiting the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups were synthesized and characterized. In these deformed alkoxycarbonyl groups, the Ccarbonyl&#8211;Oalkoxyl bonds were contracted to 1.177(11) ~ 1.191(9) &#197; with the elongations of the Ccarbonyl=Ocarbonyl bonds to 1.368(13) ~ 1.441(9) &#197;. Meanwhile, the O&#8211;Calkyl bonds were also elongated to 1.522(11) ~ 1.607(15) &#197;, and were by far the longest O&#8211;Calkyl bonds reported for alkoxycarbonyl groups. As triggered by the long O&#8208;Calkyl distances, the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like methoxycarbonyl group towards a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism at ambient conditions was examined. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;etherifications of alcohols mediated by the Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters were investigated. The yields followed the trend ethanol &gt;&gt; n&#8208;propanol &gt;&gt; n&#8208;butanol &#8776; n&#8208;pentanol, that closely related to the structure features of the alkoxycarbonyl groups in corresponding metalloesters: while the ethoxycarbonyl group showed the reactive oxocarbenium&#8208;like framework, the n&#8208;propoxycarbonyl group displayed the dioxocarbenium&#8208;like skeleton with a shorter O&#8211;Calkyl bond; In comparison, the classical frameworks with unactivated alkyl moieties were observed for n&#8208;butoxycarbonyl and n&#8208;pentoxycarbonyl groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Cu Plates with Steady Fluid Fields for High&#8208;rate Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia and Efficient Zn&#8208;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas in a microfluid flow cell to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8722;RR setup provided superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis, and could be extended to assemble efficient Zn&#8208;nitrate batteries.







Abstract
Nitrate electroreduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3) provides a promising strategy for nitrogen utilization, while achieving high selectivity and durability at an industrial scale has remained challenging. Herein, we demonstrated that the performance of eNO3&#8722;RR could be significantly boosted by introducing two&#8208;dimensional Cu plates as electrocatalysts and eliminating the general carrier gas to construct a steady fluid field. The developed eNO3&#8722;RR setup provided superior NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99&#8201;%, exceptional long&#8208;term electrolysis for 120&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and a record&#8208;high yield rate of 3.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Furthermore, the proposed strategy was successfully extended to the Zn&#8208;nitrate battery system, providing a power density of 12.09&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 FE of 85.4&#8201;%, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eNO3&#8722;RR catalysts. Coupled with the COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ infrared spectroscopy, the main contributor for the high&#8208;efficiency NH3 production could be the steady fluid field to timely rejuvenate the electrocatalyst surface during the electrocatalysis.

Coupled with the COMSOL multiphysics simulations and in situ infrared spectroscopy, the main contributor for the high-efficiency NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production could be the steady fluid field to timely rejuvenate the electrocatalyst surface during the electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Descriptor&#8208;Based Volcano Relations Predict Single Atoms for Hydroxylamine Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior hydroxylamine (NH2OH) selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proven to enhance NH2OH formation.







Abstract
Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is an important feedstock in fuels, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. Nanostructured electrocatalysts drive green electrosynthesis of hydroxylamine from nitrogen oxide species in water. However, current electrocatalysts still suffer from low selectivity and manpower&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error modes, leaving unclear selectivity/activity origins and a lack of catalyst design principles. Herein, we theoretically analyze key determinants of selectivity/activity and propose the adsorption energy of NHO (Gad(*NHO)) as a performance descriptor. A weak *NH2OH binding affinity and a favorable reaction pathway (*NHO pathway) jointly enable single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with superior NH2OH selectivity. Then, an activity volcano plot of Gad(*NHO) is established to predict a series of SACs and discover Mn SACs as optimal electrocatalysts that exhibit pH&#8208;dependent activity. These theoretical prediction results are also confirmed by experimental results, rationalizing our Gad(*NHO) descriptor. Furthermore, Mn&#8722;Co geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) are predicted to optimize Gad(*NHO) and are experimentally proved to enhance NH2OH formation.

         <title>Unveiling pH&#8208;Dependent Adsorption Strength of *CO2&#8722; Intermediate over High&#8208;Density Sn Single Atom Catalyst for Acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalyst is presented and ATR&#8208;FTIR is used to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722;, a key intermediate in acidic electrolyte on its surface. It is shown that the increase of electrolyte pH results in a redshift of the peak position of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate, i.e., the adsorption strength of the *CO2&#8722; intermediate increases, which in turn affects the performance of CO2RR to direct HCOOH in acidic electrolyte.







Abstract
The acidic electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for direct formic acid (HCOOH) production holds promise in meeting the carbon&#8208;neutral target, yet its performance is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Understanding the adsorption strength of the key intermediates in acidic electrolyte is indispensable to favor CO2RR over HER. In this work, high&#8208;density Sn single atom catalysts (SACs) were prepared and used as catalyst, to reveal the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength and coverage of *CO2&#8722; intermediatethat enables enhanced acidic CO2RR towards direct HCOOH production. At pH=3, Sn SACs could deliver a high Faradaic efficiency (90.8&#8201;%) of HCOOH formation and a corresponding partial current density up to &#8722;178.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The detailed in situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopic studies reveal that a favorable alkaline microenvironment for CO2RR to HCOOH is formed near the surface of Sn SACs, even in the acidic electrolyte. More importantly, the pH&#8208;dependent adsorption strength of *CO2&#8722; intermediate is unravelled over the Sn SACs, which in turn affects the competition between HER and CO2RR in acidic electrolyte.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Robust MOF for Challenging Ethylene Purification and Propylene Recovery with Record Productivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonpolar pore environments with N/O active sites in a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) are generated for ethylene purification and propylene recovery. The material exhibits the good balance between excellent separation performance, facile scale synthesis, economic feasibility and high stability for applications.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) purification and propylene (C3H6) recovery are highly relevant in polymer synthesis, yet developing physisorbents for these industrial separation faces the challenges of merging easy scalability, economic feasibility, high moisture stability with great separation efficiency. Herein, we reported a robust and scalable MOF (MAC&#8208;4) for simultaneous recovery of C3H6 and C2H4. Through creating nonpolar pores decorated by accessible N/O sites, MAC&#8208;4 displays top&#8208;tier uptakes and selectivities for C2H6 and C3H6 over C2H4 at ambient conditions. Molecular modelling combined with infrared spectroscopy revealed that C2H6 and C3H6 molecules were trapped in the framework with stronger contacts relative to C2H4. Breakthrough experiments demonstrated exceptional separation performance for binary C2H6/C2H4 and C3H6/C2H4 as well as ternary C3H6/C2H6/C2H4 mixtures, simultaneously affording record productivities of 27.4 and 36.2&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for high&#8208;purity C2H4 (&#8805;99.9&#8201;%) and C3H6 (&#8805;99.5&#8201;%). MAC&#8208;4 was facilely prepared at deckgram&#8208;scale under reflux condition within 3&#8197;hours, making it as a smart MOF to address challenging gas separations.

         <title>In situ and Real&#8208;time Monitoring the Chemical and Thermal Evolution of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries with Single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A buried flexible optical fiber in the pouch&#8208;type lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) enable in situ and real&#8208;time temperature monitoring during charge/discharge process. Batteries with single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) cathode show a much lower temperature rise and alleviated phase transition at elevated temperature compared to polycrystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;PC) cathode, highlighting NCM&#8208;SC&#8242;s enhanced thermal stability.







Abstract
High&#8208;capacity Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for fabrication of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, thermal runaway of LIBs with these cathodes leads to great safety concerns. In this study, single crystalline LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 (NCM&#8208;SC) has been prepared and a flexible optical fiber was buried inside the pouch&#8208;type LIBs with NCM&#8208;SC cathode to in situ study its real&#8208;time temperature evolution during charge/discharge process. NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an enhanced Li+ ions transportation efficiency and electrode reaction kinetics, which can effectively reduce the generation of polarization heat and mitigate the internal temperature rise of the pouch&#8208;type battery. Meanwhile, solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) film decomposition and gas accumulation are effectively alleviated, due to the enhanced thermal stability of SEI film formed on NCM&#8208;SC. Moreover, the single crystal architecture can effectively retard layered to spinal and rock&#8208;salt phase transition, mitigate the crack formation and structural collapse. Consequently, NCM&#8208;SC exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance and enhanced thermal stability.

&lt;p&gt;High-capacity Ni-rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for fabrication of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density. However, thermal runaway of LIBs with these cathodes leads to great safety concerns. In this study, single crystalline LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM-SC) has been prepared and a flexible optical fiber was buried inside the pouch-type LIBs with NCM-SC cathode to in situ study its real-time temperature evolution during charge/discharge process. NCM-SC exhibits an enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions transportation efficiency and electrode reaction kinetics, which can effectively reduce the generation of polarization heat and mitigate the internal temperature rise of the pouch-type battery. Meanwhile, solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) film decomposition and gas accumulation are effectively alleviated, due to the enhanced thermal stability of SEI film formed on NCM-SC. Moreover, the single crystal architecture can effectively retard layered to spinal and rock-salt phase transition, mitigate the crack formation and structural collapse. Consequently, NCM-SC exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance and enhanced thermal stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrophilic Activation of S&#8722;Si Reagents by Silylium Ions for Their Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Addition Across C&#8722;C Multiple Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ&#8208;generated bissilylated sulfonium ion is the actual catalyst in highly regio&#8208; and diastereoselective addition reactions of thiosilanes across the C&#8722;C multiple bonds of alkynes and allenes, respectively (see scheme). These thiosilylation reactions enable the direct installation of two orthogonal linchpins for further chemoselective functional&#8208;group manipulation.







Abstract
A regioselective silylium&#8208;ion&#8208;promoted thiosilylation of internal C&#8722;C triple bonds with control over the double bond geometry is described. Both a C(sp2)&#8722;S and a C(sp2)&#8722;Si bond are formed with a trans relationship in this two&#8208;component reaction of an alkyne and a thiosilane. The resulting orthogonally functionalized C&#8722;C double bond can be chemoselectively defunctionalized or further processed by cross&#8208;coupling reactions with the alkene configuration retained. The procedure is also applicable to the regio&#8208; and diastereoselective thiosilylation of terminal allenes to arrive at allylic thioethers containing a vinylsilane unit. These reactions involve the electrophilic activation of the S&#8722;Si reagent, both a silylated thiophenol and even alkylthiol derivative, by an in situ&#8208;generated carbocation intermediate. The catalytic cycle is maintained by a bissilylated aryl&#8208; or alkylsulfonium ion as a shuttle for the cationic silicon electrophile. Its independent preparation and structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction are also reported.

         <title>Incorporation of an Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate into a Thin Film for Choline Recognition in an Aqueous System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of &#8216;aniono&#8217; helicates have been formed by the coordination of tetraphenylethene&#8208;decorated anion&#8208;binding ligand with phosphate ions. The triple helicates can be solution&#8208;processed with a polymethyl methacrylate matrix to generate functional thin films with multiple optical properties and used to recognize choline and its derivatives in water.







Abstract
Functional thin films, being fabricated by incorporating discrete supramolecular architectures, have potential applications in research areas such as sensing, energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics. Here, we have determined that an anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate can be solution&#8208;processed into a functional thin film by incorporation into a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix. The thin films fabricated by the incorporation of the anion&#8208;coordinated triple helicate show multiple optical properties, such as fluorescence, CD, and CPL. In addition, the film has the ability to recognize choline and choline derivatives in a water system. The successful recognition of Ch+ by the film represents the first example of utilizing &#8216;aniono&#8217;&#8208;supramolecular architectures for biomolecule detection in aqueous solution and opens up a new route for designing biocompatible functional materials.

         <title>Graphitic Armor: A Natural Molecular Sieve for Robust Hydrogen Electroxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, graphite armor serves as a natural molecule sieve screening out bulky adversative molecules like O2 or CO but allowing H2 to diffuse along both the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane direction. This creates perfect chance for fabricating robust HOR electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Carbon coating layers have been found to improve the catalytic performance of transition metals, which is usually explained as an outcome of electronic synergistic effect. Herein we reveal that the defective graphitic carbon, with a unique interlayer gap of 0.342&#8197;nm, can be a highly selective natural molecular sieve. It allows efficient diffusion of hydrogen molecules or radicals both along the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, but sterically hinders the diffusion of molecules with larger kinetic diameter (e.g., CO and O2) along the in&#8208;plane direction. As a result, poisonous species lager than 0.342&#8197;nm are sieved out, even when their adsorption on the metal is thermodynamically strong; at the same time, the interaction between H2 and the metal is not affected. This natural molecular sieve provides a very chance for constructing robust metal catalysts for hydrogen&#8208;relevant processes, which are more tolerant to chemical or electrochemical oxidation or CO&#8208;relevant poisoning.

         <title>Significance of Vibronic Coupling that Shapes Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Double Helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates how molecular vibrations influence the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of double helicenes DPC and DNH. It highlights how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (g) factor values, emphasizing the role of Herzberg&#8208;Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.







Abstract
The circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra of S&#8208; and X&#8208;shaped double helicenes exhibit distinct vibrational structures and overall shape variations. In this study, we conducted an in&#8208;depth investigation into the vibronic effects influencing the CPL spectra of two double helicenes, namely DPC and DNH. Employing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computations utilizing the FC&#8208;HT1|VH model at the CAM&#8722;B3LYP/def2&#8208;TZVP level, we unveiled the paramount impact of Franck&#8211;Condon (FC), Herzberg&#8208;Teller (HT), and Duschinsky effects on their chiroptical responses. Our research underscores the pivotal role of structural deformations associated with the S1&#8208;to&#8208;S0 electronic transition in molding CPL spectra and wavelength&#8208;dependent dissymmetry (g) factor values, as well as the significance of HT effects in shaping and enhancing CPL responses. This extensive investigation not only advances our comprehension of the vibronic characteristics in configurationally distinct double helicenes but also offers valuable insights for the design of chiral molecules featuring controllable or finely&#8208;tunable CPL responses.

&lt;p&gt;This study investigates how molecular vibrations influence the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of double helicenes &lt;b&gt;DPC&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DNH&lt;/b&gt;. It highlights how structural changes during electronic transitions shape CPL spectra and dissymmetry (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;) factor values, emphasizing the role of Herzberg-Teller effects in enhancing CPL responses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;-shaped double helicenes exhibit distinct vibrational structures and overall shape variations. In this study, we conducted an in-depth investigation into the vibronic effects influencing the CPL spectra of two double helicenes, namely &lt;b&gt;DPC&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;DNH&lt;/b&gt;. Employing state-of-the-art computations utilizing the FC-HT&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|VH model at the CAM&#8722;B3LYP/def2-TZVP level, we unveiled the paramount impact of Franck&#8211;Condon (FC), Herzberg-Teller (HT), and Duschinsky effects on their chiroptical responses. Our research underscores the pivotal role of structural deformations associated with the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-to-S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; electronic transition in molding CPL spectra and wavelength-dependent dissymmetry (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;) factor values, as well as the significance of HT effects in shaping and enhancing CPL responses. This extensive investigation not only advances our comprehension of the vibronic characteristics in configurationally distinct double helicenes but also offers valuable insights for the design of chiral molecules featuring controllable or finely-tunable CPL responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Template&#8208;Directed Synthesis of Strained meso&#8208;meso&#8208;Linked Porphyrin Nanorings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding to a template bends a photonic wire consisting of 18 meso&#8208;meso linked porphyrins into a ring, allowing covalent cyclization by Glaser coupling, to yield a strained nanoring. The 18&#8208;legged template was synthesized efficiently via six&#8208;fold iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H borylation. The nanoring was characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).







Abstract
Strained macrocycles display interesting properties, such as conformational rigidity, often resulting in enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation or enhanced affinity for non&#8208;covalent guest binding, yet they can be difficult to synthesize. Here we use computational modeling to design a template to direct the formation of an 18&#8208;porphyrin nanoring with direct meso&#8208;meso bonds between the porphyrin units. Coupling of a linear 18&#8208;porphyrin oligomer in the presence of this template gives the target nanoring, together with an unexpected 36&#8208;porphyrin ring by&#8208;product. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) revealed the elliptical conformations and flexibility of these nanorings on a Au(111) surface.

         <title>Electrostatic Field in Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis Driven C&#8208;F Bond Cleavage of Perfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent and toxic to human health. It is demanding for high&#8208;efficient and green technologies to remove PFASs from water. In this study, a novel PFAS treatment technology was developed, utilizing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) particles (1~5 &#956;m) as the catalyst and a low frequency ultrasound (US, 40 kHz, 0.3 W/cm2) for activation. Remarkably, this system can induce near&#8208;complete defluorination for different structured PFASs. The underlying mechanism relies on contact electrification between PTFE and water, which induces cumulative electrons on PTFE surface, and creates a high surface voltage (tens of volts). Such high surface voltage can generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS, i.e., O2&#8226;&#8211;, HO&#8226;, etc.) and a strong interfacial electrostatic field (IEF of 109~1010 V/m). Consequently, the strong IEF significantly activates PFAS molecules and reduces the energy barrier of O2&#8226;&#8211; nucleophilic reaction. Simultaneously, the co&#8208;existence of surface electrons (PTFE*(e&#8722;)) and HO&#8226; enables synergetic reduction and oxidation of PFAS and its intermediates, leading to enhanced and thorough defluorination. The US/PTFE method shows compelling advantages of low energy consumption, zero chemical input, and few harmful intermediates. It offers a new and promising solution for effectively treating the PFAS&#8208;contaminated drinking water.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Homolytic Cleavage of H2O2 on Hydroxyl&#8208;Enriched Spinel CuFe2O4 with Dual Lewis Acid Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional H2O2 cleavage mediated by macroscopic electron transfer (MET) not only has low utilization of H2O2, but also sacrifices the stability of catalysts. We present a non&#8208;redox hydroxyl&#8208;enriched spinel (CuFe2O4) catalyst with dual Lewis acid sites to realize the homolytic cleavage of H2O2. The results of systematic experiments, in&#8208;situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations confirm that tetrahedral Cu sites with optimal Lewis acidity and strong electron delocalization can synergistically elongate the O&#8211;O bonds (1.47 &#197; &#8594; 1.87 &#197;) in collaboration with adjacent bridging hydroxyl (another Lewis acid site). As a result, the free energy of H2O2 homolytic cleavage is decreased (1.28 eV &#8594; 0.98 eV). H2O2 can be efficiently split into &#8226;OH induced by hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 without MET, which greatly improves the catalyst stability and the H2O2 utilization (65.2%, nearly 2 times than traditional catalysts). The system assembled with hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 and H2O2 affords exceptional performance for organic pollutant elimination. The scale&#8208;up experiment using a continuous flow reactor realizes long&#8208;term stability (up to 600 mL), confirming the tremendous potential of hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Oxo Electronic Tuning via In Situ CO Decoration for Promoted Methane Conversion to Oxygenates over Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct methane conversion (DMC) to oxygenates at low temperature is of great value but remains challenging due to the high energy barrier for C&#8208;H bond activation. Here, we report that in situ decoration of Pd1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 single atom catalyst (SAC) by CO molecules significantly promoted the DMC reaction, giving the highest turnover frequency of 207 h&#8208;1 ever reported at room temperature and ~100% oxygenates selectivity with H2O2 as oxidant. Combined characterizations and DFT calculations illustrate that the C&#8208;atom of CO prefers to coordinate with Pd1, which donates electrons to the Pd1&#8208;O active center (L&#8208;Pd1&#8208;O, L = CO) generated by H2O2 oxidation. The correspondingly improved electron density over Pd&#8208;O pair renders a favorable heterolytic dissociation of C&#8208;H bond with low energy barrier of 0.48 eV. Applying CO decoration strategy to M1&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 (M = Pd, Rh, Ru, Fe) enables improvement of oxygenates productivity by 3.2 ~ 11.3 times, highlighting the generalizability of this method in tuning metal&#8208;oxo electronic structure of SACs for efficient DMC process.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Zeta Potential Modulation as a Handle to Control the Crystallization Kinetics of Tin Halide Perovskites for Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have demonstrated exceptional potential for various applications owing to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the crystallization kinetics of THPs are less controllable than its lead counterpart because of the higher Lewis acidity of Sn2+, leading to THP films with poor morphology and rampant defects. Here, a colloidal zeta potential modulation approach is developed to improve the crystallization kinetics of THP films inspired by the classical Derjaguin&#8208;Landau&#8208;Verwey&#8208;Overbeek (DLVO) theory. After adding 3&#8208;aminopyrrolidine dihydro iodate (APDI2) in the precursor solution to change the zeta potential of the pristine colloids, the total interaction potential energy between colloidal particles with APDI2 could be controllably reduced, resulting in a higher coagulation probability and a lower critical nuclei concentration. In&#8208;situ laser light scattering measurements confirmed the increased nucleation rate of the THP colloids with APDI2. The resulting film with APDI2 shows a pinhole&#8208;free morphology with fewer defects, achieving an impressive efficiency of 15.13%.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Charge Transfer Process and Photocatalytic Activity over a Phosphonate&#8208;based MOF via Amorphization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the intrinsic relationship between the property and amorphous structural was studied. Distorted metal nodes in amorphous metal&#8211;organic frameworks affect the electronic structure with downshifted conduction band (CB) potential, which facilitates the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) process and O2 activation. Amorphous material displays a better photocatalytic activity of toluene oxidation than crystalline one (2.45&#8197;times).







Abstract
Recently, amorphous materials have gained great attention as an emerging kind of functional material, and their characteristics such as isotropy, absence of grain boundaries, and abundant defects are very likely to outrun the disadvantages of crystalline counterparts, such as low conductivity, and ultimately lead to improved charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we investigated the effect of amorphization on the charge transfer process and photocatalytic performance with a phosphonate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (FePPA) as the research object. Comprehensive experimental results suggest that compared to crystalline FePPA, amorphous FePPA has more distorted metal nodes, which affects the electron distribution and consequently improves the photogenerated charge separation efficiency. Meanwhile, the distorted metal nodes in amorphous FePPA also greatly promote the adsorption and activation of O2. Hence, amorphous FePPA exhibits a better performance of photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation for selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde. This work illustrates the advantages of amorphous MOFs in the charge transfer process, which is conducive to the further development of high performance MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Controlled Synthesis of Oriented Quasi&#8208;Spherical CsPbBr3 Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven approach is employed to achieve the controlled synthesis of four types of CsPbBr3 crystals and successfully control the orientation of quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 structures. Synthesis parameters are optimized using high&#8208;throughput characterization combined with machine learning. Furthermore, the synthetic mechanism is determined. Oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, screened by using the data&#8208;driven approach, exhibit significantly improved optical properties.







Abstract
Controlled synthesis of lead&#8208;halide perovskite crystals is challenging yet attractive because of the pivotal role played by the crystal structure and growth conditions in regulating their properties. This study introduces data&#8208;driven strategies for the controlled synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3, alongside an investigation into the synthesis mechanism. High&#8208;throughput rapid characterization of absorption spectra and color under ultraviolet illumination was conducted using 23 possible ligands for the synthesis of CsPbBr3 crystals. The links between the absorption spectra slope (difference in the absorbance at 400&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm divided by a wavelength interval of 50&#8197;nm) and crystal size were determined through statistical analysis of more than 100 related publications. Big data analysis and machine learning were employed to investigate a total of 688 absorption spectra and 652 color values, revealing correlations between synthesis parameters and properties. Ex situ characterization confirmed successful synthesis of oriented quasi&#8208;spherical CsPbBr3 perovskites using polyvinylpyrrolidone and Acacia. Density functional theory calculations highlighted strong adsorption of Acacia on the (110) facet of CsPbBr3. Optical properties of the oriented quasi&#8208;spherical perovskites prepared with these data&#8208;driven strategies were significantly improved. This study demonstrates that data&#8208;driven controlled synthesis facilitates morphology&#8208;controlled perovskites with excellent optical properties.

         <title>Directed Electron Delivery from a Pb&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite to a Co(II) Molecular Catalyst Boosts CO2 Photoreduction Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is appealing to address energy and environmental issues, while it is challenging to avoid using toxic metals and organic sacrificial reagents. We here immobilize a family of cobalt phthalocyanine catalysts on Pb&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets with delicate control on the anchors of the cobalt catalysts. Among them, the molecular hybrid photocatalyst assembled by carboxyl anchors achieves the optimal performance with an electron consumption rate of 300&#177;13 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation to O2, over 8 times of the unmodified Cs2AgBiBr6 (36&#177;8 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), also far surpassing the documented systems (&lt; 150 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Besides the improved intrinsic activity, electrochemical, computational, ex&#8208;/in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic results indicate that the electrons photogenerated at the Bi atoms of Cs2AgBiBr6 can be directionally transferred to the cobalt catalyst via the carboxyl anchors which strongly bind to the Bi atoms, substantially facilitating the interfacial electron transfer kinetics and thereby the photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Water Surface Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Cationic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Films as the Anion&#8208;Selective Electrode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinylene&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional polymers (V&#8208;2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked covalent organic frameworks (V&#8208;2D COFs) featuring high in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and robust frameworks have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;related applications. However, current synthetic approaches are restricted to producing V&#8208;2D COF powders that lack processability, impeding their integration into devices, particularly within membrane technologies reliant upon thin films. Herein, we report the novel on&#8208;water surface synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked cationic 2DPs films (V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 and V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;2) via Knoevenagel polycondensation, which serve as the anion&#8208;selective electrode coating for highly&#8208;reversible and durable zinc&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (ZDIBs). Model reactions and theoretical modeling revealed the enhanced reactivity and reversibility of Knoevenagel reaction on the water surface. On this basis, we demonstrated the on&#8208;water surface 2D polycondensation towards V&#8208;C2DPs films that show large lateral size, tunable thickness, and high chemical stability. Representatively, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 presents as a fully&#8208;crystalline and face&#8208;on oriented film with in&#8208;plane lattice parameters of a=b=~43.3 &#197;. Profiting from its well&#8208;defined cationic sites, oriented 1D channels, and stable frameworks, V&#8208;C2DP&#8208;1 film possesses superior bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8208;)&#8208;transport selectivity (transference, t&#8722;=0.85) for graphite cathode in high&#8208;voltage ZDIBs, thus triggering additional TFSI&#8208;&#8208;intercalation stage and promoting its specific capacity (from ~83 to 124 mAh g&#8208;1) and cycling life (&gt;1000 cycles, 95% capacity retention).</dc:description>

         <title>A Conjugated Phenylene Nanocage with a Guest&#8208;Adaptive Deformable Cavity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The highly strained, phenylene&#8208;derived organic cages are typically regarded as very rigid entities, yet their deformation potential and supramolecular properties remain underexplored. Herein, we report a pliable conjugated phenylene nanocage by synergistically merging rigid and flexible building blocks. The anisotropic cage molecule contains branched phenylene chains capped by a calix[6]arene moiety, the delicate conformational changes of which endow the cage with a remarkably deformable cavity. When complexing with fullerene guests, the cage showcases excellent guest&#8208;adaptivity, with its cavity volume capable to swell by as much as 85%.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Directed Attachment of Hydroxylamines to Specific Lysines of IgG Antibodies for Bioconjugations with Acylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of monoclonal antibodies as vehicles to deliver payloads has evolved as a powerful tool in cancer therapy in recent years. The clinical development of therapeutic antibody&#8208;conjugates with precise payloads holds great promise for targeted therapeutic interventions. The use of affinity&#8208;peptide mediated functionalization of native off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf antibodies offers an effective approach to selectively modify IgG antibodies with a drug antibody ratio (DAR) of 2. Here, we report the traceless, peptide&#8208;directed attachment of two hydroxylamines to native IgGs followed by chemoselective potassium acyltrifluboroborate (KA) ligation with quinolinium acyltrifluoroborates (QATs), which provide enhanced ligation rates with hydroxylamines under physiological conditions. By applying KAT ligation to the modified antibodies, conjugation of small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides to off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf IgGs proceeds efficiently, in good yields, and with simultaneous cleavage of the affinity peptide&#8208;directing moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur in Waste&#8208;Free Sustainable Synthesis: Advancing Carbon&#8208;Carbon Coupling Techniques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review explores the pivotal role of sulfur in advancing sustainable carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8211;C) coupling reactions. The unique electronic properties of sulfur, as a soft Lewis base with significant mesomeric effect make it an excellent candidate for initiating radical transformations, directing C&#8211;H&#8208;activation, and facilitating cycloaddition and C&#8211;S bond dissociation reactions. These attributes are crucial for developing waste&#8208;free methodologies in green chemistry. Our mini&#8208;review is focused on existing sulfur&#8208;directed C&#8211;C coupling techniques, emphasizing their sustainability and comparing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods with traditional approaches. The review highlights the importance of this research in addressing current challenges in organic synthesis and catalysis. The innovative use of sulfur in photocatalytic, electrochemical and metal&#8208;catalyzed processes not only exemplifies significant advancements in the field but also opens new avenues for environmentally friendly chemical processes. By focusing on atom economy and waste minimization, the analysis provides broad appeal and potential for future developments in sustainable organic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable polymers with high performance and infinite scalability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our society has been pursuing high&#8208;performance biodegradable polymers made from facile methods and readily available monomers. Here, we demonstrate a library of enzyme&#8208;degradable polymers with desirable properties from the first reported step polyaddition of diamines, COS, and diacrylates. The polymers contain in&#8208;chain ester and thiourethane groups, which can serve as lipase&#8208;degradation and hydrogen&#8208;bonding physical crosslinking points, respectively, resulting in possible biodegradability as well as upgraded mechanical and thermal properties. Also, the properties of the polymers are scalable due to the versatile method and the wide variety of monomers. We obtain 46 polymers with tunable performance covering high&#8208;Tm crystalline plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and amorphous plastics by regulating polymer structure. Additionally, the polymerization method is highly efficient, atom&#8208;economical, quantitatively yield, metal&#8208; and even catalyst&#8208;free. Overall, the polymers are promising green materials given their degradability, simple and modular synthesis, remarkable and tunable properties, and readily available monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Circular Dichroism Sensing: Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The analysis of the absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition, and concentration of chiral compounds are frequently encountered tasks across the chemical and health sciences. Chiroptical sensing methods can streamline this work and allow high&#8208;throughput screening with remarkable reduction of operational time and cost. During the last few years, significant methodological advances with innovative chirality sensing systems, the use of computer&#8208;generated calibration curves, machine learning assistance, and chemometric data processing, to name a few, have emerged and are now matched with commercially available multi&#8208;well plate CD readers. These developments have reframed the chirality sensing space and provide new opportunities that are of interest to a large group of chemists. This review will discuss chirality sensing strategies and applications with representative small&#8208;molecule CD sensors. Emphasis will be given to important milestones and recent advances that accelerate chiral compound analysis by outperforming traditional methods, conquer new directions, and pioneering efforts that lie at the forefront of chiroptical high&#8208;throughput screening developments. The goal is to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the current state and a perspective of future directions of this rapidly emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanded Azahelicenes with Large Dissymmetry Factors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expanded azahelicenes, as heteroanalogues of helically chiral helicenes, hold significant potential for chiroptical materials. Nevertheless, their investigation and research have remained largely unexplored. Herein, we present the facile synthesis of a series of expanded azahelicenes NHn (n=1&#8208;5) consisting of 11, 19, 27, 35, and 43 fused rings, mainly by Suzuki coupling followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structures of NH2, NH3 and NH4 were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis, and their (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208; enantiomers were also isolated with chiral high performance liquid chromatography. The enantiomers exhibit large absorption (abs) and luminescence (lum) dissymmetry factors, with |gabs|max = 0.044; |glum|max = 0.003 for NH2, |gabs|max = 0.048; |glum| = 0.014 for NH3, and |gabs|max = 0.043; |glum|max = 0.021 for NH4, which are superior to their respective all&#8208;carbon analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Cancer Cell&#8208;selective PD&#8208;L1 Inhibition via a DNA Safety Catch to Enhance Immunotherapy Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immune checkpoint protein blockade (ICB) has emerged as a powerful immunotherapy approach, but suppressing immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) for noncancerous cells and normal tissues remains challenging. Activatable ICB has been developed with tumor microenvironment highly&#8208;expressed molecules as stimuli, but they still lack precision and efficiency considering the diffusion of stimuli molecules in whole tumor tissue. Here we assemble PD&#8208;L1 with a duplex DNA strand, termed as &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, to regulate its accessibility for ICB. The safety catch remains at &#8220;on&#8221; status for noncancerous cells to prevent ICB binding to PD&#8208;L1. Cancer cell membrane protein c&#8208;Met acts as a trigger protein to react with safety catch, which selectively exposes its hybridization region for ICB reagent. The ICB reagent is a retractable DNA nanostring with repeating hairpin&#8208;structural units, whose contraction drives PD&#8208;L1 clustering with endocytosis&#8208;guided degradation. The safety catch, even remained at &#8220;safety on&#8221; status, is removed from the cell membrane via a DNA strand displacement reaction to minimize its influence on noncancerous cells. This strategy demonstrates selective and potent immunotherapeutic capabilities only against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and shows effective suppression of irAEs in normal tissues, therefore would become a promising approach for precise immunotherapy in mice.</dc:description>

The safety catch, even remained at &#8220;safety on&#8221; status, is removed from the cell membrane via a DNA strand displacement reaction to minimize its influence on noncancerous cells. This strategy demonstrates selective and potent immunotherapeutic capabilities only against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and shows effective suppression of irAEs in normal tissues, therefore would become a promising approach for precise immunotherapy in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Collective Effect in a Multicomponent Ensemble Combining Single Atoms and Nanoparticles for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles, and Fe&#8722;CeO2 nanoparticles in an active multicomponent ensemble has been unraveled with the capacity to simultaneously enhance ORR activity (a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.948&#8197;V vs. RHE) and durability (negligible loss after 50k&#8197;cycles) in alkaline. Density functional theory and machine learning reveal the necessary electronic interactions (&#1013;d, Wf, &#956;B, Q) and geometric interactions (d and dFe&#8722;N) in a collective effect.







Abstract
Metal single&#8208;atom catalysts represent one of the most promising non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, they still suffer from insufficient activity and, particularly, durability for practical applications. Leveraging density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML), we unravel an unexpected collective effect between FeN4OH sites, CeN4OH motifs, Fe nanoparticles (NPs), and Fe&#8722;CeO2 NPs. The collective effect comprises differently&#8208;weighted electronic and geometric interactions, whitch results in significantly enhanced ORR activity for FeN4OH active sites with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.948&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE) in alkaline, relative to a commercial Pt/C (E1/2, 0.851&#8197;VRHE). Meanwhile, this collective effect endows the shortened Fe&#8722;N bonds and the remarkable durability with negligible activity loss after 50,000&#8197;potential cycles. The ML was used to understand the intricate geometric and electronic interactions in collective effect and reveal the intrinsic descriptors to account for the enhanced ORR performance. The universality of collective effect was demonstrated effective for the Co, Ni, Cu, Cr, and Mn&#8208;based multicomponent ensembles. These results confirm the importance of collective effect to simultaneously improve catalytic activity and durability.

         <title>Delocalization Engineering of Heme&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Enzymes for Augmented Reactive Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) were synthesized as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS production even than the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related catalysis has broad applicability. Herein, inspired by porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics, we report the synthesis of polyphthalocyanine&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE) as a new porphyrin&#8208;evolving structure to serve as efficient and versatile artificial enzymes for augmented reactive oxygen catalysis. Owing to the structural advantages, such as enhanced &#960;&#8208;conjugation networks and &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, promoted electron transfer, and unique Fe&#8722;N coordination centers, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE showed more efficient ROS&#8208;production activity in terms of Vmax and turnover numbers as compared with porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers (Fe&#8208;PPor&#8208;AE), which also surpassed reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art artificial enzymes in their activity. More interestingly, by changing the reaction medium and substrates, Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE also revealed significantly improved activity and environmental adaptivity in many other ROS&#8208;related biocatalytic processes, validating the potential of Fe&#8208;PPc&#8208;AE to replace conventional (poly)porphyrin&#8208;based heme mimics for ROS&#8208;related catalysis, biosensors, or biotherapeutics. It is suggested that this study will offer essential guidance for designing artificial enzymes based on organic molecules or polymers.

         <title>Aza[5]helicene&#8208;Derived Semiconducting Polymers for Improved Performance in Perovskite Solar Cells: Exploring Energetic and Morphological Influences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating copolymer of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, and phenoxazine, featured by matched energy levels, excellent film&#8208;forming properties, enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, was demonstrated for perovskite solar cells, which attain average initial efficiency of 25.5&#8201;%, excellent 85&#8201;&#176;C thermal stability, and operational stability under the full sunlight.







Abstract
The strategic design of solution&#8208;processable semiconducting polymers possessing both matched energy levels and elevated glass transition temperatures is of urgent importance in the progression of thermally robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 25&#8201;%. In this work, we employed direct arylation polymerization to achieve the high&#8208;yield synthesis of three aza[5]helicene&#8208;derived copolymers with distinct HOMO energy levels and exceptional glass transition temperatures. Upon integration of these semiconducting polymers into formamidinium lead triiodide&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, marked disparities in photovoltaic parameters manifest, primarily stemming from variations in the electrical conductivity and film morphology of the hole transport layers. The p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E copolymer, featuring a main chain comprising alternating repeats of aza[5]helicene, ethylenedioxythiophene, phenoxazine, and ethylenedioxythiophene, attains an initial average efficiency of 25.5&#8201;%, markedly surpassing reference materials such as spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (23.0&#8201;%), PTAA (17.0&#8201;%), and P3HT (11.6&#8201;%). Notably, p&#8208;A5HP&#8208;E&#8208;POZOD&#8208;E exhibits a high cohesive energy density, resulting in enhanced Young's modulus and diminished external species diffusion coefficients, thereby conferring perovskite solar cells with exceptional 85&#8201;&#176;C tolerance and operational stability.

Plasmonic photonic crystal enables efficient hydrogen evolution from water by harmonizing competing photonic and plasmonic effects to effectively trap and concentrate light onto plasmonic catalysts. This design demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution at 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic catalyst by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other emerging high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Integrating plasmonic nanoparticles with photonic crystals holds immense potential to enhance green hydrogen photosynthesis by amplifying localized electromagnetic field through generating surface plasmons and slow photons. Current plasmonic photonic designs primarily employ semiconductor&#8208;based structural backbone deposited with plasmonic nanoparticles. However, the competition between various optical phenomena in these ensembles hinders effective field enhancement rather than facilitating it. This limitation creates a formidable performance bottleneck that retards hydrogen evolution. Herein, we enhance plasmonic catalysis for efficient hydrogen evolution by effectively harmonizing plasmonic and photonic effects. This is achieved by using inert SiO2 opal as a non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic framework. By aligning the excitation wavelengths of surface plasmons and slow photons, our optimized plasmonic photonic crystals demonstrates a remarkable H2 evolution rate of 560&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gAg&#8722;1, surpassing bare plasmonic Ag nanoparticles by &gt;106&#8208;fold and other high&#8208;performance photocatalytic designs by 280&#8208;fold. Mechanistic studies highlight the pivotal role of the non&#8208;photoabsorbing photonic backbone in facilitating effective light confinement through the photonic effect. This in turn boosts the plasmonic field for enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution, even without needing additional co&#8208;catalysts. Our work offers valuable insights for future design of electromagnetically hot plasmonic catalysts to achieve efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical transformations in diverse energy, chemical, and environmental applications.

         <title>Thiophene &#960;&#8208;Bridge Manipulation of NIR&#8208;II AIEgens for Multimodal Tumor Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By elaborate thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge manipulation, BT&#8208;NS in which benzo[c]thiophene serves as &#960;&#8208;bridge is constructed. An integration of experimental and theoretical studies disclosed BT&#8208;NS is advantageous for NIR&#8208;II FLI/PAI/PTI trimodal imaging&#8208;guided PDT/PTT treatment of tumors, displaying outstanding therapeutic efficacy and excellent biocompatibility.







Abstract
The fabrication of a multimodal phototheranostic platform on the basis of single&#8208;component theranostic agent to afford both imaging and therapy simultaneously, is attractive yet full of challenges. The emergence of aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), particularly those emit fluorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II), provides a powerful tool for cancer treatment by virtue of adjustable pathway for radiative/non&#8208;radiative energy consumption, deeper penetration depth and aggregation&#8208;enhanced theranostic performance. Although bulky thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridges such as ortho&#8208;alkylated thiophene, 3,4&#8208;ethoxylene dioxythiophene and benzo[c]thiophene are commonly adopted to construct NIR&#8208;II AIEgens, the subtle differentiation on their theranostic behaviours has yet to be comprehensively investigated. In this work, systematical investigations discovered that AIEgen BT&#8208;NS bearing benzo[c]thiophene possesses acceptable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence emission intensity, efficient reactive oxygen species generation, and high photothermal conversion efficiency. Eventually, by using of BT&#8208;NS nanoparticles, unprecedented performance on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence/photoacoustic/photothermal imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photodynamic/photothermal elimination of tumors was demonstrated. This study thus offers useful insights into developing versatile phototheranostic systems for clinical trials.

         <title>Multisite Fine&#8208;Tuning in Hybrid Cadmium Halides Enables Wide Range Emissions for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale spectral regulation was demonstrated in a single matrix of [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) via multisite fine&#8208;tuning strategy, and the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions were established for multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting and multiple information storage through simply excitation changing.







Abstract
Achieving tunable emissions spanning the spectrum, from blue to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, within a single component is a formidable challenge with significant implication, particularly in tailoring multicolor luminescence for anti&#8208;counterfeiting purposes. In this study, we demonstrate a broad spectrum of emissions, covering blue to red and extending into NIR light in [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ (BPy=Butylpyridinium; X=Cl, Br; x=0 to 0.08) through precise multisite structural fine&#8208;tuning. Notably, the multicolor emissions from [BPy]2CdBr4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+ manifest a distinctive pattern, transitioning from blue to yellow in tandem with the host [BPy]2CdBr4 and further extending from yellow to NIR with its homologous [BPy]2CdCl4&#8201;:&#8201;Sb3+, resulting in the simultaneous presence of intersecting and independent emission colors. Detailed modulation of chemical composition enables partial luminescence switching, facilitating the creation of diverse patterns with multicolor luminescence by employing [BPy]2CdX4&#8201;:&#8201;xSb3+ as phosphors. This study for the first time successfully implements several groups of tunable emission colors in a single matrix via multisite fine&#8208;tuning. Such an effective strategy not only develops the specific relationships between tunable emissions and adjustable compositions, but also introduces a cost&#8208;effective and straightforward approach to achieving unique, high&#8208;level, plentiful&#8208;color and multiple&#8208;information&#8208;storage labels for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Sites Promote OH* Formation and Enhance Formate Selectivity: Towards High&#8208;efficiency Glycerol Valorization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts could achieve low potential and high formate selectivity toward glycerol valorization, because the Lewis centers promote OH* formation and the Br&#248;nsted centers enhance selective oxidation of glycerol to formate. This study demonstrates the vital roles of solid&#8208;acid sites in improving the activity and product selectivity for electrocatalytic biomass upcycling.







Abstract
As a sustainable valorization route, electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) involves in formation of key OH* and selective adsorption/cleavage of C&#8722;C(O) intermediates with multi&#8208;step electron transfer, thus suffering from high potential and poor formate selectivity for most non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. So, it remains challenging to understand the structure&#8211;property relationship as well as construct synergistic sites to realize high&#8208;activity and high&#8208;selectivity GOR. Herein, we successfully achieve dual&#8208;high performance with low potentials and superior formate selectivity for GOR by forming synergistic Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites in Ni&#8208;alloyed Co&#8208;based spinel. The optimized NiCo oxide solid&#8208;acid electrocatalyst exhibits low reaction potential (1.219&#8197;V@10&#8197;mA/cm2) and high formate selectivity (94.0&#8201;%) toward GOR. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and pH&#8208;dependence measurements show that the Lewis acid centers could accelerate OH* production, while the Br&#248;nsted acid centers are proved to facilitate high&#8208;selectivity formation of formate. Theoretical calculations reveal that NiCo alloyed oxide shows appropriate d&#8208;band center, thus balancing adsorption/desorption of C&#8722;O intermediates. This study provides new insights into rationally designing solid&#8208;acid electrocatalysts for biomass electro&#8208;upcycling.

         <title>Terminal Copper Nitrenoid Formation and Reactivity Induced by Absorption to an Antenna Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper nitrenoids are key intermediates in copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H amination reactions but are difficult to study due to their high reactivity. This research shows that absorption to an antenna ligand can promote the denitrogenation of copper azide complexes in the gas phase and also channel the internal energy to promote the C&#8722;H amination reaction, which opens a new way to study the reactivity of highly reactive species under well&#8208;defined conditions.







Abstract
Copper nitrenoids are key intermediates in copper&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H amination reactions. Further development of this important reaction relies on knowing the properties and reactivity of the nitrenoid intermediates. This work utilizes antenna ligands to form copper nitrenoid complexes and monitor the consecutive C&#8722;H amination reactions under well&#8208;defined single&#8208;molecule conditions in the gas phase. The [Cu(Lphoto)(Lazide)]+ precursors (Lphoto is a bidentate antenna ligand, and Lazide is an organic azide) were stored in an ion trap at 3.5&#8197;K and irradiated by visible light, which resulted in denitrogenation of the complex. Further irradiation of the copper nitrenoid led to the consecutive C&#8722;H amination of the antenna ligand. The nitrenoid complexes, as well as the products of the C&#8722;H amination, were characterized by helium tagging IRPD spectroscopy, and the mechanism was described by DFT calculations. This research demonstrates that the antenna ligands can be used to promote the denitrogenation of metal azides in the gas phase and also channel the internal energy to promote further reactivity, which opens a new way to study the reactivity of highly reactive species under well&#8208;defined conditions.

         <title>Activating and Identifying the Active Site of RuS2 for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is applied to activate pyrite&#8208;type RuS2 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction by introducing sulfur vacancies. The introduction of S vacancies can regulate the p orbital of S atoms, leading to enhanced binding strength between the S site of RuS2&#8722;x and H. The S&#8722;H bond is also observed through the in&#8197;situ Raman, directly proving the S atom as the HOR catalytic active site.







Abstract
Searching for highly efficient and economical electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the development of alkaline polymer membrane fuel cells. Here, we report a valid strategy to active pyrite&#8208;type RuS2 for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis by introducing sulfur vacancies. The obtained S&#8208;vacancies modified RuS2&#8722;x exhibits outperformed HOR activity with a current density of 0.676&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and mass activity of 1.43&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;g&#8722;1, which are 15&#8208;fold and 40&#8208;fold improvement than those of Ru catalyst. In situ Raman spectra demonstrate the formation of S&#8722;H bond during the HOR process, identifying the S atom of RuS2&#8722;x is the real active site for HOR catalysis. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results including in&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy suggest the introduction of S vacancies can rationally modify the p orbital of S atoms, leading to enhanced binding strength between the S sites and H atoms on the surface of RuS2&#8722;x, together with the promoted connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and lowered water formation energy, contributes to the enhanced HOR performance.

         <title>Creating 3D Nanoparticle Structural Space via Data Augmentation to Bidirectionally Predict Nanoparticle Mixture's Purity, Size, and Shape from Extinction Spectra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment and machine learning&#8208;directed data augmentation to create a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoparticle structural space for bidirectional predictions of silver nanocube's purity, size, and shape (corner radius) in as&#8208;synthesized nanoparticle mixtures using extinction spectra and vice versa.







Abstract
Nanoparticle (NP) characterization is essential because diverse shapes, sizes, and morphologies inevitably occur in as&#8208;synthesized NP mixtures, profoundly impacting their properties and applications. Currently, the only technique to concurrently determine these structural parameters is electron microscopy, but it is time&#8208;intensive and tedious. Here, we create a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) NP structural space to concurrently determine the purity, size, and shape of 1000 sets of as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanocubes mixtures containing interfering nanospheres and nanowires from their extinction spectra, attaining low predictive errors at 2.7&#8211;7.9&#8201;%. We first use plasmonically&#8208;driven feature enrichment to extract localized surface plasmon resonance attributes from spectra and establish a lasso regressor (LR) model to predict purity, size, and shape. Leveraging the learned LR, we artificially generate 425,592 augmented extinction spectra to overcome data scarcity and create a comprehensive NP structural space to bidirectionally predict extinction spectra from structural parameters with &lt;4&#8201;% error. Our interpretable NP structural space further elucidates the two higher&#8208;order combined electric dipole, quadrupole, and magnetic dipole as the critical structural parameter predictors. By incorporating other NP shapes and mixtures&#8242; extinction spectra, we anticipate our approach, especially the data augmentation, can create a fully generalizable NP structural space to drive on&#8208;demand, autonomous synthesis&#8208;characterization platforms.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation and Transfer Hydrogenation of 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Nitrones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reduction of 1,3&#8208;dipolar nitrones to hydroxylamines was achieved by Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation. A wide range of chiral N,N&#8208;disubstituted hydroxylamines were synthesized with up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were conducted to elucidate the origin of reactivity and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Owing to their distinctive 1,3&#8208;dipolar structure, the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation of nitrones to hydroxylamines has been a formidable and longstanding challenge, characterized by intricate enantiocontrol and susceptibility to N&#8722;O bond cleavage. In this study, the asymmetric hydrogenation and transfer hydrogenation of nitrones were accomplished with a tethered TsDPEN&#8208;derived cyclopentadienyl rhodium(III) catalyst (TsDPEN: p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diphenylethylene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), the reaction proceeds via a novel 7&#8208;membered cyclic transition state, producing chiral hydroxylamines with up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee. The practical viability of this methodology was underscored by gram&#8208;scale catalytic reactions and subsequent transformations. Furthermore, mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations were also conducted to elucidate the origin of enantioselectivity.

         <title>Binding of Precursors to Replicator Assemblies Can Improve Replication Fidelity and Mediate Error Correction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of precursor molecules to the side of a fibrous assembly of self&#8208;replicating macrocycles can improve the fidelity of replication and yield a novel error&#8208;correction mechanism, provided that the fibers bind selectively to precursors that match the building&#8208;block composition of the replicator.







Abstract
Copying information is vital for life&#8216;s propagation. Current life forms maintain a low error rate in replication, using complex machinery to prevent and correct errors. However, primitive life had to deal with higher error rates, limiting its ability to evolve. Discovering mechanisms to reduce errors would alleviate this constraint. Here, we introduce a new mechanism that decreases error rates and corrects errors in synthetic self&#8208;replicating systems driven by self&#8208;assembly. Previous work showed that macrocycle replication occurs through the accumulation of precursor material on the sides of the fibrous replicator assemblies. Stochastic simulations now reveal that selective precursor binding to the fiber surface enhances replication fidelity and error correction. Centrifugation experiments show that replicator fibers can exhibit the necessary selectivity in precursor binding. Our results suggest that synthetic replicator systems are more evolvable than previously thought, encouraging further evolution&#8208;focused experiments.

         <title>Negatively Curved Octagon&#8208;Incorporated Aza&#8208;nanographene and its Assembly with Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure has led to the synthesis of a negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene containing two octagons, as confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The electron&#8208;rich nature and curved &#960;&#8208;surface of the saddle&#8208;shaped structure lead to intriguing photophysical and electrochemical properties as well as tight association with fullerenes (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60 and Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70).







Abstract
A negatively curved aza&#8208;nanographene (NG) containing two octagons was synthesized by a regioselective and stepwise cyclodehydrogenation procedure, in which a double aza[7]helicene was simultaneously formed as an intermediate. Their saddle&#8208;shaped structures with negative curvature were unambiguously confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, thereby enabling the exploration of the structure&#8211;property relationship by photophysical, electrochemical and conformational studies. Moreover, the assembly of the octagon&#8208;embedded aza&#8208;NG with fullerenes was probed by fluorescence spectral titration, with record&#8208;high binding constants (Ka=9.5&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C60, Ka=3.7&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1 with C70) found among reported negatively curved polycyclic aromatic compounds. The tight association of aza&#8208;NG with C60 was further elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of their co&#8208;crystal, which showed the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex with substantial concave&#8208;convex interactions.

         <title>Spaced Double Hydrogen Bonding in an Imidazole Poly Ionic Liquid Composite for Highly Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic Air Reductive H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spaced double hydrogen bonds in an imidazole poly ionic liquid surface can change the active site from being a covered state to a fully exposed one. This results in a more positive potential and more efficient orbital binding patterns giving better active sites for the selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reductive H2O2 production is a promising approach to alternative industrial anthraquinone processes while suffering from the requirement of pure O2 feedstock for practical application. Herein, we report a spaced double hydrogen bond (IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond) through multi&#8208;component Radziszewski reaction in an imidazole poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite (SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2) and levofloxacin hydrochloride (LEV) electron donor for highly efficient and selective photocatalytic air reductive H2O2 production. It is found that the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond formed by spaced imino (&#8722;NH&#8722;) group of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 and carbonyl (&#8722;C=O) group of LEV can switch the imidazole active sites characteristic from a covered state to a fully exposed one to shield the strong adsorption of electron donor and N2 in the air, and propel an intenser positive potential and more efficient orbitals binding patterns of SI&#8208;PIL&#8208;TiO2 surface to establish competitive active sites for selectivity O2 chemisorption. Moreover, the high electron enrichment of imidazole as an active site for the 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction ensures the rapid reduction of O2. Therefore, the IC&#8722;H&#8208;bond enables a total O2 utilization and conversion efficiency of 94.8&#8201;% from direct photocatalytic air reduction, achieving a H2O2 production rate of 1518&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h that is 16 and 23&#8197;times compared to poly&#8208;ionic&#8208;liquid composite without spaced imino groups (PIL&#8208;TiO2) and TiO2, respectively.

         <title>Cooperation of Different Active Sites to Promote CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst with three distinct catalytic sites was prepared by doping Pd atoms onto a Cu catalyst, which exhibited high activity for C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The introduced Pd atom is an active site, which can promote the H2O dissociation. The Cu atoms near the Pd atom are another catalytic site, which can enhance the CO conversion. In contrast, the Cu atoms far from the Pd atom are active sites for the CO2 activation.







Abstract
Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products provides a promising strategy for reaching the goal of carbon neutrality. However, achieving high selectivity of C2+ products at high current density remains a challenge. In this work, we designed and prepared a multi&#8208;sites catalyst, in which Pd was atomically dispersed in Cu (Pd&#8722;Cu). It was found that the Pd&#8722;Cu catalyst had excellent performance for producing C2+ products from CO2 electroreduction. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products could be maintained at approximately 80.8&#8201;%, even at a high current density of 0.8&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for at least 20&#8197;hours. In addition, the FE of C2+ products was above 70&#8201;% at 1.4&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the catalyst had three distinct catalytic sites. These three active sites allowed for efficient conversion of CO2, water dissociation, and CO conversion, ultimately leading to high yields of C2+ products.

         <title>Deoxygenative Coupling of CO with a Tetrametallic Magnesium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of CO to a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster results in both carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation and deoxygenation to generate an acetaldehyde enolate [C2OH3]&#8722; which remains coordinated to the cluster. DFT studies suggest that key steps in the mechanism involve nucleophilic attack of an oxymethylene on a formyl ligand to generate an unstable [C2O2H3]3&#8722; fragment, which undergoes subsequent deoxygenation.

Addition of CO to a tetrametallic magnesium hydride cluster results in both carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation and deoxygenation to generate an acetaldehyde enolate [C2OH3]&#8722; which remains coordinated to the cluster. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of formation of an isolable complex containing an [C2OH3]&#8722; fragment from reaction of CO with a metal hydride, and the first example of CO homologation and deoxygenation at a main group metal. DFT studies suggest that key steps in the mechanism involve nucleophilic attack of an oxymethylene on a formyl ligand to generate an unstable [C2O2H3]3&#8722; fragment, which undergoes subsequent deoxygenation.

         <title>1,4&#8208;Aminoarylation of Butadienes via Photoinduced Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing readily available and cost&#8208;effective aryl halides, amines, and butadienes as starting materials, in conjunction with rac&#8208;BINAP and a Pd catalyst, we can efficiently synthesize highly valuable complex allylamines through a rapid one&#8208;step process enabled by photocatalysis.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, three&#8208;component palladium&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;aminoarylation of butadienes with readily available aryl halides and aliphatic amines has been developed, affording allylamines with excellent E&#8208;selectivity. The reaction exhibits exceptional control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity, a broad substrate scope, and high functional group compatibility, as demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic investigations are consistent with a photoinduced radical Pd(0)&#8208;Pd(I)&#8208;Pd(II)&#8208;Pd(0) Heck&#8208;Tsuji&#8211;Trost allylation cascade.

         <title>Sortase&#8208;Catalyzed Protein Domain Inversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to mimic the conventional N&#8208;terminal sortase substrate at protein C&#8208;termini is reported, enabling C&#8208; to C&#8208;terminal ligation. Installing this mimetic at the C&#8208;terminus of a protein with an internal sortase recognition motif enables sortase&#8208;catalyzed inversion of the C&#8208;terminal portion of the protein.







Abstract
Topological transformations and permutations of proteins have attracted significant interest as strategies to generate new protein functionalities or stability. These efforts have mainly been inspired by naturally occurring post&#8208;translational modifications, such as head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization, circular permutation, or lasso&#8208;like entanglement. Such approaches can be realized experimentally via genetic encoding, in the case of circular permutation, or via enzymatic processing, in the case of cyclization. Notably, these previously described strategies leave the polypeptide backbone orientation unaltered. Here we describe an unnatural protein permutation, the protein domain inversion, whereby a C&#8208;terminal portion of a protein is enzymatically inverted from the canonical N&#8208;to&#8208;C to a C&#8208;to&#8208;C configuration with respect to the N&#8208;terminal part of the protein. The closest conceptually analogous biological process is perhaps the inversion of DNA segments as catalyzed by recombinases. We achieve these inversions using an engineered sortase A, a widely used transpeptidase. Our reactions proceed efficiently under mild conditions at 4&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and are compatible with entirely heterologously&#8208;produced protein substrates.

     alt="Sortase-Catalyzed Protein Domain Inversion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy to mimic the conventional N-terminal sortase substrate at protein C-termini is reported, enabling C- to C-terminal ligation. Installing this mimetic at the C-terminus of a protein with an internal sortase recognition motif enables sortase-catalyzed inversion of the C-terminal portion of the protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topological transformations and permutations of proteins have attracted significant interest as strategies to generate new protein functionalities or stability. These efforts have mainly been inspired by naturally occurring post-translational modifications, such as head-to-tail cyclization, circular permutation, or lasso-like entanglement. Such approaches can be realized experimentally via genetic encoding, in the case of circular permutation, or via enzymatic processing, in the case of cyclization. Notably, these previously described strategies leave the polypeptide backbone orientation unaltered. Here we describe an unnatural protein permutation, the protein domain inversion, whereby a C-terminal portion of a protein is enzymatically inverted from the canonical N-to-C to a C-to-C configuration with respect to the N-terminal part of the protein. The closest conceptually analogous biological process is perhaps the inversion of DNA segments as catalyzed by recombinases. We achieve these inversions using an engineered sortase A, a widely used transpeptidase. Our reactions proceed efficiently under mild conditions at 4&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C and are compatible with entirely heterologously-produced protein substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Smart DNA Hydrogel Enables Synergistic Immunotherapy and Photodynamic Therapy of Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA hydrogel that responds to the inflammatory environment by releasing multivalent functional units including photodynamic units, immune&#8208;activating units, and exosome killing units is constructed. The functional units have excellent tumor cell killing and immune activation efficacy, and the functional units can also synergistically modulate the immune microenvironment for efficient combination therapy.







Abstract
Immunotherapy faces insufficient immune activation and limited immune effectiveness. Herein, we report a smart DNA hydrogel that enables the release of multivalent functional units at the tumor site to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. The smart DNA hydrogel was assembled from two types of ultra&#8208;long DNA chains synthesized via rolling circle amplification. One DNA chain contained immune adjuvant CpG oligonucleotides and polyaptamers for loading natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes; the other chain contained multivalent G&#8208;quadruplex for loading photodynamic agents. DNA chains formed DNA hydrogel through base&#8208;pairing. HhaI restriction endonuclease sites were designed between functional units. Upon stimuli in the tumor sites, the hydrogel was effectively cleaved by the released HhaI and disassembled into functional units. Natural killer cell&#8208;derived exosomes played an anti&#8208;tumor role, and the CpG oligonucleotide activated antigen&#8208;presenting cells to enhance the immunotherapy. Besides the tumor&#8208;killing effect of photodynamic therapy, the generated cellular debris acted as an immune antigen to further enhance the immunotherapeutic effect. In a mouse melanoma orthotopic model, the smart DNA hydrogel as a localized therapeutic agent, achieved a remarkable tumor suppression rate of 91.2&#8201;%. The smart DNA hydrogel exhibited enhanced efficacy of synergistic immunotherapy and photodynamic therapy, expanding the application of DNA materials in biomedicine.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Radical Cascade to a Chiral Saddle&#8208;Shaped Peropyrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Undesired reaction pathways of open&#8208;shell graphene fragments can be synthetically useful! To demonstrate their transformative potential, we employed oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene&#8212;the well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;radical &#8220;decomposition&#8221; process&#8212;to build up strain and access negatively curved and configurationally stable chiral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.







Abstract
Reactions of open&#8208;shell molecular graphene fragments are typically thought of as undesired decomposition processes because they lead to the loss of desired features like &#960;&#8208;magnetism. Oxidative dimerization of phenalenyl to peropyrene shows, however, that these transformations hold promise as a synthetic tool for making complex structures via formation of multiple bonds and rings in a single step. Here, we explore the feasibility of using this &#8220;undesired&#8221; reaction of phenalenyl to build up strain and provide access to non&#8208;planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. To this end, we designed and synthesized a biradical system with two phenalenyl units linked via a biphenylene backbone. The design facilitates an intramolecular cascade reaction to a helically twisted saddle&#8208;shaped product, where the key transformations&#8212;ring&#8208;closure and ring&#8208;fusion&#8212;occur within one reaction. The negative curvature of the final peropyrene product, induced by the formed eight&#8208;membered ring, was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the helical twist was validated via resolution of the product's enantiomers that display circularly polarized luminescence and high configurational stability.

         <title>Tertiary Amides as Directing Groups for Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination using Ion&#8208;Paired Rhodium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct amination of benzylic C&#8722;H bonds generates important stereocenters. Our approach, in which the chirality of a bimetallic rhodium complex is located on its associated cations, achieves this on tertiary amide&#8208;containing substrates to give amination of arylbutyric and arylvaleric acid&#8208;derived amides. We believe that the amide most likely interacts directly with the chiral cation to provide a highly organised transition state for C&#8722;H amination.







Abstract
Enantioselective C&#8722;H amination at a benzylic methylene is a vital disconnection towards chiral benzylamines. Here we disclose that butyric and valeric acid&#8208;derived tertiary amides can undergo highly enantioselective benzylic amination using an achiral anionic Rh complex that is ion&#8208;paired with a Cinchona alkaloid&#8208;derived chiral cation. A broad scope of compounds can be aminated encompassing numerous arene substitutions, amides, and two different chain lengths. Excellent tolerance of ortho substituents was observed, which has not been achieved before in asymmetric intermolecular C&#8722;H amination with Rh. We speculate that the tertiary amide group of the substrate engages in hydrogen bonding interactions directly with the chiral cation, enabling a high level of organisation at the transition state for C&#8722;H amination. This is in contrast with our previous work where a substrate bearing a hydrogen bond donor was required. Control experiments led to the discovery that methyl ethers also function as proficient directing groups under the optimised conditions, potentially also acting as hydrogen bond acceptors. This finding has the promise to dramatically expand the applicability of our ion&#8208;paired chiral catalysts.

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of Ruthenium(BINAP)(PPh3)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a Ru(0)(BINAP)(PPh3) complex (BINAP:2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl) is reported. It behaves as a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16&#8208;electron Ru(0) complex: while being quite stable, it is capable to substitute PPh3 with alkenes/dienes, and activate C&#8722;H, N&#8722;H or inert N&#8722;Et bonds. This compound gives novel insight into Ru(0) stabilization approaches while maintaining a high specific reactivity potentially useful for catalytic applications.







Abstract
Ru(BINAP)(PPh3)HCl cleanly reacts with LiCH2TMS to give Ru(BINAP)(PPh3) (1) that has been fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction (BINAP and TMS stand for (2,2&#8242;&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl and trimethylsilyl respectively). In sharp contrast with other carbonyl&#8208;free phosphine complexes of Ru(0), 1 demonstrates a strikingly high thermal stability and no propensity for intramolecular C&#8722;H activation (cyclometalation). Yet 1 coordinates acetonitrile and readily exchanges its PPh3 ligand with alkenes and dienes, thus behaving like a &#8220;masked&#8221; 16&#8208;e Ru(0) species. Electron&#8208;poor alkenes coordinate more readily than electron&#8208;rich ones, which testifies for the nucleophilic character of the Ru(0)&#8208;BINAP fragment. While being thermally stable, 1 is highly reactive and is capable of activating C&#8722;H and N&#8722;H bonds, and even of cleaving an inert N&#8722;Et bond. The combination of high reactivity and stability originates from the P,arene&#8208;chelation by the BINAP ligand, i.e., the coordinated &#960;&#8208;arene stabilizes Ru(0) to prevent cyclometalation, yet it can slide upon substrate coordination, thereby enabling a variety of inert bond activation reactions to occur under mild conditions.

We synthesized a kind of supramolecular cationic polymer bearing cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) for the delivery of the plasmid encoding destabilized Cas9 (dsCas9) and single&#8208;guide RNA. The dynamic host&#8208;guest complexation between CB[7] moieties and trimethoprim, a stabilizer for dsCas9, can be competitively decomplexed by elevated polyamines in the tumor cells to activate Cas9&#8208;based genome editing in vivo, thereby ensuring the highly specific therapeutic genome editing for cancer gene therapy.







Abstract
We synthesize supramolecular poly(disulfide) (CPS) containing covalently attached cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), which is exploited not only as a carrier to deliver plasmid DNA encoding destabilized Cas9 (dsCas9), but also as a host to include trimethoprim (TMP) by CB[7] moieties through the supramolecular complexation to form TMP@CPS/dsCas9. Once the plasmid is transfected into tumor cells by CPS, the presence of polyamines can competitively trigger the decomplexation of TMP@CPS, thereby displacing and releasing TMP from CB[7] to stabilize dsCas9 that can target and edit the genomic locus of PLK1 to inhibit the growth of tumor cells. Following the systemic administration of TMP@CPS/dsCas9 decorated with hyaluronic acid (HA), tumor&#8208;specific editing of PLK1 is detected due to the elevated polyamines in tumor microenvironment, greatly minimizing off&#8208;target editing in healthy tissues and non&#8208;targeted organs. As the metabolism of polyamines is dysregulated in a wide range of disorders, this study offers a supramolecular approach to precisely control CRISPR/Cas9 functions under particular pathological contexts.

         <title>Where do the Fluorine Atoms Go in Inorganic&#8208;Oxide Fluorinations? A Fluorooxoborate Illustration under Terahertz Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
THz spectroscopy is used to show that fluorine atoms have a discernible preference for bonding with sp3&#8208;boron over sp2&#8208;boron in the fluorination reactions of boric acid. This result helps resolve the F/OH substitution structural ambiguity. A reaction pathway for fluorination via the hydrothermal and room&#8208;temperature evaporation reactions is presented which gives insights into previously obscured aspects of the borate&#8208;fluorination process.







Abstract
The substitution of fluorine atoms for oxygen atoms/hydroxyl groups has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the physical and chemical properties of oxides/hydroxides in fluorine chemistry. However, distinguishing fluorine from oxygen/hydroxyl in the reaction products poses a significant challenge in existing characterization methods. In this study, we illustrate that terahertz (THz) spectroscopy provides a powerful tool for addressing this challenge. To this end, we investigated two fluorination reactions of boric acid, utilizing MHF2 (M=Na, C(NH2)3) as fluorine reagents. Through an interplay between THz spectroscopy and solid&#8208;state density functional theory, we have conclusively demonstrated that fluorine atoms exclusively bind with the sp3&#8208;boron but not with the sp2&#8208;boron in the reaction products of Na[B(OH)3][B3O3F2(OH)2] (NaBOFH) and [C(NH2)3]2B3O3F4OH (GBF2). Based on this evidence, we have proposed a reaction pathway for the fluorinations under investigation, a process previously hindered due to structural ambiguity. This work represents a step forward in gaining a deeper understanding of the precise structures and reaction mechanisms involved in the fluorination of oxides/hydroxides, illuminated by the insights provided by THz spectroscopy.

         <title>Ultrafast Biomimetic Oxidative Folding of Cysteine&#8208;rich Peptides and Microproteins in Organic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, we established a method that replicates a hydrophobic environment akin to that of the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to effective suppression in dead&#8208;end products and acceleration of reaction rates through high thiolate concentrations for the oxidative folding of cysteine&#8208;rich peptides and microproteins.







Abstract
Disulfides in peptides and proteins are essential for maintaining a properly folded structure. Their oxidative folding is invariably performed in an aqueous&#8208;buffered solution. However, this process is often slow and can lead to misfolded products. Here, we report a novel concept and strategy that is bio&#8208;inspired to mimic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) by accelerating disulfide exchange rates many thousand&#8208;fold. The proposed strategy termed organic oxidative folding is performed under organic solvents to yield correctly folded cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins instantaneously without observable misfolded or dead&#8208;end products. Compared to conventional aqueous oxidative folding strategies, enormously large rate accelerations up to 113,200&#8208;fold were observed. The feasibility and generality of the organic oxidative folding strategy was successfully demonstrated on 15 cysteine&#8208;rich microproteins of different hydrophobicity, lengths (14 to 58 residues), and numbers of disulfides (2 to 5 disulfides), producing the native products in a second and in high yield.

         <title>A New Architecture for DNA&#8208;Templated Synthesis in Which Abasic Sites Protect Reactants from Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abasic site within a DNA duplex reduces hydrolysis of a colocalised DNA&#8208;thioester. This forms the basis for an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis which protects DNA&#8208;tagged building blocks until a DNA strand exchange reaction removes the protective site and colocalizes a second reactive group.







Abstract
The synthesis of artificial sequence&#8208;defined polymers that match and extend the functionality of proteins is an important goal in materials science. One way of achieving this is to program a sequence of chemical reactions between precursor building blocks by means of attached oligonucleotide adapters. However, hydrolysis of the reactive building blocks has so far limited the length and yield of product that can be obtained using DNA&#8208;templated reactions. Here, we report an architecture for DNA&#8208;templated synthesis in which reactants are tethered at internal abasic sites on opposite strands of a DNA duplex. We show that an abasic site within a DNA duplex can protect a nearby thioester from degradation, significantly increasing the yield of a DNA&#8208;templated reaction. This protective effect has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with programmable, sequence&#8208;controlled synthesis of long non&#8208;natural polymers by extending the lifetime of the reactive building blocks.

A rapid functional group transformation method that converts metabolic carboxylic acids into a new ketone within 10 minutes using the reagent 4&#8208;nitrophenyl&#8208;2H&#8208;azirine (the bait for the fish) has been developed by Daniel Globisch et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202318579). The newly formed ketone was then captured by the chemical probe methodology Quant&#8208;SCHEMA (the fishing device) for quantification of all carboxylic acids even at very low quantities (depth of the ocean). This bifunctional methodology represents a new chemical biology tool for biomarker discovery and metabolomics.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulfur Waste with Propylene Oxide and Carbon Disulfide via Lithium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, represents a promising raw material for the synthesis of degradable polymers. We show that simple lithium alkoxides facilitate the polymerisation of elemental sulfur S8 with industrially relevant propylene oxide (PO) and CS2 (a base chemical sourced from waste S8 itself) to give poly(monothiocarbonate&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx) in which x can be controlled by the amount of supplied sulfur. The in&#8208;situ generation of thiolate intermediates obtained by a rearrangement, which follows CS2 and PO incorporation, allows to combine S8 and epoxides into one polymer sequence that would otherwise not be possible. Mechanistic investigations reveal that alkyl oligosulfide intermediates from S8 ring opening and sulfur chain length equilibration represent the better nucleophiles for inserting the next PO if compared to the trithiocarbonates obtained from the competing CS2 addition, which causes the sequence selectivity. The polymers can be crosslinked in&#8208;situ with multifunctional thiols to yield reprocessable and degradable networks. Our report demonstrates how mechanistic understanding allows to combine intrinsically incompatible building blocks for sulfur waste utilisation.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, represents a promising raw material for the synthesis of degradable polymers. We show that simple lithium alkoxides facilitate the polymerisation of elemental sulfur S8 with industrially relevant propylene oxide (PO) and CS2 (a base chemical sourced from waste S8 itself) to give poly(monothiocarbonate-alt-Sx) in which x can be controlled by the amount of supplied sulfur. The in-situ generation of thiolate intermediates obtained by a rearrangement, which follows CS2 and PO incorporation, allows to combine S8 and epoxides into one polymer sequence that would otherwise not be possible.

         <title>Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s: Shape&#8208;Tunable Building Blocks for Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oligo(phenyleneethynylene)s (OPEs) have attracted widespread attention due to their remarkable (opto)electronic and photophysical properties, which have enabled numerous applications. The versatile functionalization possibilities of OPEs make them unique candidates to form various shape&#8208;persistent geometries, including linear, triangular, rectangular, hexagonal and macrocyclic. However, as a result of this structural variety, it is oftentimes challenging to correlate molecular design with self&#8208;assembly properties. In this minireview, we have classified OPEs based on their molecular shapes and correlated them with their self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution. Particularly, we provide important insights into the aggregation propensity of the different molecular shapes and how to tune the association strength using various non&#8208;covalent interactions. Our classification will enable a better understanding of the structure&#8208;property correlation in OPEs, which is key to develop supramolecular functional materials</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Homoconjugated Propellane Triimide: Synthesis, Structural Analyses, and Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rigid three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polycyclic propellanes have garnered interest due to their unique conformational chemical spaces, which display great potential use in selectivity, separation and as models to study through&#8208;space electronic interactions. Herein we report the synthesis of a novel rigid propellane, trinaphtho[3,3,3]propellane triimide, which comprises three imide groups embedded on a trinaphtho[3,3,3]propellane. The rigid 3D scaffold imparts high solubility, large bathochromic shift, amplified molar absorptivity, enhanced fluorescence, and lower reduction potential to the system relative to the subunits. Computational and experimental studies reveal that the effective &#960;&#8208;orbitals interacting through&#8208;space (homoconjugation) occurs between the subunits through the [3,3,3]propellane unit. Single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis show that the propellane triimide has a highly D3h&#8208;symmetric skeleton and readily crystallizes into different superstructures by changing alkyl chains at the imide position. In particular, the 3D porous superstructure with S&#8208;shaped channels is very promising for taking up ethane (C2H6) with very good selectivity over ethylene (C2H4), which can purify C2H4 from C2H4/C2H6 in a single separation step. This work showcases a new class of exceedingly rare 3D polycyclic propellane with intriguing electronic and supramolecular properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Two&#8208;dimensional Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels prevalent in neurons play important roles in generating action potential and information transmission by responding to transmembrane potential. Fabricating bio&#8208;inspired ionic transistors with ions as charge carriers will be crucial for realizing neuro&#8208;inspired devices and brain&#8208;liking computing. Here, we reported a two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic ionic transistor based on an MXene membrane with sub&#8208;1 nm interlayer channels. By applying a gating voltage on the MXene nanofluidic, a transmembrane potential will be generated to active the ionic transistor, which is similar to the transmembrane potential of neuron cells and can be effectively regulated by changing membrane parameters, e.g., thickness, composition, and interlayer spacing. For the symmetric MXene nanofluidic, a high on/off ratio of ~2000 can be achieved by forming an ionic depletion or accumulation zone, contingent on the sign of the gating potential. An asymmetric PET/MXene&#8208;composited nanofluidic transitioned the ionic transistor from ambipolar to unipolar, resulting in a more sensitive gate voltage characteristic with a low subthreshold swing of 560 mV/decade. Furthermore, ionic logic gate circuits, including the "NOT", "NAND", and "NOR" gate, were implemented for neuromorphic signal processing successfully, which provides a promising pathway towards highly parallel, low energy consumption, and ion&#8208;based brain&#8208;like computing.</dc:description>

         <title>Ostwald ripening for designing time&#8208;dependent crystal hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ostwald ripening (OR), a classic solution theory describing molecular transfer from metastable crystal to stable one, is applied to design time&#8208;dependent crystal hydrogels that can automatically change their mechanical properties. Using a system made from crosslinked polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium acetate (NaAc), we demonstrate that metastable fibrous crystal networks of NaAc preferably form in PAM hydrogels via a polymer&#8208;involving mismatch nucleation. These fibrous crystals would undergo OR and evolve into isolated bulk crystals, leading to a significant reduction in material rigidity (179 folds) and interfacial adhesion (20 folds). This transformation can be applied to program time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;recovery in shape and self&#8208;delamination. Since OR is a ubiquitous, robust feature of various crystals, the approach reported here represents a new direction for designing advanced transient soft materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium (II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation with Bifunctional Ligands: From Curiosity to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In 2001,&#160;our curiosity to understand the stereochemistry of&#160;C&#8211;H metalation with Pd prompted our first studies in Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8211;H activation. We identified four central challenges: 1. poor reactivity of simple Pd salts with native substrates; 2. few strategies to control site selectivity for remote C&#8211;H bonds; 3. the lack of chiral catalysts to achieve enantioselectivity via asymmetric C&#8211;H metalation, and 4. low practicality due to limited coupling partner scope and the use of specialized oxidants. These challenges necessitated new strategies in catalyst and reaction development. For&#160;reactivity, we developed approaches to enhance substrate&#8208;catalyst affinity together with novel bifunctional ligands which participate in and accelerate the C&#8211;H cleavage step. For&#160;site&#8208;selectivity, we introduced the concept of systematically modulating the distance and geometry between a directing template, catalyst, and substrate to selectively access remote C&#8211;H bonds. For&#160;enantioselectivity, we devised predictable stereomodels for catalyst&#8208;controlled enantioselective C&#8211;H activation based on the participation of bifunctional ligands. Finally, for&#160;practicality, we have developed varied catalytic manifolds for Pd(II) to accommodate diverse coupling partners while employing practical oxidants such as simple peroxides. These advances have culminated in numerous C&#8211;H activation reactions of broadly useful native substrates with diverse coupling partners under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Evolution of Adaptive Artificial Ion Channels or Nanopores with Specific Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, ceramides are a class of sphingolipids possessing a unique ability to self&#8208;assemble into protein&#8208;permeable channels with intriguing concentration&#8208;dependent adaptive channel cavities. However, within the realm of artificial ion channels, this interesting phenomenon is scarcely recaptured. Herein, we report on a novel class of adaptive artificial channels, Pn&#8208;TPPs, based on PEGylated cholic acids bearing triphenylphosphonium (TPP) groups as anion binding motifs. Interestingly, the molecules self&#8208;assemble into chloride ion channels at low concentrations, while transforming into small molecule&#8208;permeable nanopores at high concentrations. Moreover, the TPP groups endow the molecules with mitochondria&#8208;targeting property, enabling them to selectively drill holes on the mitochondrial membrane of cancer cells and subsequently trigger the caspase 9 apoptotic pathway. The anticancer efficacies of Pn&#8208;TPPs correlate with their abilities to form nanopores. Significantly, the most active ensembles formed by P5&#8208;TPP exhibits impressive anticancer activity against human liver cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 3.8 &#956;M. While demonstrating similar anticancer performance to doxorubicin, P5&#8208;TPP exhibits a selectivity index surpassing that of doxorubicin by a factor of 16.8.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Hydrogen/Oxygen Species Adsorption via Built&#8208;in Electric Field &#8208;Driven Electron Transfer Behavior at the Heterointerface for Efficient Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) plays a crucial role in the realization of a hydrogen economy. The design and development of efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are pivotal to achieving high&#8208;efficiency AWE. Herein, WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C nanoparticle&#8208;embedded carbon nanofiber (WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF) with abundant interfaces is successfully designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the electron transfer behavior from Mo2C to WC1&#8208;x, the electrocatalysts of WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF exhibit superior HER and OER performance. Furthermore, when employed as anode and cathode in membrane electrode assembly devices, the WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and remarkable stability for 100 hours at a high current density of 200 mA cm&#8208;2 towards overall water splitting. The experimental characterizations and theoretical simulation reveal that modulation of the d&#8208;band center for WC1&#8208;x/Mo2C@CNF, achieved through the asymmetric charge distribution resulting from the built&#8208;in electric field induced by work function, enables optimization of adsorption strength for hydrogen/oxygen intermediates, thereby promoting the catalytic kinetics for overall water splitting. This work provides promising strategies for designing highly active catalysts in energy conversion fields.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Host&#8208;Microbe Single&#8208;Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Ferroptosis&#8208;Associated Heterogeneity during Acinetobacter baumannii&#160;Infection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between host and bacterial cells are integral to human physiology. The complexity of host&#8208;microbe interactions extends to different cell types, spatial aspects, and phenotypic heterogeneity, requiring high&#8208;resolution approaches to capture their full complexity. The latest breakthroughs in single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) have opened up a new era of studies in host&#8208;pathogen interactions. Here, we first report a high&#8208;throughput cross&#8208;species dual scRNA&#8208;seq technology by using random primers to simultaneously capture both eukaryotic and bacterial RNAs (scRandom&#8208;seq). Using reference cells, scRandom&#8208;seq can detect individual eukaryotic and bacterial cells with high throughput and high specifity. Acinetobacter baumannii&#160;(A.b) is a highly opportunistic and nosocomial pathogen that is highly attainable antibiotic resistance posing a significant threat to human health, calling for new discoveries and treatment. In the A.b&#160;infection model, scRandom&#8208;seq witnessed polarization of THP&#8208;1 derived&#8208;macrophages and the intracellular A.b&#160;induced ferroptosis&#8208;stress in host cells. The inhibition of ferroptosis by Ferrostatin&#8208;1 (Fer&#8208;1) resulted in the improvement of cell vitality and resistance to A.b infection, indicating the potential activity to resist related infections. scRandom&#8208;seq provides a high&#8208;throughput cross&#8208;species dual single&#8208;cell RNA profiling tool that will facilitate future discoveries in unraveling the complex interactions of host&#8208;microbe interactions in infection systems and tumor micro&#8208;environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Amine Synthesis via Catalytic Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid assembly of valuable cyclic amine architectures in a single step from simple precursors has been recognized as an ideal platform in term of efficiency and sustainability. Although a vast number of studies regarding cyclic amine synthesis has been reported, new synthetic disconnection approaches are still high in demand. Herein, we report a catalytic radical&#8208;polar crossover cycloaddition to cyclic amine synthesis triggered from primary sulfonamide under photoredox condition. This newly developed disconnection, comparable to established synthetic approaches, will allow to construct &#946;, &#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclic amine and &#946;&#8208;monosubstituted cyclic amine derivatives efficiently. This study highlights the unique utility of primary sulfonamide as a bifunctional reagent, which acts as a radical precursor and a nucleophile. The open&#8208;shell methodology demonstrates broad tolerance to various functional groups, drug derivatives and natural products in an economically and sustainable fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Redesigned Nylon 6 Variants with Enhanced Recyclability, Ductility, and Transparency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Geminal (gem&#8208;) disubstitution in heterocyclic monomers is an effective strategy to enhance polymer chemical recyclability by lowering their ceiling temperatures. However, the effects of specific substitution patterns on the monomer's reactivity and the resulting polymer&#8217;s properties are largely unexplored. Here we show that, by systematically installing gem&#8208;dimethyl groups onto &#603;&#8208;caprolactam (monomer of nylon 6) from the &#945; to &#949; positions, both the redesigned lactam monomer&#8217;s reactivity and the resulting gem&#8208;nylon 6&#8217;s properties are highly sensitive to the substitution position, with the monomers ranging from non&#8208;polymerizable to polymerizable and the gem&#8208;nylon properties ranging from inferior to far superior to the parent nylon 6. Remarkably, the nylon 6 with the gem&#8208;dimethyls substituted at the &#947; position is amorphous and optically transparent, with a higher Tg (by 30 &#176;C), yield stress (by 1.5 MPa), ductility (by 3x), and lower depolymerization temperature (by 60 &#176;C) than conventional nylon 6.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Modification and Degradation of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate that electrochemical&#8208;induced decarboxylation enables reliable post&#8208;polymerization modification and degradation of polymers. Polymers containing N&#8208;(acryloxy)phthalimides were subjected to electrochemical decarboxylation under mild conditions, which led to the formation of transient alkyl radicals. By installing these redox&#8208;active units, we systematically modified the pendent groups and chain ends of polyacrylates. This approach enabled the production of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) and poly(propylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) copolymers, which are difficult to synthesize by direct polymerization. Spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques reveal these transformations are near&#8208;quantitative on several polymer systems. Electrochemical decarboxylation also enables the degradation of all&#8208;methacrylate poly(N&#8208;(methacryloxy)phthalimide&#8208;co&#8208;methyl methacrylate) copolymers with a degradation efficiency of &gt;95%. Chain cleavage is achieved through the decarboxylation of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission of the backbone radical. Electrochemistry is thus shown to be a powerful tool in selective polymer transformations and controlled macromolecular degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Enrichment for Ultrasensitive Detection of Low&#8208;Frequency Mutations by Long Blocker Displacement Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detecting low&#8208;frequency DNA mutations hotspots cluster is critical for cancer diagnosis but remains challenging. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) is constrained by sensitivity, and allele&#8208;specific PCR is restricted by throughput. Here we develop a long blocker displacement amplification (LBDA) coupled with qPCR for ultrasensitive and multiplexed variants detection. By designing long blocker oligos to perfectly match wildtype sequences while mispairing with mutants, long blockers enable 14&#8208;44 nt enrichment regions which is 2&#8208;fold longer than normal BDA in the experiments. For wild template with a specific nucleotide, LBDA can detect different mutation types down to 0.5% variant allele frequency (VAF) in one reaction, with median enrichment fold of 1,000 on 21 mutant DNA templates compared to the wild type. We applied LBDA&#8208;qPCR to detect KRAS and NRAS mutation hotspots, utilizing a single plex assay capable of covering 81 mutations and tested in synthetic templates and colorectal cancer tissue samples. Moreover, the mutation types were verified through Sanger sequencing, demonstrating concordance with results obtained from next generation sequencing. Overall, LBDA&#8208;qPCR provides a simple yet ultrasensitive approach for multiplexed detection of low VAF mutations hotspots, presenting a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and monitoring.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoresponsive Covalent Organic Frameworks: Visible&#8208;Light Controlled Conversion of Porous Structures and Its Impacts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks are a novel class of crystalline porous polymers that enable molecular design of extended polygonal skeletons to attain well&#8208;defined porous structures. However, construction of a framework that allows remote control of pores remains a challenge. Here we report a strategy that merges covalent, noncovalent, and photo chemistries to design photoresponsive frameworks with reversibly and remotely controllable pores. We developed a topology&#8208;guided multicomponent polycondensation system that integrates protruded tetrafluoroazobenzene units as photoresponsive sites on pore walls at predesigned densities, so that a series of crystalline porous frameworks&#160;with&#160;the same backbone can be constructed to develop a broad spectrum of pores ranging from mesopores to micropores. Distinct from conventional azobenzene&#8208;based systems, the tetrafluoroazobenzene frameworks are highly sensitive to visible lights to undergo high&#8208;rate isomerization. The photoisomerization exerts profound effects on pore size, shape, number, and environment, as well as molecular uptake and release, rendering the system able to convert and switch pores reversibly and remotely with visible lights. Our results open a way to a novel class of smart porous materials with pore structures and functions that are convertible and manageable with visible lights.</dc:description>

         <title>F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer: Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Purely</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, stimulus&#8208;responsive organic materials with room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) property have attracted tremendous attention due to their potential applications in chemical sensing, anticounterfeiting, display, etc. However, the molecular design in question is currently lacking in systematicness and effectiveness. We herein report a capture&#8208;release strategy for the construction of a reversible RTP via B/N Lewis pairs. Specifically, the RTP of the Lewis acid of 7&#8208;bromo&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1de]anthracene (BrBA) can be deactivated through capturing by the Lewis base of N,N&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)aniline (TPAPy), and reactivated by dissociation of the B&#8722;N bond to release BrBA. The reversible RTP is attributed to the exceptional self&#8208;assembly capability of BrBA, while the tunable RTP colors are derived from distinct F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) processes. The potential applications of RTP materials for information storage and anticounterfeiting are also experimentally validated. The capturerelease approach proposed in this work offers an effective strategy for the design of stimulus&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Functionalization of a Donor Monomer to Enhance Charge Transfer in Porous Polymer Networks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazatruxene (TAT)&#8208;based PPNs were synthesized to investigate how the existence of a hexyl functional group would affect charge transfer. The hexyl group on the TAT unit ensured the transfer of photoexcited electrons from a donor unit to an acceptor unit, resulting in improved photocatalytic activity and hydrogen production.







Abstract
Porous polymer networks (PPNs) are promising candidates as photocatalysts for hydrogen production. Constructing a donor&#8208;acceptor structure is known to be an effective approach for improving photocatalytic activity. However, the process of how a functional group of a monomer can ensure photoexcited charges transfer and improve the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) has not yet been studied on the molecular level. Herein, we design and synthesize two kinds of triazatruxene (TAT)&#8208;based PPNs: TATR&#8208;PPN with a hexyl (R) group and TAT&#8208;PPN without the hexyl group, to understand the relationship between the presence of the functional group and charge transfer. The hexyl group on the TAT unit was found to ensure the transfer of photoexcited electrons from a donor unit to an acceptor unit and endowed the TATR&#8208;PPN with stable hydrogen production.

         <title>Custom&#8208;Design of Strong Electron/Proton Extractor on COFs for Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We custom&#8208;designed a strong electron/proton extractor on COFs by introducing oxygen functional groups (&#8722;COOH and &#8722;SO3H) in high&#8208;crystalline triazine&#8208;containing COFs, which induces well&#8208;oriented build&#8208;in electron field and enhances the hydrophilicity, leading to fast proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process and enhanced O2 adsorption, and therefore boosted photocatalytic O2&#8208;to&#8208;H2O2 conversion.







Abstract
The development of photocatalysts with continuous electron extraction and rapid proton transfer could kinetically accelerate the artificial photosynthesis, but remains a challenge. Herein, we report the topology&#8208;guided synthesis of a high&#8208;crystalline triazine covalent organic framework (COF) decorated by uniformly distributed polar oxygen functional groups (sulfonic group or carboxyl) as the strong electron/proton extractor for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. It was found that the polarity&#8208;based proton transfer as well as electron enrichment in as&#8208;obtained COFs played a crucial role in improving the H2O2 photosynthesis efficiency (i.e., with an activity order of sulfonic acid&#8208; (SO3H&#8208;COF)&gt;carboxyl&#8208; (COOH&#8208;COF)&gt;hydrogen&#8208; (H&#8208;COF) functionalized COFs). The strong polar sulfonic acid group in the high&#8208;crystalline SO3H&#8208;COF triggered a well&#8208;oriented built&#8208;in electric field and more hydrophilic surface, which serves as an efficient carrier extractor enabling a continuous transportation of the photogenerated electrons and interfacial proton to the active sites (i.e., C atoms linked to &#8722;SO3H group). As&#8208;accelerated proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET), together with the stabilized O2 adsorption finally leads to the highest H2O2 production rate of 4971&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, a quantum yield of 15&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm is obtained, superior to most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Valence Tautomerism Induced Proton Coupled Electron Transfer:X&#8722;H Bond Oxidation with a Dinuclear Au(II) Hydroxide Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;Coupled electron transfer (PCET)&#8208;type reactivity of the dinuclear AuII hydroxide complex AuII2(L)2(OH)2 (L=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis (2,6&#8208;dimethyl) phenylformamidinate) towards weak X&#8722;H bonds is reported. For C(sp3)&#8722;H oxidation Au&#8722;Au &#963;&#8208;bond polarization leads to an adjustment of oxidation levels for both Au centers prior to the PCET event. The oxidation event for C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is therefore described as a valence tautomerism induced PCET, where a basic reduced Au&#8722;OH unit serves as proton acceptor and the second more oxidized Au center as an electron acceptor.







Abstract
We report the preparation and characterization of the dinuclear AuII hydroxide complex AuII2(L)2(OH)2 (L=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis (2,6&#8208;dimethyl) phenylformamidinate) and study its reactivity towards weak X&#8722;H bonds. Through the interplay of kinetic analysis and computational studies, we demonstrate that the oxidation of cyclohexadiene follows a concerted proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (cPCET) mechanism, a rare type of reactivity for Au complexes. We find that the Au&#8722;Au &#963;&#8208;bond undergoes polarization in the PCET event leading to an adjustment of oxidation levels for both Au centers prior to C(sp3)&#8722;H bond cleavage. We thus describe the oxidation event as a valence tautomerism&#8208;induced PCET where the basicity of one reduced Au&#8722;OH unit provides a proton acceptor and the second more oxidized Au center serves as an electron acceptor. The coordination of these events allows for unprecedented radical&#8208;type reactivity by a closed shell AuII complex.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping and Structural Modulation of Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a foundational understanding of an electrochemical strategy for doping and structurally modulating electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks. Additionally, various applications of these MOFs have been developed based on their distinct electrochemical behaviors.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce an electrochemical doping strategy aimed at manipulating the structure and composition of electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs). Our methodology is exemplified through a representative c&#8208;MOF, Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP=2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene), synthesized into porous thin films supported by nanocellulose. While the c&#8208;MOF exhibits characteristic capacitive behavior in neutral electrolyte; it manifests redox behaviors in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Evidence indicates that the organic ligands within c&#8208;MOF undergo oxidation (p&#8208;doping) and reduction (n&#8208;doping) when exposed to specific electrochemical potentials in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Interestingly, the p&#8208;doping process proves reversible, with the c&#8208;MOF structure remaining stable across cyclic p&#8208;doping/de&#8208;doping. In contrast, the n&#8208;doping is irreversible, leading to the gradual decomposition of the framework into inorganic species over a few cycles. Drawing on these findings, we showcase the versatile electrochemical applications of c&#8208;MOFs and their derived composites, encompassing electrochemical energy storage, electrocatalysis, and ultrafast actuation. This study provides profound insights into the doping of c&#8208;MOFs, offering a new avenue for modulating their chemical and electronic structure, thereby broadening their potential for diverse electrochemical applications.

         <title>Diboraperylene Diborinic Acid Self&#8208;Assembly on Ag(111)&#8212;Kagome Flat Band Localized States Imaged by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar diboraperylene diborinic acid B2&#8722;Per self&#8208;assembles into a chiral kagome supramolecular network on an Ag(111) substrate and is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between BOH subunits of adjacent molecules. The kagome supramolecular network exhibits a dispersionless flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level, which is observed by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and further proved by tight&#8208;binding model calculations.







Abstract
Replacement of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by boron affords electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;scaffolds due to the vacant pz&#8208;orbital of three&#8208;coordinate boron with the potential for pronounced electronic interactions with electron&#8208;rich metal surfaces. Using a diboraperylene diborinic acid derivative as precursor and a controlled on&#8208;surface non&#8208;covalent synthesis approach, we report on a self&#8208;assembled chiral supramolecular kagome network on an Ag(111) surface stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions at low temperature. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) reveal a flat band at ca. 0.33&#8197;eV above the Fermi level which is localized at the molecule center, in good agreement with tight&#8208;binding model calculations of flat bands characteristic for kagome lattices.

         <title>Development of a Small Molecule Downmodulator for the Transcription Factor Brachyury</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The small&#8208;molecule brachyury downmodulator DHC&#8208;156 was developed through the optimization of afatinib, an FDA&#8208;approved inhibitor. A series of structure&#8211;activity relationships, guided by biochemical assays and crystallography, lead to the discovery of DHC&#8208;156, which was shown to spare all wild&#8208;type kinases and downmodulates brachyury in a post&#8208;translational manner.







Abstract
Brachyury is an oncogenic transcription factor whose overexpression drives chordoma growth. The downmodulation of brachyury in chordoma cells has demonstrated therapeutic potential, however, as a transcription factor it is classically deemed &#8220;undruggable&#8221;. Given that direct pharmacological intervention against brachyury has proven difficult, attempts at intervention have instead targeted upstream kinases. Recently, afatinib, an FDA&#8208;approved kinase inhibitor, has been shown to modulate brachyury levels in multiple chordoma cell lines. Herein, we use afatinib as a lead to undertake a structure&#8208;based drug design approach, aided by mass&#8208;spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography, to develop DHC&#8208;156, a small molecule that more selectively binds brachyury and downmodulates it as potently as afatinib. We eliminated kinase&#8208;inhibition from this novel scaffold while demonstrating that DHC&#8208;156 induces the post&#8208;translational downmodulation of brachyury that results in an irreversible impairment of chordoma tumor cell growth. In doing so, we demonstrate the feasibility of direct brachyury modulation, which may further be developed into more potent tool compounds and therapies.

         <title>Diphosphine&#8208;Protected IrAu12 Superatom with Open Site(s): Synthesis and Programmed Stepwise Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl ligands on IrAu12 superatom were removed stepwise by a control amount of strong acid. Partially exposed IrAu12 superatoms were efficiently linked by diisocyanide, leading to selective formation of the dimer and trimer.







Abstract
One or two phenylacetylide (PA) ligand(s) were successfully removed from the IrAu12 superatomic core of [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)2]+ (dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) by reaction with controlled amounts of tetrafluoroboric acid. Optical and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations revealed the formation of open Au site(s) on the IrAu12 core of [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)1]2+ and [IrAu12(dppe)5]3+ with the remaining structure intact. Isocyanide was efficiently trapped at the open electrophilic site on [IrAu12(dppe)5(PA)1]2+, whereas a dimer or trimer of the IrAu12 superatoms was formed using diisocyanide as a linker. These results open the door to designed assembly of chemically modified metal superatoms.

         <title>A Ferroptosis&#8208;Inducing Arsenene&#8208;Iridium Nanoplatform for Synergistic Immunotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed an innovative arsenene&#8208;iridium nanoplatform AsIr@PDA by loading ferroptosis&#8208;inducing metal complex IrFN on arsenene nanosheets. The effective release of IrFN from AsIr@PDA induced pancreatic cancer cell ferroptosis, and the ferroptotic cell death together with the immunomodulatory arsenene endows AsIr@PDA with a superior therapeutic effect by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;induced chemotherapy and immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy.







Abstract
Due to multidrug resistance and the high risk of recurrence, effective and less toxic alternative pancreatic cancer treatments are urgently needed. Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to apoptosis but sensitive to ferroptosis. In this study, an innovative nanoplatform (AsIr@PDA) was developed by electrostatic adsorption of a cationic iridium complex (IrFN) onto two&#8208;dimensional (2D) arsenene nanosheets. This nanoplatform exhibits superior ferroptosis&#8208;inducing effects with high drug loading capacity and, importantly, excellent anti&#8208;cancer immune activation function, leading to efficient elimination of pancreatic tumors with no observable side effects. Interestingly, AsIr@PDA significantly prevents the recurrence of pancreatic cancer in vivo when compared with a cisplatin&#8208;loaded nanoplatform. This designed nanoplatform demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy by synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;induced chemotherapy with immunotherapy via an all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, providing new insights for future pancreatic cancer therapy.

         <title>The Construction of Anion&#8208;Induced Solvation Structures in Low&#8208;concentration Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte was designed, where the CIPs and SSHIPs were achieved at low concentration by the coordination of PCA&#8722; with Zn2+ and bonding with solvated H2O molecules. This electrolyte effectively inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions on Zn anodes even at low concentration.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices because of their low cost and high safety. However, owing to the high activity of H2O molecules in electrolytes, hydrogen evolution reaction and side reactions usually take place on Zn anodes. Herein, additive&#8208;free PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte with capacity of suppressing the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules was designed by selecting the cationophilic and solventophilic anions. In such electrolyte, contact ion&#8208;pairs and solvent&#8208;shared ion&#8208;pairs were achieved even at low concentration, where PCA&#8722; anions coordinate with Zn2+ and bond with solvated H2O molecules. Simultaneously, PCA&#8722; anions also induce the construction of H&#8208;bonds between free H2O molecules and them. Therefore, the activity of free and solvated H2O molecules is effectively restrained. Furthermore, since PCA&#8722; anions possess a strong affinity with metal Zn, they can also adsorb on Zn anode surface to protect Zn anode from the direct contact of H2O molecules, inhibiting the occurrence of water&#8208;triggered side reactions. As a result, plating/stripping behavior of Zn anodes is highly reversible and the coulombic efficiency can reach to 99.43&#8201;% in PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte. To illustrate the feasibility of PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte, the Zn||PANI full batteries were assembled based on PCA&#8722;Zn electrolyte and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>Characterization and Engineering of Two Highly Paralogous Sesquiterpene Synthases Reveal a Regioselective Reprotonation Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three critical active site residues [L311&#8208;S419&#8208;C458]/[M311&#8208;V419&#8208;A458] were identified as the switch of the regioselective C3/C6 reprotonation of germacrene A in sesquiterpene synthase catalysis through the characterization and engineering of two highly paralogous sesquiterpene synthases, AhCS and AhIS, using a combination of isotopic labeling experiments, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, and structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis.







Abstract
Sesquiterpene synthases (STPSs) catalyze carbocation&#8208;driven cyclization reactions that can generate structurally diverse hydrocarbons. The deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation process is widely used in STPSs to promote structural diversity, largely attributable to the distinct regio/stereoselective reprotonations. However, the molecular basis for reprotonation regioselectivity remains largely understudied. Herein, we analyzed two highly paralogous STPSs, Artabotrys hexapetalus (&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene synthase (AhCS) and ishwarane synthase (AhIS), which catalyze reactions that are distinct from the regioselective protonation of germacrene A (GA), resulting in distinct skeletons of 5/5/6 tricyclic (&#8722;)&#8208;cyperene and 6/6/5/3 tetracyclic ishwarane, respectively. Isotopic labeling experiments demonstrated that these protonations occur at C3 and C6 of GA in AhCS and AhIS, respectively. The cryo&#8208;electron microscopy&#8208;derived AhCS complex structure provided the structural basis for identifying different key active site residues that may govern their functional disparity. The structure&#8208;guided mutagenesis of these residues resulted in successful functional interconversion between AhCS and AhIS, thus targeting the three active site residues [L311&#8208;S419&#8208;C458]/[M311&#8208;V419&#8208;A458] that may act as a C3/C6 reprotonation switch for GA. These findings facilitate the rational design or directed evolution of STPSs with structurally diverse skeletons.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Involved Solvation Structure of Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li salt anions tend to enter the first solvation sheath of cationic lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and form contact ion pairs in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The anion&#8208;involved solvation structure of LiPSs significantly influences the intrinsic kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions and impacts the performance of practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are pivotal intermediates involved in all the cathodic reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Elucidating the solvation structure of LiPSs is the first step for rational design of electrolyte and improving Li&#8722;S battery performances. Herein, we investigate the solvation structure of LiPSs and find that Li salt anions tend to enter the first solvation sheath of LiPSs and form contact ion pairs in electrolyte. The anion&#8208;involved solvation structure of LiPSs significantly influences the intrinsic kinetics of the sulfur redox reactions. In particular, the LiPS solvation structure modified by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide endows Li&#8722;S batteries with reduced polarization and enhanced rate performances under high sulfur areal loading and lean electrolyte volume conditions. This work updates the fundamental understanding of the solvation chemistry of LiPSs and highlights electrolyte engineering for promoting the performances of Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Role of Surface Terminations for Charge Storage of Ti3C2Tx MXene Electrodes in Aqueous Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition from electrochemically inactive Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 to fast, pseudocapacitive behavior is reported for N,O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 MXene, attributed to the presence of confined water between the MXene layers. This study evidences the crucial role surface terminations and confined water in charge storage and reaction kinetics in MXene materials.







Abstract
In this study, we used 2&#8208;Dimmensionnal Ti3C2 MXene as model materials to understand how the surface groups affect their electrochemical performance. By adjusting the nature of the surface terminations (Cl&#8208;, N/O&#8208;, and O&#8208;) of Ti3C2 MXene through a molten salt approach, we could change the spacing between MXene layers and the level of water confinement, resulting in significant modifications of the electrochemical performance in acidic electrolyte. Using a combination of techniques including in&#8208;operando X&#8208;ray diffraction and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) techniques, we found that the presence of confined water results in a drastic transition from an almost electrochemically inactive behavior for Cl&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 to an ideally fast pseudocapacitive signature for N,O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2 MXene. This experimental work not only demonstrates the strong connection between surface terminations and confined water but also reveals the importance of confined water on the charge storage mechanism and the reaction kinetics in MXene.

         <title>PAM&#8208;Engineered Toehold Switches as Input&#8208;Responsive Activators of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toehold Switch DNA presenting a locked anti&#8208;PAM in the loop are designed to control Cas12a activity in response to different molecular inputs. The hairpin to duplex reconfiguration triggered by co&#8208;localization&#8208;based displacement reactions provides a means to control the accessibility of the PAM and Cas12a activity. We demonstrate the rapid, one&#8208;pot detection of antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity.







Abstract
The RNA&#8208;programmed CRISPR effector protein Cas12a has emerged as a powerful tool for gene editing and molecular diagnostics. However, additional bio&#8208;engineering strategies are required to achieve control over Cas12a activity. Here, we show that Toehold Switch DNA hairpins, presenting a rationally designed locked protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the loop, can be used to control Cas12a in response to molecular inputs. Reconfiguring the Toehold Switch DNA from a hairpin to a duplex conformation through a strand displacement reaction provides an effective means to modulate the accessibility of the PAM, thereby controlling the binding and cleavage activities of Cas12a. Through this approach, we showcase the potential to trigger downstream Cas12a activity by leveraging proximity&#8208;based strand displacement reactions in response to target binding. By utilizing the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a as a signal transduction method, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach for sensing applications. Our system enables rapid, one&#8208;pot detection of IgG antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity even within complex matrices. Besides the bioanalytical applications, the switchable PAM&#8208;engineered Toehold Switches serve as programmable tools capable of regulating Cas12a&#8208;based targeting and DNA processing in response to molecular inputs and hold promise for a wide array of biotechnological applications.

     alt="PAM-Engineered Toehold Switches as Input-Responsive Activators of CRISPR-Cas12a for Sensing Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toehold Switch DNA presenting a locked anti-PAM in the loop are designed to control Cas12a activity in response to different molecular inputs. The hairpin to duplex reconfiguration triggered by co-localization-based displacement reactions provides a means to control the accessibility of the PAM and Cas12a activity. We demonstrate the rapid, one-pot detection of antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RNA-programmed CRISPR effector protein Cas12a has emerged as a powerful tool for gene editing and molecular diagnostics. However, additional bio-engineering strategies are required to achieve control over Cas12a activity. Here, we show that Toehold Switch DNA hairpins, presenting a rationally designed locked protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the loop, can be used to control Cas12a in response to molecular inputs. Reconfiguring the Toehold Switch DNA from a hairpin to a duplex conformation through a strand displacement reaction provides an effective means to modulate the accessibility of the PAM, thereby controlling the binding and cleavage activities of Cas12a. Through this approach, we showcase the potential to trigger downstream Cas12a activity by leveraging proximity-based strand displacement reactions in response to target binding. By utilizing the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cleavage activity of Cas12a as a signal transduction method, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach for sensing applications. Our system enables rapid, one-pot detection of IgG antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity even within complex matrices. Besides the bioanalytical applications, the switchable PAM-engineered Toehold Switches serve as programmable tools capable of regulating Cas12a-based targeting and DNA processing in response to molecular inputs and hold promise for a wide array of biotechnological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Positional Thiophene Isomerization: A Geometric Strategy for Precisely Regulating the Electronic State of Covalent Organic Frameworks to Boost Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric strategy to regulate the electron environment of active sites of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts via dangling thiophene units inside and outside COF rings is reported. The isomeric COF&#8208;&#946; with exposed active sites and localized charges show high activity, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites.







Abstract
With the oxygen conversion efficiency of metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based fuel cells dramatically improved, the building blocks of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) raised principal concerns on the catalytic active sites with indistinct electronic states. Herein, to address this issue, we demonstrate COFs for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by regulating the edge&#8208;hanging thiophene units, and the molecular geometries are further modulated via positional thiophene isomerization strategy, affording isomeric COF&#8208;&#945; with 2&#8208;substitution and COF&#8208;&#946; with 3&#8208;substitution on the frameworks. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption ability are well&#8208;regulated through geometric modification, resulting in controllable chemical activity and local density of &#960;&#8208;electrons. Notably, the introduction of thiophene units with different substitution positions into a pristine pure carbon&#8208;based COF model COF&#8208;Ph achieves excellent activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.76&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, which is higher than most of those metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Utilizing the combination of theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, we show that the isomeric thiophene skeleton (COF&#8208;&#945; and COF&#8208;&#946;) can induce the dangling unit activation, accurately identifying the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#945;&#8208;position) adjacent to sulfur atom as active sites. The results suggest that the isomeric dangling groups in COFs are suitable for the ORR with promising geometry construction.

         <title>Ir&#8208;Doped CuPd Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Nanotetrahedrons for Ethylene Glycol Oxidation Electrocatalysis: Enhanced Selective Cleavage of C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) were facilely prepared through an aqueous surfactant&#8208;templating epitaxial growth strategy. With mesoporous channels and multi&#8208;compositions, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs delivered remarkable C&#8722;C bond cleavage of electrocatalytic ethylene glycol oxidation (EGOR) to C1 products. The Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed perfectly in coupled electrocatalysis of EGOR and nitrate reduction.







Abstract
The development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for complete oxidation of ethylene glycol (EG) in direct EG fuel cells is of decisive importance to hold higher energy efficiency. Despite some achievements, their progress, especially electrocatalytic selectivity to complete oxidated C1 products, is remarkably slower than expected. In this work, we developed a facile aqueous synthesis of Ir&#8208;doped CuPd single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanotetrahedrons (Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs) as high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for promoting oxidation cleavage of C&#8722;C bond in alkaline EG oxidation reaction (EGOR) electrocatalysis. The synthesis relied on precise reduction/co&#8208;nucleation and epitaxial growth of Ir, Cu and Pd precursors with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra Br&#8722; as the facet&#8208;selective agent under ambient conditions. The products featured concave nanotetrahedron morphology enclosed by well&#8208;defined (111) facets, single&#8208;crystalline and mesoporous structure radiated from the center, and uniform elemental composition without any phase separation. Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs disclosed remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability as well as superior selectivity of C1 products for alkaline EGOR electrocatalysis. Detailed mechanism studies demonstrated that performance improvement came from structural and compositional synergies, which kinetically accelerated transports of electrons/reactants within active sites of penetrated mesopores and facilitated oxidation cleavage of high&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier C&#8722;C bond of EG for desired C1 products. More interestingly, Ir&#8208;CuPd SMTs performed well in coupled electrocatalysis of anode EGOR and cathode nitrate reduction, highlighting its high potential as bifunctional electrocatalyst in various applications.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Macrocyclization towards Crown Ethers Using Hydroamination of Bis(allenes)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of bis(allenes) with diamines was found to be an efficient strategy to access chiral crown ethers starting from achiral substrates. This new strategy is characterized by high chemo&#8208;, enantio&#8208;and diastereoselectivity with a wide range of substrates and with good functional group tolerance to access a wide range of chiral macrocycles in high yields under mild conditions.







Abstract
Enantiomerically enriched crown ethers (CE) exhibit strong asymmetric induction in phase transfer catalysis, supramolecular catalysis and molecular recognition processes. Traditional methods have often been used to access these valuable compounds, which limit their diversity and consequently their applicability. Herein, a practical catalytic method is described for the gram scale synthesis of a class of chiral CEs (aza&#8208;crown ethers; ACEs) using Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination of bis(allenes) with diamines. Using this approach, a wide range of chiral vinyl functionalized CEs with ring sizes ranging from 12 to 36 have been successfully prepared in high yields of up to 92&#8201;%, dr of up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 and er of up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1. These vinyl substituted CEs allow for further diversification giving facile access to various CE derivatives as well as to their three&#8208;dimensional analogues using ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Some of these chiral CEs themselves display high potential for use in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrosynthesis of High Value&#8208;Added Active Chlorine Coupled with H2 Generation from Direct Seawater Electrolysis through Decoupling Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system is developed for energy&#8208;saving electrosynthesis of HClO and H2. This system requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared with direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V).







Abstract
Direct saline (seawater) electrolysis is a well&#8208;recognized system to generate active chlorine species for the chloride&#8208;mediated electrosynthesis, environmental remediation and sterilization over the past few decades. However, the large energy consumption originated from the high cell voltage of traditional direct saline electrolysis system, greatly restricts its practical application. Here, we report an acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system for energy&#8208;saving co&#8208;electrosynthesis of active chlorine and H2. We demonstrate that this system just requires a low cell voltage of 1.59&#8197;V to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a large energy consumption decrease of 27.7&#8201;% compared to direct saline electrolysis system (2.20&#8197;V). We further demonstrate that such acid&#8208;saline hybrid electrolysis system could be extended to realize energy&#8208;saving and sustainable seawater electrolysis. The acidified seawater in this system can absolutely avoid the formation of Ca/Mg&#8208;based sediments that always form in the seawater electrolysis system. We also prove that this system in the half&#8208;flow mode can realize real&#8208;time preparation of active chlorine used for sterilization and pea sprout production.

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensionally Extended Metal&#8211;Organic Ladder Compound Exhibiting Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) extended two&#8208;legged ladder compound was reported for the first time. The unique 3D extended lattice consists of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged metal chains (&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8722;I&#8722;Pt&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;) and helically arranged macrocyclic units as the constituent legs and rungs. The out&#8208;of&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;valence Pt2+/Pt4+ arrangement arises from the weak interchain correlation among adjacent legs.







Abstract
Ladder systems situated in the dimensional crossover region have attracted much attention because their electronic states and physical properties depend strongly on the electronic correlations among the constituent legs. Generally, two&#8208;/three&#8208;legged transition metal&#8208;oxide ladder compounds are studied as representative ladder systems, but two&#8208;/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) extensions based on such ladder systems with a few numbers of legs are difficult because of the extreme synthesis conditions. Here, for the first time, we report the successful creation of a 3D extended two&#8208;legged ladder compound, [Pt(en)(dpye)I]2(NO3)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (en=ethylenediamine; dpye=1,2&#8208;Di(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane), which is obtained by simple oxidative polymerization of a small Pt macrocyclic complex using elemental I2. The unique 3D extended lattice consists of 1D mixed&#8208;valence halogen&#8208;bridged metal chains (&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt&#8722;I&#8722;Pt&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;) and helically arranged macrocyclic units as the constituent legs and rungs, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering analyses and optical measurements revealed that the out&#8208;of&#8208;phase mixed&#8208;valence Pt2+/Pt4+ arrangement arises from the weak interchain correlation among adjacent legs. In addition, this compound shows an increase in proton conductivity by a factor of up to 1000, depending on humidity.

         <title>A Powerful Strategy for Synthesizing Block Copolymers via Bimetallic Synergistic Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Block copolymers, comprising polyether and polyolefin segments, are an important and promising category of functional materials. However, the lack of efficient strategies for the construction of polyether&#8208;b&#8208;polyolefin block copolymers have hindered the development of these materials. Herein, we propose a simple and efficient method to obtain various block copolymers through the copolymerization of epoxides and acrylates via bimetallic synergistic catalysis. The copolymerization of epoxides and acrylates proceeds in a sequence&#8208;controlled manner, where the epoxides&#8208;involved homo&#8208; or copolymerization occurs first, followed by the homopolymerization of acrylates initiated by the alkoxide species from the propagating polymer chain, thus yielding copolymers with a block structure. Notably, the high monomer compatibility of this powerful strategy provides a platform for synthesizing various polyacrylate&#8208;based block copolymers comprising polyether, polycarbonate, polythiocarbonate, polyester, and polyurethane segments, respectively</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Heterocycles via Cycloisomerization of Unactivated Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a general, intramolecular cycloisomerization of unactivated olefins with pendant nucleophiles. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates ethers, esters, protected amines, acetals, pyrazoles, carbamates, and arenes. It is amenable to N&#8208;, O&#8208;, as well as C&#8208;nucleophiles, yielding a number of different heterocycles including, but not limited to, pyrrolidines, piperidines, oxazolidinones, and lactones. Use of both a benzothiazinoquinoxaline as organophotocatalyst and a Co&#8208;salen catalyst obviates the need for stoichiometric oxidant or reductant. We showcase the utility of the protocol in late&#8208;stage drug diversification and synthesis of several small natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding FSI&#8722; to Construct a Self&#8208;Healing SEI Film for Li&#8208;Metal Batteries by In&#8208;situ Crosslinking Vinyl Ionic Liquid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#160;on&#160;Li metal anode tends to breakdown and undergo reconstruction during operation, causing Li&#8208;metal batteries to experience accelerated decay. Notably, an SEI membrane with self&#8208;healing characteristics can help considerably in stabilizing the Li&#8211;electrolyte interface; however, uniformly fixing the repairing agent onto the anode remains a challenging task. By leveraging the noteworthy film&#8208;forming attributes of bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;) anions and the photopolymerization property of the vinyl group, the ionic liquid 1&#8208;vinyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (VMI&#8208;FSI) was crosslinked with polyethylene oxide (PEO) in this study to form a self&#8208;healing film fixing FSI&#8722; groups as the repairing agent. When they encounter lithium metal, the FSI&#8722; groups are chemically decomposed into LiF &amp; Li3N, which assist forming SEI membrane on lithium sheet and repairing SEI membrane in the cracks lacerated by lithium dendrite. Furthermore, the FSI&#8208; anions exchanged from film are electrochemically decomposed to generate inorganic salts to strengthen the SEI membrane. Benefiting from the self&#8208;healing behavior of the film, Li/LiCoO2 cells with the loading of 16.3 mg cm&#8722;2 exhibit the initial discharge capacities of 183.0 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 and are stably operated for 500 cycles with the retention rates of 81.4%, operated between 3.0~4.5 V vs. Li+/Li.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Solid Sulfur Conversion for Energetic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Na&#8208;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high theoretical energy density (1274 Wh kg&#8208;1) and high safety enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;S batteries with great promise for stationary energy storage system. However, the uncontrollable solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase conversion and its associated sluggish polysulfides redox kinetics pose a great challenge in tunning the sulfur speciation pathway for practical Na&#8208;S electrochemistry. Herein, we propose a new design methodology for matrix featuring separated bi&#8208;catalytic sites that control the multi&#8208;step polysulfide transformation in tandem and direct quasi&#8208;solid reversible sulfur conversion during battery cycling. It is revealed that the N, P heteroatom hotspots are more favorable for catalyzing the long&#8208;chain polysulfides reduction, while PtNi nanocrystals manipulate the direct and full Na2S4 to Na2S low&#8208;kinetic conversion during discharging. The electrodeposited Na2S on strongly coupled PtNi and N, P&#8208;codoped carbon host is extremely electroreactive and can be readily recovered back to S8 without passivation of active species during battery recharging, which delivers a true tandem electrocatalytic quasi&#8208;solid sulfur conversion mechanism. Accordingly, stable cycling of the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state soft&#8208;package Na&#8208;S pouch cells with an attractive specific capacity of 876 mAh gS&#8208;1 and a high energy of 608 Wh kgcathode&#8208;1 (172 Wh kg&#8208;1, based on the total mass of cathode and anode) at 60oC are demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;linker strategy for the construction of sulfone&#8208;containing D&#8208;A&#8208;A covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen using semiconductor catalysts offers a promising approach for converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production is often restricted by the low photo&#8208;generated charge separation, slow surface reactions and inadequate stability. Here, we developed a mixed&#8208;linker strategy to build a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A&#8208;A) type covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF. The FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF structure features extended &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation that improves charge mobility, while the introduction of sulfone units not only as active sites facilitates surface reactions with water but also bolsters stability through increased interlayer forces. The resulting FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF has a low exciton binding energy, long excited&#8208;state lifetime and high photo&#8208;stability that leads to high performance for photocatalytic H2O2 production (up to 1.0 mM h&#8208;1) with an H2O2 output of 19 mM after 72 hours of irradiation. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates high stability, which sustained activity over 192 hours of photocatalytic experiment.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Reactivity of a Dialane&#8208;Bridged Diradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radicals of the lightest group 13 element, boron, are well established and observed in numerous forms. In contrast to boron, radical chemistry involving the heavier group 13 elements (aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium) remains exceedingly underexplored, primarily attributed to the formidable synthetic challenges associated with these elements. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of planar and twisted conformers of a doubly CAAC (cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene)&#8208;radical&#8208;substituted dialane. Extensive characterization through spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms their identity, while quantum chemical calculations support their open&#8208;shell nature and provide further insights into their electronic structures. The dialane&#8208;connected &#160;diradicals exhibit high susceptibility to oxidation, as evidenced by electrochemical measurements and reactions with o&#8208;chloranil and a variety of organic azides. This study opens a previously uncharted class of dialuminum systems to study, broadening the scope of diradical chemistry and its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Capacitance Traces with Interlayer Spacing in Two&#8208;dimensional Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrically conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for electrochemical capacitors (EC) due to their high specific surface areas and potential for redox activity. To maximize energy density, traditional inorganic pseudocapacitors have utilized faradaic processes in addition to double&#8208;layer capacitance. Although conductive MOFs are usually comprised of redox active ligands which allow faradaic reactions upon electrochemical polarization, systematic studies providing deeper understanding of the charge storage processes and structure&#8208;function relationships have been scarce. Here, we investigate the charge storage mechanisms of a series of triazatruxene&#8208;based 2D layered conductive MOFs with variable alkyl functional groups, Ni3(HIR3&#8208;TAT)2 (TAT = triazatruxene; R = H, Et, n&#8208;Bu, n&#8208;Pent). Functionalization of the triazatruxene core allows for systematic variation of structural parameters while maintaining in&#8208;plane conjugation between ligands and metals. Specifically, R groups modulate interlayer spacing, which in turn shifts the charge storage mechanism from double&#8208;layer capacitance towards pseudocapacitance, leading to an increase in molar specific capacitance from Ni3(HIH3&#8208;TAT)2 to Ni3(HIBu3&#8208;TAT)2. Partial exfoliation of Ni3(HIBu3&#8208;TAT)2 renders redox active ligand moieties more accessible, and thus increases the dominance of faradaic processes. Our strategy of controlling charge storage mechanism through tuning the accessibility of redox&#8208;active sites may motivate further design and engineering of electrode materials for EC.</dc:description>

         <title>A Terrylene Bisimide based Universal Host for Aromatic Guests to Derive Contact Surface&#8208;Dependent Dispersion Energies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions are among the most important intermolecular interactions in supramolecular systems. Here we determine experimentally a universal parameter for their strength that is simply based on the size of the interacting contact surfaces. Toward this goal we designed a new cyclophane based on terrylene bisimide (TBI) &#960;&#8208;walls connected by para&#8208;xylylene spacer units. With its extended &#960;&#8208;surface this cyclophane proved to be an excellent and universal host for the complexation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guests, including small and large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as dye molecules. The observed binding constants range up to 108 M&#8722;1 and show a linear dependence on the 2D area size of the guest molecules. This correlation can be used for the prediction of binding constants and for the design of new host&#8722;guest systems based on the herewith derived universal Gibbs interaction energy parameter of 0.31 kJ/&#197;2 in chloroform.</dc:description>

After demonstrating that a range of cyclopropanethiols &#8211; that are difficult to access by other methods &#8211; can be obtained with this strategy, we show that these rearranged products can be easily hydrolyzed and further derivatized.

         <title>The Rhodium Analogue of Coenzyme B12 as an Anti&#8208;Photoregulatory Ligand Inhibiting Bacterial CarH Photoreceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl; 5&#180;&#8208;deoxy&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;adenosylcobalamin), the quintessential biological organometallic radical catalyst, has a formerly unanticipated, yet extensive, role in photoregulation in bacteria. The light&#8208;responsive cobalt&#8208;corrin AdoCbl performs this nonenzymatic role by facilitating the assembly of CarH photoreceptors into DNA&#8208;binding tetramers in the dark, suppressing gene expression. Conversely, exposure to light triggers the decomposition of this AdoCbl&#8208;bound complex by a still elusive photochemical mechanism, activating gene expression. Here, we have examined AdoRhbl, the non&#8208;natural rhodium analogue of AdoCbl, as a photostable isostructural surrogate for AdoCbl. We show that AdoRhbl closely emulates AdoCbl in its uptake by bacterial cells and structural functionality as a regulatory ligand for CarH tetramerization, DNA binding, and repressor activity. Remarkably, we find AdoRhbl is photostable even when bound "base&#8208;off/His&#8208;on" to CarH in vitro and in vivo. Thus, AdoRhbl, an antivitamin B12, also represents an unprecedented anti&#8208;photoregulatory ligand, opening a pathway to precisely target biomimetic inhibition of AdoCbl&#8208;based photoregulation, with new possibilities for selective antibacterial applications. Computational biomolecular analysis of AdoRhbl binding to CarH yields detailed structural insights into this complex, which suggest that the adenosyl group of photoexcited AdoCbl bound to CarH may specifically undergo a concerted non&#8208;radical syn&#8208;1,2&#8208;elimination mechanism, an aspect not previously considered for this photoreceptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Induced Formation of Surface Acid Sites on Pt/Al(PO3)3 Enables Remarkably Efficient Hydrogenolysis of C&#8722;O Bonds in Alcohols and Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogenolysis of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers is central to the biomass valorization and also a valuable transformation in organic synthesis. However, a mild and efficient catalyst system for the hydrogenolysis of a large variety of alcohols and ethers with various functional groups is still underdeveloped. Here, we report an aluminum metaphosphate&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Al(PO3)3) for the hydrogenolysis of a wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl and benzylic alcohols, and dialkyl, aryl alkyl, and diaryl ethers, including biomass&#8208;derived furanic compounds, under mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1 atm of H2, as low as 70 &#176;C). Mechanistic studies suggested that H2 induces formation of the surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites via its cleavage by supported Pt nanoparticles. Accordingly, the high efficiency and the wide applicability of the catalyst system are attributed to the activation and cleavage of C&#8211;O bonds by the hydrogen&#8208;induced Br&#248;nsted acid sites with the assistance of Lewis acidic Al sites on the catalyst surface. The high efficiency of the catalyst imply its potential application in energy&#8208;efficient biomass valorization or fine chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

However, a mild and efficient catalyst system for the hydrogenolysis of a large variety of alcohols and ethers with various functional groups is still underdeveloped. Here, we report an aluminum metaphosphate-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/Al(PO3)3) for the hydrogenolysis of a wide variety of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl and benzylic alcohols, and dialkyl, aryl alkyl, and diaryl ethers, including biomass-derived furanic compounds, under mild conditions (0.1&#8211;1 atm of H2, as low as 70 &#176;C). Mechanistic studies suggested that H2 induces formation of the surface Br&#248;nsted acid sites via its cleavage by supported Pt nanoparticles. Accordingly, the high efficiency and the wide applicability of the catalyst system are attributed to the activation and cleavage of C&#8211;O bonds by the hydrogen-induced Br&#248;nsted acid sites with the assistance of Lewis acidic Al sites on the catalyst surface. The high efficiency of the catalyst imply its potential application in energy-efficient biomass valorization or fine chemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Silole and Disila&#8208;Cyclooctene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of Si atoms into organic compounds significantly increases a variety of functionality, facilitating further applications. Recently, on&#8208;surface synthesis was introduced into organosilicon chemistry as 1,4&#8208;disilabenzene bridged nanostructures were obtained via coupling between silicon atoms and brominated phenyl groups at the ortho position on Au(111). Here, we demonstrate a high generality of this strategy via syntheses of silole derivatives and nanoribbon structures with eight&#8208;membered sila&#8208;cyclic rings from dibrominated molecules at the bay and peri positions on Au(111), respectively. Their structures and electronic properties were investigated by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This work demonstrates a great potential to deal with heavy group 14 elements in on&#8208;surface silicon chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) can be excellent candidates for piezochromic luminescent (PCL) materials due to their structural dynamics. Spatial donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) stacking arrangements enable the modulation of inter&#8208; and intramolecular D&#8208;A interactions, as well as spatial charge transfer states, under varying pressure conditions. Herein, we demonstrate an effective approach toward dynamic reversible full&#8208;color PCL materials with TSCT&#8208;TADF characteristics. Their single crystals exhibit a full&#8208;color&#8208;gamut PCL process spanning a range of 170 nm. Moreover, the TSCT&#8208;TADF&#8208;PCL emitters display a unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and show promising application in X&#8208;ray scintillator imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>A Domino Protocol toward High&#8208;performance Unsymmetrical Dibenzo[d,d']thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b']dithiophenes Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsymmetric organic semiconductors have many advantages such as good solubility, rich intermolecular interactions for potential various optoelectronic applications. However, their synthesis is more challenging due to intricate structures thus normally suffering tedious synthesis. Herein, we report a trisulfur radical anion (S3&#8226;&#8315;) triggered domino thienannulation strategy for the synthesis of dibenzo[d,d']thieno[2,3&#8208;b;4,5&#8208;b']dithiophenes (DBTDTs) using readily available 1&#8208;halo&#8208;2&#8208;ethynylbenzenes as starting materials.   This domino protocol features no metal catalyst and the formation of six C&#8211;S and one C&#8211;C bonds in a one&#8208;pot reaction. Mechanistic study revealed a unique domino radical anion pathway. Single crystal structure analysis of unsymmetric DBTDT shows that its unique unsymmetric structure endows rich and multiple weak S&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;S interactions between molecules, which enables the large intermolecular transfer integrals of 86 meV and efficient charge transport performance with a carrier mobility of 1.52 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. This study provides a facile and highly efficient synthetic strategy for more high&#8208;performance unsymmetric organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Triisocyanate Derived Interlayer and High&#8208;Melting&#8208;Point Doping Promoter Boost Operational Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formamidinium lead triiodide serves as the optimal light&#8208;absorbing layer in single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells. However, achieving operational stability of high&#8208;efficiency n&#8208;i&#8208;p type devices at elevated temperatures remains challenging. In this work, we implemented effective surface modifications on microcrystalline perovskite films. This involved the nucleophilic addition of formamidinium cations and coordination of residual PbI2 with triphenylmethane triisocyanate as well as subsequent polymerization. The in&#8208;situ growth of a cross&#8208;linking network chemically anchored on the perovskite film in this approach effectively reduced trap densities, favorably altered surface work function, suppressing interface charge recombination and thus enhancing cell efficiency. Coupled with a high&#8208;melting&#8208;point air&#8208;doping promoter, we fabricated n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite solar cells surpassing 25% efficiency, demonstrating excellent operational stability at 65&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Fission in a New Series of Systematically Designed Through&#8208;space Coupled Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet fission (SF) holds great promise for&#160;photovoltaic technologies, where tetracenes, with their relatively high triplet energies, play a major role for application in silicon&#8208;based solar cells. However, the SF efficiencies in tetracene dimers are low due to the unfavorable energetics of their singlet and triplet energy levels. In the solid state, tetracene exhibits high yields of triplet formation through SF, raising great interest about the underlying mechanisms. To address this discrepancy, we designed and prepared a novel molecular system based on a hexaphenylbenzene core decorated with 2 to 6 tetracene chromophores. The spatial arrangement of tetracene units, induced by steric hindrance in the central part, dictates through&#8208;space coupling, making it a relevant model for solid&#8208;state chromophore organization. We then revealed a remarkable increase in SF quantum yield with the number of tetracenes, reaching quantitative (196%) triplet pair formation in hexamer. We observed a short&#8208;lived correlated triplet pair and limited magnetic effects, indicating ineffective triplet dissociation in these through&#8208;space coupled systems. These findings emphasize the crucial role of the number of chromophores involved and the interchromophore arrangement for the SF efficiency. The insights gained from this study will aid designing more efficient and technology&#8208;compatible SF systems for applications in photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Activation of Nucleobases with Small Molecules for the Conditional Control of Antisense Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conditionally controlled antisense oligonucleotides provide precise interrogation of gene function at different developmental stages in animal models. Few examples of small molecule&#8208;induced activation of antisense function exist, and have been restricted to cyclic morpholinos, which can have significant background activity in the absence of the trigger. Here, we provide a new approach by introducing azido&#8208;caged nucleobases that are site&#8208;specifically introduced into antisense morpholinos. The caging group design is a simple azidomethylene (Azm) group that, despite its very small size, blocks Watson&#8208;Crick base pairing in a programmable fashion. Furthermore, it undergoes facile decaging via Staudinger reduction when exposed to a small molecule phosphine, generating the native antisense oligonucleotide under conditions compatible with biological environments. We demonstrated small molecule&#8208;induced gene knockdown in mammalian cells, zebrafish embryos, and Xenopus embryos. We validate the general applicability of this approach by targeting three different genes.</dc:description>

         <title>Polycationic Open&#8208;Shell Cyclophanes: Synthesis of Electron&#8208;Rich Chiral Macrocycles, and Redox&#8208;Dependent Electronic States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated chiral nanorings with intriguing electronic structures and chiroptical properties have attracted considerable interests in synthetic chemistry and materials science. We present the design principles to access new chiral macrocycles (1 and 2) that are essentially built on the key components of main&#8208;group electron&#8208;donating carbazolyl moieties or the &#960;&#8208;expanded aza[7]helicenes. Both macrocycles show the unique molecular conformations with a (quasi) figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight topology as a result of the conjugation patterns of 2,2&#8217;,7,7&#8217;&#8208;spirobifluorenyl in 1 and triarylamine&#8208;coupled aza[7]helicene&#8208;based building blocks in 2. This electronic nature of redox&#8208;active, carbazole&#8208;rich backbones enabled these macrocycles to be readily oxidized chemically and electrochemically, leading to the sequential production of a series of positively charged polycationic open&#8208;shell cyclophanes. Their redox&#8208;dependent electronic states of the resulting multispin polyradicals have been characterized by VT&#8208;ESR, UV&#8722;vis&#8722;NIR absorption and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The singlet (&#916;ES&#8208;T = &#8210;1.29 kcal mol&#8210;1) and a nearly degenerate singlet&#8208;triplet ground state (&#916;ES&#8208;T(calcd) = &#8210;0.15 kcal mol&#8210;1 and &#916;ES&#8208;T(exp) = 0.01 kcal mol&#8210;1) were proved for diradical dications 12+2&#8226; and 22+2&#8226;, respectively. Our work provides an experimental proof for the construction of electron&#8208;donating new chiral nanorings, and more importantly for highly charged polyradicals with potential applications in chirospintronics and organic conductors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;entity electrochemistry is a powerful tool that enables the study of electrochemical processes at interfaces and provides insights into the intrinsic chemical and structural heterogeneities of individual entities. Signal processing is a critical aspect of single&#8208;entity electrochemical measurements and can be used for data recognition, classification, and interpretation. In this review, we summarize the recent five&#8208;year advancements in signal processing techniques for single&#8208;entity electrochemistry and highlight their importance in obtaining high&#8208;quality data and extracting effective features from electrochemical signals, which are generally applicable in single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Moreover, we shed light on electrochemical noise analysis to obtain single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint spectra that can provide rich information about the ion networks at the interface. By incorporating advanced data analysis tools and artificial intelligence algorithms, single&#8208;entity electrochemical measurements would revolutionize the field of single&#8208;entity analysis, leading to new fundamental discoveries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the challenging O&#8208;trifluoromethylation of carboxylic acids via the formation and activation of acyloxy(phenyl)trifluoromethyl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes. The method provides an easy access to various potentially valuable and hitherto elusive trifluoromethyl carboxylic esters. A remarkably wide range of substrates with commonly encountered functional groups are compatible with this reaction, including aromatic and aliphatic carboxylic acids, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. The reaction mechanism and the origins of the enhanced reactivity by zinc chloride (ZnCl2) were discussed from experimental evidence and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanols by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Alkenylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols via Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C&#8211;H alkenylation with the assistance of a commercially available L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid has been realized for the first time. Employing oxime ether as the directing group, silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanol derivatives could be readily prepared with excellent enantioselectivities, featuring a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance. Moreover, parallel kinetic resolution with unsymmetric substrates further highlighted the generality of this protocol. Mechanistic studies indicate that L&#8208;pyroglutamic acid could stabilize the Pd catalyst and provide excellent chiral induction. Preliminary computational studies unveil the origin of the enantioselectivity in the C&#8211;H bond activation step.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Amides: A General Method for the Self&#8208;Immolative Release of Amide&#8208;Containing Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controlled liberation of molecules from a constructed framework is a subject of profound interest across various chemical fields. It allows for the masking of a molecule's properties and precise deployment upon a single controllable release event. While numerous methodologies have been developed for amines, alcohols, and thiols, approaches for utilising amides as payload&#8208;release handles are still in their early stages of development, despite the prevalence of amides in therapeutic compounds and materials. Herein, is presented a comprehensive strategy for the controlled and selective release of a diverse range of amides with stable linkers. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated by its successful application in the targeted release of various amide&#8208;containing drugs in their natural form via the use of commonly used trigger motifs, such as dipeptides or glycosides. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic linezolid has been successfully converted into a prodrug form and released selectively only in the presence of the trigger event. Significantly, in its prodrug state, no activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was exhibited. Linezolid's full potential was achieved only upon controlled release, where an equipotent efficacy to the free linezolid control was demonstrated, thus emphasising the immense potential of this method.</dc:description>

         <title>Connections to the Electrodes Control the Transport Mechanism in Single&#8208;Molecule Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When designing a molecular electronic device for a specific function, it is necessary to control whether the charge&#8208;transport mechanism is phase&#8208;coherent transmission or particle&#8208;like hopping. Here we report a systematic study of charge transport through single zinc&#8208;porphyrin molecules embedded in graphene nanogaps to form transistors, and show that the transport mechanism depends on the chemistry of the molecule&#8211;electrode interfaces. We show that van der Waals interactions between molecular anchoring groups and graphene yield transport characteristic of Coulomb blockade with incoherent sequential hopping, whereas covalent molecule&#8211;electrode amide bonds give intermediately or strongly coupled single&#8208;molecule devices that display coherent transmission. These findings demonstrate the importance of interfacial engineering in molecular electronic circuits.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Trisubstituted Vicinal Diols through Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Allylation of Ketones with Siloxypropadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral trisubstituted vicinal diols are a type of important organic compounds, serving as both common structure units in bioactive natural products and chiral auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, by using siloxypropadienes as the precursors of allyl copper(I) species, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective and enantioselective reductive allylation of ketones was achieved, providing both syn&#8208;diols and anti&#8208;diols in good to excellent enantioselectivity. DFT calculations show that cis&#8208;&#947;&#8208;siloxy&#8208;allyl copper species are generated favorably with either 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene or 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene. Moreover, the steric difference of TBS group and TIPS group distinguishes the face selectivity of acetophenone, leading to syn&#8208;selectivity for 1&#8208;TBSO&#8208;propadiene and anti&#8208;selectivity for 1&#8208;TIPSO&#8208;propadiene. Easy transformations of the products were performed, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the present method. Moreover, one chiral diol prepared in the above transformations was used as a suitable organocatalyst for the catalytic asymmetric reductive self&#8208;coupling of aldimines generated in situ with B2(neo)2.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Carbon Dioxide/Lithium Oxalate Regulation toward Advanced Aprotic Lithium Carbon Dioxide Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8211;CO2 batteries have received significant attention owing to their advantages of combining greenhouse gas utilization and energy storage. However, the high kinetic barrier between gaseous CO2 and the Li2CO3 product leads to a low operating voltage (&lt;2.5 V) and poor energy efficiency. In addition, the reversibility of Li2CO3 has always been questioned owing to the introduction of more decomposition paths caused by its higher charging plateau. Here, a novel "trinity" Li&#8211;CO2 battery system was developed by synergizing CO2, soluble redox mediator (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidoxyl, as TEM RM), and reduced graphene oxide electrode to enable selective conversion of CO2 to Li2C2O4. The designed Li&#8211;CO2 battery exhibited an output plateau reaching up to 2.97 V, higher than the equilibrium potential of 2.80 V for Li2CO3, and an ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 97.1%. The superior performance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is attributed to the TEM RM&#8208;mediated preferential growth mechanism of Li2C2O4, which enhances the reaction kinetics and rechargeability. Such a unique design enables batteries to cope with sudden CO2&#8208;deficient environments, which provides an avenue for the rationally design of CO2 conversion reactions and a feasible guide for next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ni/Co Activity by Neighboring Pt Atoms in NiCoP/MXene Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate neighboring Pt atoms can enhance the metal activity of NiCoP for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, it remains a great challenge to link Pt and NiCoP. Herein, we introduced curvature of bowl&#8208;like structure to construct Pt/NiCoP interface by adding a minimal 1&#8240;&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio Pt. The as&#8208;prepared sample only requires an overpotential of 26.5 and 181.6 mV to accordingly achieve the current density of 10 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1M KOH. The water dissociation energy barrier (Ea) has a ~43% decrease compared with NiCoP counterpart. It also shows an ultrahigh stability with a small degradation rate of 10.6 &#956;V h&#8722;1 at harsh conditions (500 mA cm&#8722;2 and 50 &#176;C) after 3000 hrs. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) verify the interface electron transfer lowers the valence state of Co/Ni and activates them. DFT calculations also confirm the catalytic transition step of NiCoP can change from Heyrovsky&#160;(2.71 eV) to Tafel step (0.51 eV) in the neighborhood of Pt, in accord with the result of the improved Hads at the interface disclosed by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Highly Robust Full&#8208;Color Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence and Stable White Organic Afterglow from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials have been developed by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into a melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer by solution polymerization. Their afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively. Moreover, the resulting polymer films showed a color&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode organic afterglow and outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances.







Abstract
In this work, full&#8208;color and stable white organic afterglow materials with outstanding water, organic solvents, and temperature resistances have been developed for the first time by embedding the selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into melamine&#8208;formaldehyde polymer via solution polymerization. The afterglow quantum yields and lifetimes of the resulting polymer films were up to 22.7&#8201;% and 4.83&#8197;s, respectively, under ambient conditions. For the coronene&#8208;doped sample, its afterglow color could be linearly tuned between yellow and blue by adjusting the temperature, and it could still emit an intense blue afterglow with a lifetime of 0.68&#8197;s at 440&#8197;K. Moreover, the films showed a bright and stable white afterglow at 370&#8197;K with a lifetime of 2.80&#8197;s and maintained an excellent afterglow performance after soaking in water and organic solvents for more than 150&#8197;days. In addition, the application potential of the polymer films in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting was also demonstrated.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Base Cascades in Zeotype Single Crystal for Sugar Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;crystal indium&#8208;containing zeolite catalyst with both Lewis acid and base sites intelligently participated in the isomerization of very high concentrations of glucose (33&#8201;%) to fructose in methanol, yielding 54.9&#8201;% fructose and recovering 93.9&#8201;% total sugar following tandem hydrolysis.







Abstract
The chemically catalyzed production of fructose syrup from high concentrations of glucose is crucial for the food industry and biorefining. In this work, a single crystal catalyst was synthesized via protective desilication of zeolite while incorporating indium. Glucose was isomerized in methanol at concentrations as high as 33&#8197;wt&#8201;% before being hydrolyzed with water. The final fructose production was 54.9&#8201;%, with 89.1&#8201;% selectivity and 93.3&#8201;% sugar recovery, the highest isomerization rate at the highest concentration ever reported. Indium was present in the single&#8208;crystal catalyst as oxide nanoparticles and boundary framework atoms, and it achieved intelligent cooperation in the production of fructose syrup in methanol by catalyzing isomerization and selective glycosidation, minimizing degradation due to fructose accumulation and eliminating side reactions. This study contributed to the advancement of the industrial practice of chemically catalyzed glucose isomerization.

         <title>P450&#8208;Modified Multicyclic Cyclophane&#8208;Containing Ribosomally Synthesized and Post&#8208;Translationally Modified Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis identified 1,057 putative P450&#8208;modified RiPP gene clusters classified into 11 different clades. Gene clusters from Class&#8197;3 and 9, which encode multiple aromatic amino acids, were selected for heterologous expreesion. A total of 11 P450&#8208;modified multicyclic peptides were successfully characterized, with some containing unusual cyclophane linkers, demonstrating the powerful catalytic capabilities of P450 enzymes.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides with cyclophane linkers are an attractive compound type owing to the fine&#8208;tuned rigid three&#8208;dimensional structures and unusual biophysical features. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are capable of catalyzing not only the C&#8722;C and C&#8722;O oxidative coupling reactions found in vancomycin and other nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), but they also exhibit novel catalytic activities to generate cyclic ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) through cyclophane linkage. To discover more P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs, we set out to find cryptic and unknown P450&#8208;modified RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) through genome mining. Synergized bioinformatic analysis reveals that P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs are broadly distributed in bacteria and can be classified into 11&#8197;classes. Focusing on two classes of P450&#8208;modified RiPP BGCs where precursor peptides contain multiple conserved aromatic amino acid residues, we characterized 11 novel P450&#8208;modified multicyclic RiPPs with different cyclophane linkers through heterologous expression. Further mutation of the key ring&#8208;forming residues and combinatorial biosynthesis study revealed the order of bond formation and the specificity of P450s. This study reveals the functional diversity of P450 enzymes involved in the cyclophane&#8208;containing RiPPs and indicates that P450 enzymes are promising tools for rapidly obtaining structurally diverse cyclic peptide derivatives.

         <title>Wavelength Selective Photocontrol of Hybrid Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran Photoswitches with Overlapping Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two novel photoswitch azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads which are connected in meta or para position. While in the meta&#8208;analogue the two switching units behaves orthogonally according to the meta&#8208;rule, we exploited the red&#8208;shift in the p&#8208;substituted compound to obtain decoupled switching moieties. These insights provide the basis for the development of new multichromic switches for information and energy storage or other applications.







Abstract
Compounds with multiple photoswitching units are appealing for complex photochemical control of molecular materials and nanostructures. Herein, we synthesized novel meta&#8208; and para&#8208; connected (related to the nitrogen of the indoline) azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran dyads, in which the central benzene unit is shared by both switches. We investigated their photochemistry using static and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy as well as quantum chemical calculations. In the meta&#8208;compound, the individual components are photochemically decoupled due to the meta&#8208;pattern. In the para&#8208;compound the spiro&#8208;connectivity leads to a bifunctional photoswitchable system with a red&#8208;shifted absorption. The azobenzene and the spiropyran can thus be addressed and switched independently by light of appropriate wavelength. Through the different connectivity patterns two different orthogonally photoswitchable systems have been obtained which are promising candidates for complex applications of light control.

         <title>Ambient Catalytic Spinning of Polyethylene Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalently immobilized single&#8208;atom Ni catalyst inside nano&#8208;channels of the anodized Al2O3 membrane enables direct catalytic&#8208;spinning of multifilament PE nanofibers near room temperature. Confinement in the nano&#8208;pores has a positive influence on ethylene extrusion polymerization, namely on the chain&#8208;growth and chain&#8208;walking process&#8211;producing high&#8208;performance microstructures and morphologies.







Abstract
A novel single&#8208;atom Ni(II) catalyst (Ni&#8208;OH) is covalently immobilized onto the nano&#8208;channels of mesoporous Santa Barbara Amorphous (SBA)&#8208;15 particles and isotropic Anodized Aluminum Oxide (AAO) membrane for confined&#8208;space ethylene extrusion polymerization. The presence of surface&#8208;tethered Ni complexes (Ni@SBA&#8208;15 and Ni@AAO) is confirmed by the inductively coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectrometry (ICP&#8208;OES) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the catalytic spinning process, the produced PE materials exhibit very homogeneous fibrous morphology at nanoscale (diameter: ~50&#8197;nm). The synthesized PE nanofibers extrude in a highly oriented manner from the nano&#8208;reactors at ambient temperature. Remarkably high Mw (1.62&#215;106&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1), melting point (124&#8201;&#176;C), and crystallinity (41.8&#8201;%) are observed among PE samples thanks to the confined&#8208;space polymerization. The chain&#8208;walking behavior of surface tethered Ni catalysts is greatly limited by the confinement inside the nano&#8208;channels, leading to the formation of very low&#8208;branched PE materials (13.6/1000&#8197;C). Due to fixed supported catalytic topology and room temperature, the filaments are expected to be free of entanglement. This work signifies an important step towards the realization of a continuous mild catalytic&#8208;spinning (CATSPIN) process, where the polymer is directly synthesized into fiber shape at negligible chain branching and elegantly avoiding common limitations like thermal degradation or molecular entanglement.

         <title>Photoactivatable Engineering of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;Inducible DNAzyme Probe for In Situ Imaging of Nuclear Zinc Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;switch DNAzyme system based on nuclear&#8208;localized CRISPR/Cas9 and 470&#8197;nm light activation is reported. The system enabled the in situ localization and photoactivated imaging of metal ions in the cell nucleus.







Abstract
DNAzyme&#8208;based fluorescent probes for imaging metal ions in living cells have received much attention recently. However, employing in situ metal ions imaging within subcellular organelles, such as nucleus, remains a significant challenge. We developed a three&#8208;stranded DNAzyme probe (TSDP) that contained a 20&#8208;base&#8208;pair (20&#8208;bp) recognition site of a CRISPR/Cas9, which blocks the DNAzyme activity. When Cas9, with its specialized nuclear localization function, forms an active complex with sgRNA within the cell nucleus, it cleaves the TSDP at the recognition site, resulting in the in situ formation of catalytic DNAzyme structure. With this design, the CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;inducible imaging of nuclear Zn2+ is demonstrated in living cells. Moreover, the superiority of CRISPR&#8208;DNAzyme for spatiotemporal control imaging was demonstrated by integrating it with photoactivation strategy and Boolean logic gate for dynamic monitoring nuclear Zn2+ in both HeLa cells and mice. Collectively, this conceptual design expands the DNAzyme toolbox for visualizing nuclear metal ions and thus provides new analytical methods for nuclear metal&#8208;associated biology.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2 Generation: Controlled and Optimized Dispersion of Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts Based on Pt&#8208;TCPP Planar Adsorption on TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially controlled TiO2 surface decoration with Pt single&#8208;atom (SA) active sites is achieved by self&#8208;organized planar adsorption of mixed TCPP/Pt&#8208;TCPP precursor compounds. Via a suitable thermal treatment, an optimal loading and distribution of SA co&#8208;catalytic sites are established, which is a key factor in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.







Abstract
When using single atoms (SAs) as a co&#8208;catalyst in photocatalytic H2 generation, achieving a well&#8208;dispersed, evenly distributed and adjustable SA surface density on a semiconductor surface is a challenging task. In the present work we use the planar adsorption of tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin (TCPP) and its platinum coordinated analogue, Pt&#8208;TCPP, onto anatase TiO2 surfaces to establish a spatially controlled decoration of SAs. We show that the surface Pt SA density can be very well controlled by co&#8208;adsorption of Pt&#8208;TCPP and TCPP in the planar monolayer regime, and by adjusting the Pt&#8208;TCPP to TCPP ratio a desired well dispersed surface density of SAs up to 2.6&#215;105&#8197;atoms&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;2 can be established (which is the most effective Pt SA loading for photocatalysis). This distribution and the SA state are maintained after a thermal treatment in air, and an optimized SA density as well as a most active form of Pt for photocatalytic H2 evolution can be established and maintained.

&lt;p&gt;Spatially controlled TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface decoration with Pt single-atom (SA) active sites is achieved by self-organized planar adsorption of mixed TCPP/Pt-TCPP precursor compounds. Via a suitable thermal treatment, an optimal loading and distribution of SA co-catalytic sites are established, which is a key factor in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

         <title>LiNO3&#8208;Based Electrolytes via Electron&#8208;Donation Modulation for Sustainable Nonaqueous Lithium Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron donation modulation rules are proposed to elucidate the formation mechanism and stability principle of LiNO3 as the single salt for electrolytes of nonaqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. High donor&#8208;number solvents with strong electron&#8208;donation ability dissolve LiNO3 while low donor&#8208;number solvents with weak electron&#8208;donation ability regulate the AI&#8208;ISC structure to stabilize the electrolyte. The LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte enables remarkable long&#8208;term cycling performance by improving the solvent reduction tolerance.







Abstract
LiPF6 as a dominant lithium salt of electrolyte is widely used in commercial rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its well&#8208;balanced properties, including high solubility in organic solvents, good electrochemical stability, and high ionic conductivity. However, it suffers from several undesirable properties, such as high moisture sensitivity, thermal instability, and high cost. To address these issues, herein, we propose an electron&#8208;donation modulation (EDM) rule for the development of low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and electrochemically compatible LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes. We employ high donor&#8208;number solvents (HDNSs) with strong electron&#8208;donation ability to dissolve LiNO3, while low donor&#8208;number solvents (LDNSs) with weak electron&#8208;donation ability are used to regulate the solvation structure to stabilize the electrolytes. As an example, we design the LiNO3&#8208;DMSO@PC electrolyte, where DMSO acts as an HDNS and PC serves as an LDNS. This electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical compatibility with graphite anodes, as well as the LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes, leading to stable cycling over 200&#8197;cycles. Through spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculation, we uncover the underlying mechanism responsible for the stabilization of these electrolytes. Our findings provide valuable insights into the preparation of LiNO3&#8208;based electrolytes using the EDM rule, opening new avenues for the development of advanced electrolytes with versatile functions for sustainable rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Solid State Machinery of Multiple Dynamic Elements in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexible framework sliding governs the overall dynamical machinery. Moving elements, bicyclopentane, bipyridyls and azo groups, rotate with modulated dynamics in response to chemical stimuli such as I2 vapors and pressurized CO2 diffused into a pillared MOF.







Abstract
Engineering coordinated rotational motion in porous architectures enables the fabrication of molecular machines in solids. A flexible two&#8208;fold interpenetrated pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework precisely organizes fast mobile elements such as bicyclopentane (BCP) (107&#8197;Hz regime at 85&#8197;K), two distinct pyridyl rotors and E&#8208;azo group involved in pedal&#8208;like motion. Reciprocal sliding of the two sub&#8208;networks, switched by chemical stimuli, modulated the sizes of the channels and finally the overall dynamical machinery. Actually, iodine&#8208;vapor adsorption drives a dramatic structural rearrangement, displacing the two distinct subnets in a concerted piston&#8208;like motion. Unconventionally, BCP mobility increases, exploring ultra&#8208;fast dynamics (107&#8197;Hz) at temperatures as low as 44&#8197;K, while the pyridyl rotors diverge into a faster and slower dynamical regime by symmetry lowering. Indeed, one pillar ring gained greater rotary freedom as carried by the azo&#8208;group in a crank&#8208;like motion. A peculiar behavior was stimulated by pressurized CO2, which regulates BCP dynamics upon incremental site occupation. The rotary dynamics is intrinsically coupled to the framework flexibility as demonstrated by complementary experimental evidence (multinuclear solid&#8208;state NMR down to very low temperatures, synchrotron radiation XRD, gas sorption) and computational modelling, which helps elucidate the highly sophisticated rotor&#8208;structure interplay.

         <title>Long&#8208;lifespan Zinc&#8208;ion Capacitors Enabled by Anodes Integrated with Interconnected Mesoporous Chitosan Membranes through Electrophoresis&#8208;driven Phase Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
Interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes are fabricated through electrophoresis. Reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation, endowing zinc ion capacitors with ultra&#8208;high stability.







Abstract
The advancement of highly secure and inexpensive aqueous zinc ion energy storage devices is impeded by issues, including dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution and corrosion of zinc anodes. It is essential to modify the interface of zinc anodes that homogenizes ion flux and facilitates highly reversible zinc planarized deposition and stripping. Herein, by coupling zinc ion coordination with acid&#8208;base neutralization under the driving of electrophoresis, manageable mesoscopic phase separation for constructing chitosan frameworks was achieved, thereby fabricating interconnected mesoporous chitosan membranes based heterogeneous quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes integrated with anodes. The framework is constructed by twisted chitosan nanofiber bundles, forming a three&#8208;dimensional continuous spindle&#8208;shaped pore structure. With this framework, the electrolyte provides exceptional ion conductivity of 25.1&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, with a puncture resistance strength of 2.3&#8197;GPa. In addition, the amino groups of chitosan molecule can make the surface of the framework positively charged. Thus, reversible zinc planarized deposition is successfully induced by the synergistic effect of stress constraint and electrostatic modulation. As a result, as&#8208;assembled zinc ion capacitor has an excellent cycle life and sustains the capacity by over 95&#8201;% after 20000&#8197;cycles at a current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This research presents a constructive strategy for stable electrolytes&#8208;integrated zinc anodes.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Continuous and In Situ Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide by Sulfur&#8208;Functionalized Polymer Catalyst for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfur functionalized polymer photocatalyst for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production is synthesized through multi&#8208;component reactions. Continuous H2O2 production, photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton water treatment, and natural water sterilization are realized in the panel reactor system under natural sunlight irradiation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic H2O2 generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water&#8208;mediated and catalyst&#8208;free multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H2O2 production efficiency (3132&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20&#8197;cm) is constructed for large&#8208;scale production of H2O2, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H2O2 utilization efficiency of the photo&#8208;self&#8208;Fenton system using in situ generated H2O2 is found 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of the traditional photo&#8208;Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large&#8208;scale continuous H2O2 photocatalytic production and water treatment.

&lt;p&gt;A sulfur functionalized polymer photocatalyst for highly-efficient photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is synthesized through multi-component reactions. Continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, photo-self-Fenton water treatment, and natural water sterilization are realized in the panel reactor system under natural sunlight irradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation system based on polymer catalyst receives increasing attention in recent years; however, the insufficient charge separation efficiency and low oxygen adsorption/activation capacity severely limit their potential application. In this study, a sulfur (C=S) functionalized polymer catalyst is reported through a green water-mediated and catalyst-free multi-component reactions (MCRs) route. The sulfur functional group endows the polymer with a suitable energy band and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pair. The reported polymer achieves a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency (3132&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in pure water without oxygen aeration. To demonstrate their potential in in situ wastewater treatment, a panel reactor system (20&#215;20&#8197;cm) is constructed for large-scale production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which realizes continuous degradation of emerging pollutants including antibiotics and bisphenol A under natural sunlight irradiation condition. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency of the photo-self-Fenton system using in situ generated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of the traditional photo-Fenton system. This study offers new insights in green synthesis and design of functional polymer photocatalyst, and demonstrates the feasibility of panel reactor system for large-scale continuous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalytic production and water treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of Deuterium Isotopes on Pt(II) Complexes and Their Impact on Organic NIR Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed general guidelines for the effect of deuterium isotopes on the NIR emission efficiency of Pt(II) complexes and common organic NIR emitters. Also, in this study the NIR OLED based on deuterated Pt(II) complex DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f emitter attains 796&#8197;nm electroluminescence with EQEmax of 16.6&#8201;% and radiance of 32,279&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, which sets new records for NIR OLEDs of &gt;750&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Insight into effect of deuterium isotopes on organic near&#8208;IR (NIR) emitters was explored by the use of self&#8208;assembled Pt(II) complexes H&#8208;3&#8208;f and HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, and their deuterated analogues D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f, respectively (Scheme&#8197;2). In vacuum deposited thin film, albeit having nearly identical emission spectral feature maximized at ~810&#8197;nm, H&#8208;3&#8208;f and D&#8208;3&#8208;f exhibit remarkable difference in photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 29&#8201;% and 50&#8201;%, respectively. Distinction in PLQY is also observed for HPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (800&#8197;nm, 50&#8201;%) and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f (798&#8197;nm, 67&#8201;%). We then elucidated the theoretical differences in the impact on near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence between Pt(II) complexes and organic small molecules upon deuteration. The results establish a general guideline for the deuteration on NIR emission efficiency. From a perspective of practical application, NIR OLEDs based on D&#8208;3&#8208;f and DPh&#8208;3&#8208;f emitters attain EQEmax of 15.5&#8201;% (radiance 31,287&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2) and 16.6&#8201;% (radiance of 32,279&#8197;mW&#8201;Sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2) at 764&#8197;nm and 796&#8197;nm, respectively, both of which set new records for NIR OLEDs of &gt;750&#8197;nm.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Aqueous All&#8208;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed by matching the S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples with rational electrode potential difference. The aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high specific capacity and discharge voltage, contributing to an enhanced energy density.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising energy storage devices because of their high safety and low cost. However, their energy densities are generally unsatisfactory due to the limited capacities of ion&#8208;inserted electrode materials, prohibiting their widespread applications. Herein, a high&#8208;energy aqueous all&#8208;sulfur battery was constructed via matching S/Cu2S and S/CaSx redox couples. In such batteries, both cathodes and anodes undergo the conversion reaction between sulfur/metal sulfides redox couples, which display high specific capacities and rational electrode potential difference. Furthermore, during the charge/discharge process, the simultaneous redox of Cu2+ ion charge&#8208;carriers also takes place and contributes to a more two&#8208;electron transfer, which doubles the capacity of cathodes. As a result, the assembled aqueous all&#8208;sulfur batteries deliver a high discharge capacity of 447&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 based on total mass of sulfur in cathode and anode at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, contributing to an enhanced energy density of 393&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. This work will widen the scope for the design of high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries.

         <title>Leveraging Radiation&#8208;triggered Metal Prodrug Activation Through Nanosurface Energy Transfer for Directed Radio&#8208;chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for radiation&#8208;triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer, from electrons of a gold nanocluster core to reductive Ru (II) active center in the hybrid layer, is presented to overcome the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species. The proposed nanoplatform&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy leads to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based drugs currently dominate the field of chemotherapeutic agents; however, achieving the controlled activation of metal prodrugs remains a substantial challenge. Here, we propose a universal strategy for the radiation&#8208;triggered activation of metal prodrugs via nanosurface energy transfer (NSET). The core&#8211;shell nanoplatform (Ru&#8208;GNC) is composed of gold nanoclusters (GNC) and ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;containing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid coatings. Upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, chemotherapeutic Ru (II) complexes were released in a controlled manner through a unique NSET process involving the transfer of photoelectron energy from the radiation&#8208;excited Ru&#8208;GNCs to the Ru&#8208;containing hybrid layer. In contrast to the traditional radiation&#8208;triggered activation of prodrugs, such an NSET&#8208;based system ensures that the reactive species in the tumor microenvironment are present in sufficient quantity and are not easily quenched. Additionally, ultrasmall Ru&#8208;GNCs preferably target mitochondria and profoundly disrupt the respiratory chain upon irradiation, leading to radiosensitization by generating abundant reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ru&#8208;GNC&#8208;directed radiochemotherapy induces immunogenic cell death, resulting in significant therapeutic outcomes when combined with the programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8722;L1) checkpoint blockade. This NSET strategy represents a breakthrough in designing radiation&#8208;triggered nanoplatforms for metal&#8208;prodrug&#8208;mediated cancer treatment in an efficient and controllable manner.

         <dc:description>
Here, a near surface high&#8208;entropy zone was fabricated into single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2, including a Gd doped LiCeO2 shell and Ce/Gd dopant&#8208;concentrated layer. This synergistic effect can effectively prevent the in&#8208;plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding and formation of intragranular nanocracks.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are promising lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials for their high reversible capacity, but they suffer from fast structural degradation during cycling. Here, we report the Ce/Gd incorporated single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.83Co0.07Mn0.10O2 (SC&#8208;NCM) cathode materials with significantly enhanced cycling stability. The Gd ions are adequately incorporated in SC&#8208;NCM while Ce ions are prone to aggregate in the outer surface, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;entropy zone in the near&#8208;surface of SC&#8208;NCM, including a Gd doped LiCeO2 (LCGO) shell and Ce/Gd dopant&#8208;concentrated layer. The high&#8208;entropy zone can effectively inhibit the oxygen evolution and prevent the formation of oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, it leads to a greatly improved H2&#8208;H3 phase transformation reversibility and mitigated stress/strain caused by Li&#8208;ion extraction/insertion during (de)lithiation process. The synergetic effects of reduced oxygen vacancies concentration and mitigated stress/strain can effectively prevent the in&#8208;plane migration of TM ions, lattice planar gliding as well as the formation of intragranular nanocracks. Consequently, Ce/Gd incorporated SC&#8208;NCM (SC&#8208;NCM@CG2) delivers a high initial discharge specific capacity of 219.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 90.2&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1.0&#8197;C.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Approach for Z&#8208;Vinyl Fluorides by Hydrofluorination of Alkynes bearing SF4 and SF5 Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and stereoselective approach for the synthesis of Z&#8208;vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups has been reported. TBAF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O exhibits high compatibility, allowing for easy incorporation of fluoride into SF5 and SF4 alkynes at room temperature. Competitive experiments and DFT calculations verify that SF5 alkynes react much faster than SF4 alkynes.







Abstract
The synthesis of vinyl fluorides plays a crucial role in various scientific disciplines, including pharmaceutical and materials sciences. Herein, we present a direct and stereoselective hydrofluorination method for the synthesis of Z isomers of vinyl fluorides from alkynes containing unexplored SF5 and SF4 groups. Our strategy employed tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) as a fluorine source. It demonstrates high compatibility with aryls, biaryls, heteroaryls, and tert&#8208;alkyl groups, allowing facile incorporation of SF5 and SF4 groups across the triple bond without any transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This approach avoids the potential decomposition of the SF5 or SF4 units via coordination with transition metals or acidic protic sources. Remarkably, this transformation proceeded at room temperature without any additional additives, providing the Z isomer of vinyl fluorides in excellent yield and high selectivity. The presence of a water molecule as a hydrate in TBAF is essential for efficient conversion. This methodology opens new avenues for the synthesis of enchanting SF5&#8208; and SF4&#8208;containing fluorinated vinylic scaffolds, thereby providing advanced opportunities for novel drug discovery and fluorinated polymers.

         <title>Secondary&#8208;Bond&#8208;Driven Construction of a Polar Material Exhibiting Strong Broad&#8208;Spectrum Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation and Large Birefringence</title>

         <dc:description>
A secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven strategy for the construction of the first noncentrosymmetric vanadyl iodate lacking additional counter cations, VO2(H2O)(IO3), which possesses strong second&#8208;harmonic generation and sufficient birefringence, was reported.







Abstract
Considerable effort has been invested in the development of non&#8208;centrosymmetric (NCS) inorganic solids for ferroelectricity&#8208;, piezoelectricity&#8208; and, particularly, optical nonlinearity&#8208;related applications. While great progress has been made, a persistent problem is the difficulty in constructing NCS materials, which probably stems from non&#8208;directionality and unsaturation of the ionic bonds between metal counter&#8208;cations and covalent anionic modules. We report herein a secondary&#8208;bond&#8208;driven approach that circumvents the cancellation of dipole moments between adjacent anionic modules that has plagued second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) material design, and which thereby affords a polar structure with strong SHG properties. The resultant first NCS counter&#8208;cation&#8208;free iodate, VO2(H2O)(IO3) (VIO), a new class of iodate, crystallizes in a polar lattice with 
VO2(H2O)(IO3)] zigzag chains connected by weak hydrogen bonds and intermolecular forces. VIO exhibits very large SHG responses (18 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1200&#8197;nm, 1.5 &#215; KTiOPO4 @ 2100&#8197;nm) and sufficient birefringence (0.184 @ 546&#8197;nm). Calculations and crystal structure analysis attribute the large SHG responses to consistent polarization orientations of the 
VO2(H2O)(IO3)] chains controlled by secondary bonds. This study highlights the advantages of manipulating the secondary bonds in inorganic solids to control NCS structure and optical nonlinearity, affording a new perspective in the development of high&#8208;performance NLO materials.

         <title>Precisely Manipulating Molecular Packing via Tuning Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Topology Enabling High&#8208;Performance Nonfused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a series of low&#8208;cost nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with precisely regulated alkyl side&#8208;chains. It is found that tuning the topology of alkyl side&#8208;chains can effectively manipulate molecular assemble. Hence, the NFREA DPA&#8208;4 with asymmetric alkyl side&#8208;chains exhibits a tight packing and high crystallinity, thus contributing to improved electron mobility and boosted power conversion efficiency (16.67&#8201;%).







Abstract
In the development of high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs), the self&#8208;organization of organic semiconductors plays a crucial role. This study focuses on the precisely manipulation of molecular assemble via tuning alkyl side&#8208;chain topology in a series of low&#8208;cost nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs). Among the three NFREAs investigated, DPA&#8208;4, which possesses an asymmetric alkyl side&#8208;chain length, exhibits a tight packing in the crystal and high crystallinity in the film, contributing to improved electron mobility and favorable film morphology for DPA&#8208;4. As a result, the OSC device based on DPA&#8208;4 achieves an excellent power conversion efficiency of 16.67&#8201;%, ranking among the highest efficiencies for NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>In situ Implanting 3D Carbon Network Reinforced Zinc Composite by Powder Metallurgy for Highly Reversible Zn&#8208;based Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work provides a novel understanding of in situ implanted carbon network reinforcing Zn anode by powder metallurgy, moving from the surface/interface modification of Zn foil to the bulk phase regulation of Zn powder. The carbon network as an electron transport channel enhances the conductivity of the electrode and provides more nucleation sites to inhibit the growth of dendrites, realizing a highly reversible Zn anode.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;based batteries have emerged as compelling candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, owing to their intrinsic safety, remarkable theoretical energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

&lt;p&gt;Our work provides a novel understanding of in situ implanted carbon network reinforcing Zn anode by powder metallurgy, moving from the surface/interface modification of Zn foil to the bulk phase regulation of Zn powder. The carbon network as an electron transport channel enhances the conductivity of the electrode and provides more nucleation sites to inhibit the growth of dendrites, realizing a highly reversible Zn anode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn-based batteries have emerged as compelling candidates for grid-scale energy storage, owing to their intrinsic safety, remarkable theoretical energy density and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, the dendrite formation, side reactions, and corrosion on anode have overshadowed their practical applications. Herein, we present an in situ grown carbon network reinforcing Zn matrix anode prepared by powder metallurgy. This carbon network provides an uninterrupted internal electron transport pathway and optimize the surface electric field distribution, thereby enabling highly reversible Zn deposition. Consequently, symmetrical cells demonstrate impressive stability, running for over 880&#8197;h with a low voltage hysteresis (&#8776;32&#8197;mV). Furthermore, this Zn matrix composite anode exhibits enhanced performance in both the aqueous Zn-ion and the Zn-air batteries.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Ferrocene Quencher&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanomedicine for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence&#8208;Monitored Chemodynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored chemodynamic therapy agent (Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) is prepared by integrating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters via host&#8211;guest interaction. In addition to producing &#8901;OH, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and H2O2 causes Fc oxidation and consequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, allowing renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to self&#8208;monitor &#8901;OH formation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) generation is crucial for both the efficacy and safety of chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Although &#8901;OH probe&#8208;integrated CDT agents can track &#8901;OH production by themselves, they often require complicated synthetic procedures and suffer from self&#8208;consumption of &#8901;OH. Here, we report the facile fabrication of a self&#8208;monitored chemodynamic agent (denoted as Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs) by incorporating ferrocene (Fc) into &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;functionalized gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) via host&#8211;guest molecular recognition. The water&#8208;soluble CD served not only as a capping agent to protect AuNCs but also as a macrocyclic host to encapsulate and solubilize hydrophobic Fc guest with high Fenton reactivity for in vivo CDT applications. Importantly, the encapsulated Fc inside CD possessed strong electron&#8208;donating ability to effectively quench the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence of AuNCs through photoinduced electron transfer. After internalization of Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs by cancer cells, Fenton reaction between redox&#8208;active Fc quencher and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) caused Fc oxidation and subsequent NIR&#8208;II fluorescence recovery, which was accompanied by the formation of cytotoxic &#8901;OH and therefore allowed Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs to in situ self&#8208;report &#8901;OH generation without undesired &#8901;OH consumption. Such a NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;monitored CDT enabled the use of renal&#8208;clearable Fc&#8208;CD&#8208;AuNCs for efficient tumor growth inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.

         <title>Engineering Tunable Ratiometric Dual Emission in Single Emitter&#8208;based Amorphous Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular structural strategy enabling single emitter based dual&#8208;emission properties in various solid forms is presented. The developed amorphous films endow in situ regulation of the dual&#8208;emissive characteristics to show highly controllable multiple luminescent color tuning (yellow to blue including white emission), which benefits to the construction of an irreplaceable set of optical information combination.







Abstract
Molecular emitters with multi&#8208;emissive properties are in high demand in numerous fields, while these properties basically depend on specific molecular conformation and packing. For amorphous systems, special molecular arrangement is unnecessary, but it remains challenging to achieve such luminescent behaviors. Herein, we present a general strategy that takes advantage of molecular rigidity and S1&#8208;T1 energy gap balance for emitter design, which enables fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emission properties in various solid forms, whether crystalline or amorphous. Subsequently, the amorphism of the emitters based polymethyl methacrylate films endowed an in situ regulation of the dual&#8208;emissive characteristics. With the ratiometric regulation of phosphorescence by external stimuli and stable fluorescence as internal reference, highly controllable luminescent color tuning (yellow to blue including white emission) was achieved. There properties together with a persistent luminous behavior is of benefit for an irreplaceable set of optical information combination, featuring an ultrahigh&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting ability. Our research introduces a concept of eliminating the crystal&#8208;form and molecular&#8208;conformational dependence of complex luminescent properties through emitter molecular design. This has profound implications for the development of functional materials.

         <title>Disclosing Support&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Effect on Ambient Light&#8208;Driven Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation over Nickel/Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size of support significantly affects the reaction orientation of the light&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation. Small&#8208;size TiO2 supporting nickel exhibits enhanced metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI) and enables more light&#8208;induced electrons on TiO2 to transfer to Ni, thereby accelerating the H2 decomposition and CO2 methanation process.







Abstract
The size of support in heterogeneous catalysts can strongly affect the catalytic property but is rarely explored in light&#8208;driven catalysis. Herein, we demonstrate the size of TiO2 support governs the selectivity in photothermal CO2 hydrogenation by tuning the metal&#8208;support interactions (MSI). Small&#8208;size TiO2 loading nickel (Ni/TiO2&#8208;25) with enhanced MSI promotes photo&#8208;induced electrons of TiO2 migrating to Ni nanoparticles, thus favoring the H2 cleavage and accelerating the CH4 formation (227.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) under xenon light&#8208;induced temperature of 360&#8201;&#176;C. Conversely, Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 with large TiO2 prefers yielding CO (94.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) due to weak MSI, inefficient charge separation, and inadequate supply of activated hydrogen. Under ambient solar irradiation, Ni/TiO2&#8208;25 achieves the optimized CH4 rate (63.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) with selectivity of 99.8&#8201;%, while Ni/TiO2&#8208;100 exhibits the CO selectivity of 90.0&#8201;% with rate of 30.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work offers a novel approach to tailoring light&#8208;driven catalytic properties by support size effect.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;electronegativity cationic high&#8208;entropy doping strategy was proposed to achieve significantly improved properties than that of commercial NCM&#8208;811. Configurational disorder originated from high&#8208;entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer provides higher structure stability to trigger anion redox activity while electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity provides higher anion redox activity.

LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM&#8208;811) exhibits the highest capacity in commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), and the high Ni content (80&#8201;%) provides the only route for high energy density. However, the cationic structure instability arisen from the increase of Ni content (&gt;80&#8201;%) limits the further increase of the capacity, and inevitable O2 release related to anionic structure instability hinders the utilization of anion redox activity. Here, by comparing various combinations of high&#8208;entropy dopants substituted Co element, we propose a low&#8208;electronegativity cationic high&#8208;entropy doping strategy to fabricate the high&#8208;Ni Co&#8208;free layered cathode (LiNi0.8Mn0.12Al0.02Ti0.02Cr0.02Fe0.02O2) that exhibits much higher capacity and cycling stability. Configurational disorder originated from cationic high&#8208;entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer, anchors the oxidized lattice oxygen ((O2)n&#8722;) to preserve high (O2)n&#8722; content, triggering the anion redox activity. Electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity than that of Co element, increases the electron density of O in TM&#8208;O octahedron (TM&#8208;O6) configuration to reach higher (O2)n&#8722; content, resulting in the higher anion redox activity. With exploring the stabilization effect on both cations and anions of high&#8208;entropy doping and low&#8208;electronegativity cationic modified anion redox activity, we propose an innovative and variable pathway for rationally tuning the properties of commercial cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;The low-electronegativity cationic high-entropy doping strategy was proposed to achieve significantly improved properties than that of commercial NCM-811. Configurational disorder originated from high-entropy doping in transition metal (TM) layer provides higher structure stability to trigger anion redox activity while electron transfer induced by applying TM dopants with lower electronegativity provides higher anion redox activity.

         <title>Intrinsic Solubilization of Lithium Nitrate in Ester Electrolyte by Multivalent Low&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Penalty Design for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility in ester electrolytes and proposed a new multivalent low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design to achieve intrinsic LiNO3 solubilization. Linear esters with higher multivalency leads to more stable solvation structures and a monotonic increase in LiNO3 solubility of up to 0.8&#8197;M. Our findings offer new fundamental insights into the LiNO3 solvation chemistry.







Abstract
LiNO3 is a remarkable additive that can dramatically enhance the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at lithium metal anodes. However, it has long been constrained by its incompatibility with commercially used ester electrolytes. Herein, we correlated the fundamental role of entropy with the limited LiNO3 solubility and proposed a new low&#8208;entropy&#8208;penalty design that achieves high intrinsic LiNO3 solubility in ester solvents by employing multivalent linear esters. This strategy is conceptually different from the conventional enthalpic methods that relies on extrinsic high&#8208;polarity carriers. In this way, LiNO3 can directly interact with the primary ester solvents and fundamentally alters the electrolyte properties, resulting in substantial improvements in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with high Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. This work illustrates the significance of regulating the solvation entropy for high&#8208;performance electrolyte design.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range Aluminum&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte formed via diluting ionic liquid electrolytes with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent is proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. It presents better fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, as well as a faster kinetics, enabling a long&#8208;life&#8208;span Al&#8722;S batteries under &#8722;20&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8722;sulfur (Al&#8722;S) batteries are promising energy storage devices due to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the high viscosity and inferior ion transport of conventionally used ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) limit the kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries, especially at sub&#8208;zero temperatures. Herein, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILE) formed via diluting the ILEs with non&#8208;solvating 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene (dFBn) co&#8208;solvent are proposed for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range Al&#8722;S batteries. The addition of dFBn effectively promotes the fluidity and ionic conductivity without affecting the AlCl4&#8722;/Al2Cl7&#8722; equilibrium, which preserves the reversible stripping/plating of aluminum and further promotes the overall kinetics of Al&#8722;S batteries. As a result, Al&#8722;S cells employing the LCILE exhibit higher specific capacity, better cyclability, and lower polarization with respect to the neat ILE in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 40&#8201;&#176;C. For instance, Al&#8722;S batteries employing the LCILE sustain a remarkable capacity of 507&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 20&#8201;&#176;C, while only 229&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 is delivered with the dFBn&#8208;free electrolyte under the same condition. This work demonstrates the favorable use of LCILEs for wide&#8208;temperature Al&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Coupling Ferricyanide/Ferrocyanide Redox Mediated Recycling Spent LiFePO4 with Hydrogen Production</title>

Water electrolysis coupling spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide redox reaction realizes energy&#8208;efficient hydrogen production at low electricity costs, while realizing spent LFP materials to value&#8208;added LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4 for cost&#8208;effective and environment&#8208;friendly recycling of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LFP batteries.







Abstract
Replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable alternative oxidation reactions offers a promising alternative to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production. However, questions remain regarding the economic viability of alternative oxidation reactions for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Here, we propose an innovative cost&#8208;effective, environment&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;efficient strategy for simultaneous recycling of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries and hydrogen production by coupling the spent LFP&#8208;assisted ferricyanide/ferrocyanide ([Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722;) redox reaction. The onset potential for the electrooxidation of [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; is low at 0.87&#8197;V. Operando Raman and UV/Visible spectroscopy confirm that the presence of LFP in the electrolyte allows for the rapid reduction of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; to [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;, thereby completing the [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/[Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; redox cycle as well as facilitating the conversion of spent LiFePO4 into LiOH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O and FePO4. The electrolyzer consumes 3.6&#8197;kWh of electricity per cubic meter of H2 produced at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 43&#8201;% less than conventional water electrolysis. Additionally, this recycling pathway for spent LFP batteries not only minimizes chemical consumption and prevents secondary pollution but also presents significant economic benefits.

         <title>Tracking the Impact of Koch&#8208;Carbonylated Organics During the Zeolite ZSM&#8208;5 Catalyzed Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrocarbons Process</title>

The complementary research strategy (involving catalysis, operando UV/Vis, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy) bridges the mechanistic gap between Koch&#8208;type carbonylation&#8208;led direct and dual cycle mechanisms during the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons process.







Abstract
A methanol&#8208;based economy offers an efficient solution to current energy transition challenges, where the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons (MTH) process would be a key enabler in yielding synthetic fuels/chemicals from renewable sources. Despite its original discovery over half a century ago over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, the practical application of this process in a CO2&#8208;neutral scenario has faced several obstacles. One prominent challenge has been the intricate mechanistic complexities inherent in the MTH process over the zeolite ZSM&#8208;5, impeding its widespread adoption. This work takes a significant step forward by providing critical insights that bridge the gap in our understanding of the MTH process. It accomplishes this by connecting the (Koch&#8208;carbonylation&#8208;led) direct and dual cycle mechanisms, which operate during the early and steady&#8208;state phases of MTH catalysis, respectively. To unravel these mechanistic intricacies, we have performed catalytic and operando (i.e., UV/Vis coupled with an online mass spectrometer) and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic&#8208;based investigations on the MTH process, involving co&#8208;feeding methanol and acetone (cf. a key Koch&#8208;carbonylated species), including selective isotope&#8208;labeling studies. Our iterative research approach revealed that (Koch&#8722;)carbonyl group selectively promotes the side&#8208;chain mechanism within the arene cycle of the dual cycle mechanism, impacting the preferential formation of BTX fraction (i.e., benzene&#8208;toluene&#8208;xylene) primarily.

         <title>Pyridinium&#8208;Derived Mesoionic N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefins (py&#8208;mNHOs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of mesoionic, six&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins derived from 3&#8208;methylpyridinium ions (py&#8208;mNHOs) is reported. Py&#8208;mNHOs are among the most reactive neutral nucleophiles on the Mayr scale. Additionally, they are 1,3&#8208;dipoles that undergo dearomative (3+2)&#8208;cycloadditions with dipolarophiles. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations were used to analyze the gradual transition from stepwise adduct formation to concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions.







Abstract
Mesoionic polarization allows access to electron&#8208;rich olefins that have found application as organocatalysts, ligands, or nucleophiles. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of 3&#8208;methylpyridinium&#8208;derived mesoionic olefins (py&#8208;mNHOs). We used a DFT&#8208;supported design concept, which showed that the introduction of aryl groups in the 1&#8208;, 2&#8208;, 4&#8208;, and 6&#8208;positions of the heterocyclic core allowed the kinetic stabilization of the novel mesoionic compounds. Tolman electronic parameters indicate that py&#8208;mNHOs are remarkably strong &#963;&#8208;donor ligands toward transition metals and main group Lewis acids. Additionally, they are among the strongest nucleophiles on the Mayr reactivity scale. In reactions of py&#8208;mNHOs with electron&#8208;poor &#960;&#8208;systems, a gradual transition from the formation of zwitterionic adducts via stepwise to concerted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions was observed experimentally and analyzed by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>A Stable Extra&#8208;Large Pore and High&#8208;Silica Zeolite Derived from Ge&#8208;Rich Precursor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;silica &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with a multidimensional 28&#8208;MR extra&#8208;large pore channel, has been hydrothermally synthesized from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor, assisted by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). Possessing not only superior crystallinity and hydrothermal stability, but also &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS is the high&#8208;silica zeolite containing the largest pore opening to date.







Abstract
A multidimensional extra&#8208;large pore zeolite with highly hydrothermal stability, denoted as &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, has been developed successfully, starting from Ge&#8208;rich germanosilicate precursor hydrothermally directed by a small and commercially available piperidinium&#8208;type organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS, with the supermicropores, is structurally analogues to 28&#8208;membered ring &#8722;IRT topology as confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. And it is the high&#8208;silica (Si/Ge=58) zeolite with the largest pore size as well. Notably, using acid&#8208;washed as&#8208;made Ge&#8208;rich &#8722;IRT precursor as the silicon source is crucial to restore partially collapsed structure into a stable framework by OSDA&#8208;assisted recrystallization. The calcined &#8722;IRT&#8722;HS maintains a high crystallinity, even when stored in a humid environment for extended periods or directly exposed to water. Additionally, high silica Al&#8208;containing analogue is also readily synthesized, serving as an active solid&#8208;acid catalyst in 1,3,5&#8208;triisopropylbenzene cracking reaction, yielding an impressive initial conversion up to 76.1&#8201;% much higher than conventional large&#8208;pore Beta zeolite (30.4&#8201;%). This work will pave the way for the designed synthesis of targeted high&#8208;silica zeolites with stable and extra&#8208;large pore frameworks, mimicking the structures of existing Ge&#8208;rich counterparts.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted Rapid Synthesis of MOF&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Ni Catalyst for CO2 Electroreduction at Ampere&#8208;Level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts within 3&#8197;min. Specifically, the optimized single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon materials (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) based on a metal&#8211;organic framework precursor showcases a tremendous CO partial current density of 1.06&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96&#8201;% in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted tremendous interest in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the common electric heating techniques to produce carbon&#8208;based SACs usually suffer from prolonged heating time and tedious operations. Herein, a general and facile microwave&#8208;assisted rapid pyrolysis method is developed to afford carbon&#8208;based SACs within 3&#8197;min without inert gas protection. The obtained carbon&#8208;based SACs present high porosity and comparable carbonization degree to those obtained by electric heating techniques. Specifically, the single&#8208;atom Ni implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C) derived from a Ni&#8208;doped metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) exhibits remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (96&#8201;%) with a substantial CO partial current density (jCO) up to 1.06&#8197;A/cm2 in CO2 electroreduction, far superior to the counterpart obtained by traditional pyrolysis with electric heating. Mechanism investigations reveal that the resulting Ni1&#8722;N&#8722;C presents abundant defective sites and mesoporous structure, greatly facilitating CO2 adsorption and mass transfer. This work establishes a versatile approach to rapid and large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs as well as other carbon&#8208;based materials for efficient catalysis.

         <title>The Influence of Donor/Acceptor Interfaces on Organic Solar Cells Efficiency and Stability Revealed through Theoretical Calculations and Morphology Characterizations</title>

The donor/acceptor interface structures and features show an obvious influence on blending phase&#8208;separation morphology and charge transport behavior. It is not reasonable to simply judge the quality of fluorinated and chlorinated acceptors without suitable selection of donors, and regulating donor/acceptor interfaces can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel acceptors.







Abstract
End&#8208;groups halogenation strategies, generally refers to fluorination and chlorination, have been confirmed as simple and efficient methods to regulate the photoelectric performance of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), but a controversy over which one is better has existed for a long time. Here, two novel NFAs, C9N3&#8208;4F and C9N3&#8208;4Cl, featured with different end&#8208;groups were successfully synthesized and blended with two renowned donors, D18 and PM6, featured with different electron&#8208;withdrawing units. Detailed theoretical calculations and morphology characterizations of the interface structures indicate NFAs based on different end&#8208;groups possess different binding energy and miscibility with donors, which shows an obvious influence on phase&#8208;separation morphology, charge transport behavior and device performance. After verified by other three pairs of reported NFAs, a universal conclusion obtained as the devices based on D18 with fluorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs and PM6 with chlorination&#8208;end&#8208;groups&#8208;based NFAs generally show excellent efficiencies, high fill factors and stability. Finally, the devices based on D18: C9N3&#8208;4F and PM6: C9N3&#8208;4Cl yield outstanding efficiency of 18.53&#8201;% and 18.00&#8201;%, respectively. Suitably selecting donor and regulating donor/acceptor interface can accurately present the photoelectric conversion ability of a novel NFAs, which points out the way for further molecular design and selection for high&#8208;performance and stable organic solar cells.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Bioorthogonal Tumor&#8208;Membrane Reactor for In Situ Selective and Sustained Prodrug Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor cell membrane reactors are constructed in vivo for the precise location control of prodrug activation, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency. Here, tumor&#8208;targeting liposomes install the bioorthogonal trigger on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that activates an externally delivered prodrug in situ.







Abstract
The site&#8208;specific activation of bioorthogonal prodrugs has provided great opportunities for reducing the severe side effects of chemotherapy. However, the precise control of activation location, sustained drug production at the target site, and high bioorthogonal reaction efficiency in vivo remain great challenges. Here, we propose the construction of tumor cell membrane reactors in vivo to solve the above problems. Specifically, tumor&#8208;targeted liposomes with efficient membrane fusion capabilities are generated to install the bioorthogonal trigger, the amphiphilic tetrazine derivative, on the surface of tumor cells. These predecorated tumor cells act as many living reactors, transforming the tumor into a &#8220;drug factory&#8221; that in situ activates an externally delivered bioorthogonal prodrug, for example intratumorally injected transcyclooctene&#8208;caged doxorubicin. In contrast to the rapid elimination of cargo that is encapsulated and delivered by liposomes, these reactors permit stable retention of bioorthogonal triggers in tumor for 96&#8197;h after a single dose of liposomes via intravenous injection, allowing sustained generation of doxorubicin. Interestingly, an additional supplement of liposomes will compensate for the trigger consumed by the reaction and significantly improve the efficiency of the local reaction. This strategy provides a solution to the efficacy versus safety dilemma of tumor chemotherapy.

         <title>Ultrastable, Superrobust, and Recyclable Supramolecular Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to strengthen and stabilize the supramolecular polymer network is reported. The superb multivalence cooperation makes the hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect, resulting in a superroubst and recyclable supramolecular polymer network with remarkably high resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and H&#8208;bond&#8208;destructive solvents.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs), crosslinked by noncovalent bonds, have emerged as reorganizable and recyclable polymeric materials with unique functionality. However, poor stability is an imperative challenge faced by SPNs, because SPNs are susceptible to heat, water, and/or solvents due to the dynamic and reversible nature of noncovalent bonds. Herein, the design of a noncovalent cooperative network (NCoN) to simultaneously stabilize and reinforce SPNs is reported, resulting in an ultrastable, superrobust, and recyclable SPN. The NCoN is constructed by multiplying the H&#8208;bonding sites and tuning the conformation/geometry of the H&#8208;bonding segment to optimize the multivalence cooperativity of H&#8208;bonds. The rationally designed H&#8208;bonding segment with high conformational compliance favors the formation of tightly packed H&#8208;bond arrays comprising higher&#8208;density and stronger H&#8208;bonds. Consequently, the H&#8208;bonded crosslinks in the NCoN display a covalent crosslinking effect but retain on&#8208;demand dynamics and reversibility. The resultant ultrastable SPN not only displays remarkable resistance to heat up to 120&#8201;&#176;C, water soaking, and a broad spectrum of solvents, but also possesses a superhigh true stress at break (1.1&#8197;GPa) and an ultrahigh toughness (406&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3). Despite the covalent&#8208;network&#8208;like stability, the SPN is recyclable through activating its reversibility in a high&#8208;polarity solvent heated to a threshold temperature.

         <title>Synergistic Glutathione Depletion and STING Activation to Potentiate Dendritic Cell Maturation and Cancer Vaccine Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>

Manganese&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide nanoparticles enhanced dendritic cell maturation via intracellular glutathione depletion and subsequent STING pathway activation. Effective antigen delivery and presentation mediated by the nanoparticles significantly triggered antitumor immune response and inhibited tumor growth in both therapeutic and prophylactic settings.







Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen presentation are key factors for successful vaccine&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. This study developed manganese&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (Mn&#8208;LDH) nanoparticles as a self&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine carrier that not only promoted DC maturation through synergistically depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) and activating STING signaling pathway, but also facilitated the delivery of model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) into lymph nodes and subsequent antigen presentation in DCs. Significant therapeutic&#8208;prophylactic efficacy of the OVA&#8208;loaded Mn&#8208;LDH (OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH) nanovaccine was determined by the tumor growth inhibition in the mice bearing B16&#8208;OVA tumor. Our results showed that the OVA/Mn&#8208;LDH nanoparticles could be a potent delivery system for cancer vaccine development without the need of adjuvant. Therefore, the combination of GSH exhaustion and STING pathway activation might be an advisable approach for promoting DC maturation and antigen presentation, finally improving cancer vaccine efficacy.

         <title>Activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 Signaling and Inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; Checkpoint with a Dual siRNA&#8208;Assembled Nanoadjuvant for Robust Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an RNA nanoadjuvant loaded with densely packed siRNA and covered with cationic liposomes. With high&#8208;order RNA structure, it works like an RNA virus to robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling to drive the maturation of APCs. Moreover, dual gene silencing of CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs leads to efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint, thereby enhancing the phagocytosis of tumor cells by APCs for cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the anti&#8208;tumor immunity as they are responsible for capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells. However, their activation is often limited by the absence of adjuvants and the suppressive effects of immune checkpoints, such as CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945;. Herein, we present a nanoadjuvant that is self&#8208;assembled from long RNA building blocks generated through rolling circle transcription (RCT) reaction and further modified with cationic liposomes. Owing to the high load of densely packed RNA, this nanoadjuvant could robustly activate RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling in APCs, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti&#8208;tumor M1&#8208;like phenotype. In addition, with a well&#8208;designed template, the generated long RNA from RCT reaction includes two kinds of siRNA targeting both CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs. This dual gene silencing results in efficient inhibition of the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint. Collectively, the robust activation of RIG&#8208;I/MDA5 signaling and efficient inhibition of CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; checkpoint enhance the phagocytic activity of APCs, which in turn promotes the cross&#8208;priming of effector T cells and the activation of anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. This study therefore provides a simple and robust RNA nanoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;We present an RNA nanoadjuvant loaded with densely packed siRNA and covered with cationic liposomes. With high-order RNA structure, it works like an RNA virus to robustly activate RIG-I/MDA5 signaling to drive the maturation of APCs. Moreover, dual gene silencing of CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs leads to efficient inhibition of the CD47-SIRP&#945; checkpoint, thereby enhancing the phagocytosis of tumor cells by APCs for cancer immunotherapy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) play a crucial role in the anti-tumor immunity as they are responsible for capturing, processing, and presenting tumor antigens to T cells. However, their activation is often limited by the absence of adjuvants and the suppressive effects of immune checkpoints, such as CD47-SIRP&#945;. Herein, we present a nanoadjuvant that is self-assembled from long RNA building blocks generated through rolling circle transcription (RCT) reaction and further modified with cationic liposomes. Owing to the high load of densely packed RNA, this nanoadjuvant could robustly activate RIG-I/MDA5 signaling in APCs, leading to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti-tumor M1-like phenotype. In addition, with a well-designed template, the generated long RNA from RCT reaction includes two kinds of siRNA targeting both CD47 in tumor cells and SIRP&#945; in APCs. This dual gene silencing results in efficient inhibition of the CD47-SIRP&#945; checkpoint. Collectively, the robust activation of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling and efficient inhibition of CD47-SIRP&#945; checkpoint enhance the phagocytic activity of APCs, which in turn promotes the cross-priming of effector T cells and the activation of anti-tumor immune responses. This study therefore provides a simple and robust RNA nanoadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localized Oxidation Embellishing Strategy Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy is introduced by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on SnO2 electron transport layer in n&#8208;i&#8208;p structured perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). The LOE strategy induces plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 on the SnO2 surface, reducing surface oxygen vacancies and realizing benign energy alignment. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 based pero&#8208;SC treated by the LOE strategy achieves power conversion efficiency of 25.72&#8201;%.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) has attracted extensive studies as a promising photovoltaic technology, wherein the electron extraction and transfer exhibit pivotal effect to the device performance. The planar SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) has contributed the recent record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the pero&#8208;SCs, yet still suffers from surface defects of SnO2 nanoparticles which brings energy loss and phase instability. Herein, we report a localized oxidation embellishing (LOE) strategy by applying (NH4)2CrO4 on the SnO2 ETL. The LOE strategy builds up plentiful nano&#8208;heterojunctions of p&#8208;Cr2O3/n&#8208;SnO2 and the nano&#8208;heterojunctions compensate the surface defects and realize benign energy alignment, which reduces surface non&#8208;radiative recombination and voltage loss of the pero&#8208;SCs. Meanwhile, the decrease of lattice mismatch released the lattice distortion and eliminated tensile stress, contributing to better stability of the devices. The pero&#8208;SCs based on &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with the SnO2 ETL treated by the LOE strategy realized a PCE of 25.72&#8201;% (certified as 25.41&#8201;%), along with eminent stability performance of T90&gt;700&#8197;h. This work provides a brand&#8208;new view for defect modification of SnO2 electron transport layer.

Anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals synthesized by one&#8208;step mechanochemical method for high&#8208;efficiency photo&#8208;thermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Halogen anion counterions serve as the efficient electron source of donors with skeleton atoms unchanged and bring great convenience to the rational design &amp; synthesis of functional cocrystals.







Abstract
An anion&#8208;counterion strategy is proposed to construct organic mono&#8208;radical charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals for near&#8208;infrared photothermal conversion and solar&#8208;driven water evaporation. Ionic compounds with halogen anions as the counterions serve as electron donors, providing the necessary electrons for efficient charge transfer with unchanged skeleton atoms and structures as well as the broad red&#8208;shifted absorption (200&#8211;2000&#8197;nm) and unprecedented photothermal conversion efficiency (~90.5&#8201;%@808&#8197;nm) for the cocrystals. Based on these cocrystals, an excellent solar&#8208;driven interfacial water evaporation rate up to 6.1&#177;1.1&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;sun is recorded due to the comprehensive evaporation effect from the cocrystal loading in polyurethane foams and chimney addition, such performance is superior to the reported results on charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals or other materials for solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation. This prototype exhibits the great potential of cocrystals prepared by the one&#8208;step mechanochemistry method in practical large&#8208;scale seawater desalination applications.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Templated Fabrication of Ultrathin Electroactive Gold Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale (width of ~20&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin (0.49&#8197;nm) amorphous Au nanosheets are synthesized at room temperature in an aqueous solution using DNA nanosheets with extended single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a larger spacing (16.7&#8197;nm) for the first time. The extended ssDNA induces metallization and enables further precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions.







Abstract
Generally, two&#8208;dimensional gold nanomaterials have unique properties and functions that offer exciting application prospects. However, the crystal phases of these materials tend to be limited to the thermodynamically stable crystal structure. Herein, we report a DNA framework&#8208;templated approach for the ambient aqueous synthesis of freestanding and microscale amorphous gold nanosheets with ultrathin sub&#8208;nanometer thickness. We observe that extended single&#8208;stranded DNA on DNA nanosheets can induce site&#8208;specific metallization and enable precise modification of the metalized nanostructures at predefined positions. More importantly, the as&#8208;prepared gold nanosheets can serve as an electrocatalyst for glucose oxidase&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidation, exhibiting enhanced electrocatalytic activity (~3&#8208;fold) relative to discrete gold nanoclusters owing to a larger electrochemical active area and wider band gap. The proposed DNA framework&#8208;templated metallization strategy is expected to be applicable in a broad range of fields, from catalysis to new energy materials.

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Tethered Binaphthyl&#8208;Embedded One&#8208;Handed Helical Ladder Polymers: Impact of the Tether Length on Helical Geometry and Chiroptical Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defect&#8208;free 2,2&#8242;&#8208;tethered binaphthyl&#8208;embedded one&#8208;handed helical ladder polymers with different tether lengths was synthesized by the modified alkyne benzannulations using the 4&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2,6&#8208;dimethylphenylethynyl group as the alkyne source. The helical geometries can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling the binaphthyl dihedral angle with variations in the alkylenedioxy tethering groups, leading to a strong circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction to Formate or CO with High Selectivity over a Covalent Organic Framework Covalently Anchored on Graphene Oxide</title>

The photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO2 to HCOO&#8722; or CO can be significantly enhanced by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been widely studied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, pristine COFs usually exhibit low catalytic efficiency owing to the fast recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. In this study, we fabricated a stable COF&#8208;based composite (GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co) by covalently anchoring COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Interestingly, in absolute acetonitrile (CH3CN), GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co shows a high selectivity of 94.4&#8201;% for the photoreduction of CO2 to formate, with a formate yield of 15.8&#8197;mmol/g, which is approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. By contrast, in CH3CN/H2O (v&#8201;:&#8201;v=4&#8201;:&#8201;1), the main product for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction over GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co is CO (96.1&#8201;%), with a CO yield as high as 52.2&#8197;mmol/g, which is also approximately four times higher than that using the pristine COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co. Photoelectrochemical experiments demonstrate the covalent bonding of COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co and GO to form the GO&#8208;COF&#8208;366&#8208;Co composite facilitates charge separation and transfer significantly, thereby accounting for the enhanced catalytic activity. In addition, theoretical calculations and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveal H2O can stabilize the *COOH intermediate to further form a *CO intermediate via O&#8722;H(aq)&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O(*COOH) hydrogen bonding, thus explaining the regulated photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Improving Rate Performance of Encapsulating Lithium&#8208;Polysulfide Electrolytes for Practical Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexyl methyl ether (HME) is proposed as a co&#8208;solvent to formulate encapsulating lithium&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE). The sacrifice in specific capacity of S cathodes at a high rate in common EPSEs is circumvented in HME&#8208;EPSE while mitigating parasitic reactions of lithium polysulfides with lithium metal anodes. Both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a lithium&#8722;sulfur pouch cell.







Abstract
The cycle life of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is severely plagued by the incessant parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and reactive Li polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating Li&#8208;polysulfide electrolyte (EPSE) emerges as an effective electrolyte design to mitigate the parasitic reactions kinetically. Nevertheless, the rate performance of Li&#8722;S batteries with EPSE is synchronously suppressed. Herein, the sacrifice in rate performance by EPSE is circumvented while mitigating parasitic reactions by employing hexyl methyl ether (HME) as a co&#8208;solvent. The specific capacity of Li&#8722;S batteries with HME&#8208;based EPSE is nearly not decreased at 0.1&#8197;C compared with conventional ether electrolytes. With an ultrathin Li metal anode (50&#8197;&#956;m) and a high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#8197;mgS&#8201;cm&#8722;2), a longer cycle life of 113&#8197;cycles was achieved in HME&#8208;based EPSE compared with that of 65&#8197;cycles in conventional ether electrolytes at 0.1&#8197;C. Furthermore, both high energy density of 387&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycle life of 27&#8197;cycles were achieved in a Li&#8722;S pouch cell (2.7&#8197;Ah). This work inspires the feasibility of regulating the solvation structure of LiPSs in EPSE for Li&#8722;S batteries with balanced performance.

         <title>A Giant Heterometallic Polyoxometalate Nanocluster for Enhanced Brain&#8208;Targeted Glioma Therapy</title>

A gigantic transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated polyoxometalate cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers was obtained and used for enhanced brain&#8208;targeted glioma therapy for the first time.







Abstract
Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with precise atom structures, flexibly adjustable and abundant active sites are promising for constructing functional nanodrugs. However, current POM drugs are almost vacant in orthotopic brain tumor therapy due to the inability to effectively penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and low drug activity. Here, we designed the largest (3.0&#8197;nm &#215; 6.0&#8197;nm) transition&#8208;metal&#8211;lanthanide co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster {[Ce10Ag6(DMEA)(H2O)27W22O70][B&#8208;&#945;&#8208;TeW9O33]9}288&#8722; featuring 238 metal centers via synergistic coordination between two geometry&#8208;unrestricted Ce3+ and Ag+ linkers with tungsten&#8208;oxo cluster fragments. This POM was combined with brain&#8208;targeted peptide to prepare a brain&#8208;targeted nanodrug that could efficiently traverse BBB and target glioma cells. The Ag+ active centers in the nanodrug specifically activate reactive oxygen species to regulate the apoptosis pathway of glioma cells with a low half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (5.66&#8197;&#956;M). As the first brain&#8208;targeted POM drug, it efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Sulfur&#8208;Containing Cyclophanes by Chiral Sulfide Catalyzed Electrophilic Sulfenylation of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have successfully developed an efficient method for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes through the catalytic asymmetric electrophilic sulfenylation reaction for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) revealed the origin of enantioselectivity in this sulfenylation reaction.







Abstract
An efficient catalytic asymmetric electrophilic sulfenylation reaction for the synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes has been developed for the first time. This was achieved by using a new Lewis base catalyst and a new ortho&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted sulfenylating reagent. Using the substrates with low rotational energy barrier, the transformation proceeded through a dynamic kinetic resolution, and the high rotational energy barrier of the substrates allowed the reaction to undergo a kinetic resolution process. Meanwhile, this transformation was compatible with a desymmetrization process when the symmetric substrates were used. Various planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing cyclophanes were readily obtained in moderate to excellent yields with moderate to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% ee). This approach was used to synthesize pharmaceutically relevant planar&#8208;chiral sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Density functional theory calculations showed that &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between the sulfenyl group and the aromatic ring in the substrate play a crucial role in enantioinduction in this sulfenylation reaction.

The ancient art of arranging diatoms (very small algae) under the microscope with a single hair is connected on the Cover picture with the research reported in this Communication (e202318210). The diatoms make up the formula of the disbiradical reported in the study and its characteristic three&#8208;line EPR signal. The milky way in the background represents the through&#8208;space interaction delivering the explanation for the peculiar EPR signal pattern. (Design and idea: Jan Rosenboom).

The butterfly metamorphosis Within the cocoon's shell (aryl methyl ethers) is encased a secret beauty (phenols), how to liberate it? In their Review (e202317257), Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes, and Bert&#8197;F. Sels et&#8197;al. comprehensively summarize the advancements and perspectives of lignin O&#8208;demethylation (metamorphosis). The presence of methoxy groups (cocoon) limits the chemical reactivity and the applicability of lignin&#8208;derived compounds. Through O&#8208;demethylation (metamorphosis), the reborn product (butterfly) rich in phenolic functionality can start a versatile new life with broader applications.

Giant heterometallic polyoxometalate (POM) clusters own flexibly adjustable active sites and are promising functional drug carriers. In their Research Article (e202319700), Jiefei Wang, Bingyang Shi, Junwei Zhao et&#8197;al. designed the largest (3.0 nm &#215; 6.0 nm) Ce3+/Ag+ co&#8208;encapsulated POM cluster with blood brain barrier&#8208;traversing and mitochondrial targeting properties to solve the long&#8208;standing brain delivery problem of drugs for glioma. As the first brain&#8208;targeting POM drug, Ag+ specifically activates reactive oxygen species regulated apoptosis pathway of glioma and efficiently prolongs the survival of orthotopic glioma&#8208;bearing mice.

         <dc:description>
The controlled activation of metal prodrugs presents an exciting opportunity for precise and safe cancer chemotherapy. A universal strategy of radiation&#8208;triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer was developed to address the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species, as reported by Fangman Chen, Wen Sun, Dan Shao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202317943). The proposed tool led to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The controlled activation&lt;/b&gt; of metal prodrugs presents an exciting opportunity for precise and safe cancer chemotherapy. A universal strategy of radiation-triggered metal prodrug activation via nanosurface energy transfer was developed to address the limitations of insufficient and easily quenched reactive species, as reported by Fangman Chen, Wen Sun, Dan Shao et&#8197;al. in their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202317943"&gt;(e202317943)&lt;/a&gt;. The proposed tool led to profound outcomes for combined cancer treatment.

         <title>Dual Nature of Thiophene Harnessed in the Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Emitters via Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Murai and Yamaguchi report on near&#8208;infrared emitters derived from the dithieno[2,3&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;f]azepine core. Low band gaps were achieved by fusing antiaromatic azepine with thiophene rings equipped with electron&#8208;accepting moieties, which relieves the antiaromaticity of azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure. This novel approach provides dyes with fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters are of great interest for applications in bioimaging and modern technology. Yet the design of such materials with decent characteristics is challenging due to intrinsic limitations. In a recent article, Murai and Yamaguchi report the synthesis of NIR emitters with appreciable fluorescence quantum yields reaching 0.02 at 878&#8197;nm in CH2Cl2 solution. The low band gaps were achieved by a new design strategy exploiting antiaromaticity relief. This concept was realized for compounds consisting of an antiaromatic azepine central ring fused to thiophene moieties. In these systems, thiophene unfolds its dual nature. On the one hand, it contributes to the high antiaromaticity of azepine; on the other hand, it exerts a stabilizing effect on azepine through the formation of a quinoid structure, which reduces its antiaromaticity and shifts the absorption and emission maxima into the NIR region.

         <title>Leveraging Expertise in Thermal Catalysis to Understand Plasma Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Scientific Perspective outlines best practice in the design of plasma catalysis experiments. A water pumping model depicts the limitations of an exergonic reaction that surpasses thermodynamic equilibrium, where the pump represents the plasma. The leak back causes energy dissipation, depending on the water level in the upper reservoir (representing conversion) and the size of the leak (representing plasma activation of the product).







Abstract
Best practices in testing heterogeneous catalysts are translated to plasma&#8208;catalytic experiments. Independent determination of plasma&#8208;catalytic and plasma&#8208;chemical contributions is essential. Non&#8208;porous catalyst particles are preferred because active sites inside sub&#8208;micron pores cannot contribute. Temperature variation is needed to determine kinetics, despite the complexity of thermal effects in plasma. Rigorous checks on catalyst deactivation and mass balance are needed. Plasma enhanced reversed reactions should be minimized by keeping conversion low and far from thermodynamic equilibrium, preventing underestimation of the rate of forward reaction. In contrast, plasma&#8208;catalytic studies often aim at conversions surpassing thermodynamic equilibrium, not obtaining any information on kinetics. Calculation of catalyst activity per active sites (turn&#8208;over&#8208;frequency) requires also appropriate characterization to determine the number of active sites. The relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics for plasma&#8208;catalysis is discussed using endothermic decomposition of CO2 and exothermic synthesis of ammonia from N2 and H2 as examples. Assuming Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood and Eley&#8208;Rideal mechanisms, the effect of excitation of reactant molecules on activation barriers and surface coverages are discussed, influencing reaction rates. The consequences of reversed reactions are considered. Plasma&#8208;catalysis with catalysts applied for thermal catalysis at much higher temperature should be avoided, as adsorbed species are bonded too strongly resulting in low rates.

         <title>Mesoscale Clusters in the Crystallisation of Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a surge in research on mesoscale clusters of organic molecules in light of the limitations of classical nucleation theory. This mini&#8208;review offers a fresh perspective on calling upon nanoscale characterisation techniques to evaluate the interdependence of solution properties and sample treatment on cluster properties to go alongside their role in nucleation, all based on literature&#8208;based experimental evidence.







Abstract
The early stages of the molecular self&#8208;assembly pathway leading to crystal nucleation have a significant influence on the properties and purity of organic materials. This mini review collates the work on organic mesoscale clusters and discusses their importance in nucleation processes, with a particular focus on their critical properties and susceptibility to sample treatment parameters. This is accomplished by a review of detection methods, including dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Considering the challenges associated with crystallisation of flexible and large&#8208;molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients, the dynamic nature of mesoscale clusters has the potential to expand the discovery of novel crystal forms. By collating literature on mesoscale clusters for organic molecules, a more comprehensive understanding of their role in nucleation will evolve and can guide further research efforts.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation: Substrate Specificity and Mechanistic Variability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates is summarized in this review article from the perspective of substrate specificity and mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation finds widespread application in academia and industry. And indeed, a number of processes have been implemented for the production of pharma and agro intermediates as well as flavors &amp; fragrances. Although these processes are all based on the use of late transition metals as catalysts, there is an increasing interest in the use of base metal catalysis in view of their lower cost and the expected different substrate scope. Catalysts based on cobalt have already shown their potential in enantioselective hydrogenation chemistry. This review outlines the impressive progress made in recent years on cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of different unsaturated substrates. We also illustrate the ligand dependent substrate specificity as well as the mechanistic variability in detail. This may well guide further catalyst development in this research area.

The characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework of manganese dioxides endows this family of materials with rich physiochemical properties and wide applications in sustainable energy storage. This review timely covers recent advancements related to such materials, with a focus on the atomistic insights into their structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships that are critical to further advance these applications.







Abstract
Tunnel&#8208;structured manganese dioxides (MnO2), also known as octahedral molecule sieves (OMS), are widely studied in geochemistry, deionization, energy storage and (electro)catalysis. These functionalities originate from their characteristic sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel framework, which, with a high degree of structural polymorphism and rich surface chemistry, can reversibly absorb and transport various ions. An intensive understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationship is prerequisite for functionality optimization, which has been recently approached by implementation of advanced (in situ) characterizations providing significant atomistic sciences. This review will thus timely cover recent advancements related to OMS and their energy storage applications, with a focus on the atomistic insights pioneered by researchers including our group: the origins of structural polymorphism and heterogeneity, the evolution of faceted OMS crystals and its effect on electrocatalysis, the ion transport/storage properties and their implication for processing OMS. These studies represent a clear rational behind recent endeavors investigating the historically applied OMS materials, the summary of which is expected to deepen the scientific understandings and guide material engineering for functionality control.

         <title>Luminescent and Photoredox&#8208;Active Molybdenum(0) Complexes Competitive with Isoelectronic Ruthenium(II) Polypyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments concerning the photophysics and the photochemistry of molybdenum(0) complexes are reviewed. Molybdenum(0) is isoelectronic with ruthenium(II), but considerably more abundant and cheaper. Replacing photoactive ruthenium(II) complexes by molybdenum(0) compounds would be attractive for many different applications.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II) complexes with chelating polypyridine ligands are among the most frequently investigated compounds in photophysics and photochemistry, owing to their favorable luminescence and photoredox properties. Equally good photoluminescence performance and attractive photocatalytic behavior is now achievable with isoelectronic molybdenum(0) complexes. The zero&#8208;valent oxidation state of molybdenum is stabilized by carbonyl or isocyanide ligands, and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states analogous to those in ruthenium(II) complexes can be established. Microsecond MLCT excited&#8208;state lifetimes and photoluminescence quantum yields up to 0.2 have been achieved in solution at room temperature, and the emission wavelength has become tunable over a large range. The molybdenum(0) complexes are stronger photoreductants than ruthenium(II) polypyridines and can therefore perform more challenging chemical reductions. The triplet nature of their luminescent MLCT states allows sensitization of photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation, to convert low&#8208;energy input radiation into higher&#8208;energy output fluorescence. This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning luminescent molybdenum(0) complexes and highlights their application potential. Molybdenum is roughly 140&#8197;times more abundant and far cheaper than ruthenium, hence this research is relevant in the greater context of finding more sustainable alternatives to using precious and rare transition metals in photophysics and photochemistry.

         <title>Advancements and Perspectives toward Lignin Valorization via O&#8208;Demethylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
O&#8208;Demethylation (ODM) is a strategic tool to unlock lignin applications for drop&#8208;in and new commodity, fine &amp; specialty chemicals.







Abstract
Lignin represents the largest aromatic carbon resource in plants, holding significant promise as a renewable feedstock for bioaromatics and other cyclic hydrocarbons in the context of the circular bioeconomy. However, the methoxy groups of aryl methyl ethers, abundantly found in technical lignins and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals, limit their pertinent chemical reactivity and broader applicability. Unlocking the phenolic hydroxyl functionality through O&#8208;demethylation (ODM) has emerged as a valuable approach to mitigate this need and enables further applications. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the progress in the valorization of technical lignin and lignin&#8208;derived chemicals via ODM, both catalytic and non&#8208;catalytic reactions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the properties and potential applications of the O&#8208;demethylated products is presented, accompanied by a systematic overview of available ODM reactions. This review primarily focuses on enhancing the phenolic hydroxyl content in lignin&#8208;derived species through ODM, showcasing its potential in the catalytic funneling of lignin and value&#8208;added applications. A comprehensive synopsis and future outlook are included in the concluding section of this review.

         <title>Electroluminescent Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroluminescent cluster materials and devices emerged rapidly in recent years. Their external quantum efficiencies reached &#8776;30&#8201;%, on the basis of ligand and device engineering. On account of the unique advantage of combining organic and inorganic components for enhanced luminescence properties and stability, cluster&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes hold promise for next&#8208;generation displays and lightings.







Abstract
Optoelectronic cluster materials emerge rapidly in recent years especially for light&#8208;emitting devices, owing to their 100&#8201;% exciton harvesting and unique organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid structures with tunable excited&#8208;state characteristics for thermally activated delayed fluorescence and/or phosphorescence and inheritable photo&#8208; and thermo&#8208;stability. However, for efficient electroluminescence, excited&#8208;state compositions of cluster emitters should be tuned through ligand engineering to enhance ligand&#8208;centered radiative components and reduce cluster&#8208;centered quenching states. Nonetheless, the balance of optoelectronic properties requires delicate and controllable ligand functionalization. On the other hand, in addition to balancing carrier fluxes, it showed that device engineering, especially host matrixes and interfacial optimization, can not only alleviate triplet quenching, but also modify processing and passivate defects. As consequence, the record external quantum efficiencies of cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes already reached &#8776;30&#8201;%. Herein, we overview recent progress of electroluminescent cluster materials and discuss their structure&#8211;property relationships, which would inspire the continuous efforts making cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes competent as the new generation of displays and lighting sources.

         <title>In Vitro Module Editing Of NRPS Enables Production Of Highly Potent Gq&#8208;Signaling Inhibitor FR900359 Derived From Unculturable Plant Symbiont</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
YM&#8208;254890, YM&#8208;254891 and FR900359 are potent selective G protein inhibitors. FR900359 which is originally discovered from plant&#8208;symbiont bacteria shows the strongest activity. While YM&#8208;254890 and YM&#8208;254891 are culturable bacteria derived, the BGC for them is not reported. Here, we identified the BGC for YM&#8208;254890 by heterologous expression. Furthermore, rational editing of the BGC led to the production of FR900359 in culturable host.







Abstract
Heterotrimeric G proteins are key mediators in the signaling of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCR) that are involved in a plethora of important physiological processes and thus major targets of pharmaceutical drugs. The cyclic depsipeptides YM&#8208;254890 and FR900359 are strong and selective inhibitors of the Gq subfamily of G proteins. FR900359 was first reported to be produced by unculturable plant symbiont, however, a culturable FR900359 producer was discovered recently by the standard strategy, screening of the producing strain from the environment. As another strategy, we introduce herein the different way to supply natural compounds of unculturable microorganism origin. We therefore embarked on constructing an artificial biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for FR900359 with YM&#8208;254890 BGC as a template using &#8220;in vitro module editing&#8221; technology, first developed for the modification of type&#8208;I PKS BGCs, to edit YM&#8208;254890 BGC. The resulting artificial BGCs coding FR900359 were heterologously expressed in the Pseudomonas putida KT2440 host strain.

The cyclic depsipeptides YM-254890 and FR900359 are strong and selective inhibitors of the G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; subfamily of G proteins. FR900359 was first reported to be produced by unculturable plant symbiont, however, a culturable FR900359 producer was discovered recently by the standard strategy, screening of the producing strain from the environment. As another strategy, we introduce herein the different way to supply natural compounds of unculturable microorganism origin. We therefore embarked on constructing an artificial biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for FR900359 with YM-254890 BGC as a template using &#8220;&lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; module editing&#8221; technology, first developed for the modification of type-I PKS BGCs, to edit YM-254890 BGC. The resulting artificial BGCs coding FR900359 were heterologously expressed in the &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt; KT2440 host strain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict the Antibacterial Activity of Ruthenium Complexes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine Learning models were trained on the antibacterial activity of 288 ruthenium&#8208;arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and utilised to predict novel compounds based on a virtual library. 54 new compounds were synthesised and found to possess a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate compared to the training set.







Abstract
Rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and lack of innovation in the antibiotic pipeline necessitate novel approaches to discovering new drugs. Metal complexes have proven to be promising antimicrobial compounds, but the number of studied compounds is still low compared to the millions of organic molecules investigated so far. Lately, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a valuable tool for guiding the design of small organic molecules, potentially even in low&#8208;data scenarios. For the first time, we extend the application of ML to the discovery of metal&#8208;based medicines. Utilising 288 modularly synthesized ruthenium arene Schiff&#8208;base complexes and their antibacterial properties, a series of ML models were trained. The models perform well and are used to predict the activity of 54 new compounds. These displayed a 5.7x higher hit&#8208;rate (53.7&#8201;%) against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) compared to the original library (9.4&#8201;%), demonstrating that ML can be applied to improve the success&#8208;rates in the search of new metalloantibiotics. This work paves the way for more ambitious applications of ML in the field of metal&#8208;based drug discovery.

         <title>Rational Design of a Phosphorus&#8208;Centered Disbiradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradical that exhibits highly dynamic behavior in solution leading to isomerization is presented. Among the various conformers, those that have significantly shorter distances between radical sites and thus can interact weakly through space dominate.







Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;centered disbiradicals, in which the radical sites exist as individual spin doublets with weak spin&#8208;spin interaction have not been known so far. Starting from monoradicals of the type [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8722;R], we have now succeeded in linking two such monoradical phosphorus centers by appropriate choice of a linker. To this end, biradical [&#8901;P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)2P&#8901;] (1) was treated with 1,6&#8208;dibromohexane, affording the brominated species {Br[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (3). Subsequent reduction with KC8 led to the formation of the disbiradical {&#8901;[P(&#956;&#8208;NTer)]2}2C6H12 (4) featuring a large distance between the radical phosphorus sites in the solid state and formally the highest biradical character observed in a P&#8208;centered biradical so far, approaching 100&#8201;%. EPR spectroscopy revealed a three&#8208;line signal in solution with a considerably larger exchange interaction than would be expected from the molecular structure of the single crystal. Quantum chemical calculations revealed a highly dynamic conformational space; thus, the two radical sites can approach each other with a much smaller distance in solution. Further reduction of 4 resulted in the formation of a potassium salt featuring the first structurally characterized P&#8208;centered distonic radical anion (5&#8722;). Moreover, 4 could be used in small molecule activation.

         <title>Local Water Content in Polymer Gels Measured with Super&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous polymer systems play a key role in many applications and technological innovations. The fluorescence lifetime of a dye provides access to the number of water molecules in its vicinity, allowing the local water content of aqueous polymer networks to be studied with super&#8208;resolved fluorescence imaging. This method was applied to thermoresponsive microgels to study the water content in their swollen and collapsed state.







Abstract
Water molecules play an important role in the structure, function, and dynamics of (bio&#8208;)&#8201;materials. A direct access to the number of water molecules in nanoscopic volumes can thus give new molecular insights into materials and allow for fine&#8208;tuning their properties in sophisticated applications. The determination of the local water content has become possible by the finding that H2O quenches the fluorescence of red&#8208;emitting dyes. Since deuterated water, D2O, does not induce significant fluorescence quenching, fluorescence lifetime measurements performed in different H2O/D2O&#8208;ratios yield the local water concentration. We combined this effect with the recently developed fluorescence lifetime single molecule localization microscopy imaging (FL&#8208;SMLM) in order to nanoscopically determine the local water content in microgels, i.e. soft hydrogel particles consisting of a cross&#8208;linked polymer swollen in water. The change in water content of thermo&#8208;responsive microgels when changing from their swollen state at room temperature to a collapsed state at elevated temperature could be analyzed. A clear decrease in water content was found that was, to our surprise, rather uniform throughout the entire microgel volume. Only a slightly higher water content around the dye was found in the periphery with respect to the center of the swollen microgels.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Induced Chirality in ClMBA2SnI4 2D Perovskite
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Sn&#8208;based 2D chiral perovskite ClMBA2SnI4 is reported showing appealing optical properties with a low band gap and a broad emission centered in the red part of the spectrum. Computational modelling describes both the chiral transfer effect on the band structure and the origin of broad emission. Preliminary correlations between the nature of chiral ligand and central atom on the chiroptical response of chiral perovskites are proposed.







Abstract
Chiral perovskites possess a huge applicative potential in several areas of optoelectronics and spintronics. The development of novel lead&#8208;free perovskites with tunable properties is a key topic of current research. Herein, we report a novel lead&#8208;free chiral perovskite, namely (R/S&#8722;)ClMBA2SnI4 (ClMBA=1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanamine) and the corresponding racemic system. ClMBA2SnI4 samples exhibit a low band gap (2.12&#8197;eV) together with broad emission extending in the red region of the spectrum (&#8764;1.7&#8197;eV). Chirality transfer from the organic ligand induces chiroptical activity in the 465&#8211;530&#8197;nm range. Density functional theory calculations show a Rashba type band splitting for the chiral samples and no band splitting for the racemic isomer. Self&#8208;trapped exciton formation is at the origin of the large Stokes shift in the emission. Careful correlation with analogous lead and lead&#8208;free 2D chiral perovskites confirms the role of the symmetry&#8208;breaking distortions in the inorganic layers associated with the ligands as the source of the observed chiroptical properties providing also preliminary structure&#8208;property correlation in 2D chiral perovskites.

         <title>Tuning the Mechanical Properties of 3D&#8208;printed Objects by the RAFT Process: From Chain&#8208;Growth to Step&#8208;Growth</title>

RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of xanthate&#8208;based RAFT agent and vinyl acetate&#8208;based monomer was developed and applied in photoinduced 3D printing, presenting a facile way to tune the mechanical properties of the printed objects.







Abstract
Photoinduced 3D printing based on the reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process has emerged as a robust method for creating diverse functional materials. However, achieving precise control over the mechanical properties of these printed objects remains a critical challenge for practical application. Here, we demonstrated a RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization of a bifunctional xanthate and bifunctional vinyl acetate. Additionally, we demonstrated photoinduced 3D printing through RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization with a tetrafunctional xanthate and a bifunctional vinyl acetate. By adjusting the molar ratio of the components in the printing resins, we finely tuned the polymerization mechanism from step&#8208;growth to chain&#8208;growth. This adjustment resulted in a remarkable range of tunable Young's moduli, ranging from 7.6&#8197;MPa to 997.1&#8197;MPa. Moreover, post&#8208;functionalization and polymer welding of the printed objects with varying mechanical properties opens up a promising way to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with specific and tunable properties.

         <title>Facile Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Assisted Crystallization Modulation for Large&#8208;area High&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br Films and Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile hydrogen bonding&#8208;modulated crystallization strategy is developed to achieve highly&#8208;crystalline, uniform, and large&#8208;area CsPbI2Br films, enabling CsPbI2Br solar cells with record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under indoor illumination suggests its potential in the applications of powering the Internet of Things, etc.







Abstract
The thermally stable inorganic cesium&#8208;based perovskites promise efficient and stable photovoltaics. Unfortunately, the strong ionic bonds lead to uncontrollable rapid crystallization, making it difficult in fabricating large&#8208;area black&#8208;phase film for photovoltaics. Herein, we developed a facile hydrogen&#8208;bonding assisted strategy for modulating the crystallization of CsPbI2Br to achieve uniform large&#8208;area phase&#8208;pure films with much&#8208;reduced defects. The simple addition of methylamine acetate in precursors not only promotes the formation of intermediate phase via hydrogen bonding to circumvent the direct crystallization of CsPbI2Br from ionic precursors but also widens the film processing window, thus enabling to fabricate large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure CsPbI2Br film under benign conditions. Combining with stable dopant&#8208;free poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), the CsPbI2Br solar cells achieve the record&#8208;high efficiencies of 18.14&#8201;% and 16.46&#8201;% for 0.1&#8197;cm2 and 1&#8197;cm2 active area, respectively. The obtained high efficiency of 38.24&#8201;% under 1000&#8197;lux illumination suggests its potential in indoor photovoltaics for powering the Internet of Things, etc.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the tandem BBr3&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of tertiary cyclic amine, intramolecular C&#8722;H borylation, and Ni&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular B&#8722;Br/C&#8722;Br reductive coupling was developed. This method represents a simple route to construct the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of N&#8208;heterocycles has recently received considerable attention, and the introduction of boron atom into heterocycles often results in positive property changes. However, direct enlargement of N&#8208;heterocycles through boron atom insertion is rarely reported in the literature. Here, we report a N&#8208;heterocyclic editing reaction through the combination boron atom insertion and C&#8722;H borylation, accessing the fused&#8208;BN&#8208;heterocycles. The synthetic potential of this chemistry was demonstrated by substrate scope and late&#8208;stage diversification of products.

         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles can effectively penetrate human cell membranes. They are easy to synthesize, require only three positive charges for cell entry, and their uptake can be monitored by mass spectrometry due to the unique ability to trace bismuth. This discovery offers an alternative to fluorophore labeling and opens new possibilities for designing therapeutic agents with improved cellular uptake and traceability.







Abstract
Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) play a significant role in the delivery of cargos into human cells. We report the first CPPs based on peptide&#8208;bismuth bicycles, which can be readily obtained from commercially available peptide precursors, making them accessible for a wide range of applications. These CPPs enter human cells as demonstrated by live&#8208;cell confocal microscopy using fluorescently labelled peptides. We report efficient sequences that demonstrate increased cellular uptake compared to conventional CPPs like the TAT peptide (derived from the transactivating transcriptional activator of human immunodeficiency virus 1) or octaarginine (R8), despite requiring only three positive charges. Bicyclization triggered by the presence of bismuth(III) increases cellular uptake by more than one order of magnitude. Through the analysis of cell lysates using inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), we have introduced an alternative approach to examine the cellular uptake of CPPs. This has allowed us to confirm the presence of bismuth in cells after exposure to our CPPs. Mechanistic studies indicated an energy&#8208;dependent endocytic cellular uptake sensitive to inhibition by rottlerin, most likely involving macropinocytosis.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Carbonylation towards Chiral Isoindolinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide as C1 source, enabling highly efficient synthesis of chiral isoindolinones, is reported. The robustness and synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. Moreover, the chiral isoindolinones also proved to be efficient chiral ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide, an essential and easily available C1 feedstock, remains challenging. Here, we disclosed an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation catalyzed by inexpensive and readily available cobalt(II) salt. The reactions proceed efficiently through desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, affording a broad range of chiral isoindolinones in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 92&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of biological active compounds, such as (S)&#8208;PD172938 and (S)&#8208;Pazinaclone. The resulting chiral isoindolinones also serve as chiral ligands in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation with alkynes to construct phosphorus stereocenter.

     alt="Cobalt-Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Carbonylation towards Chiral Isoindolinones"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide as C1 source, enabling highly efficient synthesis of chiral isoindolinones, is reported. The robustness and synthetic potential of this method is demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of bioactive molecules, (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-PD172938 and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Pazinaclone. Moreover, the chiral isoindolinones also proved to be efficient chiral ligands for asymmetric C&#8722;H activation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation with carbon monoxide, an essential and easily available C1 feedstock, remains challenging. Here, we disclosed an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H carbonylation catalyzed by inexpensive and readily available cobalt(II) salt. The reactions proceed efficiently through desymmetrization, kinetic resolution, and parallel kinetic resolution, affording a broad range of chiral isoindolinones in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 92&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated by asymmetric synthesis of biological active compounds, such as (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-PD172938 and (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-Pazinaclone. The resulting chiral isoindolinones also serve as chiral ligands in cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation with alkynes to construct phosphorus stereocenter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Plasmonic Hot Electron Energy on Ag Surface by Amine Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface coordination induces a substantial enhancement in plasmonic hot electron energy, thereby enabling the achievement of previously inaccessible visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=F, Cl) bonds using individual plasmonic metal.







Abstract
Plasmonic catalysis has emerged as a promising approach to solar&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Notably, hot carriers play a decisive role in plasmonic catalysis since only when their energy matches with the LUMO or HOMO energy of the reactant molecule, can the reaction be activated. However, the hot carrier energy depends on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the plasmonic metal substrate and the interaction with incident light. Tuning the hot carrier energy is of great significance for plasmonic catalysis but remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that the energy of hot electrons can be significantly elevated to an unprecedented level through the coordination of amines on Ag surface. The bonding of amines and Ag reduces the work function of nanoparticles, leading to the increase of hot electron energy by 0.4&#8197;eV. This enhancement of energy promotes the cleavage of C&#8722;X (X=Cl, F) bonds upon excitation by visible light. This study provides new insights for promoting plasmonic charge transfer and enhancing the photocatalytic performance of plasmon&#8208;mediated systems.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Mediated Magnetism&#8208;Conversion Nanoprobes for Activatable Ultra&#8208;High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a novel ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) with tunable nanomagnetism for ultra&#8208;high field (UHF)&#8208;tailored activatable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement. Under a 9 T MRI, the pH&#8208;sensitive alteration in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity within the MCNP leads to a remarkable &gt;10&#8208;fold increase in longitudinal relaxivity (r1) value (10.6&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, pH&#8197;5.0), as compared to the value observed at neutral pH.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a focal point of interest in the field of cancer diagnosis. Despite the ability of current paramagnetic or superparamagnetic smart MRI contrast agents to selectively enhance tumor signals in low&#8208;field MRI, their effectiveness at UHF remains inadequate due to inherent magnetism. Here, we report a ligand&#8208;mediated magnetism&#8208;conversion nanoprobe (MCNP) composed of 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid ligand&#8208;coated silver&#8208;gadolinium bimetallic nanoparticles. The MCNP exhibits a pH&#8208;dependent magnetism conversion from ferromagnetism to diamagnetism, facilitating tunable nanomagnetism for pH&#8208;activatable UHF MRI. Under neutral pH, the thiolate (&#8722;S&#8722;) ligands lead to short &#964;&#8242;m and increased magnetization of the MCNPs. Conversely, in the acidic tumor microenvironment, the thiolate ligands are protonated and transform into thiol (&#8722;SH) ligands, resulting in prolonged &#964;&#8242;m and decreased magnetization of the MCNP, thereby enhancing longitudinal relaxivity (r1) values at UHF MRI. Notably, under a 9&#8197;T MRI field, the pH&#8208;sensitive changes in Ag&#8722;S binding affinity of the MCNP lead to a remarkable (&gt;10&#8208;fold) r1 increase in an acidic medium (pH&#8197;5.0). In vivo studies demonstrate the capability of MCNPs to amplify MRI signal of hepatic tumors, suggesting their potential as a next&#8208;generation UHF&#8208;tailored smart MRI contrast agent.

         <title>Intensified Continuous Flow Process for the Scalable Production of Bio&#8208;Based Glycerol Carbonate
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intensified continuous flow process for the production of glycerol carbonate from bio&#8208;based glycidol and stoichiometric CO2 in the presence of a homogeneous organocatalyst. It features an unprecedented mechanism and fast CO2 capture rate, which set robust foundations for large scale operation.







Abstract
A subtle combination of fundamental and applied organic chemistry toward process intensification is demonstrated for the large&#8208;scale production of bio&#8208;based glycerol carbonate under flow conditions. The direct carbonation of bio&#8208;based glycidol with CO2 is successfully carried out under intensified flow conditions, with Barton's base as a potent homogeneous organocatalyst. Process metrics for the CO2 coupling step (for the upstream production, output: 3.6&#8197;kg day&#8722;1, Space Time Yield (STY): 2.7&#8197;kg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;L&#8722;1, Environmental factor (E&#8208;factor): 4.7) outclass previous reports. High conversion and selectivity are achieved in less than 30&#8197;s of residence time at pilot scale with a stoichiometric amount of CO2. Supporting DFT computations reveal the unique features of the mechanism in presence of Br&#248;nsted bases.

         <title>Total Synthesis of the Guangnanmycin A Alcohol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant ring strain has to be built up in pursuit of guangnanmycin A, a congener of the anticancer drug lead leinamycin. The challenge was met by liaising ring closing alkyne metathesis with ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization. The signature disulfide was introduced by a thia&#8208;Michael addition reaction followed by an unusual thioether&#8208;to&#8208;disulfide swap. In the dense array, however, final oxidation of the primary alcohol was unsuccessful.







Abstract
Guangnanmycin A is a recently discovered congener of the well&#8208;known antitumor drug lead leinamycin; its macrolactam ring, however, is even more strained than that of the parent compound. The first synthetic foray towards this challenging target is reported, which relies on molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed macrocyclization by ring closing alkyne metathesis (RCAM) followed by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed redox isomerization of the propargyl alcohol thus formed; the resulting enone enabled the introduction of the yet missing exo&#8208;methylene group by a modified Peterson olefination. The signature disulfide moiety of guangnanmycin A was installed by strain&#8208;driven thia&#8208;Michael addition followed by conversion of the thioether thus formed into an unsymmetric disulfide with the aid of (methylthio)dimethylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate and MeSSMe. While this sequence furnished racemic guangnanmycin A alcohol in good overall yield, the final oxidation to the corresponding acid failed, most likely because of the exceptional sensitivity of the strained scaffold.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics with a Membrane&#8208;Embedded Electron Shuttle Mimics the Bioenergy Anabolism of Mitochondria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism is achieved by synthetic electron shuttle&#8208;activated transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture. It offers a new and efficient route to realize artificial bioenergy production, holding great promise in ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.







Abstract
Enhanced bioenergy anabolism through transmembrane redox reactions in artificial systems remains a great challenge. Here, we explore synthetic electron shuttle to activate transmembrane chemo&#8208;enzymatic cascade reactions in a mitochondria&#8208;like nanoarchitecture for augmenting bioenergy anabolism. In this nanoarchitecture, a dendritic mesoporous silica microparticle as inner compartment possesses higher load capacity of NADH as proton source and allows faster mass transfer. In addition, the outer compartment ATP synthase&#8208;reconstituted proteoliposomes. Like natural enzymes in the mitochondrion respiratory chain, a small synthetic electron shuttle embedded in the lipid bilayer facilely mediates transmembrane redox reactions to convert NADH into NAD+ and a proton. These facilitate an enhanced outward proton gradient to drive ATP synthase to rotate for catalytic ATP synthesis with improved performance in a sustainable manner. This work opens a new avenue to achieve enhanced bioenergy anabolism by utilizing a synthetic electron shuttle and tuning inner nanostructures, holding great promise in wide&#8208;range ATP&#8208;powered bioapplications.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Bipolarolides A and B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B was achieved by using a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantiomerically enriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of bipolarolides A and B, which possess an intriguing and complex 5/6/6/6/5 caged pentacyclic skeleton with seven contiguous stereocenters. The synthesis features a lithium&#8208;halogen exchange/intermolecular nucleophilic addition to link two enantioenriched fragments, two ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions to assemble the five&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered rings, and a bioinspired Prins reaction/ether formation cascade cyclization to construct the 5/6/6/6/5 caged skeleton.

         <title>pH&#8208;Controlled Reversible Folding of Copolymers via Formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet Secondary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization, short pH&#8208;responsive peptides are embedded into the main chain of vinylic polymers. Controlled by pH, these defined peptide sequences dictate the reversible folding of their parent polymers into hydrogen&#8208;bonded architectures, effectively mirroring the translation from primary to higher&#8208;order structures.







Abstract
Protein functions are enabled by their perfectly arranged 3D structure, which is the result of a hierarchical intramolecular folding process. Sequence&#8208;defined polypeptide chains form locally ordered secondary structures (i.e., &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet) through hydrogen bonding between the backbone amides, shaping the overall tertiary structure. To generate similarly complex macromolecular architectures based on synthetic materials, a plethora of strategies have been developed to induce and control the folding of synthetic polymers. However, the degree of complexity of the structure&#8208;driving ensemble of interactions demonstrated by natural polymers is unreached, as synthesizing long sequence&#8208;defined polymers with functional backbones remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of hybrid peptide&#8208;N,N&#8208;Dimethylacrylamide copolymers via radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization (rROP) of peptide containing macrocycles. The resulting synthetic polymers contain sequence&#8208;defined regions of &#946;&#8208;sheet encoding amino acid sequences. Exploiting the pH responsiveness of the embedded sequences, protonation or deprotonation in water induces self&#8208;assembly of the peptide strands at an intramacromolecular level, driving polymer chain folding via formation of &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures. We demonstrate that the folding behavior is sequence dependent and reversible.

         <title>Aromatic Ketones as Mild Presodiating Reagents toward Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic ketone Na&#8208;9&#8208;FN&#8208;DME is rationally designed as a mild presodiating reagent by introducing a carbonyl group into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to balance the conjugated and inductive effect, thus demonstrating versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts, Na0.44MnO2 as an example achieves higher charge capacity and longer life after presodiation, and manifests structural stability upon prolonged presodiation time.







Abstract
Chemical presodiation (CP) is an effective strategy to enhance energy density of sodium ion batteries. However, the sodiation reagents reported so far are basically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) wth low reductive potential (~0.1&#8197;V vs. Na+/Na), which could easily cause over&#8208;sodiation and structural deterioration of the presodiated cathodes. In this work, Aromatic ketones (AKs) are rationally designed as mild presodiating reagents by introducing a carbonyl group (C=O) into PAHs to balance the conjugated and inductive effect. As the representatives, two compounds 9&#8208;Fluorenoneb (9&#8208;FN) and Benzophenone (BP) manifest favorable equilibrium potential of 1.55&#8197;V and 1.07&#8197;V (vs. Na+/Na), respectively. Note that 9&#8208;FN demonstrates versatile presodiating capability toward multiple Na uptake hosts (tunneled Na0.44MnO2, layered Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, polyanionic Na4Fe2.91(PO4)2P2O7, Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na3V2(PO4)2F3), enabling greatly improved initial charging capacity of the cathode to balance the irrevisible capacity of the anode. Our results indicate that the Aromatic ketones are competitive presodiating cathodic reagents for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and will inspire more studies and application attempts in the future.

         <title>Stereodivergent Protein Engineering of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase for Light&#8208;Driven Kinetic Resolution of Sec&#8208;Alcohol Oxalates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoselectivity&#8208;tailored, photoenzyme&#8208;catalyzed kinetic resolution of oxalates and oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines was possible by using a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAP variants with excellent selectivity (both giving up to 99&#8201;% e.e., E&gt;200). The enzymes were obtained by focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM)&#8208;guided stereodivergent protein engineering of fatty acid photodecarboxylase.







Abstract
Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme to create stereocomplementary variants for synthesizing optically pure molecules with tailor&#8208;made (R) or (S) configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photodecarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP) using the focused rational iterative site&#8208;specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both giving products with up to 99&#8201;% e.e.). These variants were used for the CvFAP&#8208;catalyzed light&#8208;driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding sec&#8208;alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral sec&#8208;alcohols and amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of sec&#8208;alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary CvFAPs.

&lt;p&gt;Stereodivergent engineering of one enzyme to create stereocomplementary variants for synthesizing optically pure molecules with tailor-made (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) or (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) configurations on an optional basis is highly desirable and challenging. This study aimed to engineer fatty acid photodecarboxylase from &lt;i&gt;Chlorella variabilis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP) using the focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis (FRISM) strategy to obtain two highly stereocomplementary variants with excellent selectivity (both giving products with up to 99&#8201;% e.e.). These variants were used for the &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAP-catalyzed light-driven kinetic resolution of oxalates or oxamic acids prepared from the corresponding &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols or amines, providing a new biotransformation process for preparing chiral &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols and amines. Molecular dynamics simulation, kinetic data and transient spectra revealed the source of selectivity. This study represents the first example of the kinetic resolution of &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;-alcohols or amines catalyzed by a pair of stereocomplementary &lt;i&gt;Cv&lt;/i&gt;FAPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tetrazine&#8208;Isonitrile Bioorthogonal Fluorogenic Reactions Enable Multiplex Labeling and Wash&#8208;Free Bioimaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 10, March 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes for multiplex imaging, by incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds upon click reactions. These modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm, and high turn&#8208;on ratios up to 3184&#8208;fold.







Abstract
Developing fluorogenic probes for simultaneous live cell labeling of multiple targets is crucial for understanding complex cellular events. The emerging [4+1] cycloaddition between tetrazine and isonitriles holds promise as a bioorthogonal tool, yet existing tetrazine probes lack reactivity and fluorogenicity. Here, we present the development of a series of tetrazine&#8208;functionalized bioorthogonal probes. By incorporating pyrazole adducts into the fluorophore scaffolds, the post&#8208;reacted probes displayed remarkable fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios, up to 3184&#8208;fold. Moreover, these modifications are generalizable to various fluorophores, enabling a broad emission range from 473 to 659&#8197;nm. Quantum chemical calculations further elucidate the turn&#8208;on mechanisms. These probes enable the simultaneous labeling of multiple targets in live cells, without the need for a washing step. Consequently, our findings pave the way for advanced multiplex imaging and detection techniques for cellular studies.
