         <title>Building a Bridge Between Ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS by Non&#8208;Exhaustive Microdesorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential analysis strategy was developed to integrate rapid ambient mass spectrometry (MS) screening with LC&#8208;MS confirmation using a single solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) device. The approach involves an initial non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption for ambient MS screening, followed by a second desorption for LC&#8208;MS confirmation of only the disputed samples. This workflow enhances throughput while maintaining sensitivity and minimizing matrix effects. The method has been applied for high throughput anti&#8208;doping test.








Abstract
Ambient mass spectrometry (AMS) offers rapid screening but faces challenges in analyzing complex samples due to high matrix effects. The absence of a separation step can also lead to false positives due to the isomers or isobars. In this study, a sequential analysis strategy which combines ambient MS and LC&#8208;MS based on the non&#8208;exhaustive microdesorption in solid&#8208;phase microextraction (SPME) was developed for the first time. By combining coated blade spray (CBS)&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS, in the first step, a few microliters of solvent were used for non&#8208;exhaustive desorption with high enrichment factor for rapid screening by CBS&#8208;MS. For the suspicious samples, the remaining analytes on the SPME coating undergo exhaustive desorption, then followed by LC&#8208;MS confirmation. The matrix&#8208;compatible coating used in the SPME device significantly reduces matrix effects while enhancing sensitivity through analyte enrichment. This method is environmentally friendly, utilizing only a few microliters of organic solvents for screening. The approach was rigorously validated, both theoretically and experimentally, and successfully applied to anti&#8208;doping testing, enabling detection of 53 prohibited substances in urine samples by integrating CBS&#8208;MS with LC&#8208;MS.

         <title>Synergy of Oxygen Vacancies and Ni Single Atoms Toward Efficient Urea Photosynthesis from CO2 and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urchin&#8208;like Ni1/TiO2&#8208;x catalyst with atomically dispersed Ni and Ov dual sites enables efficient urea synthesis by synergistically activating N2 and CO2. The Ni sites facilitate N2 adsorption, while Ov activates CO2. The CO2 reduction product (i.e., CO) can migrate to Ni sites, coupling with *N2 to form *NCON*, converting to urea. This dual&#8208;site mechanism lowers barriers and boosts kinetics, offering a green urea synthesis route.








Abstract
The direct photochemical synthesis of urea under mild conditions presents considerable promise. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic urea synthesis is severely restricted by the co&#8208;adsorption and activation of inert CO2 and N2 molecules. Herein, an ingenious design of a high&#8208;performance Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst by strategically coupling Ni single atoms (Ni SAs) and oxygen vacancies (Ov) onto urchin&#8208;like TiO2 architecture. By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni1/TiO2&#8208;X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73&#160;&#181;mol gcat.&#8722;1h&#8722;1. Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N2 adsorption and activation, generating *N2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N2 to form a &#8220;tower&#8208;like&#8221; urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual&#8208;active&#8208;site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high&#8208;value products.

         <title>Photoredox Catalysts Based on N&#8208;(Hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide for Photopolymerization and 3D Printing Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, two benzothioxanthene imide dyes demonstrate excellent photochemical properties. When used as photocatalysts, they work with amine and iodonium salt or sulfonium salt to form different three&#8208;component systems for effectively initiating photopolymerization under visible light, through photoredox catalysis processes. The best formulations can be applied for 3D printing and direct laser write. This work offers a strategy for developing novel photosensitive dyes as photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photoredox catalytic systems are widely used in free radical polymerization as an important photoinitiating approach. However, many reported photoredox catalytic systems are limited by their low stabilities, high excitation powers, and low initiating efficiencies upon excitation in the visible region. Therefore, it is still a great challenge to develop efficient photoinitiating systems for photopolymerization under visible light. In this work, three new effective photosensitizers from N&#8208;(hexyl)benzothioxanthene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide derivatives, namely 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI), 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (BTXI&#8208;Br) and 2&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;thioxantheno[2,1,9&#8208;def]isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione 6,6&#8208;dioxide (BTXIO), were designed by density functional theory calculation and synthesized as photoredox catalysts for visible light induced photopolymerization. When combined with initiators such as oxidants, that is, bis(4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate or sulfonium salts (i.e., thianthrenium salts, phenoxathiinium salt, phenothiazinium salt, dibenzothiophenium salt) and the reductant ethyl dimethylaminobenzoate to form three&#8208;component initiating systems, they showed good to high performance in visible light photo polymerizations with LED@405&#160;nm and LED@450&#160;nm. In addition, these photoinitiating systems enable the successful digital light processing and direct laser writing of 3D structures with high resolution, demonstrating a promising strategy for 3D printing applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Enrichment and Quantitative Analysis of In Vivo Protein Complexes via Dimethylpiperidine Cross&#8208;Linker DPST</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,6&#8208;Dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), an enrichable and quantifiable cross&#8208;linker, offers the advantages of membrane permeability and biocompatibility. It enables one&#8208;step enrichment of cross&#8208;linked peptides via tandem mass tag (TMT) antibody, minimizing sample loss and enabling in vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) analysis of 1E4 cells. The isotope labeling feature of DPST ensures precise quantification in dynamic environments. With its flexible design supporting various isotope labeling configurations (6/10&#8208;plex), DPST holds significant promise for advancing biomedical research.








Abstract
In vivo cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) enables the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein complexes in living cells. However, most XL&#8208;MS methods face significant sample loss during enrichment, limiting their applications to limited&#8208;quantity samples, and suffer from poor reproducibility (20%&#8211;40%), hindering precise quantification. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel membrane&#8208;permeable cross&#8208;linker, 2,6&#8208;dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), in which the dimethylpiperidinyl group enables one&#8208;step enrichment of cross&#8208;linked peptides via tandem mass tags (TMTs) antibody approach, eliminating sample loss from multi&#8208;step processes and allowing analysis from as few as 1E4 cells. DPST also allows the light and heavy isotopic labeling of cross&#8208;linked samples at the cellular level, which reduces inaccuracies from multi&#8208;step preparations. This generates reporter ions for precise MS2 quantification, improving the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio without increasing spectral complexity. Using DPST, we analyzed cross&#8208;links in primary neurons from single fetal mice and quantified the transient and weak interactions in dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) environments. Additionally, DPST's design supports multiple isotopic labeling configurations (e.g., 6&#8208;plex, 10&#8208;plex). Therefore, DPST provides a scalable and robust tool for in vivo XL&#8208;MS&#8208;based qualitative and quantitative analysis of living cells, even with limited sample quantities.

&lt;p&gt;2,6-Dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), an enrichable and quantifiable cross-linker, offers the advantages of membrane permeability and biocompatibility. It enables one-step enrichment of cross-linked peptides via tandem mass tag (TMT) antibody, minimizing sample loss and enabling in vivo cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) analysis of 1E4 cells. The isotope labeling feature of DPST ensures precise quantification in dynamic environments. With its flexible design supporting various isotope labeling configurations (6/10-plex), DPST holds significant promise for advancing biomedical research.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vivo cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) enables the proteome-wide characterization of protein complexes in living cells. However, most XL-MS methods face significant sample loss during enrichment, limiting their applications to limited-quantity samples, and suffer from poor reproducibility (20%&#8211;40%), hindering precise quantification. To overcome these challenges, we developed a novel membrane-permeable cross-linker, 2,6-dimethylpiperidine disuccinimidyl tridecanoate (DPST), in which the dimethylpiperidinyl group enables one-step enrichment of cross-linked peptides via tandem mass tags (TMTs) antibody approach, eliminating sample loss from multi-step processes and allowing analysis from as few as 1E4 cells. DPST also allows the light and heavy isotopic labeling of cross-linked samples at the cellular level, which reduces inaccuracies from multi-step preparations. This generates reporter ions for precise MS2 quantification, improving the signal-to-noise ratio without increasing spectral complexity. Using DPST, we analyzed cross-links in primary neurons from single fetal mice and quantified the transient and weak interactions in dynamic liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) environments. Additionally, DPST's design supports multiple isotopic labeling configurations (e.g., 6-plex, 10-plex). Therefore, DPST provides a scalable and robust tool for in vivo XL-MS-based qualitative and quantitative analysis of living cells, even with limited sample quantities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme Induced Solid&#8208;Like Condensates Formation of Engineered Peptide in Living Cells for Prostate Cancer Inhibition</title>

         <dc:description>
This study presents the condensate formation from engineered amphiphilic&#8208;branched peptides in living cells through enzymatic reactions. We describe the rational design and synthesis of DMN&#8208;SIPL, a peptide that forms solid&#8208;like condensates via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) when triggered by the type&#8208;II membrane&#8208;associated serine peptidase hepsin.








Abstract
This work describes the rational design and synthesis of hepsin&#8208;recognized amphiphilic&#8208;branched peptides (DMN&#8208;SIPL) that can form solid condensates through liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) upon enzymatic reaction. The peptide forms solid&#8208;like condensates both in vitro and in living cells, triggered by type&#8208;II membrane&#8208;associated serine peptidase, hepsin, whose overexpression determines prostate cancer progression. Specifically, integrating self&#8208;assembly, hepsin hydrolysis, and hepsin&#8208;binding domain generates a branched substrate that acts as a precursor for enzyme&#8208;induced LLPS. Upon binding hepsin on the cell membrane, DMN&#8208;SIPL forms condensates initiated by hepsin&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly. The prostate cancer cells then uptake these condensates via lipid raft&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The entrapped hepsin in the condensates further hydrolyzes the DMN&#8208;SIPL to stabilize the intracellular condensates. Structure&#8211;activity relationship reveals the importance of enzyme&#8208;binding motif, enzyme&#8208;recognized motif, and the self&#8208;assembly motif. Mechanistic studies indicate that the resulting solid&#8208;like condensates modulate cancer cell metabolism by inhibiting hepsin upstream protein activation and downstream signal transduction, ultimately inducing cancer cell growth inhibition selectively. As a first example, this work investigates enzymatic LLPS condensate formation in living cells, paving the way to generate functional synthetic biomolecular condensates through LLPS for biomedical applications.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Vacancies with Atomically Dispersed Cu Sites for Stable and Efficient Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniformly dispersed Cu single atoms on the In2O3 enable efficient photothermal CO2 conversion through modulating the synergy with induced oxygen vacancies. The catalyst exhibits an optimal reactivity (1108&#160;mmol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 CO with selectivity &gt;99%) at a moderate Cu loading (2.4&#160;wt%). 








Abstract
Photothermal catalysis under mild conditions represents a promising and sustainable approach for CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals, thereby enabling efficient carbon recycling. However, precise manipulation of active sites and their coordination environments at the atomic level to enhance catalyst performance still remains a challenge. Here, we present a single&#8208;atom doping strategy for oxygen vacancy engineering to facilitate efficient CO2 conversion. Specifically, an In2O3&#8208;based catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies induced by homogeneously dispersed Cu single atoms is constructed, exhibiting a competent CO2 reduction performance in photothermal reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction. The optimal Cu&#8208;In2O3 catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 46.17&#160;mol&#160;gCu&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with near&#8208;unity selectivity (&gt;99%) and demonstrates stability over 450 h under 3&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 full&#8208;spectrum light illumination. Comprehensive spectroscopic characterization and computational simulations elucidate that the Cu single atoms synergistically interact with oxygen vacancies to promote H2 dissociation and CO2 activation under photoexcitation. This work provides insights into the design of photothermal catalysts, emphasizing the transformative potential of atomic&#8208;site engineering for efficient CO2 conversion and sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr Sites for Highly Selective Production of p&#8208;xylene from Tandem Upcycling of PET and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous catalyst Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A with atomic Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites was successfully developed at ambient temperature and pressure, which not only exhibits efficient activation of C&#9552;O and H&#9472;H bonds but also possesses a fast hydrogen spillover effect. These properties endow this catalyst with superior catalytic activity for the upcycling of waste PET and CO2 into p&#8208;xylene (PX) and ethylene glycol (EG).








Abstract
Exploring an efficient catalytic system for tandem upcycling of CO2 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is highly desirable for achieving efficient resource utilization of wastes. However, the high activation energy for C&#9552;O bonds (in both PET and CO2) and the difficulty in regulating the reaction pathways restricted PET recovery efficiency. Here, we demonstrated the rational design of a single&#8208;atom Cu catalyst for precisely catalyzing the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol and tandem PET upcycling to ethylene glycol (EG) and p&#8208;xylene (PX). In the Cu/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2&#8208;A catalyst, Cu atoms are selectively anchored to the Zr&#8208;oxo nodes of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 to form Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites. The Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites can effectively activate both CO2 and H2 by reducing the activation energy and accelerate the transformation of PET to dimethyl terephthalate (DMT), which is further hydro&#8208;deoxygenated to yield PX. As a result, 20.4% CO2 conversion was obtained within 36&#160;h, with 89.5% and 92.1% yields of PX and EG, respectively. Rapid and precise hydrogen spillover from Cu atoms to adsorbed reactants/intermediates at the Cu&#8211;O&#8211;Zr sites also drives the reaction process.

         <title>Deciphering Coulombic Efficiency of Lithium Metal Anodes by Screening Electrolyte Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor basicity (&#946;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, which provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design. 








Abstract
Coulombic efficiency (CE) is a quantifiable indicator for the reversibility of lithium metal anodes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the quantitative relationship between CE and electrolyte properties has yet to be established, impeding rational electrolyte design. Herein, an interpretable model for estimating CE based on data&#8208;driven insights of electrolyte properties is proposed. Hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor basicity (&#946;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of solvents govern anode interphase chemistry. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on &#946; and HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. Using the new solvent screened by above regression model, the lithium metal anode in the pouch cell with an energy density of 418 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 achieves the highest CE of 99.2%, which is much larger than previous CE ranging from 70%&#8211;98.5%. This work provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design.

&lt;p&gt;Both hydrogen-bond acceptor basicity (&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coulombic efficiency (CE) is a quantifiable indicator for the reversibility of lithium metal anodes in high-energy-density batteries. However, the quantitative relationship between CE and electrolyte properties has yet to be established, impeding rational electrolyte design. Herein, an interpretable model for estimating CE based on data-driven insights of electrolyte properties is proposed. Hydrogen-bond acceptor basicity (&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;) and the energy level gap between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO gap) of solvents are identified as the top two parameters impacting CE by machine learning. &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; and HOMO-LUMO gap of solvents govern anode interphase chemistry. A regression model is further proposed to estimate the CE based on &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; and HOMO-LUMO gap. Using the new solvent screened by above regression model, the lithium metal anode in the pouch cell with an energy density of 418 Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; achieves the highest CE of 99.2%, which is much larger than previous CE ranging from 70%&#8211;98.5%. This work provides a reliable interpretable quantitative model for rational electrolyte design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intermediate Layer&#8208;Engineered Lanthanide Nanoparticles Enable Deep Bioorthogonal Liver Tumor and Vascular Imaging via Switchable NIR&#8208;II Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering the intermediate layer of lanthanide nanoparticles, we achieve switchable NIR&#8208;II emissions, enabling high&#8208;resolution vascular imaging at 1525&#160;nm and deep bioorthogonal liver tumor imaging at 1064&#160;nm. This will provide reference for designing imaging probes to adapt to fluorescence imaging in different scenes.








Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has become an attractive optical region for fluorescence imaging. However, due to the complexity in vivo, NIR&#8208;II light with various wavelengths for different imaging scenes has not been investigated. Here, we found that 1525&#160;nm light is suitable for high&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging due to low background interference, while its attenuation in vivo makes it unsuitable for deep imaging. The 1064&#160;nm light is suitable for deep imaging. The impact of Yb3+ ions and the proportion of the intermediate layer in lanthanide nanoparticles on the modulation of emissions were investigated. The intense 1064&#160;nm emission is achievable when the Yb3+ content is 80% and the intermediate layer proportion is 0.1. The bioorthogonal orthotopic liver tumor imaging could be achieved by modifying the lanthanide nanoparticles with DBCO&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;DSPE and establishing artificial receptors by N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;tetraacylated (Ac4ManNAz). Lanthanide nanoparticles with the intermediate layer proportion of 0.66 and 80% Yb3+ facilitate intense 1525&#160;nm emission, enabling the vascular imaging. Based on the imaging characteristics of NIR&#8208;II emissions with different wavelengths in vivo, this work achieves high&#8208;resolution imaging and deep imaging through intermediate layer regulation of lanthanide nanoparticles, providing an opportunity to explore a new generation of high&#8208;performance fluorescent probes.

         <dc:description>
The first application of radical Brook rearrangement in asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed, enabling enantioconvergent synthesis of chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. The reaction proceeded through the combination of photocatalytic generation of masked ketyl radicals and Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides. The the presence of para&#8208;methoxyphenyldimethylsilyl group lowers the oxidation potentials of the racemic alcohol substrates, enabling a radical relay process to form carbon&#8208;centered radicals from initial generation of the aryl cation radicals. The reaction features mild conditions, broad substrate scope, and excellent enantioselectivity. The formal synthesis of bioactive Odanacatib and LX&#8208;1031 and various down&#8208;stream transformations demonstrated the synthetic potential of the reaction.








Abstract
While radical Brook rearrangement has emerged as a powerful strategy in modern organic synthesis, enantioselective cross coupling involving radical Brook rearrangement remains unexplored. Herein, we report a photocatalytic radical Brook rearrangement followed by cross&#8208;coupling with aryl/heteroaryl bromides, enabling the enantioconvergent construction of chiral &#945;&#8208;fluoroalkyl alcohols. Key to this transformation is a radical relay process involving sequential generation of aryl cation radicals, alkoxy radicals, and carbon&#8208;centered radicals through Brook rearrangement. The reaction exhibits exceptional scope (&gt;40 examples), outstanding enantiocontrol (up to 99% ee), and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated through formal syntheses of bioactive Odanacatib and LX&#8208;1031, along with diverse downstream derivatizations.

         <title>Al3+&#8208;Dependent Anisotropic Facet Tailoring on SrTiO3 Single Crystal for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controlling Al3+ concentration in SrCl2 molten salt through the addition of miscible AlCl3, the anisotropic SrTiO3 single crystals with well&#8208;defined {100}, {111}, and {110} facets can be sequentially synthesized, achieving the optimal remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 2621.85&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 and apparent quantum yield value of 50.5% at 350&#160;nm for stoichiometric photocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Controllable fabrication of single&#8208;crystal metal oxide is of paramount importance for advanced photo(electro)catalytic applications, but achieving nonequilibrium crystal shapes with tailored facets through molten salt synthesis still remains a challenge. Herein, we systematically explored the effect of Al3+ concentration in tailoring crystal facets of SrTiO3 single crystals and developed a one&#8208;step molten salt strategy for engineering anisotropic structures by using miscible AlCl3 as Al3+ additive. By progressively increasing Al3+ concentration, a series of high&#8208;quality SrTiO3 single crystals exposing {100}, {111}, and {110} facets were sequentially synthesized. Theoretical calculations reveal an Al&#8208;doping stabilized {111} surface reconstruction and provide further atomistic insights into the surface structural evolution with Wulff constructions as Al3+ concentration increases. Experimental results demonstrate that the anisotropic facets dominate the efficient charge separation for the enhanced photocatalytic overall water splitting activity. Consequently, SrTiO3 single crystals enclosed by well&#8208;defined {100} and {111} facets exhibit a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 2621.85&#160;&#181;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield value of 50.5% at 350&#160;nm for stoichiometric overall water splitting. This work offers a molten&#8208;salt synthetic strategy and valuable insight for preparing facet&#8208;controlled single&#8208;crystal semiconductors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Activated Heterogeneous Fenton Process for Accelerated Degradation of Aromatic Pollutants over Copper Oxide Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an unusual phenomenon of pollutant&#8208;induced activity enhancement of CuO for H2O2 activation and self&#8208;accelerated pollutant degradation, contrasting the performance decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. CuO can stabilize and activate phenol via ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer, generating surface&#8208;bound phenoxyl radicals to further mediate the H2O2 activation and meanwhile yielding low&#8208;valent Cu. This offers opportunities for simultaneously addressing the catalyst passivation and redox cycling limitations of heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like catalysis. 








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts have been commonly adopted for Fenton&#8208;like oxidation of organic pollutants, but generally suffer from inadequate activity in practical water treatment applications due to surface passivation by accumulated pollutants and sluggish redox cycling of active metal. Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant&#8208;induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H2O2 activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe2O3 catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer route, generating surface&#8208;bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H2O2 activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low&#8208;valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe&#8208;Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst&#8208;phenol interaction towards self&#8208;activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14&#8208;time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude higher H2O2 utilization efficiency than the Fe2O3 control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100&#8208;day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst&#8208;pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.

&lt;p&gt;This study reports an unusual phenomenon of pollutant-induced activity enhancement of CuO for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and self-accelerated pollutant degradation, contrasting the performance decay of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. CuO can stabilize and activate phenol via ligand-to-metal charge transfer, generating surface-bound phenoxyl radicals to further mediate the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and meanwhile yielding low-valent Cu. This offers opportunities for simultaneously addressing the catalyst passivation and redox cycling limitations of heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysis. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-based heterogeneous catalysts have been commonly adopted for Fenton-like oxidation of organic pollutants, but generally suffer from inadequate activity in practical water treatment applications due to surface passivation by accumulated pollutants and sluggish redox cycling of active metal. Here, we observed an unusual phenomenon of pollutant-induced activity enhancement for copper oxide (CuO) in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and phenol degradation, which is in sharp contrast to considerable activity decay of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst. The CuO was found to stabilize and activate phenol via ligand-to-metal charge transfer route, generating surface-bound phenoxyl radicals for further mediating the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and enabling a rapid regeneration of low-valent Cu. Based on this principle, a Fe-Cu bimetal oxides catalyst was elaborated to further augment the catalyst-phenol interaction towards self-activated Fenton oxidation. The optimal catalyst achieved 14-time faster pollutant degradation rate and 2 order-of-magnitude higher H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization efficiency than the Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; control. It also demonstrated good adaptability to degradation of diverse substituted benzenes and maintained stable performance for treatment of real lake water during 100-day continuous operation. Our work implies that the catalyst-pollutant interaction may be rationally leveraged and modulated to create highly efficient and stable heterogeneous catalytic systems, thus further unlocking their potential for sustainable water purification application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Polarity of Imine Bonds in Donor&#8211;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the polarity of imine (C&#9552;N) bonds in donor&#8211;acceptor covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with fluorinated units balances exciton binding and charge separation. A moderate C&#9552;N polarity delivers optimal H&#8322; evolution (14.0&#160;mmol h&#8315;&#185; g&#8315;&#185;), offering insights into polarity&#8211;performance relationships in COF photocatalysts.








Abstract
The development of imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has also drawn attention to the influence of the nature of imine binding, including its orientation and possible protonation, on the chemical and physical properties of imine COFs. However, the influence of the polarity of imine bond (C&#9552;N) on the photocatalytic performance of COFs has not yet been described. In this work, we synthesized a series of imine COFs with differently polarized C&#9552;N bonds by altering the C&#9552;N bond orientation and regulating the donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) strength, respectively. The less polarized C&#9552;N bond for one of the COFs possesses a faster charge separation with a decrease of exciton binding energy (Eb). In contrast, the imine COF with more polarized C&#9552;N bond exhibits a stronger internal electric field contributing to a more efficient charge transfer. Taking into account this trade&#8208;off between binding energy and charge transfer concerning the effect of C&#9552;N polarity on the photocatalytic performances, the imine COF with moderately polarized C&#9552;N bond shows the highest hydrogen evolution performance of 14.0&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides evidence that the polarity of C&#9552;N should be taken into account when designing and tuning the properties of imine COFs.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Promoted C&#9472;C Coupling for Selective Methane Conversion into Ethane on Cerium Oxide Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

Surface hydroxyl modification on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts enhances CH4 chemisorption, reducing the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling and effectively suppressing over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, thereby achieving approximately 97% selectivity over a 200&#8208;h flow operation.








Abstract
Converting methane into high&#8208;value chemicals under mild conditions offers substantial environmental and energy benefits but is challenged by the difficulty of activating C&#9472;H bonds and preventing over&#8208;oxidation. In this study, the pivotal role of hydroxyl&#8208;rich surfaces on noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalysts is demonstrated in directing selective C&#9472;C coupling of methane. These surface hydroxyls not only enhance methane chemisorption and improve charge separation, but also promote favorable interactions with molecular oxygen, collectively boosting catalytic performance. Furthermore, the hydroxyl groups lower the energy barrier for ethane formation while suppressing its over&#8208;oxidation to CO2, resulting in significantly improved selectivity. Under ambient conditions in a flow&#8208;reactor system, the catalyst achieves a continuous ethane production rate of 187 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with approximately 97% selectivity over an extended operation period (&gt;200&#160;h), surpassing previous noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems. This work provides critical insights into the role of hydroxyl&#8208;modified local environment in methane valorization, paving the way for the development of sustainable and efficient catalytic systems.

         <title>Uni&#8208;Electrolyte: An Artificial Intelligence Platform for Designing Electrolyte Molecules for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence platform, namely Uni&#8208;Electrolyte, was constructed to design electrolyte molecules for rechargeable batteries. The Uni&#8208;Electrolyte includes three parts, i.e., EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor, which can design new molecules, predict their retrosynthesis pathways and reaction conditions, and predict the chemical mechanism to produce a solid electrolyte interphase, respectively.








Abstract
Electrolytes are an essential part of rechargeable batteries, such as lithium batteries. However, electrolyte innovation is facing grand challenges due to the complicated solution chemistry and infinite molecular space (&gt;1060 for small molecules). This work reported an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, namely Uni&#8208;Electrolyte, for designing advanced electrolyte molecules, which mainly includes three parts, i.e., EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor. New molecules can be designed by combining high&#8208;throughput screening and generative AI models from more than 100 million alternative molecules in the EMolCurator module. The molecular properties, including frontier molecular orbital information, formation energy, binding energy with a Li ion, viscosity, and dielectric constant, can be adopted as the screening parameters. The EMolForger and EMolNetKnittor modules can predict the retrosynthesis pathway and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation mechanism for a given molecule, respectively. With the assistance of advanced AI methods, the Uni&#8208;Electrolyte is strongly supposed to discover new electrolyte molecules and chemical principles, promoting the practical application of next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

An electron&#8208;rich tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen is developed by Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202504825) to enhance thermal conductivity in polymer composites through molecular&#8208;level interface engineering.

A hybrid metal&#8211;enzyme electrode integrating bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) with a metallic catalyst facilitates enhanced CO2 electroreduction. The bCA dynamically catalyzes the reversible conversion between CO2 and bicarbonate, enabling local CO2 regeneration at the catalyst surface. This enzyme&#8208;mediated CO2 supply significantly boosts CO2RR current density beyond mass transfer limits, even under flooding conditions, as reported by Jinwoo Lee, Jungbae Kim, Ki Tae Park et&#160;al. in their Research Article (e202504380).

         <dc:description>
CO2 electrolysis is considered a promising strategy for producing valuable chemicals. However, it is challenging to selectively convert CO2 into long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals due to the difficulty of controlling complex C&#9472;C coupling during the reaction process. In their Research Article (e202502740), Takayoshi Ishimoto, Miho Yamauchi et&#160;al. demonstrate the effective enhancement of in&#8208;situ Raman scattering signals by employing precisely designed electrode structures, which reveal that the crucial step in C&#9472;C coupling is the asymmetric coupling of CO and CH2, thereby advancing CO2 electroreduction to the production of long&#8208;chain carbon chemicals.

         <title>Rational Design of Type&#8208;I Photodynamic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview offers a comprehensive overview of Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy and outlines two design strategies for Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents: thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block Type&#8208;II excitation energy transfer, and kinetic optimization of photoinduced electron/hydrogen transfer processes to enhance Type&#8208;I pathway.








Abstract
Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents can not only produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, but also directly damage biomolecules through electron/hydrogen transfer process, exhibiting reduced dependence on oxygen concentration in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The rational design of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents has attracted increasing attention. This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of Type&#8208;I PDT and its advantages in treating hypoxic tumors. It systematically outlines two complementary design strategies: i) thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block the Type&#8208;II energy transfer pathway, and ii) kinetic enhancement of electron/hydrogen transfer to favor the Type&#8208;I mechanism. Finally, key challenges in Type&#8208;I PDT are discussed, and future perspectives are highlighted to facilitate the clinical translation of Type&#8208;I photodynamic agents.

&lt;p&gt;This Minireview offers a comprehensive overview of Type-I photodynamic therapy and outlines two design strategies for Type-I photodynamic agents: thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block Type-II excitation energy transfer, and kinetic optimization of photoinduced electron/hydrogen transfer processes to enhance Type-I pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type-I photodynamic agents can not only produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, but also directly damage biomolecules through electron/hydrogen transfer process, exhibiting reduced dependence on oxygen concentration in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The rational design of Type-I photodynamic agents has attracted increasing attention. This minireview provides a comprehensive overview of Type-I PDT and its advantages in treating hypoxic tumors. It systematically outlines two complementary design strategies: i) thermodynamic modulation through molecular engineering to block the Type-II energy transfer pathway, and ii) kinetic enhancement of electron/hydrogen transfer to favor the Type-I mechanism. Finally, key challenges in Type-I PDT are discussed, and future perspectives are highlighted to facilitate the clinical translation of Type-I photodynamic agents. We hope this review will stimulate further progress in the development of innovative PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Visible light&#8208;driven photochemistry has advanced significantly, offering diverse methodologies in synthetic organic chemistry. Photocatalysis using red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light is particularly notable due to its lower energy, reduced phototoxicity, minimized side reactions, and deeper penetration into reaction media. This minireview summarizes recent developments in red&#8208; and NIR&#8208;mediated photocatalysis, emphasizing radical generation and reactive intermediates for organic synthesis. Applications in small&#8208;molecule activation, polymer chemistry, and biologically relevant transformations are discussed, highlighting the growing potential of these photochemical processes in fundamental and applied chemistry.








Abstract
The field of visible light&#8208;mediated photochemistry has experienced significant growth, leading to the development of a wide array of methodologies in synthetic organic chemistry. In particular, photocatalysis by using long&#8208;wavelength light such as red and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light has garnered substantial attention. These strategies have inherent benefits of low energy, including minimal health hazards, less side reactions, and increased penetration through diverse reaction media. In this minireview, we present an overview of recent advancements in red&#8208; and NIR light&#8208;induced photocatalysis for the generation of various radicals and key intermediates in organic synthesis. Additionally, this minireview will recount the application of small&#8208;molecule activation, polymer science, and bio&#8208;related aspects to offer a comprehensive framework and insight of photochemistry mediated by red and NIR light.

Porous conductive ion&#8208;selective membranes (PCIMs) enable low&#8208;resistance, high&#8208;selectivity ion transport in sustainable energy devices. This review explores emerging PCIMs with sub&#8208;nano/nanometer pores, focusing on ion transport mechanisms, key pore characteristics, and design strategies. It also highlights advances in PCIM applications, including fuel cells, flow batteries, and Li&#8212;S batteries. By integrating theory with design principles, this review provides insights for optimizing PCIMs and advancing membrane&#8208;based energy technologies.








Abstract
Porous conductive ion&#8208;selective membranes (PCIMs), as key components of sustainable energy devices, have attracted widespread research interest owing to their unique pore structures and properties for achieving low&#8208;resistance high&#8208;ion&#8208;selectivity transport. However, the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency PCIMs remains challenging, and the intricate relationship between the structural properties of PCIMs and its pivotal influence on the performance of energy devices is not well explored. This review focuses on emerging PCIMs with sub&#8208;nano/nanometer pores, particularly their design strategies, and fabrication processes. First, the theorical mechanisms underlying ion transfer in confined pores is comprehensively discussed. Subsequently, the effect of a series of pore characteristics&#8212;including size, charge, geometry, orientation, and durability on ion&#8208;selective transport and their regulation strategies are discussed and summarized. Then, effective and universally known methods for designing and adjusting PCIMs containing intrinsic pores, induced pores, and composite pores are highlighted. Furthermore, the progresses of PCIM applications in emerging electrochemical energy devices including fuel cells, flow batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries, and concentration batteries are summarized. Overall, this review aims to provide a valuable reference for scholars and researchers dedicated to the study of PCIMs, thereby contributing to the ongoing progress in this field.

Ning et&#160;al., have reported a very interesting and promising electrochemical method of 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. The only part of this article that seems to be disputable is the reported mass spectrometry data, namely, the lack of specification of the employed LC&#8208;MS conditions, sometimes the wrong m/z values assigned to the species claimed to be identified, and the lack of the mass spectra of NADH.








Abstract
Recently, Ning et&#160;al., have reported a very interesting and promising electrochemical method of 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. NAD+ forms host&#8211;guest complex with the cucurbit[8]uril anchored to the NiO surface, and then NAD+ approaches the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO, which leads to the effective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. It is reasonable to expect that the method will find practical application in the industrial processes in which 1,4&#8208;NADH is employed, lowering their costs. The only part of the article by Ning et&#160;al., which seems to be disputable, is the reported mass spectrometry data, sometimes a lack of data, as described in detail in this correspondence.

         <title>Photogenerated Holes Induced Deep Sodium Storage of TiO2/CdSe/NFPP Cathode for High&#8208;Efficiency Photorechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;functional TiO2/CdSe/NFPP cathode was designed for photorechargeable sodium batteries. Photogenerated holes from CdSe migrate to NFPP, facilitating efficient sodium deintercalation. The holes&#8208;absorbed film&#8208;forming agent FEC on NFPP causes a thin NaF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase, which effectively suppresses electron tunneling and electrolyte decomposition. The PRSBs deliver high capacity and conversion efficiency (4.34%).








Abstract
Resource&#8208;friendly photorechargeable sodium batteries (PRSBs) integrate energy storage devices with solar cells, offering a promising path for sustainable energy. Herein, a novel TiO2/CdSe/Na3Fe2(PO4)P2O7 (NFPP) cathode was prepared layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer utilizing resource&#8208;abundant commercialized NFPP and photoactive CdSe. The aligned energy levels with type II band structure ensure effective transfer of photogenerated holes from CdSe (&#8722;5.71&#160;eV) to higher valence band of NFPP (&#8722;5.10&#160;eV). Experimental results reveal that, during charging, the induced holes in NFPP accelerate the transition of Fe2+ to Fe3+ with a change of O&#8211;Fe hybrid orbitals. The calculations of bond valence sum and energy distribution reveal that NFPP&#8208;holes possesses broad Na+ transport path with reduced transport barrier (from 0.512 to 0.428&#160;eV), improving Na+ extraction efficiency. Additionally, photogenerated holes could regulate surface charge distribution on NFPP and thus form a film&#8208;forming agent fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)&#8208;dominated electric double layer. Finally, it converts to a thinner (9.75&#160;nm illumination) NaF&#8208;rich cathode interphase layer, avoiding subsequent excessive electrolyte decomposition. As a result, the NFPP under illumination delivers high capacity of 119.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, showing 41.11% improvement compared to dark conditions.

         <title>Multivariate Distribution Structured Anisotropic Inorganic Polymer Composite Electrolyte for Long&#8208;Cycle and High&#8208;Energy All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte with multivariate distribution anisotropic structure was developed. Parts of the vermiculite sheets suspended among the PVDF matrix facilitate lithium salts dissociation and form fast Li+ transport channels. Other parts of vermiculite sheets tiled on electrolyte surface generate dense and high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, improving the interfacial kinetics and suppressing the dendrite growth.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries owing to their favorable rheological properties and interfacial compatibility with cathodes and Li anodes. However, their limited ionic conductivity and low modulus lead to inferior electrochemical performance and dendrite growth. Herein, we developed a composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte comprising vermiculite sheets and a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix with multivariate distribution and an anisotropic structure. Within this assembly, some vermiculite sheets were suspended in the PVDF matrix to facilitate Li salt dissociation and Li+ transport, while others were tiled on the electrolyte surface, generating a dense, high&#8208;modulus Li2SiO3&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase via in situ electrochemical reduction, which further improved interfacial kinetics and suppressed dendrite growth. As a result, a high conductivity of 1.38&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 was achieved at room temperature, and the Li||Li cells displayed robust stability over 3000&#160;h. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2||Li full cells delivered a specific capacity of 172&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;C and 86% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 0.5&#160;C. Additionally, practical cycle performance at a high loading (4.4&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) was achieved in pouch cells. Overall, multivariate distribution and anisotropic structuring offers a novel perspective for the preparation of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Scalable Preparation of Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels Based on Hydration Shielding&#8208;Accelerated Redox Self&#8208;Catalytic Polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP) method was first developed for implementing the fast preparation of robust polyzwitterionic hydrogels (PZHs) without external energy at low monomer concentration. HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP shows attractive applications in scalable manufacture of PZHs coatings on diverse substrates, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, as well as excellent sand fixation ability.








Abstract
Traditional synthesis methods for polyzwitterionic hydrogels involve harsh conditions, such as thermal or UV irradiation, prolonged durations, and high monomer concentrations. Herein, we address these challenges at the meantime by proposing a novel chemical method, called hydration&#8208;shielding accelerated self&#8208;catalytic polymerization (HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP), facilitating the preparation of polyzwitterionic hydrogels. The discovery is that polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) chains can generate hydration shielding around hydrated zwitterionic monomers, promoting their effective aggregation and rapid crosslinking polymerization under the assistance of silver ions (Ag+)&#8208;potassium persulfate (S2O82&#8208;) redox catalyst. The HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method performs under mild condition (&#8722;5&#160;&#176;C to 37&#160;&#176;C) without extra energy, overcomes the critical monomer polymerization concentration limitation (wt%: 0.3%), and completes within an ultrashort polymerization time (&lt;60&#160;s). The prepared polyzwitterionic hydrogels possesses a denser network and superior mechanical properties compared to those prepared by traditional thermal/UV methods, exhibiting good antiswelling behavior, excellent lubrication performance, and significant antibacterial and anti&#8208;fouling properties. These significant advances endow HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP with attractive application potentials in manufacturing functional hydrogel coatings for biomedical device, in situ encapsulation of thermally sensitive materials, and excellent sand fixation abilities. Moreover, HS&#8208;A&#8208;RP method is suitable for scalable manufacture and decorative coating of polyzwitterionic hydrogels on diverse substrates in extreme environmental conditions.

         <title>Imine Reductase&#8211;Catalyzed Remote Stereocontrol for Enantiodivergent Synthesis of Cyclohexylidene&#8208;Based Axially Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic route for the enantiodivergent synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines was developed. This method features imine reductase catalyzed remote stereocontrol in establishing the unusual axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond, providing both enantiomers of chiral products in high yield with high enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines exhibit unique axial chirality arising from the restricted double bond and have shown great potential in medicinal chemistry. However, their asymmetric synthesis remains challenging due to the long distance between the chirally relevant groups. Herein, we report a highly efficient and asymmetric synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axially chiral amines from 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones and primary amines catalyzed by imine reductases (IREDs). Enantiodivergent IREDs were identified to provide convenient access to both enantiomers of chiral products with high yields and enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield, 99:1 or 1:99 enantiomeric ratio). A gram&#8208;scale synthesis of cyclohexylidene&#8208;based amines was also achieved. Moreover, protein X&#8208;ray crystallography and molecular modeling studies were conducted to provide structural insight into the remote stereocontrol of IREDs in generating cyclohexylidene&#8208;based axial chirality.

         <title>Hopping&#8208;Type Charge Transport in Controllably p&#8208;Doped Polaronic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers</title>

This report explores polaron&#8208;based charge transport in controllably p&#8208;type doped 2D polymers. Substoichiometric injection of holes in 2DP lattices leads to the lowest optical bandgaps and maximal electronic conductivities. Variable&#8208;temperature conductivity reveals the existence of hopping&#8208;type transport with two distinct Arrhenius regimes, which may be related to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane directional electronic transport.








Abstract
In this work, we find that controllable p&#8208;type doping leads to Holstein&#8208;type polarons in four electron&#8208;rich two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs). Substoichometrically injecting holes into these 2DPs leads to small optical bandgaps (&lt;1.0&#160;eV) and electrical conductivities (17&#160;mS&#160;m&#8722;1) significantly higher than their undoped analogs. Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy both reveal that this arises from the formation of paramagnetic polarons. We achieve maximal conductivities when 2DPs comprised of electron&#8208;rich nodes and electron&#8208;rich linkers are combined, which is a consequence of more delocalized polarons as unveiled by diffuse&#8208;reflectance UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Variable&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity measurements reveal two distinct Arrhenius regimes in all 2DPs investigated, which we attribute to the different thermally activated processes inherent to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane electronic transport in stacked 2DP multilayers. This resulted in a maximum electronic conductivity of 326 mS m&#8722;1 at an elevated temperature. Collectively, this report provides fundamental insight into polaron&#8208;based charge&#8208;transport in p&#8208;type 2D organic layers, which we expect will form the foundation for the eventual deployment of these materials in electronic devices.

         <title>Selective C2 Electroproduction via Back Bonding in Asymmetric Copper&#8208;Copper Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric CuF&#8208;CuN motifs were engineered through the in situ isostructural substitution method on F&#8208;Cu3N substrates. Unlike the isolated 3dz2&#8208;2pz &#963; bonding between CuN and the *C1 intermediate, CuF establishes an additional 3dxz&#8208;2pz &#960; back bonding interaction. This synergy induces a charge&#8208;polarized 2*CHO adsorption configuration, concurrently enhancing coupling kinetics and C2 selectivity through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions.








Abstract
CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is considered a highly attractive approach to reduce carbon emissions and yet encounters challenges in further converting *C1 intermediates to valuable two&#8208;carbon (C2) products. Although copper&#8208;based catalysts exhibit satisfactory adsorption energy for *C1 species, the symmetrical charge distribution at adjacent copper sites leads to a strong repulsive force between adsorbed *C1. Herein, asymmetric copper&#8208;copper (CuF&#8208;CuN) motifs with distinct adsorption behaviors have been constructed on the F&#8208;Cu3N substrate using the in situ isostructural substitution method. Compared to the high hybridization of CuN 3d and N 2p orbitals, implanted F not only reduces the hybridization strength but also endows the CuF with delocalized unpaired electrons. Accordingly, CuF, beyond forming an isolated 3dz2&#8208;2pz &#963; bond between Cu and the key *C1 intermediate (*CHO), offers additional 3dxz&#8208;2pz &#960; back bonding to the *CHO. With dipole interactions in the asymmetric CuF&#8208;CuN motifs, the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent *CHO is diminished, efficiently promoting the C&#8208;C coupling in CO2RR. Therefore, the CuF&#8208;CuN motifs achieve an exceptional C2 selectivity of 81.5% with a partial current density of &#8722;325.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a C2/C1 selectivity ratio of 10.47. This nuanced manipulation of atomic interactions illuminates a path to potentially groundbreaking alterations in material characteristics.

         <title>Kinetically Enhanced Access to a Dynamic Polyester Platform via Sequence Selective Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulphur</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare sequence&#8208;selective terpolymerisation of elemental sulphur, aromatic thioanhydrides, and epoxides yields dynamic poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx) polymers. Mechanistic insights reveal a lithium&#8208;catalysed rate enhancement via ester coordination. The resulting polymers are thermally stable, backbone&#8208;editable, and processable into degradable adhesives.








Abstract
Elemental sulphur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, contains preformed dynamic sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds promising to impart dynamicity onto polymers obtained from this monomer. Yet robust methodologies to access linear polymers with tuneable properties and functionality are rare. Addressing these problems, we here report a rare sequence selective terpolymerisation of elemental sulphur with aromatic thioanhydrides and epoxides under simple lithium alkoxide catalysis yields semi&#8208;aromatic poly(ester&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx). This enables access to terpolymers from a greatly improved range of epoxide comonomers compared to previous methodologies, including industrially relevant, flexible, rigid, functional and natural product&#8208;derived variants, allowing tuning of glass transition temperatures across a Tg range of&#160;&gt;150 &#176;C. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the insertion of S8 leads to an unusual rate acceleration via coordinative participation of the polyester links sitting adjacent to the propagating chain end. The thermal stability of the polymers allows for post polymerisation backbone modification via &#9472;S&#9472;S&#9472; bond metathesis. After crosslinking, these can be applied as thermally reprocessable and acid degradable adhesives. Our contribution paves the way for the rational buildup of diverse and functional polymer structures from elemental sulphur waste.

         <title>Electronically Asynchronous Transition State Tuned from Remote Site for Oxygen Atom Transfer by CuII&#8211;Nitrite Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the occurrence of electronically asynchronous transition state in oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reaction by CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722; complexes (1&#8722;4) controlled from remote site. OAT reactivity was found to be linearly correlated with &#160;&#946;&#8208;LUMO and Cu(II)/(I) redox potentials, which were tuned from remote site substituents. Mechanistic study indicates asynchronous electron transfer mechanism where CuII/I reduction precedes nitrite reduction. 








Abstract
Nitrite (NO2&#8722;) reduction to nitric oxide (NO) is of paramount interest in biology. In biology, Cu&#8211;nitrite reductase reduces NO2&#8722;&#160;to NO, while alternatively NO2&#8722;&#160;can be reduced to NO at copper center via oxygen atom transfer (OAT) to electron&#8208;rich substrate like PPh3. This work demonstrates systematic tuning of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy by remote site modification, which leads to systematic change in electrochemical property and OAT activity of CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722;&#160;involving electronically asynchronous transition state. For this purpose, we report here four CuII&#8211;NO2&#8722; complexes: [CuII(LCH2)(NO2)(ClO4)] (1), [CuII(LO)(NO2)(ClO4)] (2), [CuII(LCH2Me)(NO2)(ClO4)] (3), [CuII(LOMe)(NO2)(ClO4)] (4) with similar primary coordination spheres but different substituents at remote sites. In going from 1 to 4, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy, which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh3 resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for 4 compared to 1. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism that was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from 1 to 4 is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states, which was controlled from remote site modification.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; complexes: [Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;CH2&lt;/sub&gt;)(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;)(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;CH2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;)(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), [Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;)(NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) with similar primary coordination spheres but different substituents at remote sites. In going from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, by remote site substitution, there is systematic stabilization of LUMO energy, which correlates linearly with the increased OAT to PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; resulting in 130 times reactivity enhancement for &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; compared to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. This kind of significant reactivity enhancement by tuning LUMO energy from remote site is very rare. Mechanistic study involving experimental and computational study reveals asynchronous mechanism that was hitherto not reported for any OAT. The observed increase in OAT reactivity from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; is attributed to an increase in the extent of asynchronicity in corresponding transition states, which was controlled from remote site modification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Layered&#8208;Spinel Heterogeneous Structure and Oxygen Vacancies Enable Superior Electrochemical Performance for Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial layer of layered&#8208;spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies was formed on the surface of LRMOs, which improved the structural stability and the reversibility of anion redox reaction. The treated cathode features high initial capacity of 314.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a coulombic efficiency of 88.3%. When cycling at 1&#160;C, the cathode shows a high capacity retention of 87.9% with a small voltage decay of 1.26&#160;mV per cycle.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) materials are considered to be the next&#8208;generation cathode for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion/metal batteries owing to their superior specific capacity, high operation voltage, and low cost. However, the commercial application of LRMOs is constrained by the surface structure degradation and lattice oxygen release, resulting in low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and rapid voltage and capacity decay. Herein, we propose a facile sorbic acid&#8208;assisted surface treatment strategy to construct homogeneous multifunctional interface layers composed of layered&#8208;spinel heterogeneous structure and oxygen vacancies on the surface of LRMOs, which enhance the structure stability and improve the activity and reversibility of the anionic oxygen redox reactions. The multifunctional interfacial layers effectively suppress irreversible oxygen release and alleviate unfavorable layered&#8208;spinel phase transformation. As a consequence, the treated LRMOs cathode displays improved ICE of 88.3%, high capacity retention rate (87.9% at 1&#160;C after 150 cycles) and low voltage decay ratio (1.26&#160;mV per cycle). These findings provide a valuable new idea to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRMOs through multi&#8208;strategy synergistic interface engineering techniques.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting, Vacancy&#8208;Rich HxIrOy Nanosheets for the Fabrication of Low&#8208;Ionomer&#8208;Dependent Anode Catalyst Layer in PEM Water Electrolyzer</title>

Cation vacancies&#8208;rich, 1&#160;nm&#8208;thick &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy nanosheets with both high catalytic activity and high protonic conductivity have been prepared. This bifunction integration enables the fabrication of a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent catalyst/ionomer layer for efficient proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.








Abstract
The anode catalyst layer is composed of catalytically functional IrOx and protonic conducting ionomer and largely dictates catalytic performance of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, we report a new type of anode nanocatalyst that possesses both IrOx&#8217;s catalytic function and high proton conductivity that traditional anode catalysts lack and demonstrate its ability to construct high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer, the interior of which&#8212;about 85% of total catalyst layer&#8212;is free of ionomers. The proton&#8208;conducting anode nanocatalyst is prepared via protonation of layered iridate K0.5(Na0.2Ir0.8)O2 and then exfoliation to produce cation vacancy&#8208;rich, 1&#160;nm&#8208;thick iridium oxide nanosheets (labeled as &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy). Besides being a proton conductor, the &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy is found to have abundant catalytic active sites for the oxygen evolution reaction due to the optimization of both edge and in&#8208;plane iridium sites by multiple cation vacancies. The dual functionality of &#9633;&#8208;HxIrOy allows the fabrication of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading, low&#8208;ionomer&#8208;dependent anode catalyst layer with enhanced exposure of catalytic sites and reduced electronic contact resistance, in contrast to common fully mixed catalyst/ionomer layers in PEMWE. This work represents an example of realizing the structural innovation in anode catalyst layer through the bifunctionality of anode catalyst.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Base Electrolyte Additive Mediates Interfacial Chemistry for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A feasible ether&#8208;based electrolyte incorporating methylmagnesium chloride as a Lewis&#8208;basic additive is proposed to regulate interfacial chemistry. This electrolyte plays a crucial role in promoting a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase formation and enhancing Li deposition, achieved through the bifunctional effects of anion&#8208;additive interactions. The designed electrolyte contributes to the superior cycling stability of Li metal anodes.








Abstract
Electrolytes play a crucial role in regulating interfacial chemistry, which is essential for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, we present an ether&#8208;based electrolyte system incorporating the simplest Grignard reagent, CH3MgCl, as an additive. This additive, endowed with Lewis&#8208;base characteristics, enhances the stability of the anode&#8208;electrolyte interface through bifunctional effects. During Li deposition, CH3Mg+ preferentially adsorbs onto the electrode surface, attracting more anions into the Helmholtz layer. Concurrently, CH3&#8722; creates an electron&#8208;rich environment, facilitating nucleophilic attacks on anions and promoting its reduction to form an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Additionally, Mg2+ undergoes electrodeposition prior to Li+, forming a Li&#8208;Mg alloy with subsequently deposited Li. This process lowers the nucleation barrier for Li deposition, resulting in improved deposition uniformity. Accordingly, the designed electrolyte demonstrates excellent cycling stability for Li anodes in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cells and full&#8208;cells paired with LiFePO4 cathodes. Notably, Li||LiFePO4 batteries using a thin&#8208;film Li anode pre&#8208;deposited on Cu retain &#8764;92.84% of their initial capacity after 300 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;99.74%. These findings highlight the critical role of additives in engineering interfacial chemistry and provide a promising strategy for designing advanced electrolytes to improve the cycling performance of Li metal batteries.

         <dc:description>
The table of contents (TOC) figure provides a visual overview of the key innovations and findings of this study on high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The single&#8208;solvent electrolyte composed of 2.3&#160;M lithium salt in tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), which enables stable LMB operation at ultra&#8208;high voltages up to 5.0&#160;V.

Abstract
The urgent need for high energy density (&gt; 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) has driven advancements in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes. However, degradation of traditional electrolytes restricts high cut&#8208;off voltage&#160;&lt;&#160;4.4&#160;V, while low lithium transference numbers (tLi+) lead to polarization and early charge/discharge termination, which typically necessitate use of multiple solvents or salt&#8208;concentrated electrolytes to enable high&#8208;voltage chemistry. To address this challenge, we developed a single&#8208;solvent, single&#8208;salt electrolyte with tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate (TFEP), achieving a high tLi+ of 0.78 and enabling ultra&#8208;high&#8208;voltage LMB operation up to 5.0&#160;V. Large molecular sterics and electron density delocalization of TFEP enabled dominant presence of local aggregates (AGGs), which further populated to form large and ion&#8208;rich weakly&#8208;solvating nanometric aggregates (n&#8208;AGGs), changing redox properties and promoting the interfacial stabilities to a greater extent. As a result, we showed suppressed dendrite formation with stable cycling for over 1500 h, and full&#8208;cell operations paired with LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811) at 4.7&#160;V and with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) at 5.0&#160;V. The tuning of bulk electrolyte properties from the scale of microscopic electronic structures to mesoscopic solvation structures has effectively enhanced thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the electrolyte, paving the way for LMBs with high&#8208;voltage tolerance.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Post&#8208;CO Intermediates to Decode C&#9472;C Coupling Pathways in CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance Raman spectroscopy (RRS) was used to observe the in situ CO2 electroreduction process by designing copper electrodes with unique structures. This dynamic observation allowed for the capture of the C&#9472;C coupling process, where CH2 asymmetrically couples with CO to form CH2CO. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) has emerged as a promising strategy for sustainable energy conversion and carbon utilization. Despite intensive research efforts, the understanding of intermediates and pathways leading from CO2RR to multicarbon (C2+) chemicals remains incomplete. The challenge is to gain insight into the activation of adsorbed CO and the subsequent pathways. Here, we design a specially tailored Cu nanowire array facing a hydrophobic interface as an electrode to highly enhance Raman signals in the in situ environment, allowing sensitive observation of the sequential change of various elusive intermediates during CO2RR, such as CO, CH2, CO coexisting with CH2, CH2CO, and CH3. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the C&#9472;C coupling during CO2RR originates from an asymmetric coupling between CH2 and CO to form CH2CO, identified as the rate&#8208;determining step in the formation of C2+ products. These findings deepen the understanding of the C&#9472;C coupling processes, which are crucial for advancing catalyst development in electrochemical CO2 upgrading.

Evaluating the synergetic effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on the interaction between Na+ and anion balances stable interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity in non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes. Developed electrolytes enable high&#8208;energy pouch cell achieving a capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at the current density of 2C.








Abstract
Safety hazard induced by flammable electrolytes are troubling the advancement of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Non&#8208;flammable phosphate electrolytes are competent to address this issue, yet current designs struggle to balance the interfacial chemistry and high ionic conductivity due to the untamed interaction between Na+ and anion. Herein, we evaluate the effect of dielectric constant (DC) and binding energy (Ea) of solvents on this interaction, revealing a systematic approach to achieve desired designs. It is shown that incorporating solvents with high DC and moderate Ea forms anion&#8208;rich solvation structure for stabilizing the anode interface and achieving necessary salt dissociation for high ionic conductivity. Specifically, propylene carbonate is incorporated as the eligible solvent into triethyl phosphate, affording non&#8208;flammable electrolytes with low cost and high ionic conductivity of 6.22&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Consequently, 1.25&#160;Ah hard carbon (HC)|NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) pouch cell delivers a high&#8208;power discharge of 5C rate and maintains an impressive capacity retention of 87.1% after 700 cycles at 2C rate. Moreover, 6.61&#160;Ah HC|NFM pouch cell with 152.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 avoids smoke production and volume expansion during nail penetration. This work discloses an advanced strategy for deigning practical phosphate electrolytes, paving the way for developing high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Crystal&#8208;Structure and Active&#8208;Site of Defective ZnAl&#8208;Catalysts During CO2 Photoreduction</title>

The combination of operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning probe spectroscopy has been conducted to correlate dynamic crystal&#8208;structure and active&#8208;site evolutions with CO2 reduction activity on defective ZnAl&#8208;LDH photocatalysts. 








Abstract
Understanding of surface defects of a catalyst during the reaction process is critical to establish an accurate structure&#8208;activity relationship. Herein, combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction/photoelectron spectroscopy with scanning probe microscope, we have first established the correlations between CO2 photoreduction activities and crystal&#8208;structure/active&#8208;site of defective ZnAl layered double hydroxides (ZnAl&#8208;LDH). Specifically, the introduction of oxygen vacancies in ZnAl&#8208;LDH could effectively promote the selective adsorption of both CO2 and H2O molecules on surface Al and Zn active sites, respectively, leading to opposite transition states and the evident shrinking of crystalline structures. Under light irradiation, the adsorbed CO2 molecules transformed into *COOH intermediate on surface Al active sites, while the H2O molecules dissociated into OH group on Zn sites to provide proton, simultaneously leading to the expansion of crystalline structures and increase of layer spacing. Accordingly, these defect&#8208;dependent evolutions of surface active sites and crystalline structure contributed to the significant improvement of CO2 reduction to CO activity (17.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), much higher than that of pristine ZnAl&#8208;LDH (6.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work provides new insights for in&#8208;depth understanding of the electronic and crystalline changes of defective photocatalysts during the reaction process.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyl Amination of Olefins via Radical&#8208;Polar Crossover at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed tandem radical Heck/allylic amination of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with 1,3&#8208;butadienes and enynes at room temperature to yield &#947;&#8208;lactams. Unlike previous alkyl Heck reactions, this transformation generates hybrid alkyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical and a transposed &#960;&#8208;allyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical under ambient conditions.








Abstract
In contrast to traditional ground&#8208;state palladium&#8208;catalyzed alkyl Heck reactions, which are thermodynamically unfavorable and endothermic, excited&#8208;state palladium catalysis facilitates single&#8208;electron mechanisms, with light primarily driving the formation of alkyl radicals from triplet&#8208;state Pd(0). Here, we report a novel and mechanistically distinct Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction, where the key hybrid alkyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical intermediate is generated by the halogen atom transfer (XAT) from alkyl bromide to the Pd(0) at room temperature, without the need for photoinitiation. This hybrid species engages in the addition to dienes and conjugated enynes, producing a transposed open&#8208;shell allyl Pd(I)&#8208;radical, which undergoes radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC) to yield the desired products. Density functional theory (DFT) studies offer insights into the reaction mechanism, confirming the involvement of hybrid alkyl/allyl Pd(I) radical species as key intermediates.

Human H ferritin (HuHf) is a nanocarrier for anticancer metal drugs. By cryo&#8208;EM, a 1.51&#160;&#197; structure of its adduct with Au(NHC)Cl was solved, showing a novel tetranuclear gold(I) cluster bound to Cys90 and Cys102. Short inter&#8208;metal distances indicate aurophilic interactions. This study highlights the power of cryo&#8208;EM in examining metal&#8208;drug&#8211;protein interactions using the strong signal of transition metal ions.








Abstract
Human H ferritin (HuHf) has excellent potential as a nanocarrier for the selective delivery of anticancer metal&#8208;based drugs to tumor cells. Here, we addressed the interaction of the gold monocarbene compound Au(NHC)Cl with HuHf by electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS)&#160;measurements, which provide the metalation state of the protein subunits and demonstrate the involvement of protein cysteines in gold binding. The adduct between Au(NHC)Cl and HuHf was studied by cryo&#8208;EM measurements, resulting in a high&#8208;resolution 3D density map at 1.51&#160;&#197;. The cryo&#8208;EM structure shows a novel tetranuclear gold(I) cluster, located in a surface pocket of each subunit where it is bound to Cys90 and Cys102. The short inter&#8208;metal distances are diagnostic of the occurrence of aurophilic interactions. The present work demonstrates the usefulness of cryo&#8208;EM to investigate the interactions between metal&#8208;based drugs and their protein targets/carriers, also leveraging the strong signal of transition metal ions.

         <title>In Situ Studies of Multi&#8208;Carrier Dynamics in Electrochemically&#8208;Charged Colloidal CdSe/CdS Core/Shell Quantum Dots</title>

Electrochemically charging colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) enables the study of the intrinsic multi&#8208;carrier dynamics in quantum dots (QDs) by in situ ultrafast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, revealing the spin blockade effect and phonon bottleneck effect for hot electron cooling and allowing mechanism studies of charged QDs in various applications.








Abstract
The application of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) in optoelectronic devices and photocatalysis inevitably involves them in charged states. The carrier and exciton dynamics of electrochemically charged NCs in solutions have yet to be reported. Herein, the electrochemical charging effects in colloidal CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) are systematically investigated using static spectroelectrochemistry (SEC) and in situ transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. Static SEC reveals the presence of in&#8208;gap trap states from 0.9&#160;eV below the conduction band (CB) edge. Negligible changes in TA spectra and kinetics were observed from open circuit potential (OCP) to more anodic potentials within the QD band gap. At cathodic potentials, the negatively charged QDs show band edge trion decay with a lifetime of 690&#160;&#177;&#160;31&#160;ps and slower 1P to 1S electron relaxation with time constants of 12.4&#160;&#177;&#160;0.8&#160;ps assigned to the spin blockade effect and 316&#160;&#177;&#160;35&#160;ps assigned to the phonon bottleneck effect. Our study reveals rich effects of charging on QD excited state under nearly native conditions.

This manuscript demonstrates the copolymerization of Se/CO/OX to yield the well&#8208;defined poly(selenocarbonate) that can be easily converted into the poly(selenoether) via the O/Se exchange reaction.








Abstract
The incorporation of selenium (Se) atoms into polymers has garnered significant interest. However, methods to introduce selenium atoms into polymers remain limited, particularly for approaches that directly utilize elemental selenium. This work presents a novel copolymerization of gaseous carbon monoxide (CO), solid Se powder, and liquid oxetane (OX) to synthesize Se&#8208;containing polymers with tunable structure, using commercially available alkyl borane and organic bases as the binary metal&#8208;free catalyst system. The polymerization process includes two steps: the reduction of CO and Se to form COSe and alternating copolymerization of COSe with OX. The O/Se exchange reaction (O/Se ER) was discovered during the polymerization, which can alter the polymer structure. The O/Se ER could be significantly suppressed by the binary organocatalyst system at 60 &#176;C, affording well&#8208;defined poly(selenocarbonate) in a fast and selective manner. The poly(selenocarbonate) is semi&#8208;crystalline exhibiting a melting temperature of 116 &#176;C, a number&#8208;average molecular weight of 39&#160;kDa, a tensile strength of 5.0&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;MPa, and an elongation of 5.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5%. Interestingly, the poly(selenocarbonate) could be completely converted into the poly(selenoether) by utilizing the O/Se ER, i.e., decarboxylation in the presence of organic bases at high temperatures. This work provides an efficient synthetic method for synthesizing Se&#8208;containing polymers from readily available monomers.

         <title>Boosting Current Density of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction using Metal&#8211;Enzyme Hybrid Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;enzyme (M&#8208;bCA) hybrid platform integrates highly stabilized and densely loaded bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) immobilized on CNTs with Sn and Bi catalysts. The enzyme dynamically catalyzes the reversible interconversion between CO2 and bicarbonate, enabling rapid local CO2 regeneration at the catalyst surface. This enhanced CO2 supply boosts CO2RR current densities beyond mass transfer limits.








Abstract
As a promising solution to global warming, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to liquid fuel has attracted great attention. A primary challenge in industrializing CO2RR technologies for producing liquid fuel is the mass transfer limitation of CO2, which significantly reduces the current density of CO2RR. This study proposes a new enzyme&#8208;enhanced electrocatalysis platform for boosting CO2RR current density. This platform integrates an enzyme of bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA), stabilized on carbon nanotubes (bCA@CNT), into formate/formic acid selective metal catalysts such as tin (Sn) and bismuth (Bi) to prepare Metal&#8208;bCA (M&#8208;bCA) hybrid cathodes. The incorporation of bCA enhances both the CO2 hydration and the reversible dehydration of bicarbonate to CO2 in the cathode. This dynamic catalysis of bCA facilitates rapid local regeneration of dissolved CO2 from bicarbonate at the catalyst surface, thereby boosting the current density of CO2RR. Consequently, the formate current density of the Sn&#8208;bCA cathode was 3.3 times higher than that of the bare Sn cathode in a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA)&#8208;type cell.

&lt;p&gt;A metal-enzyme (M-bCA) hybrid platform integrates highly stabilized and densely loaded bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA) immobilized on CNTs with Sn and Bi catalysts. The enzyme dynamically catalyzes the reversible interconversion between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and bicarbonate, enabling rapid local CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regeneration at the catalyst surface. This enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supply boosts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR current densities beyond mass transfer limits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a promising solution to global warming, electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to liquid fuel has attracted great attention. A primary challenge in industrializing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR technologies for producing liquid fuel is the mass transfer limitation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which significantly reduces the current density of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. This study proposes a new enzyme-enhanced electrocatalysis platform for boosting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR current density. This platform integrates an enzyme of bovine carbonic anhydrase (bCA), stabilized on carbon nanotubes (bCA@CNT), into formate/formic acid selective metal catalysts such as tin (Sn) and bismuth (Bi) to prepare Metal-bCA (M-bCA) hybrid cathodes. The incorporation of bCA enhances both the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydration and the reversible dehydration of bicarbonate to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the cathode. This dynamic catalysis of bCA facilitates rapid local regeneration of dissolved CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from bicarbonate at the catalyst surface, thereby boosting the current density of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Consequently, the formate current density of the Sn-bCA cathode was 3.3 times higher than that of the bare Sn cathode in a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA)-type cell. Furthermore, the Bi-bCA cathode achieved an excellent&#160;current density of&#160;442&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 1.5 times higher than the bare Bi cathode, for direct production of highly concentrated (3.4&#160;mol&#160;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) formic acid&#160;in a 3-compartment cell.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Au6Cu2 Clusters with High Electron Affinity and Oxygen&#8208;Mimetic Properties for Hypoxic Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

[Au6Cu2(C2C6H4X)6(PPh2C6H4PPh2)3]2+ (X&#160;=&#160;NO2, denoted as NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2; X&#160;=&#160;H, denoted as H&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters were synthesized for radiosensitizing studies. The NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles demonstrated significantly enhanced radiosensitization compared to the H&#8208;Au6Cu2 nanoparticles, attributed to their higher electron affinity, which increases hypoxic cytotoxicity and mimics the oxygen effect by reacting with DNA free radicals. 








Abstract
Hypoxia&#8208;induced radioresistance primarily contributes to the failure of radiotherapy because it hinders the effective fixation of DNA damage. Despite the considerable antitumor activity of chemical molecules such as electron&#8208;affinic nitroimidazoles affirmed by clinical studies, their dose&#8208;dependent side effects and low radiotherapy efficacy have become major drawbacks. In this study, we synthesized nitrobenzene&#8208;functionalized Au6Cu2 (NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2) clusters, integrating metal clusters with chemical radiosensitizers. The ligand 4&#8208;nitrophenylacetylene's hypoxia&#8208;selective toxicity arises from reductase&#8208;mediated radical generation under hypoxia, depleting GSH and compromising radiotherapy ROS clearance. Our findings indicate that the electron affinity of interfacial ligands has a significant effect on the electron affinity and hypoxic cytotoxicity of metal clusters. Experimental results demonstrated that NO2&#8208;Au6Cu2 clusters exhibit a high sensitization enhancement ratio by leveraging the properties of gold clusters to augment radiotherapy and the oxygen&#8208;mimetic property of chemical molecules to impair DNA repair pathways. This research introduces a novel strategy for developing highly efficient metal cluster&#8208;based hypoxic radiosensitizers.

         <title>Proton Driving Mechanism Revealed in Sulfur&#8208;Doped Single&#8208;Atom FeN2O2 Carbon Dots for Superior Peroxidase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that sulfur doping in FeN2O2 single&#8208;atom carbon dots induces a proton driving mechanism, significantly enhancing peroxidase&#8208;like activity. This mechanism facilitates H2O dissociation and proton transfer, providing an ample supply of H* for the conversion of H2O2 to&#183;OH, as verified through KIE, in situ experiments, and DFT calculations. 








Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;doped single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAEs) hold great promise as enzyme mimics, yet their catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that the proton driving mechanism induced by sulfur doping in single&#8208;atom FeN2O2 carbon dots (S&#8208;FeCDs) significantly enhances peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity. Synthesized via low&#8208;temperature carbonization, S&#8208;FeCDs exhibit FeN2O2 coordination with sulfur in the second shell, as confirmed by XAFS and AC&#8208;STEM. The POD&#8208;specific activity of S&#8208;FeCDs reached 295&#160;U mg&#8722;1, which is 11.2&#8208;fold higher than that of sulfur&#8208;free FeCDs, with natural enzyme&#8208;like kinetics. In situ experiments, kinetic and mechanistic studies revealed that sulfur doping promotes H2O dissociation, enhances H+ adsorption, reduces the &#916;G for H2O2&#8208;to&#8208;&#183;OH conversion. DFT revealed a lowered energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (2*OH&#160;&#8594;&#160;*O&#160;+&#160;*H2O) from 2.50 to 1.62&#160;eV. In vivo, S&#8208;FeCDs demonstrated broad pH efficacy in MRSA&#8208;infected wound models, achieving near&#8208;complete healing within 7 days. The proton driving mechanism was further validated through nitro compound reduction, demonstrating accelerated N&#9472;H bond activation. This work highlights the critical role of sulfur&#8208;induced proton dynamics in enhancing SAEs performance, providing a rational strategy for designing multifunctional nanozymes in biomedical and catalytic applications.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Antimicrobial Based on Conjugated Oligoelectrolyte and Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of supramolecular antimicrobials was developed by forming host&#8208;guest inclusion complexes between conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) and cyclodextrins. This supramolecular strategy enhanced COEs' biocompatibility without sacrificing antimicrobial efficacy, offering a new antibiotic design platform to address the typical trade&#8208;off between efficacy and selectivity in amphiphilic antimicrobials and combat antimicrobial resistance.








Abstract
The escalating global threat of antimicrobial resistance necessitates the development of new antimicrobial agents. In this study, we prepared a resveratrol&#8208;derived antimicrobial conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) named DY6 to enhance drug&#8208;like properties. While DY6&#8217;s increased hydrophobicity augmented its antibacterial efficacy, it also induced significant cytotoxicity, highlighting the long&#8208;existing dilemma of amphiphilic antimicrobials. To mitigate this issue, we employed a supramolecular strategy by complexing DY6 with sodium sulfobutyl ether &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (S&#946;CD), forming the host&#8211;guest inclusion complex DY6@S&#946;CD. This complex elevated the half&#8208;maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against L929 cells from 9.4 to over 128&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 while maintaining a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). NMR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopic analyses confirmed that DY6&#8217;s aromatic backbone is encapsulated within the hydrophobic cavity of S&#946;CD. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that size compatibility and electrostatic interactions are essential for stable complex formation and enhanced biocompatibility. Importantly, DY6@S&#946;CD exhibited no resistance development over 14&#8208;day serial passages against S. aureus, significantly outperforming norfloxacin. In biofilm&#8208;based MRSA&#8208;infected wound and corneal models, DY6@S&#946;CD more effectively reduced bacterial load and inflammation compared to the last&#8208;resort antibiotic vancomycin. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of supramolecular host&#8211;guest approach based on COEs to overcome the drug&#8208;resistant challenges.

         <title>Liquid Coordination Polymers with Anhydrous Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional liquid coordination polymers near ambient conditions are prepared by introducing H3PO4 as a network modifier. This process disrupts extended coordination networks, producing a stable liquid. Liquid properties are controlled by tuning the ratio of network modifiers, resulting in anhydrous proton conductivity up to 27 mS cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and viscosities ranging from 18.8 to 105.9 Pa&#183;s at 303&#160;K.








Abstract
Liquid states in coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically considered transient intermediates in the crystal&#8208;to&#8208;glass transformations of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. However, their potential as functional materials has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by the unique properties of ionic liquids, organic liquids, and liquid metals, we explore liquid CPs as a platform for novel functionalities distinct from those of their crystalline and glass counterparts. Here, we present a strategy to achieve functional liquid CPs near ambient conditions by introducing H3PO4 as a network modifier, shifting compositions away from stoichiometric ratios. This process disrupts extended coordination networks during melting, producing a stable liquid state. By tuning the ratio of network modifiers, we achieve control over liquid properties, including anhydrous proton conductivity up to 27 mS cm&#8722;1 at 353&#160;K and viscosities ranging from 18.8 to 105.9 Pa&#183;s at 303&#160;K. These findings demonstrate the transformative potential of liquid CPs, introducing them as a new platform for designing liquid conductors.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Interface Engineering and Additive&#8208;Induced Crystallinity Tuning for High&#8208;Performance Thermally Conductive Polymer Composites</title>

         <dc:description>
A tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen (TRM) is used to develop a TRM polymer matrix (TPM) with excellent thermal conductivity and interfacial affinity with boron nitride (BN) and expanded graphite (EG). Fabricated TPM composites, which are thermally and chemically stable, can be selectively used for electrical insulation, conduction, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding.








Abstract
To boost up the properties of thermally conductive polymer composites, it is essential to conduct comprehensive research focused on interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers. Hexagonal boron nitride (BN) or expanded graphite (EG) are commonly utilized as nanofillers to improve the thermal conductivity of polymer composites. However, the interfacial interactions between the polymer matrix and nanofillers are generally weak, making effective thermal conductivity challenging. To address this issue, we have designed and synthesized an electron&#8208;rich and aromatic tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen (TRM), which not only possesses high thermal conductivity but also exhibits excellent interfacial affinity with BN and EG at the molecular level. Systematic experiments, including photophysical, thermodynamic, structural, and computational analyses, reveal that the thermal conductivity of TRM&#8208;based polymer composites is substantially enhanced due to effective interfacial interactions between TRM and fillers. The TRM composites experimentally show excellent thermal conductivity based on enhanced interfacial phonon transfer, and these results are supported by theoretical interpretations. These findings underscore the critical importance of interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers at the molecular level in maximizing the material properties of polymer composites.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Branched PdCoPx Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct synthesis strategy was used to prepare branched Pd1Co2Px nanostructures with rich Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interface sites, demonstrating their efficacy as cathode catalysts for lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). The Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces can direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products, which enhances the stability of LOB cycling. 








Abstract
Developing advanced cathode materials plays a positive role in lowering the charge/discharge overpotentials and improving the cycling performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs). Here we report a direct synthesis strategy to prepare high&#8208;dimensional branched PdCoPx series nanostructures, in which the Pd atoms are well dispersed within cobalt phosphide, leading to rich Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces and evoking a prominent ligand effect between the elements. The Pd1Co2Px exhibits an excellent and stable activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media, with a mass activity of 1.46&#160;A mgPd&#8722;1, far exceeding that of commercial Pd/C (0.12&#160;A mgPd&#8722;1) and Pt/C (0.17&#160;A mgPt&#8722;1). Using Pd1Co2Px as the cathode, the resulting LOB shows an ultralow discharge/charge overpotential of 0.40&#160;V and could run stably for over 240 cycles, which is a significant improvement compared with the counterparts using CoPx and Pd/C cathodes. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results indicate that the dispersed Pd atoms could significantly enhance the ORR kinetics, and the Pd&#9472;Co&#9472;P interfaces could direct the two&#8208;dimensional growth of Li2O2, thereby facilitating the formation of more easily decomposable film&#8208;like Li2O2 products. This feature successfully elevates both the charge and discharge performances, as well as the stability of the LOB.

         <title>Concurrent Production of Glycolic Acid via Anode Valorization of Plastic Paired With Cathode Upcycling of Biomass Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A paired electrolysis system for simultaneous glycolic acid production was constructed through combining anodic oxidation of polyethylene terephthalate hydrolysate and cathodic reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which was enabled by the rational design of a CO&#8208;tolerant PdBi alloy anode and an earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived (PET&#8208;derived) ethylene glycol (EG) into valuable chemicals, such as glycolic acid (GA), provides a sustainable route for reclaiming the carbon resource in plastic wastes. However, valorization of EG to GA is realized solely via anodic oxidation, which is typically accompanied by the generation of low&#8208;value hydrogen at the cathode. Here, we develop a GA production system that combines anodic and cathodic GA production via oxidation of PET&#8208;derived EG paired with reduction of biomass&#8208;derived oxalic acid, which is made possible by the discovery of a robust PdBi alloy anode and earth&#8208;abundant TiO2 cathode. Building on the theoretical understanding and experimental demonstration of anti&#8208;CO poisoning on the PdBi anode and temperature&#8208;dependent GA electrosynthesis on the TiO2 cathode, our integrated electrochemical system achieves a total Faradaic efficiency of 182% for GA production. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrochemical coupling strategy paves the way for high&#8208;efficiency utilization of surplus plastic&#8208;/biomass&#8208;derived feedstocks via renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;driven electrocatalysis.

In alkaline seawater, ruthenium clusters in nitrogen&#8208;doped molybdenum carbide (Ru@NMoC) act as highly efficient catalysts to promote the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveal that nitrogen doping induces electron redistribution around the Ru clusters, optimizing their electronic structure. This enhances the adsorption and desorption of intermediates, accelerating the HER kinetics.








Abstract
Delicate control over electron distribution in hybrid catalysts is crucial for improving hydrogen evolution catalysis, which remains an aspirational target in advancing efficient hydrogen production. Herein, we optimize the local electronic structures and balance the reaction steps by incorporating Ru clusters into nitrogen&#8208;doped molybdenum carbide (denoted as Ru@NMoC), addressing performance limitations in alkaline seawater. The Ru@NMoC catalyst demonstrates ultralow overpotentials of 8, 17, and 20&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 in 1&#160;M KOH, 1&#160;M KOH&#160;+&#160;0.5&#160;M NaCl, and 1&#160;M KOH seawater, respectively, significantly outperforming conventional HER catalysts. Operando spectroscopic techniques reveal strong ability for interface water dissociation and stable local charge structure in Ru@NMoC. Theoretical simulations demonstrate that N&#8208;doping of Ru clusters self&#8208;optimizes their electronic states and lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation. Self&#8208;powered H2 production system can be achieved using Zn&#8211;H&#8322;O batteries to drive anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell, demonstrating its practicability.

         <title>Molecularly Woven Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly woven artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) was constructed by coating woven polymer crystals onto the Li metal anode. The mechanical stability of these woven polymer crystals, combined with their intrinsic Li&#8208;ion channels, enables the resulting lithium&#8208;metal batteries to be dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems, but they suffer from destructive dendrite growth. Here, we integrate cutting&#8208;edge molecular weaving technology into the fabrication of artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEI) to realize dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;lasting LMBs. Specifically, weaving polymer chains into a 2D plane endows polymer network crystals with high strength and elasticity and creates angstrom&#8208;level meshes for Li&#8208;ion transport and uniform deposition. As a result, related Li plating experiments remained stable at an unprecedentedly high current density of 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, full cells with &#8220;woven&#8221; ASEI exhibited superior long&#8208;term cycling performance compared to existing 2D materials, achieving a capacity retention of 98% over 270 cycles under stringent testing conditions.

         <title>Deconstructive Functionalization of Cyclic Ketones via Electrochemical Interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith (IDB) reaction enables the highly regioselective deconstructive functionalization of cyclic ketones using electricity as the sole oxidant. This strategy transforms complex cyclic ketones into acyclic molecules and has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of planococcol, citrilol acetate, maconelliol, and its derivatives. Mechanistic studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover.








Abstract
Deconstructive functionalization of cyclic molecules has recently emerged as a prominent strategy to access unique architectures that are challenging to prepare through traditional methods. While significant progress has been made in the deconstructive functionalization of cyclic alcohols and amines, the strategies for deconstructing cyclic ketones remain largely unexplored. The Dowd&#8211;Beckwith reaction, a ring&#8208;expansion of cyclic ketones, is a powerful method for synthesizing medium&#8208; and large&#8208;ring compounds. Herein, we developed the first interrupted Dowd&#8211;Beckwith (IDB) reaction for highly regioselective deconstructive functionalization of cyclic ketones using electricity as the sole oxidant. This protocol is widely applicable for the deconstruction of small, medium&#8208;sized, and macrocyclic ketones bearing a diverse range of functional groups. Remarkably, various naturally occurring complex cyclic ketones were successfully deconstructed into acyclic molecules, which are difficult to access by known strategies. The method was applied to the asymmetric synthesis of planococcol, citrilol acetate, maconelliol, and its derivatives. Furthermore, the functional groups incorporated during the transformation provided versatile handles for subsequent synthetic modifications. Mechanistic experiments and computational studies support an oxidative radical&#8208;polar crossover followed by deconstructive functionalization.

A new ionic quinoline&#8208;linked COF (iQCOF) was synthesized by combining &#960;&#8208;bridge and charge&#8208;introduction strategy via a one&#8208;pot Povarov reaction. The &#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;linked ionic liquid endow iQCOF enhanced charge transfer ability, fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and higher reaction rate. Thereby, it can be regarded as advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with rapid kinetics to achieve&#160;high&#8208;rate performance and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their well&#8208;defined topologies and tunable pore architectures. However, their practical application is often limited by intrinsically sluggish charge transfer and inferior reaction kinetics. To address these challenges, we develop an ionic quinoline&#8208;linked COF (iQCOF) cathode via a one&#8208;pot Povarov reaction with triazole ionic liquid. The iQCOF architecture achieves a synergistic enhancement by integrating &#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;induced charge delocalization to facilitate charge transport, the specific adsorption effect to gain fast ionic atmosphere dissociation rate, and polar triazine units to enable uniform ion flux for stable interfaces. As a result, iQCOF delivers a high specific capacity of 407 mAh g&#8722;1 with 701&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, and exceptional rate capability (121 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1) with 0.0027% per cycle over 10&#160;000 cycles, further highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;performance organic cathode. This work provides a convenient strategy for advanced COF&#8208;based cathodes with fast reaction kinetics to achieve high&#8208;rate performance, paving the way for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies.

         <title>Regulating Reactive Oxygen Species via Orbital Rehybridization Between Intermediate and Active Site for Selective Methane Photooxidation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique regulation mechanism of reactive oxygen was proposed for selectively photocatalytic conversion of methane to methanol under mild conditions. This new mechanism addresses the contradiction between activity and selectivity faced with the traditional uncontrolled generation of reactive oxygen species by regulating the interaction between active centers and key intermediate.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane (POM) to CH3OH provides a promising pathway for sustainable chemical industry, while uncontrollable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) would proceed at the expense of compromised catalytic activity or selectivity of POM. Herein, we precisely control the type of as&#8208;formed ROS by introducing Au single atoms (SAs) on CuOx/ZnO (Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH3OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d&#8208;band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO&#8208;*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of dz2&#8208;pz and dxz/dyz&#8208;px. This facilitated the dissociation of O&#9472;O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO could also lower the first C&#8211;H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH4 molecules. As a result, Au1&#8208;CuOx/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH3OH productivity of 16856&#160;&#181;mol&#183;gcat.&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions.

&lt;/i&gt;/ZnO (Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/ZnO), to simultaneously achieve high selectivity and productivity of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH in POM. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the introduced Au SAs significantly altered the electronic structure of Cu atoms, leading to an energy level rearrangement of Cu 3d orbital and the upshift of d-band center, which increased the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states of Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/ZnO-*OOH. Thus, the hybridization between Cu active sites and the key intermediate *OOH was significantly enhanced, especially for the orbital hybridizations of d&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-p&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and d&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/d&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-p&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;. This facilitated the dissociation of O&#9472;O to form *OH intermediate rather than the direct desorption of *OOH, thereby ultimately determining the ROS type in aerobic POM. Additionally, the asymmetric electronic structure of Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/ZnO could also lower the first C&#8211;H dissociation energy by structural polarization of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. As a result, Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-CuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/ZnO exhibited an excellent CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH productivity of 16856&#160;&#181;mol&#183;g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 100% selectivity during POM at mild conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing the Quinoidal Form of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by O&#9472;B&#8592;N Units to Give a &gt; 1000 nm Redshift in the Absorption Wavelength</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating four O&#9472;B&#8592;N units into naphthalene diimide, the core is transformed from an aromatic form to a quinoidal form, significantly enhancing &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. This results in a reduced bandgap from 3.10 to 0.88&#160;eV and a redshift in absorption from 400 to 1410&#160;nm. The synthesized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exhibits strong SWIR absorption and high transparency in the visible region, developing a colorless anti&#8208;counterfeiting application.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have distinct chemical structures and excellent optoelectronic properties. Although PAHs with ultra&#8208;large &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons have been successfully synthesized, ultrasmall bandgap (Eg&#160;&lt;&#160;1.2&#160;eV) or short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) light absorption (&#955;&#160;&gt;&#160;1000&#160;nm) is seldom reported for PAHs. In this work, we design and synthesize a PAH by incorporating four O&#9472;B&#8592;N units into naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the core. The incorporation of four O&#9472;B&#8592;N units changes the NDI core from an aromatic form to a quinoidal form, leading to significantly enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. As a result, the optical bandgap of the molecule decreases from 3.10 to 0.88&#160;eV, and the onset absorption wavelength is redshifted from 400 to 1410&#160;nm. The resulting molecule exhibits strong light absorption in the infrared region and high transparency in the visible region. It can be used to develop colorless infrared anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to tune optoelectronic properties of PAHs.

         <title>Quaternary Phosphonium Salts Enable Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Annulative C&#9472;H Activation of Aminophosphines with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed system for P(III)&#8208;directed C&#9472;H activation of aminophosphines and cyclization with alkynes facilitated by deprotonative isomerization, using phosphonium salts as key additives. These salts lower energy barriers, regenerate the catalyst, and protect the P(III) group, enabling stereospecific synthesis of chiral phosphacycles. 








Abstract
Quaternary phosphonium salts, despite their extensive historical study, have remained unexplored as key additives in transition metal catalysis until our current investigation. Here, we present a groundbreaking palladium&#8208;catalyzed system for P(III)&#8208;directed C&#9472;H activation of aminophosphines, followed by annulation with alkynes. By utilizing P&#8208;stereogenic aminophosphines, we have achieved the stereospecific synthesis of chiral phosphacycles. This innovative process, facilitated by deprotonative isomerization, efficiently yields a wide range of P&#8208;heterocycles. The pivotal breakthrough of our methodology lies in the identification of phosphonium salts as effective additives, which undertake multiple functions: they not only reduce the energy barrier of pivotal steps but also regenerate the palladium catalyst while safeguarding the P(III) directing group from oxidation. Through systematic experimental investigations, particularly by comparing transition states with and without quaternary phosphonium salts, we have elucidated the unique reaction pathway, thereby explaining the critical role of the salts.

         <title>Air&#8208;Level Oxygen Enables 100% Selectivity in Urea Synthesis via Photocatalytic C&#9472;N Coupling of CO and Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic coupling reaction of carbon monoxide and ammonia pays a new pathway for urea synthesis under mild conditions. Herein, we proposed a universal O2&#8208;mediated urea generation pathway via the O2&#8226;&#8211; radicals act as the dominant active species to drive the mild NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 radicals, which then coupled with CO as the crucial step for urea production.








Abstract
The clean&#8208;energy&#8208;driven synthesis of urea from carbon&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;containing small molecules has garnered significant interest but remained great challenges to achieve with high selectivity. Herein, we present a photocatalytic pathway for the selective urea synthesis through the oxidative coupling between CO and NH3. The key factor in this process is the atmospheric O2 level, which plays a crucial role in controlling both the urea production rate and its selectivity. Using oxygen&#8208;deficient TiO2 under an air&#8208;level (20%) O2 atmosphere, we achieved a urea generation rate of 54.31&#160;mg gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity. This rate is 38.52 times higher than under oxygen&#8208;free conditions, while further increasing the O2 level significantly reduces selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the process begins with the oxidation of NH3 to &#8226;NH2 through oxidative radicals generated on TiO2, especially the oxygen&#8208;derived O2&#8226;&#8211;. This &#8226;NH2 radicals then couple with CO to form urea. The concentration of radicals is controlled by the O2 level, with the optimal concentration under air&#8208;level O2 enabling efficient NH3 oxidation to &#8226;NH2 while preventing over&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Isoreticular Synthesis of Mesoporous Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra with Permanent Porosity to Gas and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the synthesis of two robust, mesoporous metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (MOCs/MOPs) using an isoreticular expansion approach. Among them, the largest mesoporous MOP captures up to 0.47&#160;gwater&#183;gMOP&#8722;1, displaying an S&#8208;shaped water sorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop.








Abstract
Synthesis of mesoporous metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (MOCs or MOPs) that retain their porous functionality in the solid&#8208;state remains challenging, given their tendency to collapse upon desolvation. Herein, we report the use of the isoreticular expansion approach to synthesize two permanently porous Rh(II)&#8208;based octahedral MOPs within the mesoporous regime. Our mesoporous MOPs, featuring internal cavities of up to 12.5&#160;nm3, withstand the activation process, enabling their use as solid&#8208;state adsorbents for gases and water. In particular, the largest mesoporous MOP, named BCN&#8208;17, captures up to 0.47&#160;gwater&#183;gMOP&#8722;1 and exhibits an S&#8208;shaped water&#8208;sorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop, characteristic of mesoporous materials.

Our mesoporous MOPs, featuring internal cavities of up to 12.5&#160;nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, withstand the activation process, enabling their use as solid-state adsorbents for gases and water. In particular, the largest mesoporous MOP, named BCN-17, captures up to 0.47&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;g&lt;sub&gt;MOP&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibits an S-shaped water-sorption isotherm with a hysteresis loop, characteristic of mesoporous materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PCET Photodecarboxylation for SN2&#8217;&#8208;Type Alkylation of gem&#8208;Dichlorocyclobutenones</title>

A versatile radical SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones is reported by photodecarboxylation of free carboxylic acids via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET). This mild and scalable Csp3&#9472;Csp3 bond forming alkylation method enables efficient access to Csp3&#8208;enriched 4&#8208;alkylated &#945;&#8208;chlorocyclobutenones with excellent functional group tolerance, employing carboxylic acid&#8208;based drugs, fatty acids, and steroids.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with organometallic reagents remained unsuccessful. Herein, we report an acridine&#8208;catalyzed radical SN2&#8217; alkylation of both &#946;&#8208;alkyl and &#946;&#8208;aryl substituted gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with free carboxylic acids. In this process, Csp3&#8208;enriched 4&#8208;alkylated 2&#8208;chlorocyclobutenones are obtained with commendable functionality tolerance. A PCET photodecarboxylation enables for the first time SN2&#8217;&#8208;type alkylation of gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with &#946;&#8208;H&#8208;containing carboxylic acids, addressing several challenges. This mild and scalable Csp3&#9472;Csp3 bond&#8208;forging alkylation applies to the functionalization of natural product&#8208;derived gem&#8208;dichlorocyclobutenones with carboxylic acid drugs, fatty acids, and steroids. The &#945;&#8208;chlorocyclobutenone product is further exploited in divergent organic synthesis via postsynthetic modification.

         <title>Breaking Symmetry of Active Sites in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Valorization of Polyester Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible asymmetric ligand substitution strategy is developed to break symmetric sites on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The obtained defective MIL&#8208;101 (D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101) as a nanozyme featured with asymmetric Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ sites exhibits high performance for photocatalytic depolymerization of polyester plastics.








Abstract
Chemical upcycling of waste plastics offers a promising way toward achieving a circular economy and alleviating environmental pollution but remains a huge challenge. Inspired by hydrolase enzymes and aiming to overcome their intrinsic limitations, we put forward a design principle for an innovative nanozyme featuring asymmetric metal sites. This nanozyme functions as photocatalyst, enabling sustainable valorization of polyester plastics. As a proof of concept, an asymmetric ligand substitution strategy is developed to construct metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that are defective MIL&#8208;101(Fe) (D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101) with asymmetric Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ (0&lt;&#160;&#948;&#160;&lt;1) sites. The differential electronic configurations inherent to adjacent Fe3&#8208;&#948;/Fe3+ sites endow a high photocatalytic activity for the valorization of polyester plastic. Accordingly, the ester bonds of polyesters can be preferentially cleaved, contributing to the low energy barrier of upcycling plastics. As a result, the D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 achieves a high monomer yield with terephthalic acid (TPA) of &#8764;93.9% and ethylene glycol (EG) of &#8764;87.1% for photocatalytic valorization of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET), beyond the efficiency of natural enzymes and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. In addition, such a D&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 is demonstrated to be feasible for the valorization of various real&#8208;world polyester plastic wastes in a flow photocatalysis system.

         <title>Selective Electrocatalytic Hydrodimerization of Acetylene to 1,3&#8208;Butadiene Over Neighboring Cu Dual Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical acetylene hydrodimerization mechanisms are deciphered by correlating the nuclearity of Cu site in Cu&#8208;MOFs with catalytic performance. The neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF orchestrate three critical steps: acetylene adsorption, C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates, and 1,3&#8208;butadiene desorption, which contribute to the superior electrocatalytic selectivity of 1,3&#8208;butadiene.








Abstract
Selective electrocatalytic hydrodimerization of acetylene to 1,3&#8208;butadiene is a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive naphtha steam cracking route, but remains a grand challenge due to competitive acetylene semihydrogenation and oligomerization. Herein, we profoundly investigate the underpinning structure&#8211;performance correlations between diverse nuclear number of Cu sites and acetylene hydrodimerization over benchmark Cu&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts. The operando electrochemical Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopies and theoretical simulations together reveal that single Cu site and double Cu sites are favorable for acetylene semihydrogenation and hydrodimerization, respectively. The as&#8208;designed neighboring Cu dual sites in trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF enable the adsorption of acetylene, subsequent C&#8211;C coupling of *C2H2 and *C2H3 intermediates into 1,3&#8208;butadiene as well as the desorption of 1,3&#8208;butadiene. As a result, the trinuclear Cu3&#8208;MOF affords a 1,3&#8208;butadiene selectivity of 91% and a high 1,3&#8208;butadiene production rate of 64&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is about 2&#8208;fold and 20&#8208;fold higher than Cu2&#8208;MOF and Cu1&#8208;MOF. This work not only provides profound insights into the electrocatalytic mechanism of acetylene hydrodimerization but also guides the rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.

         <title>Lignin Dissolution and Direct Ultrasmall&#8208;Lignin&#8208;Nanoparticle Formation in Acidic and Alkaline Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Molecular&#8208;Level Insight</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural interpretation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how molecular moieties and interaction networks influence the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structures and conformational states of lignin during dissolution and aggregation: laterally shifted in deep eutectic solvents, offset&#8208;stacked in tetrahydrofuran, and stretched in dimethyl sulfoxide.








Abstract
Although deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have demonstrated significant potential in lignin processing, their influence on molecular stacking and conformational evolution during lignin dissolution and nanoparticle formation remains insufficiently understood. Here, we develop a green, straightforward, and single&#8208;step approach to produce self&#8208;assembled lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNPs obtained using the acidic DES method exhibited a great size reduction, with an average size approximately one&#8208;ninth of that produced by conventional solvent&#8208;exchange methods. To gain mechanistic insights into the reconstruction, dissolution, and self&#8208;assembly of lignin in DESs, we integrate structural characterization with molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic behavior and configurational states of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass lignin models (4,182&#160;g mol&#8722;1) in aqueous solvent systems. The results reveal the critical role of molecular structure, intra/intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, stacked conformations, solvent&#8208;specific effects in determining the size and compactness of LNPs. Notably, the DES stabilizes lateral&#8208;shifted configurations, promoting the formation of small and compact LNPs. In contrast, the tetrahydrofuran/H2O solvent system favors offset&#8208;stacked configurations and hydrophobic interactions, leading to larger, spherical LNPs. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of LNP formation using DESs, demonstrating the possibility of regulating and controlling lignin assemblies through solvent parameters.

&lt;p&gt;Structural interpretation and molecular dynamics simulations reveal how molecular moieties and interaction networks influence the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structures and conformational states of lignin during dissolution and aggregation: laterally shifted in deep eutectic solvents, offset-stacked in tetrahydrofuran, and stretched in dimethyl sulfoxide.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have demonstrated significant potential in lignin processing, their influence on molecular stacking and conformational evolution during lignin dissolution and nanoparticle formation remains insufficiently understood. Here, we develop a green, straightforward, and single-step approach to produce self-assembled lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The LNPs obtained using the acidic DES method exhibited a great size reduction, with an average size approximately one-ninth of that produced by conventional solvent-exchange methods. To gain mechanistic insights into the reconstruction, dissolution, and self-assembly of lignin in DESs, we integrate structural characterization with molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we simulate the dynamic behavior and configurational states of high-molar-mass lignin models (4,182&#160;g mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in aqueous solvent systems. The results reveal the critical role of molecular structure, intra/intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, stacked conformations, solvent-specific effects in determining the size and compactness of LNPs. Notably, the DES stabilizes lateral-shifted configurations, promoting the formation of small and compact LNPs. In contrast, the tetrahydrofuran/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvent system favors offset-stacked configurations and hydrophobic interactions, leading to larger, spherical LNPs. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of LNP formation using DESs, demonstrating the possibility of regulating and controlling lignin assemblies through solvent parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen Bonding Tuned Enantioselectivity Control in Cobaloxime&#8208;Chiral Amine Cooperative Catalysis</title>

The dynamically changing hydrogen bonding between the enamine radical cation and cobaloxime controls the enantioselectivity. 








Abstract
Cobaloxime is a versatile 3d&#8208;metal catalyst for dehydrogenative radical coupling reactions. Prior mechanistic studies of cobaloxime catalysis have revealed that cobaloxime(II)&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process can control the site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity of radical transformation. However, the relevance of HAT to the enantioselectivity is seldom reported. Herein, our density functional theory studies of the cobaloxime&#8208;chiral amine co&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective coupling of the enamine radical cation with alkene proved that it is the HAT step that determines the enantioselectivity, instead of the previously proposed radical addition. Because the metal&#8211;alkene&#8208;coupled (MAC) radical addition is a reversible process while the followed by HAT is the rate&#8208;determining step. Moreover, computational studies suggest that the dynamically changing hydrogen bonding between the radical cation and cobaloxime plays a significant role in harnessing the reactivity and tuning the enantiocontrol. The intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen bonding between the iminium and the cobaloxime fragments contributes to the lower energy barrier of MAC radical addition. Structural analysis and quantitative steric&#8208;electronic effect dissection jointly unveiled that the stronger intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the aminium and the cobaloxime fragments is the dominant factor that stabilizes the (R)&#8208;HAT transition state and guarantees high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Fluorination&#8208;Assisted Interfacial Dipole for CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with Over 22% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination&#8208;assisted interfacial dipole engineering is conducted for inorganic CsPbI3 PSCs, which could not only form more robust interfacial contact but also beneficial dipole alignment, leading to effective passivation and prominent energy level adjustment with additional charge transport channels, thus substantially suppressing interfacial energy losses. Consequently, the PSCs show an efficiency of up to 22.05% with superior device stability.








Abstract
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite attracts widespread attention in photovoltaic applications due to its superior thermal stability and optoelectronic properties. However, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still suffer from severe energy losses due to interface nonradiative recombination and undesirable charge carrier transfer, predominantly limiting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, an interfacial dipole engineering is introduced for CsPbI3 PSCs, in which azetidinium chloride (Az) and its fluorinated derivative 3,3&#8208;difluoroazetidinium chloride (DFAz) are employed to manipulate the interface properties of PSCs and thus diminish energy losses. Systematically theoretical calculations and experimental studies reveal that the fluorination&#8208;assisted ammonium molecule could form a stronger interaction with perovskites and thereby arrange the dipole alignment on the superficial layer of perovskites, which could simultaneously ameliorate the passivation effect and energy level alignment of the perovskite and hole transport layers, thereby suppressing interface recombination. Meanwhile, the coordinated bonding between the ammonium and hole transport layer facilitates charge transfer at the heterojunction interface by offering additional carrier transport channels. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs deliver a high efficiency of up to 22.05%. This work provides important design principles of interface engineering for high&#8208;performance solar cells to minimize energy losses.

         <title>Phenylene Cage Synthesized by Metal&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Phenylene Macrocycle and Its Piezofluorochromic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;mediated assembly has been used to synthesize a phenylene cage with a diameter of 2.0&#160;nm. The strained nanocage exhibits intense blue emission and piezofluorochromism, with the fluorescence shifted from blue to yellow&#8211;green under pressure.








Abstract
A phenylene macrocycle containing two meta&#8208;phenylene units positioned opposite each other was used as a building block to construct phenylene cages via platinum&#8208;mediated C&#9472;C coupling. A phenylene cage (PC[10]3), consisting of three phenylene macrocycle units, was successfully synthesized and thoroughly characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. PC[10]3 exhibited significant backbone strain and displayed bright blue emission with a quantum yield of 96%. Additionally, PC[10]3 exhibited a broader and more pronounced piezofluorochromic response compared to its macrocyclic unit, undergoing a distinct photoluminescence shift from blue to yellow&#8211;green under pressure. This work opens new avenues for designing and synthesizing hydrocarbon nanocages.

Multiplexed quantification of small&#8208;molecule binding kinetics to virion&#8208;displayed membrane proteins via charge&#8208;sensitive, wide&#8208;field plasmonic imaging of barcoded nanocomposite oscillators. Virion display maintains native membrane protein environments. Affinity&#8208;resolved multistate DNA barcoding efficiently addresses individual nano&#8208;oscillators and enables measurement of a library of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors on a single chip.








Abstract
A high&#8208;density nano&#8208;oscillator platform using self&#8208;assembled DNA&#8208;barcoded virion sensors is developed to address the critical need for high&#8208;throughput label&#8208;free measurement of small&#8208;molecule binding to membrane proteins. By integrating virion display technology with charge&#8208;sensitive plasmonic detection, our platform enables robust, label&#8208;free quantification of small&#8208;molecule binding kinetics to membrane proteins. Gold nanoparticle&#8208;virion conjugates are self&#8208;assembled onto a plasmonic sensor chip via a flexible molecular linker to form high&#8208;density nano&#8208;oscillators. Driven by an alternating electric field, the oscillation amplitudes of the nano&#8208;oscillators are precisely measured via widefield plasmonic imaging. This charge&#8208;sensitive mechanism can sensitively detect the binding of small&#8208;molecule ligands to the membrane proteins displayed on the virions at single&#8208;nanosensor resolution, overcoming the sensitivity limit of conventional mass&#8208;sensitive techniques. More importantly, the platform employs novel affinity&#8208;discriminated DNA barcodes for multistate decoding with exponential multiplexing capacity, enabling high&#8208;throughput screening of a library of membrane proteins. For a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, binding kinetics of five pairs of G&#8208;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and their corresponding small molecule ligands are measured on a single sensor chip, with all individual nano&#8208;oscillators identified by just two affinity&#8208;discriminated, quadra&#8208;state DNA decoders. This technology advances membrane protein research and drug screening capabilities, offering a practical solution for biomolecular interaction studies and biosensing applications.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Organocatalysis with Bidentate Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a model Mukaiyama aldol reaction with unbiased substrates, high enantioselectivity was achieved with a modifiable bidentate iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen bonding organocatalyst. The crucial role of halogen bonding was confirmed by the low performance of the corresponding hydrogen bond donor and via DFT calculations. 








Abstract
As the employment of &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221; non&#8208;covalent interactions like halogen bonding (XB) in asymmetric catalysis is still at a very early stage, there are significant challenges to overcome. In some reported cases, the relevance of halogen bonding to the catalytic action is unclear, while in others, catalyst activity is limited. Herein, we present the second generation of a bidentate iodine(I)&#8208;based halogen bond donor as a modifiable and highly active chiral halogen bonding catalyst. With these modified derivatives, high stereocontrol of up to 98% ee could be achieved in a model Mukaiyama aldol reaction for a range of different substrates. Importantly, the crucial role of halogen bonding in this catalytic process was demonstrated by the low performance of the non&#8208;iodinated variants and by DFT calculations. The latter also indicate that the stereoinduction is based on the imposed orientation of the substrates towards each other.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Psiguadial A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic approach harnessing reactive species enabled the enantioselective synthesis of the complex meroterpenoid psiguadial A through an enolate&#8211;ortho&#8208;quinone methide (oQM) umpolung strategy and late&#8208;stage cationic ring closure. The final fully decorated aromatic core was successfully synthesized by adaptation of modern aryl methyl ether deprotection and formylation methodologies, establishing efficient access to this class of natural products.








Abstract
The first enantioselective total synthesis of the antiproliferative natural product (&#8211;)&#8208;psiguadial A is reported. This approach features the enantioselective synthesis of a complex tricyclic terpenoid precursor, the union of that precursor with a polyketide component by an enolate&#8208;ortho&#8208;quinone methide coupling reaction to form a highly congested carbon&#9472;carbon bond, and an acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular hydration ring&#8208;closure leveraging a fully substituted alkene to generate the unique oxepane core structure of the natural product.

We show a reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl (BCP)&#8208;thianthrenium reagents and alkyl bromides, which is catalyzed by a copper/photoredox catalyst system. The reaction provides a variety of BCP&#8208;alkylated products through the formation of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond.

         <title>Photoacid&#8208;Induced Supramolecular Network Disassembly: A Systems Approach to Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;responsive supramolecular (SM) materials are attractive for many applications but are difficult to achieve. Here, we report a systems approach that involves blending a hydrogen&#8208;bonded SM network with a photoacid generator. The resulting material displays significant softening upon UV irradiation and functions as an efficient debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand adhesive.








Abstract
The introduction of supramolecular (SM) motifs allows the design of stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers whose physical properties can be changed by external triggers that affect the SM binding. However, using this approach to create light&#8208;responsive materials that can be switched under isothermal conditions proves to be challenging. Here, we report a material systems approach to achieve this. Thus, SM polymer networks, in which optically inert ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) groups assemble into reversible cross&#8208;links, are combined with a trigger molecule, the photoacid generator (PAG) 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;styryl)&#8208;4,6&#8208;bis(trichloromethyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (MBTT). Model experiments with a fluorescent, self&#8208;reporting UPy motif elucidate the sequence of processes that result from optical triggering, namely acid generation, protonation of UPy groups, and ultimately dissociation of the SM cross&#8208;links. The optically stimulated transformation of gels and rubbery films into viscous liquids was quantitatively monitored by opto&#8208;rheological measurements, showing that the optical stimulation and resultant mechanical responses are intimately coupled. The potential usefulness of this approach to create materials with spatially graded mechanical characteristics and as the basis for debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand (DOD) adhesives was explored in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments.

         <title>Reengineering of a Proteomimetic Pan&#8208;Ras Inhibitor into a Ras Degrader</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes the development of proteomimetic molecular glues. We show that crosslinked helix dimers can be designed to recognize two different proteins. We converted a Ras ligand into a Ras degrader by epitope grafting, an MDM2 E3 ligase binding domain solvent&#8208;exposed surface of the dimeric scaffold. 








Abstract
Bifunctional ligands that can coax protein&#8211;protein interactions have become attractive therapeutic modalities. Herein, we describe conformationally defined helix dimers as proteomimetic molecular glues. The helix dimers can be rationally designed to engage helical protein interfaces. We previously described a synthetic Sos protein mimic, CHDSOS, as a Ras ligand that inhibits wild&#8208;type and oncogenic Ras signaling. This Sos proteomimetic consisted of a crosslinked helix dimer (CHD) that reproduced two helical domains, termed &#945;H and &#945;I, from Sos. The native &#945;H helix of Sos constitutes the primary contact surface for Sos, while &#945;I has minimal engagement. We conjectured that the &#945;I domain of CHDSOS could be reengineered to preserve Ras binding, while engaging another protein to fully leverage the contact residues available in a proteomimetic. Herein, we incorporate a second distinct binding epitope into CHDSOS, thereby generating a bispecific proteomimetic. This secondary epitope was designed based on the p53 activation domain to engage the E3 ligase MDM2 and induce complexation with Ras. The resulting lead proteomimetic, CHDBI4, associates with both MDM2 and Ras and demonstrates reduction of cellular Ras levels. Overall, the study offers a proof of concept for the development of a bispecific proteomimetic scaffold to target multiple protein interfaces.

         <title>Design Considerations of Ionic Conductive Elastomeric Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Zinc Metal Batteries with High Safety and Long Life</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic conductive elastomeric electrolyte rich in high&#8208;density hydrogen bond network was constructed through the cross&#8208;linked encapsulation of PA molecules with PVA chains during solvent evaporation. Unlike the conventional hydrogel electrolytes, elastomeric electrolytes (ZICE&#8208;4) demonstrate the fast Zn2+ ion transport, uniform Zn2+ flux, high volumetric adaptability, and wide working temperature range. 








Abstract
Zn&#8722;ion batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth have impeded their application. In this study, we developed an Zn2+&#8208;ionic conductive elastomer solid&#8208;state electrolyte through the simultaneous hydrogen&#8208;bond cross&#8208;linking between phytic acid (PA) molecules and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The large PA molecules inside the polymer electrolyte are favorable to maintaining stretched conformation of PVA chain and uniform interpenetrating distribution, enhancing the amorphous region of PVA polymer. And the high&#8208;density hydrogen bond network constructed from PVA chains and PA molecules builds a novel transport mode to promote the efficient Zn2+ ion transport, displaying significant ion conductivity of 6.05&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C and a higher transference number of 0.68. The special viscoelasticity of the elastomer facilitates close contact with electrodes, ensuring superior interface compatibility. The assembled Zn symmetric battery exhibits a stable cycle life of 2880&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the assembled Zn//VO2 full battery still maintains a capacity retention rate of 86.5% at 400 cycles under 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The development of ionic conductive elastomers offers a novel approach to solve the solid&#8208;state interface design of solid&#8208;state Zn&#8722;ion batteries.

         <title>Nonconjugated Structural Distortion Promoting the Formation of NIR Triplet States in Phenothiazine Dyes for Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through steric modification of PTZ dyes, we developed a nonconjugated structural distortion strategy that enhances ISC efficiency and prolongs triplet&#8208;state lifetime via optimized spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The optimized photosensitizer HNBS achieves oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation at ultralow doses while inducing pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death for synergistic photoimmunotherapy. 








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) triplet&#8208;state dyes are pivotal for advanced biomedical and material science applications. Although numerous strategies have been proposed to enhance the photosensitization efficiency of dyes, significant challenges remain. Herein, we propose a novel strategy leveraging nonconjugated structural distortion to enhance triplet&#8208;state formation. This strategy, achieved by introducing steric groups at the edges of the phenothiazine (PTZ) dye framework, notably enhances intersystem crossing (ISC) and prolongs triplet&#8208;state lifetime. Based on this strategy, HNBS and HNBSe are synthesized, which exhibit exceptional triplet&#8208;state quantum yields (47.2% for HNBS and 87.7% for HNBSe) and prolonged triplet&#8208;excited&#8208;state lifetimes (21.1&#160;&#181;s for HNBS and 6.3&#160;&#181;s for HNBSe). These values substantially exceed those of conventional dyes, such as NBS (negligible and NBSe (3.2&#160;&#181;s). Under ultralow&#8208;light doses (0.45&#160;J cm&#8722;2 in vitro, and 6&#160;J cm&#8722;2 in vivo), these photosensitizers demonstrate robust tumor cell inhibition, highlighting their exceptional photosensitizing ability. Mechanistically, HNBS possesses lysosomal&#8208;targeting ability, and upon light irradiation, it induces lysosomal damage, triggering pyroptosis and immunogenic cell death. These processes promote dendritic cell maturation and T&#8208;cell differentiation, augmenting the immune response and enabling effective photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Type I&#8208;B Main&#8208;Chain Polyrotaxane Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing &#8220;host&#8722;guest recognition followed by click polymerization&#8221; strategy, a Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain polyrotaxane (PR), featuring multiple wheels and stoppers along the polymer backbone, was efficiently synthesized. The first&#8208;ever Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR network (PRN) was then constructed to unveil the structure&#8722;property relationships of the PR. The special topological structures and dynamic characteristics of the PR skeleton provided multiple energy dissipation pathways, effectively toughening and strengthening the PRN.








Abstract
Polyrotaxanes (PRs) are recognized for their outstanding conformational flexibility, making them ideal candidates for the design of high&#8208;performance mechanically interlocked materials. However, Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PRs, featuring multiple wheels and stoppers along the polymer backbone, remain underexplored due to the challenges in their design and synthesis. Herein, we introduce a facile &#8220;host&#8722;guest recognition followed by click polymerization&#8221; strategy for the synthesis of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR, which is subsequently employed to prepare the first&#8208;ever Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR network (PRN). Compared to the control whose wheels are nonslidable under applied force, the distinctive dynamic behaviors of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR impart extraordinary mechanical enhancements to PRN, with fracture strain, toughness, and puncture resistance all surging by more than 27&#8208;fold. Moreover, the combination of the host&#8722;guest recognition and multiple stoppers endows the PRN with great self&#8208;recovery capability due to the restriction of the motion range of mechanical bonds. This work not only presents a novel strategy for designing and synthesizing Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PR networks but also highlights the pivotal role of Type I&#8208;B main&#8208;chain PRs in enhancing material performance, offering valuable insights for advancing the development of dynamic polymer materials.

         <title>Leveraging Sortase A Electrostatics for Powerful Transpeptidation Reactions</title>

The electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA&#8208;5M) is leveraged to improve SrtA&#8208;5M&#8208;mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. The reaction is highly efficient, straightforward to implement, compatible with recombinant protein expression, and enables remarkably clean protein labeling and protein&#8208;protein coupling.








Abstract
Sortase&#8208;mediated transpeptidation is a powerful biochemical reaction to perform protein engineering. In this work, we leverage the unique electrostatic profile of sortase A pentamutant (SrtA&#8208;5M) to improve SrtA&#8208;5M&#8208;mediated transpeptidations by incorporating short, charged peptidic modules into the substrates. Importantly, the reaction proceeds with a minimal excess of nucleophile and is fast and highly efficient in the low micromolar substrate concentration range. Electrostatic assistance eliminates the need for additives or complex substrate engineering strategies, thereby giving it a broad scope. Our findings also provide fundamental insights into the influence of substrate charge on SrtA&#8208;5M activity, paving the way for further optimization of sortase A&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation reactions.

A ligand&#8208;controlled nickel&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;divergent reductive alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling between two different migratory alkyl halides has been developed. The reaction proceeds via tunable non&#8208;migratory or site&#8208;defined migratory alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling at room temperature, providing a straightforward protocol for the alkylation of unactivated Csp3&#9472;H bonds by differentiating thermodynamic and non&#8208;thermodynamic alkyl intermediates to deliver three types of branched N&#8208;acyl amine architectures from identical starting materials.








Abstract
Site&#8208;selective and divergent functionalizations on saturated alkyl chain at specific unfunctionalized positions is a key challenge in organic chemistry and other related areas and offers unprecedented synthetic opportunities. Herein, a ligand&#8208;controlled Ni&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective and divergent alkyl&#8211;alkyl reductive coupling between two different alkyl halides has been developed. Notably, the reaction finely tunes and recognizes thermodynamic favored &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals over &#946;&#8208;aminoalkyl radicals, and distal ipso&#8208;alkyl radicals to deliver chemo&#8208; and position&#8208;selective alkylation of unactivated &#945;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;H of amines under reductive conditions. Moreover, the reaction selectively functionalizes one alkyl chain over two migratable alkyl chains. By just switching the catalytic parameters, &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;alkylation of saturated C&#9472;H bonds, and ipso&#8208;alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling allow for rapid access to three types of branched aliphatic amine architectures from identical starting materials.

         <title>Supramolecularly Confined Catalysis in Polyphthalocyanine&#8208;Crown&#8208;Ether Frameworks Boosts Sulfur Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether frameworks coating on carbon nanotubes, which not only serve as supramolecularly confined catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur chemistry but also suppress the growth of lithium dendrites. This newly designed catalysts achieve the long&#8208;term cycling operation of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with a tiny capacity decay rate of 0.711&#8240; per cycle. Our design strategy can be potentially applied to a wider spectrum of electrochemical catalysis.








Abstract
Metal phthalocyanines are considered as potent catalysts in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) chemistry. However, their adsorption capability is deficient to inhibit polysulfides from shuttling, which in turn retards the S&#8208;redox reaction in the cathode. Here we report flexible, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) polyphthalocyanine&#8208;crown&#8208;ether (PPc&#8208;CE) frameworks that provide a supramolecularly confined space created with the single&#8208;atom catalytic nickel phthalocyanine nodes and crown&#8208;ether linkers as Li host. Electrochemical and theoretical analyses reveal that a cooperative redox catalysis with the enhanced lithiophilicity of PPc&#8208;CE&#8208;coated carbon nanotubes (PPc&#8208;CE/CNTs) boosts Li&#8211;S redox kinetics and, meanwhile, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites for the long term. A Li||S cell employing PPc&#8208;CE/CNT catalysts delivers a high discharge capacity of 1,363 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and still retains a specific capacity of &#8764;700 mAh g&#8722;1 over 500 cycles at 1C. Our work provides insights into the molecular design of redox catalysts for Li&#8211;S batteries based on 2D polymers.

         <title>Enantioselective Divergent Total Syntheses of Cycloaurenones and Dysiherbols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols via a common cyclohexadienone intermediate, that is, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition reaction. This cyclohexadienone was obtained by a bidirectional synthesis from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide, with stereocenters set by a novel Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% e.e.).








Abstract
Cycloaurenones and dysiherbols are naturally occurring sesquiterpene quinones/quinols that share a 6/6/5/6 tetracyclic carbon skeleton with either a cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;decalin system containing four contiguous stereocenters, including three contiguous all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. Total syntheses of cycloaurenones have not been reported. Herein, we present the first enantiodivergent syntheses of cycloaurenones and dysiherbols based on manipulation of a common cyclohexadienone intermediate: namely, a local desymmetric Giese&#8211;Baran&#8208;type cyclization for cycloaurenones and a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition for dysiherbols. Moreover, the key cyclohexadienone intermediate was readily accessible by a bidirectional approach from a chiral bis&#8208;Weinreb amide. The 1,4&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters were installed by an unprecedented enantioselective hydrogenation of the corresponding bis&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Weinreb amide (&gt;99:1 chiral/meso ratio, &gt;99% enantiomeric excess).

         <title>In Situ Solid Conversion into Mechanically Adaptive LiF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase via MgF2 Precursor on Si Surface in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgF2 coating with high coating integrity is in situ constructed on Si nanoparticles. During electrochemical cycling, the MgF2 layer undergoes in situ conversion into LiF and Mg, thereby forming a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with high mechanical adaptability, excellent electronic insulation, and high ionic conductivity. This unique transformed SEI layer effectively mitigates mechanical degradation and interfacial side reactions, contributing to significantly enhanced electrochemical properties of the Si anode. 








Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes hold exceptional promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (&#8764;4200&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185;). However, their commercialization is severely hindered by the significant volume expansion (&#8764;300%) and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional SEI, predominantly composed of organic species, suffers from low ionic conductivity, low electronic insulation, and poor mechanical robustness, leading to rapid capacity decay. Herein, we propose an interface engineering strategy by decorating Si nanoparticles with an in situ conversed MgF2 layer (with coating integrity of 94.2%). During initial lithiation, the applied MgF2 layer is in situ conversed into SEI film with high ionic conductivity, electronic insulation, and better mechanical adaptability. The prepared Si@MgF2&#8208;1 anode achieves a high initial coulombic efficiency (91.7%), superior rate capability (2000&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 10&#160;C), and remarkable cycling stability (1794.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles). Full&#8208;cell based on the Si@MgF2&#8208;1 anode and NCM811 cathode further validate the practicality of this approach. The robust conversion strategy for the construction of a mechanically adaptive LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer holds significant promise for the advancement of durable silicon&#8208;based LIBs.

Structural shaping of a highly reactive chiral Mn&#8208;oxo species translates into exceptionally enantioselective C&#9472;H oxidation catalyst of cyclohexyl 1,3&#8208;meso diethers (up to &gt;99% ee) leading to polyfunctionalized cyclohexanes.








Abstract
Chiral polyoxygenated cyclohexanes are valuable constituents of biologically relevant products. Herein, we report a protocol for the direct access to these scaffolds via site&#8208; and enantioselective non&#8208;directed oxidation of cyclohexyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;meso diethers using aqueous H&#8322;O&#8322;. Structural shaping of a highly reactive chiral Mn&#8208;oxo species, achieved through the combination of a sterically encumbered ligand and a bulky carboxylic acid, promotes a precise fit of the substrate within the catalyst pocket, which translates into exceptional enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). Computational studies reveal that C&#9472;H oxidation proceeds via an initial hydrogen atom transfer, followed by electron transfer, leading to the formation of a chiral cationic intermediate. The resulting desymmetrized 3&#8208;methoxycyclohexanone products serve as valuable intermediates for the synthesis of bioactive cores, as they can undergo orthogonal chemical modifications to enable further structural diversification.

         <title>Rapid Access to an Enantioenriched Spiro Bisindole Directly from Indole and Acetone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective one&#8208;pot &#8220;self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy was developed for the exceedingly convenient access to a spiro bisindole directly from indole and acetone. The obtained enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric bisindole showed exceptional performance as a chiral backbone of diverse effective catalysts or ligands.








Abstract
Disclosed here is a &#8220;one&#8208;pot self&#8208;assembly&#8221; strategy for the enantioselective synthesis of a spiro bisindole molecule directly from indole and acetone. This convenient synthesis contrasts drastically to the typical long sequence required for other privileged C2&#8208;symmetric spirocycles. The use of an alcohol additive in cooperation with chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis proved crucial to the good efficiency and enantioselectivity. The favorable interaction between the additive and CPA was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and density functional theory (DFT) studies. The obtained enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric bisindole was demonstrated as a useful backbone of chiral catalysts/ligands.

         <title>Organocatalytic Asymmetric Cycloaddition for the Construction of Chiral Indole&#8208;Fused Medium&#8208; and Large&#8208;Sized Rings</title>

The first catalytic asymmetric (4&#160;+&#160;4) and (4&#160;+&#160;4&#160;+&#160;m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates have been established via asymmetric organocatalysis, providing a useful protocol for constructing enantioenriched indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings. The biological evaluation of selected chiral indole products discovered several compounds with some extent of antitumor activity, indicating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.








Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric construction of chiral indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings represents an important issue in synthetic chemistry but with significant challenges. To overcome these challenges, herein, we report highly enantioselective synthesis of chiral indole&#8208;fused medium&#8208; and large&#8208;sized rings via organocatalytic asymmetric (4&#160;+&#160;4) and (4&#160;+&#160;4&#160;+&#160;m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates with benzofuranyl azadienes, providing an efficient strategy for accessing these enantioenriched frameworks. By designing 2&#8208;indolylacetates as a new class of four&#8208;carbon platform molecules for higher&#8208;order cycloadditions and modulating the nucleophilicity of benzofuranyl azadienes, we achieved the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of chiral indole&#8208;fused eight&#8208;membered rings and eleven&#8208; to fourteen&#8208;membered macrocycles in high yields with good enantioselectivity. This work not only demonstrates the first application of 2&#8208;indolylacetates as four&#8208;carbon platform molecules in cycloaddition reactions, but also represents the first catalytic asymmetric (4&#160;+&#160;4) and (4&#160;+&#160;4&#160;+&#160;m) cycloadditions of 2&#8208;indolylacetates. Furthermore, biological evaluation revealed that several chiral indole derivatives exhibit some extent of antitumor activity, indicating their potential applications in medicinal chemistry.

         <title>H2S Donor Functionalized Molecular Machine for Combating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria Infected Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel H2S donor functionalized molecular machine, ACR&#8208;DM&#8208;HS, with combination of antibacteria and anti&#8208;inflammation to accelerate angiogenesis through membrane disruption, ROS generation, and H2S releasing was developed for synergistic therapy of multiple resistant bacteria&#8208;infected chronic wound, which offers a promising treatment approach for combating bacterial multidrug resistance and tackling chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds are a worldwide medical challenge due to the complex and multifaceted etiologies, including bacterial infection, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis. Developing a comprehensive strategy integrating antibiosis and anti&#8208;inflammation to promote revascularization and accelerate wound healing is highly desirable. Nevertheless, current therapeutic methods still face two major challenges: 1) how to combat bacterial drug resistance, 2) how to achieve spatiotemporal control over bacterial elimination and inflammation reduction. To address these issues, a novel H2S donor functionalized molecular machine (MM), ACR&#8208;DM&#8208;HS, was developed. It selectively binds to and disturbs the bacterial membrane through a light&#8208;active vibronic&#8208;driven mechanochemical action (VDA), which synergizes with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to efficiently eradicate multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilms, and conquers the evolution of bacterial resistance. Furthermore, it releases H2S in infected tissues to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibit the secretion of inflammatory factors, promote angiogenesis, and accelerate the healing of diabetic wounds in vivo. This work provides an integrated strategy combining antibiotics and anti&#8208;inflammation to treat with multidrug resistance bacterial&#8208;infected chronic wounds.

Visible light/pH dual&#8208;responsive ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with reversible stimuli&#8208;chromic characteristics were fabricated through self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers, displaying reversible shape transitions, repeatable acidochromism from yellow to pink, and fluorochromism performance.

Abstract
Endowing dual&#8208;responsive ultrathin polymersomes (UTPSs) with reversible stimuli&#8208;chromic and fluorochromic performances offers a prospective yet challenging strategy for achieving high&#8208;level information encryption and anticounterfeiting. Herein, starting from rational synthesis of visible light/pH&#8208;responsive integrated azobenzene monomer, side&#8208;chain&#8208;type amphiphilic alternating azocopolymers were elaborately crafted using a moderate epoxy&#8208;amino click&#8208;polycondensation. Followed by subsequent solution self&#8208;assembly, dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with a diameter of &#8764;253&#160;nm and a vesicular thickness of &#8764;2.1&#160;nm were subtly produced based on the pendant hydrophobic conjugate stacking mechanism. The photoisomerization of azobenzene units and protonation of tertiary amines within UTPSs were accountable for the visible&#8208;light&#8208; or pH&#8208;triggered reversible shape and physicochemical transitions (i.e., color, size, diameter, vesicular thickness, zeta potential, fluorescent intensity) as well as repeatable acidochromism from yellow to pink and recyclable fluorochromism, respectively. Benefiting from these attractive traits, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept 2D quick response code was meticulously crafted using the stimuli&#8208;chromic UTPSs into patterning lithography, showcasing a multilevel decryption, favorable reversibility, and preferable recyclability for advanced information security. Our work provides innovative guidelines for the development of dual&#8208;responsive UTPSs with multiple stimuli&#8208;chromism merits for the potential of complex information encryption.

Our work provides innovative guidelines for the development of dual-responsive UTPSs with multiple stimuli-chromism merits for the potential of complex information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultraselective Permeable Polyamide Membranes Prepared via Interfacial Polymerization of Alkane and Deep Eutectic Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green interfacial polymerization platform that can eliminate side reactions was designed to precisely regulate the preparation of narrow pore size polyamide membranes through a dynamic 3D hydrogen bonding network. In addition, the platform has unprecedented universality, and the membranes produced have an order of magnitude higher selectivity for NaCl/Na2SO4, as well as excellent permeability.








Abstract
Conventional alkane/water interfacial polymerization encounters significant challenges in constructing polyamide membranes with precise nanoconfinement. This requires advanced strategies that simultaneously slow the diffusion kinetics and suppress side reactions, facilitating the formation of a well&#8208;defined pore architecture. Herein, we introduced an alkane/deep eutectic solvent (DES) interfacial polymerization approach, allowing the preparation of ultraselective permeable polyamide membranes. The DES, acting as an anhydrous solvent, effectively prevents side reactions, while its robust hydrogen bonding network finely regulates the diffusion behavior of amine monomers and induces the assembly of oligomers, affording a polyamide membrane with uniform subnanometer pores. Notably, the strong hydrogen bonding network of DES enhances the solvation of amine monomers, which further promotes the tuning of the membrane structures and functions. The polyamide membrane produced using specific DES (D&#8208;PA) revealed an exceptional NaCl/Na2SO4 (165.8) separation selectivity, an order of magnitude larger than that of conventional polyamide membranes, coupled with impressive water permeance of up to 18.4&#160;L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1. This strategy offers a paradigm shift in the fabrication of ultraselective permeable polyamide membranes for advanced water purification system.

         <title>A Universal P&#8208;Type Heterointerface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal p&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite was constructed using the heterocyclic dipolar compound imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI), enabling effective hole extraction from perovskite to SAMs and significantly reducing charge recombination. As a result, the optimized solar cells reached 26.05% and demonstrated excellent stability.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells with self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high efficiency and long&#8208;term operational stability. However, the hole extraction at the SAMs/perovskite interface is generally less efficient with respect to the electron extraction. Here, we report the construction of a universal p&#8208;type heterointerface between SAMs and perovskite with heterocyclic dipolar compounds imidazole hydroiodide (ImHI). We found that the strong interaction by hydrogen bonds together with formative dipole layer were observed between ImHI and perovskite. This allows more p&#8208;type contacts with relatively small energy barriers at SAMs/perovskite heterointerfaces by downshifting the Fermi level, reducing the energy mismatch and facilitating the hole extraction. The p&#8208;type contact enhancement was further confirmed by a series of SAMs at the perovskite buried interface. As a result, a best&#8208;performing solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 26.05% was achieved, with maintaining 96% of the initial efficiency for 2000&#160;h under nitrogen&#8208;filled glove box, 94% of the initial efficiency for 800&#160;h at 55&#160;&#176;C/55% RH, and 86% of the initial efficiency for 1000&#160;h under continuous light stress at maximum power point.

         <title>Supramolecular Chalcogen&#8208;Bonded Shape Memory Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chalcogen&#8208;bonded liquid crystal elastomers incorporating Se&#8943;N interactions exhibit distinct shape memory and actuation properties. Stronger Se&#8943;N ChBs enable programmable one&#8208;way and two&#8208;way SME, while weaker S&#8943;N ChBs fail to induce actuation. Solid&#8208;state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and DFT reveal the molecular interactions governing ChB&#8208;driven mechanical responses.








Abstract
Supramolecular liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) incorporating chalcogen bonds (ChBs) have been synthesized and investigated for shape memory and actuation properties. LCEs featuring strong Se&#8943;N ChBs (&#8722;40 to &#8722;43&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) exhibit both shape memory effects (SME) and reversible actuation, while those with weaker S&#8943;N ChBs (&#8722;32 to &#8722;34&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) do not. The Se&#8943;N&#8208;based LCEs transition from one&#8208;way to two&#8208;way SME after three days at room temperature, enabling programmable 2D/3D shape transformations and rewritable surface patterns. They also enable the fabrication of light&#8208;powered crawling robots as well as temperature&#8208;responsive knot&#8208;like actuators. These results highlight the critical role of the ChB strength and specificity in designing functional materials. Solid&#8208;state NMR, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations provide further molecular&#8208;level insights into ChB interactions, laying the groundwork for advanced supramolecular actuators and shape&#8208;morphing LCEs.

We presented the rational design and synthesis of two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs engineered with high&#8208;density nitrogen/oxygen active sites for selective gold recovery. Their comprehensive gold recovery performance is among the best in the COF field, with the third highest adsorption capacity, ultrafast adsorption kinetics, and near&#8208;perfect selectivity, resulting from the synergistic effect of redox interactions, electrostatic interactions, coordination bonds, and hydrogen bonding.








Abstract
Developing efficient adsorbents for precious metals, especially gold recovery, necessitates the integration of multiple critical properties, including high adsorption capacity, rapid adsorption kinetics, and exceptional selectivity, posing significant scientific challenges with substantial economic and environmental implications. Herein, we report a strategy to achieve highly efficient gold adsorption through synergistic effects of nitrogen and oxygen active sites into covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Two &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs (NKCOF&#8208;77 and &#8208;78) with high&#8208;density nitrogen/oxygen active sites are rationally designed and synthesized via a Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction approach. Notably, the comprehensive gold recovery performance for NKCOF&#8208;77 is among the best in the COF field, with the third highest adsorption capacity (up to 3225&#160;mg g&#8722;1), ultrafast adsorption kinetics (&lt;5&#160;min), and near&#8208;perfect selectivity (&gt;99.9% with 10 competitive cations and anions). Moreover, the COFs show exceptional ability for gold recovery from real e&#8208;waste solutions, demonstrating tremendous practical application potential. Various experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that strategically incorporating high&#8208;density nitrogen and oxygen active sites is crucial in&#160;significantly enhancing the gold adsorption capacity. This work provides a novel strategy for designing COFs as precious metal adsorbents, highlighting their promising potential for industrial applications.

         <title>Employment of l&#8208;Citrulline as an Effective Molecular Bridge for Regulating the Buried Interface of Perovskite Solar Cells to Achieve High Efficiency and Good Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

l&#8208;Citrulline (CIT), with amino acid end groups (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and a urea end group (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2), functions as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The optimized PSC device (0.07065 cm2) achieved an impressive champion PCE of 25.95%. The solar module with an active area of 23.26 cm2 achieved a PCE of 22.70%, which is one of the highest values reported recently using the slot&#8208;die coating method. The strategy offers valuable insights to advance the industrialization of large&#8208;area devices.








Abstract
Suppressing the defects from SnO2 and perovskite interface is essential for the fabrication of large&#8208;area n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with the needed lifetime and efficiency for commercialization. Here, we report the employment of l&#8208;citrulline (CIT), which has amino acid (&#9472;COOH, &#9472;NH2) and urea (&#9472;NH&#9472;CO&#9472;NH2) groups, during SnO2 colloidal dispersion to function as a molecular bridge to modulate the SnO2/perovskite buried interface. The amino acid group can effectively coordinate with Sn4+ to passivate the oxygen vacancy defects of SnO2, and the urea group can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and I&#8722;. These interactions not only improve the electron mobility of SnO2 but also facilitate the formation of larger grain&#8208;size perovskite film. In addition, they can also inhibit the generation of excess PbI2 and the nonphotoactive &#948; phase to result in suppressed trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the incorporation of CIT helps achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.95% (0.07065 cm2) in PSC with improved shelf life/light soaking stability. When combined with an antisolvent&#8208;free slot&#8208;die coating technique in air, the solar modules (23.26 cm2) could achieve a PCE of 22.70%, which is among the highest PCE reported so far.

         <title>Unlocking Precision in Biomass Conversion Through Functional Ligand Engineering of Lewis Acidic MOFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a strategic combination of sulfo&#8208;functionalized ligands and terephthalic acid, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;based catalysts with tunable Lewis acidity were synthesized, where the specific chemical state of each sulfo group served as a critical regulator of catalytic activity in glucose isomerization. This precise control enabled unambiguous correlation between acid site characteristics and reaction performance.








Abstract
Glucose isomerization to fructose is a key factor in cellulosic biomass utilization. Thus, achieving highly efficient fructose production and understanding the dominant reaction route remain crucial goals. Hereby, this study refines a precise ligand engineering strategy applied to the typical metal&#8211;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66, generating a series of Lewis acidic UiO&#8208;66&#8208;based catalysts with only subtle structural adjustments. Among all, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;pCl&#8208;SBA possessed the strongest Lewis acidity and the best glucose isomerization performance. Further investigation elaborates the crucial contribution of both Lewis acid amount and specific acid nature to enhanced catalytic reactivity, given a high fructose yield of 47% at glucose conversion of 63%, achieved with a UiO&#8208;66&#8208;STPA(49%). The increased acid density with specific Lewis acid strength is computationally identified to promote glucose polarization, facilitating the isomerization process. Density functional theory calculations reveal that incorporating functionalized ligands and increasing their proportion markedly decrease both the electron density at Zr sites and the material's band gap, which in turn benefits the Lewis acid strength and catalytic activity enhancement. This work highlights the significance of Lewis sites&#8217; nature and its effect on glucose isomerization performance.

         <title>Covalent Elaboration of Confined Surfaces Steers C&#9472;C Coupling Pathway for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction at Ampere&#8208;Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

A novel gasphilic Cu2O nanoparticle dispersed within the hierarchically porous carbon matrix as a high&#8208;efficiency CO2RR electrocatalyst switches in the reaction pathways from ethanol to ethylene during CO2RR at ampere&#8208;level current, depending on the multiscale microenvironment engineering. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ethylene achieved is as high as &#8764;71% with a partial current density of 513.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Microenvironmental engineering of electrocatalysts is pivotal for directing reaction pathways and stabilizing key intermediates in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon products, but it has yet to meet the industrial requirement for selectively producing a most desired product, such as ethylene or ethanol, at a steady above&#8208;ampere current level. Herein, a topotactic conversion cum covalent functionalization strategy is invoked to craft a catalyst with confined and modulated surfaces that can bias the reaction heavily for ethylene production with a 22&#8208;fold boost in the ethylene/ethanol ratio. The well&#8208;tuned covalent structural motif of &#9472;Si&#9472;O&#9472;Cu&#9472; on PDMS&#8208;Cu2O/C dramatically elevates the C2H4&#8208;forming activity with a faradaic efficiency reaching up to 71% and a high partial current density of 513.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations unveil the ultralow coordination number and the upshifted d&#8208;band center. Notably, modulating the d&#8208;band center with the covalently elaborated surfaces allows control of the adsorption energies of CHO* and other intermediates along the ethylene path, largely lowering energy barriers for the key steps, particularly the formation of CH2CHO*. This work sheds light on the microenvironment modulation at the surface bonding to mesoscopic scales to precisely control catalytic processes and steer reaction pathways toward the target product.

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven O&#8208;Glycosylation with Selenoglycosides Mediated by Chalcogen Bonding to Umemoto's Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light irradiation of solutions of phenylselenoglycosides and Umemoto's reagent in the presence of alcohols results in often high&#8208;yielding formation of O&#8208;glycosidic products. Experimental and computational work suggests that chalcogen&#8208;bonded electron&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes are critical intermediates in this process which may proceed through photoinduced electron transfer.








Abstract
The activation of chalcogenoglycosides for O&#8208;glycosylation typically involves strong electrophiles requiring low temperature. Herein, we demonstrate that visible&#8208;light irradiation of selenoglycosides in the presence of Umemoto's reagent results in often high&#8208;yielding O&#8208;glycosylation. We provide evidence that this process is mediated by a novel mode of reactivity, specifically photoinduced electron transfer within a chalcogen&#8208;bonded complex.

Atomic&#8208;level investigation of V(V) solvation transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3 via a four&#8208;step mechanism is presented, with the second deprotonation as the rate&#8208;determining step. This insight enables V(V) stabilization via proton and anion coordination, and a mixed&#8208;acid electrolyte was developed with exceptional stability at 50&#160;&#176;C for VFB.








Abstract
Vanadium flow batteries (VFBs) are safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable solutions for storing renewable energies. However, the poor thermal stability of pentavalent vanadium [V(V)] electrolyte, manifested as V2O5 precipitation at high temperatures, leads to more critical heat management, low energy density, and even low reliability. The unclear dynamic solvation chemistry of V(V) ions brings difficulties in solving the above issues intrinsically. Herein, we investigated solvation structures and dynamic evolution of V(V) electrolyte using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and in situ liquid time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). For the first time, we clarified the transformation from [VO2(H2O)3]+ to VO(OH)3, identifying the second deprotonation as the rate&#8208;determining step. Based on this, we developed stabilization strategies through anion coordination and proton concentration control. The incorporation of HCl and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid improved the thermal stability of V(V) electrolytes remarkably. The optimized electrolyte showed no precipitation during 30&#8208;day static tests at 50 &#176;C, enabling stable cycling performance of 3000 cycles in VFB single cells. Further demonstration in a kW&#8208;scale stack achieved over 1000 cycles, validating the scalability and viability. Our work provides insights into the solvation chemistry of V(V) species, paving the way to improve the reliability and energy density of a VFB system.

         <title>A Synergistic Photocatalysis&#8211;Electrocatalysis System for Efficient Hydrogen Generation and Energy&#8208;Saving Benzylamine Oxidative Upgrading</title>

A synergistic photocatalysis&#8211;electrocatalysis system addresses the I3&#8722; light shielding in HI splitting and achieves efficient H2 generation and energy&#8208;saving benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The Re0.5Mo0.5S2&#8208;modified MAPbI3 photocatalyst generates 875.4&#160;&#181;mol of H2 in 4 h, and the electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction coupled with benzylamine oxidation can operate at a low potential of 0.44&#160;V for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting represents a promising tactic for H2 generation, but the light&#8208;shielding effect induced by the generated I3&#8722; greatly impedes subsequent reactions. A critical challenge in this field lies in achieving the timely reduction of I3&#8722; while avoiding the use of additional sacrificial agents, such as H3PO2. Herein, we develop a synergistic photocatalysis&#8211;electrocatalysis system to address this challenge and achieve efficient H2 generation and benzylamine oxidative upgrading. The photocatalytic component features a Re0.5Mo0.5S2 cocatalyst&#8208;modified MAPbI3 with efficient charge separation and ample active sites, achieving a remarkable H2 generation of 875.4&#160;&#181;mol within 4&#160;h through HI splitting.&#160;The subsequent electrocatalytic module can operate at a low potential (only 0.44&#160;V to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to reduce the generated I3&#8722; and oxidize benzylamine to value&#8208;added chemicals. After the electrolysis, the regenerated HI solution can be recycled for subsequent photocatalytic H2 generation. The synergistic system establishes a sustainable catalytic cycle mediated by I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couples, enabling continuous photocatalytic H2 generation from HI splitting and energy&#8208;saving electrocatalytic benzylamine oxidative upgrading.

         <title>HFIP&#8208;Promoted E&#8208;selective Asymmetric Crotylboration of Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Silyl Crotylboronate with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)&#8212;a polar alcoholic solvent that has been underutilized in allylboration&#8212;enables otherwise challenging (E)&#8208;selective crotylboration of enantioenriched quaternary &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates with aldehydes. HFIP's strong hydrogen bonding effect increases the Lewis acidity of the boron center and the steric effect of Bpin, resulting in high yields and (E)&#8208;selectivity.








Abstract
Polyketide synthesis consistently requires the development of linchpin&#8208;type allylboron reagents, such as &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates. Traditionally, these reagents feature &#945;&#8208;tertiary substitution and are used in aprotic solvents, typically yielding homoallylic alcohols with disubstituted (Z)&#8208;vinylsilanes. Here, we report the asymmetric synthesis of enantioenriched quaternary &#945;&#8208;silyl crotylboronates via stereospecific allylic Matteson homologation. We further demonstrate that hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)&#8212;a polar alcoholic solvent that has been underutilized in allylboration&#8212;not only enhances reaction reactivity but also overrides the typical (Z)&#8208;selectivity, enabling access to the otherwise challenging (E)&#8208;selective products. The method enables the rapid construction of (E)&#8208;anti&#8208;2,4&#8208;dimethylpent&#8208;3&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;oxy motif, a structural unit frequently found in polyketides, and allows the protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of PM050463. DFT calculations suggest that HFIP's strong hydrogen bonding effect increases the Lewis acidity of the boron center and the steric effect of Bpin, resulting in high yields and (E)&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>A Neutral Single&#8208;Molecule Carrier for Delivery of Phosphonate Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>

The first application of a neutral anion receptor as a &#8220;single&#8208;molecule carrier&#8221; for targeted delivery of phosphonate drugs into living cells through anion coordination.








Abstract
Phosphate/phosphonate&#8208;based drugs (PDs), as multinegative, hydrophilic molecules, face the greatest difficulty in diffusion across biological membranes, leading to poor bioavailability. Conventional drug delivery strategies to overcome this issue, including utilizing small&#8208;molecule prodrugs or nanoparticle carriers, often suffer from case&#8208;specific modifications or uncertainties in drug loading. Inspired by the anion coordination chemistry of natural phosphate transporters and artificial anion receptors, here, we present the first use of a neutral anion receptor, i.e., bis(tripodal hexaurea) cage 1, as a &#8220;single&#8208;molecule carrier&#8221; for the delivery of PDs into living cells. Cage 1 features advantages of molecular&#8208;level encapsulation, enhanced intracellular accumulation, subcellular targeting, responsive drug release, and broad adaptability. It enhances PD accumulation in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing the cellular uptake of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;phosphate/phosphonate substrates by up to 45&#8208;fold via a macropinocytosis&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathway. This work demonstrates the potential of neutral anion receptors to serve as single&#8208;molecule carriers and offers a promising solution for improving PDs bioavailability, advancing the development of antitumor phosphate/phosphonate&#8208;based drugs.

         <title>Enantioselective Immobilization of Nonprecious Metal Complexes on Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks for Improved Single&#8208;Site Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Enantioselective immobilization of chiral Co(salen) complexes on the surface of chiral &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs enables axial coordination of Co(II) centers with COF linkages, which tautomerize from keto&#8208;enamine to enol&#8208;imine upon binding. This enantiomeric assembly enhances Co(II) reducibility and allows for inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer, leading to remarkable photocatalytic H&#8322; evolution without additional precious metals.








Abstract
The noncovalent assembly of molecular catalysts into photocatalytic systems represents a pivotal strategy for exploring single&#8208;site heterogenous catalysts, excluding the need for elaborate functionalization design. However, the reliance on weak noncovalent interactions (e.g., van der Waals forces) often leads to inefficient outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer and inferior structural stability. Herein, we report the enantioselective immobilization of cobalt&#8208;based molecular catalysts with chiral tetradentate ligands onto the surface of a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked chiral covalent organic framework (COF) synthesized through chirality induction. The enantiomeric assembly enables axial coordination between the molecular catalysts and the chiral COF, accompanied by enamine&#8208;to&#8208;imine tautomerization. Leveraging efficient inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer, the resulting composite exhibits a significantly enhanced H2 evolution rate (5.70&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and sustained performance without the use of precious metals. The enantiomeric assembly strategy on a COF platform demonstrates a viable approach to improve both the stability and activity of molecular catalysts, thereby expanding the design paradigm of single&#8208;site photocatalysts.

         <title>Introducing Functional Groups Into B&#8592;N Organic Frameworks with Permanent Porosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionality of crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#9472;O bonds (BNOFs) is engineered by introducing diverse dangling groups. Notably, the carboxyl&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;5 exhibits superior reversible NH&#8323; adsorption compared with their less&#8208; or nonfunctionalized counterparts. Combining high surface areas, low cost, and exceptional sustainability, these functionalized frameworks represent a promising platform for advanced applications.








Abstract
Crystalline organic frameworks incorporating dative B&#8592;N and reversible B&#9472;O bonds (BNOFs) have garnered increasing interest on account of their crystallinity, porosity, and processability. However, strategies for introducing functions into BNOFs remain largely unexplored. In this work, a series of functionalized BNOFs, named BNOF&#8208;n (n&#160;=&#160;2&#8211;9), have been designed and synthesized using a mixed&#8208;monomer assembly strategy. The obtained materials share structural similarities but reveal distinct functional groups, demonstrating excellent chemical stability, high surface areas, and remarkable regenerability. Notably, BNOF&#8208;5, functionalized with abundant carboxyl groups, achieves exceptional reversible NH3 adsorption capacity (up to 10.0&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;bar and 298&#160;K), significantly surpassing that of the nonfunctionalized BNOF&#8208;1 (5.6&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) and the less&#8208;functionalized BNOF&#8208;7 (7.9&#160;mmol g&#8722;1), thereby clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the functionalization strategy. Remarkably, the damaged BNOF&#8208;5 can be efficiently repaired through facile regeneration, highlighting its outstanding recyclability. This work demonstrates the first attempt at functionalization methodology in BNOFs, extending their potential toward diverse applications.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Ethanol by Cu4 Clusters with Adjacent Cu Single Atoms Anchored on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst composed of Cu4 clusters and adjacent Cu single atoms anchored on carbon nitride was prepared via a two&#8208;step calcination process. The synergistic effect between Cu4 clusters and Cu single atoms could lower the C&#9472;C coupling energy barrier and make it one of the most efficient catalysts for CO2 to ethanol via photocatalysis.








Abstract
An efficient photocatalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3CH2OH conversion comprising atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu4) and single Cu sites coordinated with 2 N and 1 O anchored on two&#8208;step calcinated C3N4 (Cu4/Cu1@CN) is reported. It was found to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to ethanol with production rate of 154&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and selectivity of 98%, the yield rate and selectivity exceed most of the reported results for ethanol production. Experimental and theoretical calculations indicate that the high efficiency of this catalyst arises from the strong synergy between Cu4 clusters and adjacent Cu single atoms, which facilitates OC&#9472;CO coupling and promotes ethanol production.

A comprehensive understanding of the concurrent capacity and stability enhancement mechanisms attributed to Nb&#8208;doping and highlights the significant potential of the synergistic regulation of mechanical and chemical coupling in improving the capacity and lifespan of NRLOs by Nb&#8208;doping.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) materials are considered highly promising cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, their practical application is limited by capacity loss and interface instability caused by chemical and mechanical failure during cycling. Doping has been identified as a direct and effective method to address these challenges. However, mechanistic understanding of doping enhanced electrochemical performance is still unclear. In this study, the introduction of high&#8208;valent Nb ions was employed to achieve mechanical&#8211;chemical coupling regulation, thereby concurrently improving the capacity and cycle life of NRLO. First, Nb5+ doping was conducted to refine secondary grains, achieving a &#8220;grain refinement&#8221; effect similar to that in ceramics and alloys, while further stabilizing the grain boundaries. The intergrain fusion structure of NCM811&#8208;0.5Nb effectively dissipates lattice strain under highly delithiated state, suppresses oxygen loss, and prevents cracks that lead to fracture during cycling. Moreover, Nb doping stabilizes the monoclinic phase during phase transitions and promotes the formation of highly stable spinel twin boundaries after cycling. This effectively reduces the Li diffusion barrier, leading to improved reversible specific capacity and rate capability. Lastly, the strong Nb&#9472;O bonding restrains oxygen release and transition metal/Li antisite mixing, thus mitigate rock&#8208;salt phase formation. This study demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the concurrent capacity and stability enhancement mechanisms attributed to Nb&#8208;doping and highlights the significant potential of the synergistic regulation of mechanical and chemical coupling in improving the capacity and lifespan of NRLOs by Nb&#8208;doping.

         <title>Utilizing the Mn(II) Dissolution&#8208;Induced Vacancy for Optimum Mg2+ Storage of Spinel Mn3O4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are two significant factors necessary for the cathode materials of aqueous Mg&#8208;ion energy storage devices as follows: one is the storage mechanism of Mg2+ that can achieve enhanced Mg2+ diffusion kinetics and bring higher power density; the other is the high structural stability to achieve long lifespan. The tetrahedral vacancy reversible insertion/extraction mechanism by Mn(II) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework is a powerful strategy to achieve Mg2+ energy storage system with high rate performance and long lifespan. 








Abstract
Manganese&#8208;based oxide can theoretically exert the multivalent advantages of an aqueous magnesium&#8208;ion cathode due to its redox activity and abundant crystal structure. However, sluggish diffusion kinetics of Mg2+ and Mn dissolution limit the rate performance and structure stability. Herein, we successfully utilize the notorious dissolution of Mn(II) tetrahedral site contributed vacancies for packaging optimum Mg2+ storage of a popular spinel Mn3O4 electrode.

     alt="Utilizing the Mn(II) Dissolution-Induced Vacancy for Optimum Mg2+ Storage of Spinel Mn3O4"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two significant factors necessary for the cathode materials of aqueous Mg-ion energy storage devices as follows: one is the storage mechanism of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that can achieve enhanced Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics and bring higher power density; the other is the high structural stability to achieve long lifespan. The tetrahedral vacancy reversible insertion/extraction mechanism by Mn(II) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework is a powerful strategy to achieve Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; energy storage system with high rate performance and long lifespan. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese-based oxide can theoretically exert the multivalent advantages of an aqueous magnesium-ion cathode due to its redox activity and abundant crystal structure. However, sluggish diffusion kinetics of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn dissolution limit the rate performance and structure stability. Herein, we successfully utilize the notorious dissolution of Mn(II) tetrahedral site contributed vacancies for packaging optimum Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage of a popular spinel Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrode. Such mechanism reverses the sluggish diffusion kinetics. Moreover, merited by the common ion effect and drug dissolution, a suitable preaddition of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to electrolyte inhibit Mn(III) dissolution and optimize the integrity of the spinel framework. Impressively, the cathode achieves a reversible capacity of 310 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a stable cycle performance of 2000 cycles with 94.9% retention. Our research shows that reversible insertion/extraction at vacancies and effective stabilization of spinel framework is a powerful strategy to achieve Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion energy storage system with high rate performance and long lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vibronic Trimer Design Enhancing Intramolecular Triplet&#8208;Exciton Hopping to Accelerate Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation for Photon Upconversion</title>

Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation&#8208;based photon up&#8208;conversion (TTA&#8208;UC) system using an anthracene&#8208;based UC emission by assembling multiple chromophores linked to a boron to enhance TTA rate constant. Structural fluctuations driven by vibronic motion induce picosecond intramolecular triplet exciton hopping, expanding the triplet exciton distribution and enhancing intermolecular TTA reactivity.








Abstract
Photon upconversion via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA&#8208;UC) is a well&#8208;known process that converts low&#8208;energy light into higher&#8208;energy light. This process has attracted attention for its potential in various fields, including light&#8208;emitting devices, power generation and medical applications. It is desirable to develop TTA&#8208;UC materials of TTA emitters with large TTA rate constants (kTTA). However, molecular design to accelerate the bimolecular rate constant of kTTA has not been considered. We present a strategy to manipulate kTTA by assembling multiple chromophores linked to a boron in a rotationally symmetric manner, causing asymmetric motions by a localized triplet exciton. We have studied tri(9&#8208;anthryl)borane, which consists of three anthracenes linked via boron, as a TTA emitter. Time&#8208;resolved luminescence measurements confirmed that kTTA is improved compared to the conventional TTA&#8208;UC system using DPA, an anthracene&#8208;based monomer. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that the improvement in kTTA is due to fast intramolecular triplet exciton hopping coupled with vibrational motions in the trimer molecule, which extends the reactivity at the collision distance between the excitons through the pseudo&#8208;rotational motions. This molecular design that enhances TTA reactivity is expected to contribute to the future development of TTA&#8208;UC materials for sensing fluid environment.

         <title>Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy Reveals Spatially Resolved Charge&#8208;Transfer Mechanism in CdS/BiOBr S&#8208;scheme Heterojunction Photocatalyst</title>

In situ KPFM reveals charge&#8208;transfer mechanism in CdS/BiOBr S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. Upon light illumination, the Fermi level (Ef) of n&#8208;type semiconductors rises, generating a built&#8208;in electric field that drives photogenerated carrier separation. Electrons accumulate on CdS, lowering its surface photovoltage (SPV), while holes accumulate on BiOBr, elevating its SPV above that of the bare semiconductors, highlighting efficient charge separation.








Abstract
S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions hold great promise for photocatalysis, yet a comprehensive understanding of their charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms remains limited. While time&#8208;resolved techniques have provided valuable insights, the spatial resolution of charge transfer at the material surface remains underexplored. Here, we employ Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, revealing spatially resolved details. Our findings show that upon illumination, the Fermi level (Ef) of n&#8208;type semiconductors increases, but a built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) persists within the heterojunction. Electrons accumulate on the surface of the reduction semiconductor (RS), resulting in a surface photovoltage (SPV) lower than that of the individual semiconductor, while holes accumulate on the oxidation semiconductor (OS) surface, producing an SPV higher than that of the bare material. The S&#8208;scheme heterojunction leads to a remarkable increase in charge separation, with 11 additional photogenerated electrons and 3722 additional holes compared to the bare CdS and BiOBr. These results offer critical insights into the spatially resolved charge&#8208;transfer mechanisms of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions.

         <title>Functional Dendrimer Nanogels for DNA Delivery and Gene Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrimer nanogels are designed by emulsion&#8208;free method, endowing them with dual&#8208;active groups, o&#8208;hydroxyl amine, temperature&#8208;responsiveness, polyampholyte property, and self&#8208;triggered aminolysis. With these unique characters, dendrimer nanogels display high gene transfection and therapeutic efficacies with low side effects, thus solving the dilemma between efficacy and cytotoxicity of conventional cationic colloidal vectorsin gene delivery.








Abstract
Solving the dilemma between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors is one of the biggest challenges in gene delivery. Cationic dendrimer assemblies with hierarchical structure, smart and biomimetic behaviors have been developed for drug/gene delivery in vivo. Among different dendrimer assemblies, the dendrimer&#8208;based nanogels were not intensively studied due to complicated synthesis and unknown properties. Here, for the first time, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels with high yield and purity, tunable size, uniform morphology, and good colloidal stability were synthesized using the emulsion&#8208;free method, which cannot be obtained by the miniemulsion method. Importantly, the dendrimer nanogels integrate the advantages of low&#8208;generation dendrimer and stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer, thus achieving dual&#8208;active groups, o&#8208;hydroxyl amine units, temperature&#8208;responsiveness, polyampholyte property, and self&#8208;triggered aminolysis. With these unique properties, dendrimer nanogels can &#8220;temporarily&#8221; acquire high charge density through the covalent crosslinking of low&#8208;generation dendrimer for improved DNA compression, promoted cell internalization and lysosomal escape, and efficient DNA delivery, followed by self&#8208;triggered aminolysis into small dendrimers to control DNA release, reduce cytotoxicity, and facilitate metabolism in vivo. Compared to high&#8208;generation dendrimers, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels display higher gene transfection and therapeutic efficacies, and lower side effects simultaneously. This work provides a facile strategy for the preparation of low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels that break up the contradiction between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors in gene therapy. This innovative approach to construct low&#8208;generation dendrimers into smart dendrimer nanogels will have broad applicability in clinical translation.

         <title>Homogenized Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a rigid SAM (PhPAPy), designed to leverage the structural tunability of SAMs for achieving uniform substrate coverage with a single molecule. The high&#8208;quality HTL based on PhPAPy effectively minimizes direct perovskite&#8211;electrode contact, reduces defect density, and suppresses nonradiative recombination at the buried interface. The champion device achieved a certified reverse&#8208;scan PCE of 26.74% while maintaining T95&#160;=&#160;2000&#160;h long&#8208;term stability (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).








Abstract
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly improved, driven by advancements in self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs). However, achieving homogeneous SAM coverage on substrates remains challenging, directly impacting device performance and stability. Here, we present (4&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (PhPAPy), a SAM with a rigid aromatic ring structure. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that this rigidity limits rotational freedom, promoting a near&#8208;vertical molecular orientation on the substrate. Additionally, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the planar pyrene rings enhance molecular packing, forming a homogeneous and dense SAM layer. As a result, the uniform PhPAPy effectively minimizes perovskite&#8211;substrate direct contact, enhances the interfacial properties, reduces buried interface defects, and improves both efficiency and stability. With PhPAPy SAM, the assembled inverted PSCs achieve a certified reverse&#8208;scanning power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.74% and a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 26.12% (from National Institute of Metrology in China). These devices retain 95% of their initial efficiency after 2000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5G illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C and ambient humidity (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

&lt;p&gt;We report a rigid SAM (PhPAPy), designed to leverage the structural tunability of SAMs for achieving uniform substrate coverage with a single molecule. The high-quality HTL based on PhPAPy effectively minimizes direct perovskite&#8211;electrode contact, reduces defect density, and suppresses nonradiative recombination at the buried interface. The champion device achieved a certified reverse-scan PCE of 26.74% while maintaining &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;95&#160;&lt;/sub&gt;=&#160;2000&#160;h long-term stability (ISOS-L-2).

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly improved, driven by advancements in self-assembled molecules (SAMs). However, achieving homogeneous SAM coverage on substrates remains challenging, directly impacting device performance and stability. Here, we present (4-(pyren-1-yl)phenyl)phosphonic acid (PhPAPy), a SAM with a rigid aromatic ring structure. &lt;i&gt;Ab&lt;/i&gt; initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations reveal that this rigidity limits rotational freedom, promoting a near-vertical molecular orientation on the substrate. Additionally, &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the planar pyrene rings enhance molecular packing, forming a homogeneous and dense SAM layer. As a result, the uniform PhPAPy effectively minimizes perovskite&#8211;substrate direct contact, enhances the interfacial properties, reduces buried interface defects, and improves both efficiency and stability. With PhPAPy SAM, the assembled inverted PSCs achieve a certified reverse-scanning power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.74% and a certified stabilized power output (SPO) efficiency of 26.12% (from National Institute of Metrology in China). These devices retain 95% of their initial efficiency after 2000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under continuous AM 1.5G illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C and ambient humidity (ISOS-L-2).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking Durable and Sustainable Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries via Molecularly Engineered Polyiodide Reservoirs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable &#8220;polyiodide reservoir&#8221;, engineered by the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities within covalent organic cages, is proposed as the iodine host. The resulting zinc&#8211;iodine battery demonstrates a capacity retention of 90.1% after 4000 cycles at 5 C and maintains 85.4% of its initial capacity after three reuse cycles.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for safe and sustainable energy storage but are hindered by polyiodide shuttling, leading to rapid capacity decay and limited cyclability. In this work, we propose a &#8220;polyiodide reservoirs&#8221; concept, utilizing iodophilic covalent organic cages to confine polyiodide through multiple noncovalent interactions. By precisely engineering the nitrogen&#8208;active site densities around 3D cavities, these cages evolve from open to near&#8208;enclosed structure, achieving molecular&#8208;level polyiodide entrapment. The optimized superphane cage (18 N&#8208;active sites) enables a ZIB with 90.1% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 5 C, even under extreme conditions (58.9 wt% iodine content within the cage and an iodine area loading of 3.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 in the cathode). Importantly, the cage's solubility&#8208;driven regeneration capability retains 85.4% initial capacity over three reuse cycles. This work establishes covalent organic superphanes as a transformative platform for long&#8208;life ZIBs, offering a dual solution to shuttle suppression and electrode sustainability through structural confinement and dynamic recyclability.

         <title>Giant Negative Thermal Expansion Induced by Topological Phase Transition in a Potassium Zinc Phosphate Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
KZnP3O9 exhibits record negative thermal expansion (&#916;V/V&#160;= &#8722;11.49%) through an unprecedented topological phase transition, where infinite (PO4)&#8734; chains reorganize into discrete P3O9 rings. The synergistic couplings among K+ sublattice compression, covalent bond rearrangement, and vibrational destabilization drive this giant negative thermal expansion.








Abstract
Negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials exhibit the counterintuitive property of volume contraction upon heating, which is critical for precision engineering applications. While significant progress has been made in NTE material discovery and mechanism understanding, developing cost&#8208;effective systems with strong NTE effects remains challenging. Here we report that an economical phosphate material, KZn(PO3)3, which demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking volumetric contraction (&#916;V/V&#160;= &#8722;11.49%) during its low&#8208;temperature to high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This exceptional NTE behavior originates from an unprecedented topological phase transition involving structural reorganization from infinite (PO4)&#8734;&#8208;chains (C&#8734; symmetry) to discrete P3O9&#8208;rings (C3 symmetry). The variable&#8208;cell nudged elastic band, ab initio molecular dynamics, and self&#8208;consistent phonon calculations reveal a threefold mechanism: (1) reduced K&#8211;K distance minimize electrostatic repulsion, (2) covalent bond rearrangement enables the chain&#8208;to&#8208;ring transformation, and (3) pronounced vibrational modes of O1 atoms destabilize the anionic chains, promoting their cleavage. Concurrently, these cooperative effects drive the observed giant NTE, while the resulting hexagonal&#8208;closed&#8208;packed (hcp) K+ sublattice further enhances structural contraction.

         <title>Blocky Selective Postpolymerization C&#8211;H Functionalization of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8211;H functionalization of polyolefins in a solvent&#8208;swollen semicrystalline state favored selectivity for blocky microstructures. Blocky microstructures preserved the crystallinity size, percent, and strength of polyolefins in comparison to their random analogues.








Abstract
C&#8211;H functionalization of commodity polyolefins affords functional materials derived from a high&#8208;volume, low&#8208;cost resource. However, current postpolymerization modification strategies result in randomly distributed functionalization along the length of the polymer backbone, which has a negative impact on the crystallinity of the resultant polymers, and thus the thermomechanical properties. Here, we demonstrate an amidyl radical mediated C&#8211;H functionalization of polyolefins to access blocky microstructures, which exhibit a higher crystalline fraction, larger crystallite size, and improved mechanical properties compared to their randomly functionalized analogues. Taking inspiration from the site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalization of small molecules, we leverage the steric protection provided by crystallites and target polymer functionalization to amorphous domains in a semicrystalline polyolefin gel. The beneficial outcomes of blocky functionalization are independent of the identity of the pendant functional group that is installed through functionalization. The decoupling of functional group incorporation and crystallinity highlights the promise in accessing nonrandom microstructures through selective functionalization to circumvent traditional tradeoffs in postpolymerization modification, with potential impact in advanced materials and upcycling plastic waste.

         <title>Structural Origin of Spin&#8208;Orbit Splitting of 1P Orbitals of Icosahedral Au13 Superatom Protected by Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 30, July 21, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;orbit (SO) splitting of the superatomic 1P orbitals in thiolate&#8208;protected Au13 superatoms were investigated. Cryogenic anion photoelectron spectroscopy and fully relativistic calculation including SO coupling revealed the 1P orbitals of the Au13 and Au@Ag12 superatomic cores undergo SO splitting, while not in the Ag13 core.








Abstract
The key structural factors underlying the spin&#8208;orbit (SO) splitting of the 1P orbitals in thiolate&#8208;protected Au13 superatoms were investigated using cryogenic anion photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) and two&#8208;component density functional theory (2c&#8208;DFT) calculations. PES revealed that the 1P orbitals of the Au13 and Au@Ag12 superatomic cores undergo splitting, whereas those of the Ag13 core do not. According to 2c&#8208;DFT calculations, the SO splitting of the 1P orbitals of the Au13 superatom stems from the symmetry&#8208;dictated coupling between the 6p orbitals of the central Au atom and the 1P orbitals formed by the surrounding icosahedral Au12 shell, both of which are split by SO effects.

         <title>Ligand Type Guided Keto&#8208;Arylation Enables Modular Total Synthesis of Polycyclic CBS Xanthones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand type concept guided a central aromatic keto&#8208;arylation in the first total syntheses of CBS72, CBS87 and CBS100. Davis oxidation with catalytic base and late&#8208;stage aminolysis completed the route. This strategy provides modular, concise and high&#8208;yielding access to uncharted polycyclic xanthones. Meanwhile, ligand types emerge as a powerful design tool in sophisticated cross couplings.








Abstract
The first total synthesis of the potent polycyclic xanthone antibiotics CBS72, CBS87 and CBS100 was accomplished by a modular strategy featuring a very demanding intermolecular aromatic keto&#8208;arylation. Central to the solution was a recently&#8208;developed ligand type approach, rather than brute force screening, demonstrating the usefulness of this novel concept in complex target synthesis. Additional key features include an asymmetric Davis hydroxylation proceeding with only catalytic amounts of base, thus enabling the conversion of a highly sensitive, elaborate substrate. Furthermore, a late&#8208;stage aminolysis completed the polycyclic framework, circumventing laborious protective group chemistry. Together, this strategy provides a concise, high&#8208;yielding access, confirming the full architecture of this most potent class of polyaromatic xanthones, and establishes ligand types as a powerful design tool for sophisticated cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>The Overlooked Dual Phosphorescence of Lappert's Diamino Stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 shows rich photophysics and photochemistry: unprecedented dual green/orange phosphorescence with long excited state lifetimes, excimer formation, and unimolecular bond homolysis. Photolytic Sn&#9472;N bond homolysis occurs only in the long&#8208;lived excited monomer but not in the excimer.








Abstract
The first stable heavy carbene homologues, the heavy tetrylenes, were reported in 1973 by Lappert and coworkers. These tetrylenes were extensively investigated with respect to ground state reactivity, such as small molecule activation, insertion into &#963;&#8208;bonds, coordination chemistry, materials chemistry, or catalysis. Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that the bright yellow&#8208;colored diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed, involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second&#8208;order Jahn&#8211;Teller distorted structures. The present study provides new insights toward a rational design of tetrel(II) complexes with long&#8208;lived emissive excited states, with Sn[N(SiMe3)2]2 being the prototype.

         <title>Revealing Parallel Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Dynamics in [Ru(L)2(dppz)]2+ Molecular Lightswitch with N K&#8208;Edge X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
The inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light&#8208;driven charge separation in the well&#8208;studied &#8220;molecular lightswitch&#8221; [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (aqueous [RutheniumII(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine)]2+[Cl&#8722;]2) were tracked by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real&#8208;time using ultrafast X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations.








Abstract
In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light&#8208;driven charge separation in the well&#8208;studied &#8220;molecular lightswitch&#8221; [Ru(bpy)2dppz]2+ (aqueous [RutheniumII(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine)]2+[Cl&#8722;]2) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real&#8208;time using ultrafast X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. Sub&#8208;70&#160;fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra&#8208;ligand electron transfer following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;dppz metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2&#160;ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time&#8208;resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter&#8208;ligand electron &#8220;hopping&#8221; between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru&#8208;to&#8208;bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well&#8208;studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light&#8208;driven electron transfer chemistry.

         <title>A C&#8208;to&#8208;B Atom Swap on Coumarins and Dibenzolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic boronic hemiesters, boron isosteres of lactones, display unique and valuable chemical properties. Herein, we report a novel method for their synthesis via nickel&#8208;catalyzed decarbonylative borylation, enabled by electron&#8208;rich phosphine ligands to achieve a formal &#8220;C&#8208;to&#8208;B&#8221; atom swap. This strategy efficiently transforms a variety of coumarin derivatives and seven&#8208;membered dibenzolactones into the corresponding benzoxaborines, showcasing broad functional group tolerance and synthetic versatility.








Abstract
We report a carbon&#8208;to&#8208;boron &#8220;C&#8208;to&#8208;B&#8221; atom swap reaction to transform readily available coumarins into their isosteric benzoxaborins via a net replacement of the C&#9552;O group with a B&#9472;OH moiety. These conditions were applied to coumarin natural products and other 6&#8211;7&#8208;membered lactones (25 examples, 29%&#8211;93%). We leverage this methodology to transform a flat polyaromatic hydrocarbon into three&#8208;dimensional tribenzo[b.d.f]oxepines through a series of atom&#8208;swapping reactions followed by ring expansion via the oxaborin intermediate.

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation platform has been developed for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines. In contrast to natural NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent C&#9552;N bond reductases, this strategy employs carbonic anhydrase or P450 as a catalyst in combination with a silane&#8208;reducing agent, offering a fully orthogonal alternative to conventional NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent cellular processes.








Abstract
Chiral amines are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic catalysts. Their increasing demand has driven the advancement of synthetic methods. In this study, we developed a metalloenzyme&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method for the synthesis of chiral amines. Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent C&#9552;N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent cellular functions. This reactivity highlights the potential to develop new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic functions capable of addressing challenges in both organic synthesis and biosynthesis.

     alt="Metalloenzyme-Catalyzed Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation for the Synthesis of Chiral Amines"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metalloenzyme-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation platform has been developed for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines. In contrast to natural NAD(P)H-dependent C&#9552;N bond reductases, this strategy employs carbonic anhydrase or P450 as a catalyst in combination with a silane-reducing agent, offering a fully orthogonal alternative to conventional NAD(P)H-dependent cellular processes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral amines are prevalent in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and organic catalysts. Their increasing demand has driven the advancement of synthetic methods. In this study, we developed a metalloenzyme-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation method for the synthesis of chiral amines. Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H-dependent C&#9552;N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H-dependent cellular functions. This reactivity highlights the potential to develop new-to-nature enzymatic functions capable of addressing challenges in both organic synthesis and biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conduction Band Convergence and Modular Nanostructures: Driving High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type PbSe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo 4d orbital hybridized with the Se 4p&#8208;Pb 6p to provide conduction band convergence, and PbSe&#8208;MoSe2 modular nanostructures lead to high thermoelectric performance in MoCl5 doped n&#8208;type PbSe.








Abstract
n&#8208;type lead chalcogenides showing high thermoelectric performance are rare due to the larger energy offset between the two lowest energy conduction bands minima, leaving ample opportunity to modulate electronic structure for improving their thermoelectric performance. Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of &#8764;1.8 at 873&#160;K in n&#8208;type PbSe doped with MoCl5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4d orbital hybridized with the Se 4p&#8208;Pb 6p. This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n&#8208;type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (&#963;S2) of &#8764;21 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 873&#160;K for PbSe&#160;+&#160;1 mol% MoCl5. When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano&#8208;heterostructures (5&#8208;30&#160;nm) of PbSe&#8208;MoSe2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano&#8208;heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of 0.20&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at &#8764;725&#160;K in PbSe&#160;+&#160;1 mol% MoCl5 sample.

         <title>Synergistic Covalently and Mechanically Interlocked Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the innovative design and construction of a synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP), in which the covalent polymer (CP) and the mechanically interlocked polymer (MIP) are seamlessly integrated into a unified system. This design effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional polymer networks, establishing a new paradigm in the field of novel materials design.








Abstract
Integrating different polymer types into a unified system in a thoughtful manner leverages their complementary advantages, providing a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance materials. Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs), characterized by their unique spatial entanglement, exhibit distinctive performance advantages, yet their potential to expand material properties through rational integration with other polymer architectures presents substantial opportunities for continued investigation. Herein, we report a coherent integration of covalent polymers (CPs) and mechanically interlocked polymers through sequential orthogonal polymerizations, developing a novel synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP) featuring both structural stability and force&#8208;induced dynamics. Compared to its structurally similar but noninterlocked control sample, CMIP demonstrates markedly enhanced thermomechanical stability and performance recovery, achieving a 93.4% recovery efficiency at 100% strain after just 5 min of rest, in contrast to 59.7% for the control. This remarkable stability and recovery result from the synergistic interplay between the covalent polymer framework and the interlocked structure, which work in tandem to preserve network integrity and enable rapid host&#8722;guest reformation. Notably, despite this significant improvement, CMIP retains a comparable damping capacity (91%&#160;versus 87%) and material toughness (14.8&#160;versus 15.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), owing to the efficient energy dissipation mechanisms enabled by host&#8722;guest dissociation and subsequent sliding motion. This strategy imparts CMIP with unique characteristics, offering a prospective pathway for the development of a diverse array of advanced synergistic materials with enhanced, multifaceted properties.

         <title>Collision&#8208;Induced Fragmentation of Oligosaccharides: Mechanistic Insights for Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Glycomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycan fragmentation with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry (MS) leads to a range of specific disassembly mechanisms, which are being reviewed in detail.








Abstract
Structural alterations in oligosaccharides are often associated with disease, positioning clinical glycomics as an emerging tool for diagnostics. This is most commonly achieved using a controlled collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) of larger oligosaccharides into fragments and measuring their mass in a mass spectrometer. Due to the complexity of oligosaccharides, and particularly their unusual fragmentation mechanisms, the underlying processes are poorly understood. Deciphering glycan fragmentation and making it understandable is highly desirable and would transform the field of glycomics from an expert technique into a widely applicable tool available to non&#8208;specialists. Here, we review the current knowledge of glycan fragmentation mechanisms in CID, with particular emphasis on hexose migrations and the anomeric memory. We discuss challenges and perspectives for future investigations, opening the window to widespread use of glycomics in clinical applications based on a fundamental understanding of glycan fragmentation.

         <title>Photoresponsive Slide&#8208;Ring Gels Enable Modulation of Sliding Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;responsive cyclodextrin&#8208;based slide&#8208;ring gels are presented, which allow for a reversible modulation of the sliding dynamics. Upon light irradiation, the azobenzene&#8208;containing network polymers are isomerized, which alters their binding affinity toward the threaded cyclodextrins. As a result, the macrocycle sliding dynamics change, allowing for a reversible switching of the material's mechanical properties between a stiff and a soft state.








Abstract
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based slide&#8208;ring gels (SRGs) have emerged as a promising class of materials owing to their unique topology. Upon mechanical loading, the slidable cross&#8208;links of the polymer network freely translocate along the polymer backbone enabling pronounced energy dissipation in the material, which is associated with exceptional ductility and toughness. Despite the critical role of sliding dynamics in defining SRG mechanical properties, attempts to control them have primarily been limited to tuning the overall loading of macrocycles. Further, SRGs that can be triggered via an external stimulus have yet to be reported. In this work, we present light&#8208;responsive SRGs based on azobenzene&#8208;containing polymers. Reversible photoswitching of the azobenzenes modulates the sliding dynamics of the threaded &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) macrocycles. By using UV&#8211;Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that &#945;&#8208;CDs readily bind to the azobenzenes along the polymer backbone in the E configuration. Upon light irradiation, and thus isomerization to the Z isomer, the macrocycles no longer interact with the azobenzenes, allowing them to freely translocate along the polymer backbone. As a result of this E to Z isomerization and difference in sliding dynamics, the mechanical properties of the SRGs reversibly alternate between a stiff and a soft state.

         <title>Exposure of Au Atom on Au(111) in Metal Nanoclusters for pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

An exposed Au atom on Au(111) in Au52 nanoclusters and as&#8208;formed surface/interface environment were constructed by introducing nonaromatic ligand. In situ characterizations and simulations confirmed the activation of CO2 and the accelerated protonation of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water by the surface/interface modification, leading to pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysis with high activity, selectivity, and durability.








Abstract
The control of surface and interface structures in nanocatalysts is a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic performance, but significant challenges persist in achieving precisely designed active sites or environments on the surface/interface of fully protected metal nanoclusters. In this study, we report the construction of an exposed Au atom on Au(111) and the formation of a unique surface/interface environment on the Au52 cluster via a cyclopentanethiol&#8208;etching strategy. Theoretical calculations and in situ attenuated total reflection infrared adsorption spectroscopy reveal that the exposed Au atom facilitates CO2 activation, while the tailored surface/interface environment promotes the accumulation of strongly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water, which can be validated by the molecular dynamic simulation, thus enhancing proton transfer and suppressing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, the surface/interface&#8208;modified Au52 cluster showcases high activity, selectivity, and durability across pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral, and alkaline) electrolytes, providing new insights for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts at atomic level.

         <title>Angularly Resolved Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We find that the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal (TERS) is angularly distributed and vibrational mode specific. The radiation pattern in the back focal plane (BFP) of vertical or parallel Raman dipoles is strongly influenced by the near&#8208;field in the TERS nanogap, while the emission is guided into the far&#8208;field with high directionality by the tip&#8208;sample antenna; however, with significant differences in the emission angle, intensity, and the divergency.

Abstract
Despite intensive research in tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), the angular distribution of Raman scattering in the TERS gap remains experimentally unreported leaving its relevance to the TERS signal formation to be seldomly discussed. Here, we investigate the angular distribution of the tip&#8208;enhanced Raman signal in the Fourier plane using a model system composed of flat&#8208;lying cobalt (II) hexadecafluoro&#8208;phthalocyanine (CoPcF16) molecules physically adsorbed on a smooth gold surface. Both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational modes are observed, where the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Raman modes at about 678 and 740&#160;cm&#8722;1 have different angular intensity distributions than those of in&#8208;plane Raman modes at 1309 and 1373&#160;cm&#8722;1. We interpret the angular spectrum of the TERS signal considering the molecular vibrational modes computed with density functional theory (DFT) for the free and gold&#8208;deposited molecule, and the directed Raman scattering by the gap&#8208;mode predicted by finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulations. We contend that the TERS gap directs the Raman vibrational modes differently, leading to distinct angularly distributed Raman scattering intensities. These findings emphasize the nonnegligible role of the TERS detection scheme in understanding spectral features, such as the relative peak intensity ratio variations for studying molecular orientations, or for monitoring chemical reactions.

         <title>Design of Fluorine&#8208;Free Weakly Coordinating Electrolyte Solvents with Enhanced Oxidative Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of silicon is systematically explored as a sustainable strategy to design weakly solvating electrolytes for lithium&#8208;based batteries. After identifying a promising molecular structure via computational screening, coordination spheres and their correlation with electrochemical key performance indicators are compared between electrolyte formulations, revealing that negative hyperconjugation enhances their oxidative stability.








Abstract
High concentrations of conducting salt in electrolyte formulations enhance the agglomeration of ionic species, which has been demonstrated to yield anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases and improved reversibility in several battery configurations. However, industrial application of these electrolytes may be limited due to high costs of electrolyte conducting salts. Here, weakly solvating electrolyte solvents with tailored coordination strength have been established as an approach to achieve ionic agglomeration at moderate conducting salt concentrations and without per&#8208;fluorinated diluents. However, the inevitable presence of uncoordinated solvent molecules in this electrolyte concept renders them susceptible to oxidative decomposition. Although previous efforts demonstrated fluorination as an effective design strategy to tailor the oxidative stability of weakly solvating electrolytes, the per&#8208;fluorinated solvents are toxic and harmful to the environment. Herein, the incorporation of silicon is evaluated as an eco&#8208;friendly approach to dispel electron density of the oxygen lone pair. Though steric demand of substituents is already sufficient to tailor the coordination strength, negative hyperconjugation effectively expands the oxidative stability limit of weakly solvating electrolytes. Combining ion agglomeration and intrinsic oxidative stability, the herein introduced weakly solvating electrolyte enables a notable improvement of reversibility under eco&#8208;friendly conditions, presenting a valid alternative to fluorinated electrolyte solvents.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Ligation of Four Different Alcohols at One Silicon Center: Methodology Development and Proof of Concept</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylchlorosilane (Ph3SiCl) was developed as a tetrachlorosilane surrogate for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center to generate fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the unusual transformations of Wheland intermediates into both silicon cations and silylated phenylhalonium ions in low and comparable activation barriers.








Abstract
While critical and indispensable in diversified areas, organosilicon compounds are not naturally occurring and all rely on chemical synthesis. The de novo synthesis of them via quadruple substitutions of tetrachlorosilane was one of the most straightforward and common practices but confronted over&#8208;substitution challenges for heteroleptic silanes, especially the ones with four different substituents. Although selective and iterative substitutions at silicon have achieved notable achievements, methods for fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes are still lacking. Herein, we established the key dephenylative etherification reaction coupling phenylsilanes and alcohols to alkoxysilanes and then developed triphenylchlorosilane (Ph3SiCl) as the surrogate to tetrachlorosilane for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center as fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes. Mechanistic studies revealed the unusual transformations of Wheland intermediates into both silicon cations and silylated phenylhalonium ions in low and comparable activation barriers.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters were developed through the construction of multipathway charge transfer characteristics. OLEDs employing the optimized molecule as the terminal emitter and as a sensitizer exhibit high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, achieving EQEs of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, with corresponding CIE&#8208;y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.








Abstract
BT.2020&#8208;compliant deep&#8208;blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are in high demand to achieve a wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays. Herein, we report deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters featuring a unique donor1&#8208;donor2&#8208;acceptor (D1&#8208;D2&#8208;A) molecular configuration in which C1&#8208;N linked carbazole derivatives serve as dual&#8208;function donors and an oxygen&#8208;bridged triarylboron unit acts as the acceptor. The new design strategy focuses on constructing excited states with multipathway charge transfer characteristics&#8212;including multiresonance, through&#8208;bond, and through&#8208;space charge transfer&#8212;by precisely tuning the relative electron&#8208;donating strengths of the D1 and D2 units. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the optimized emitter, BO&#8208;BTC, achieves a well&#8208;balanced trade&#8208;off among emission efficiency, color purity, singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, and horizontal dipole orientation ratio. Consequently, OLEDs using BO&#8208;BTC as the terminal emitter or as the sensitizer for &#957;&#8208;DABNA achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage&#8208;y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.

         <title>Synergistic Modulation of Intermediate Adsorption and Active Hydrogen Supply Enable Pulsed Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Hydroxylamine Electroreduction with Nearly 100% Faradaic Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
This study develops boron&#8208;doped amorphous bismuth metallene arrays for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;hydroxylamine electroreduction. The B&#8208;induced p&#8208;sp orbital hybridization and amorphous structure modulate the electronic configuration and increase active site density, thus optimizing intermediate adsorption and H* generation while lowering the energy barrier of the potential determining step. The catalyst achieves 85.3% NH&#8322;OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus RHE, which further rises to nearly 100% under pulsed potential operation, surpassing most reported systems. 








Abstract
Electrochemical hydroxylamine (NH2OH) synthesis from NOx under ambient conditions presents a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial methods, but its selectivity remains limited by unbalanced active hydrogen (H*) supply and intermediate adsorption. Herein, we develop boron&#8208;doped amorphous Bi metallene arrays for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH electroreduction. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B&#8208;induced p&#8208;sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH&#8322;OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts. This work not only proposes a novel catalyst design leveraging amorphous engineering and orbital hybridization but also demonstrates the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis in steering reaction pathways for electrosynthesis.

         <title>Crystal Facet&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution From Ultra&#8208;Stable Cu&#8208;Zr/Hf Heterobimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering and facet engineering were concurrently employed to develop a series of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free heterobimetallic MOFs (M&#8208;BCA&#8208;M', M&#160;=&#160;Cu+, M'&#160;=&#160;Zr4+ or Hf4+) for record&#8208;high photocatalytic hydrogen production in pristine MOFs. The high performance and crystal&#8208;facet dependent behaviors were investigated to provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the coordination regulation and morphology control of pristine MOFs for efficient photocatalysis.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water splitting for hydrogen production over metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is particularly attractive yet remains a challenge. Here, we report a series of ultra&#8208;stable heterobimetallic MOFs (M&#8208;BCA&#8208;M', M&#160;=&#160;Cu+, M&#8242;&#160;=&#160;Zr4+ or Hf4+) for photocatalytic hydrogen production, in which, the Cu(I) species act as the active center, whereas Zr(IV)/Hf(IV) plays an essential role in stabilizing the framework. Uniform MOF crystals with distinct morphologies were obtained, showing a rare crystal facet&#8208;dependent photocatalytic behavior. The octahedral MOF crystals denoted as Cu&#8208;BCA&#8208;Hf&#8208;O with the exposure of only {101} and {011} facets exhibit a record&#8208;high hydrogen production rate (49825.71&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) among pristine MOF photocatalysts. The exceptional performance of Cu&#8208;BCA&#8208;Hf&#8208;O can be primarily attributed to its superior photogenerated carrier transfer ability and abundant active sites exposed on the crystal surface. This study provides molecular&#8208;level insights into the coordination regulation and morphology control of MOFs for highly efficient photocatalysis, highlighting the promising future of pristine MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Driven Ion Transport Homogenization in 3D Hierarchical MOF for Ultrastable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical pore channels of MIL&#8208;100 confine LiI to form a conductive ionic network, while its triple&#8208;level cross&#8208;linked multi&#8208;stage porous restricts TFSI&#8315; anion mobility, enabling rapid Li&#8314; transport and uniform deposition by optimizing ion flux and suppressing space charge effects.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are hindered by limited ionic conductivity, heterogeneous lithium flux and interfacial instability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Herein, we report a hierarchical ion&#8208;transport network formed by confining lithium halides (LiX, X&#9552;Cl, Br, I) within the mesoporous cages of MIL&#8208;100(Al), synergistically integrated with a PVDF&#8208;HFP polymer matrix. The 3D interconnected pores (0.5&#8211;1&#160;nm) of MIL&#8208;100(Al) not only spatially confine anions via size&#8208;selective sieving but also enable continuous Li&#8314; transport through tunable host&#8211;guest interactions between the Lewis&#8208;acidic metal nodes and lithium halides. Among these, the LiI&#8208;embedded composite (E&#8208;LiI) exhibits a high Li&#8314; transference number (0.88 at 25&#160;&#176;C) and favorable interfacial kinetics, attributed to strong anion coordination and homogeneous Li&#8314; plating. Structural characterizations confirm uniform LiX distribution within the MOF framework. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL simulation elucidate halogen&#8208;dependent desolvation energetics and Li+ transport kinetics. SSLMBs employing E&#8208;LiI electrolytes demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (capacity retention &#8764;100% after 600 cycles at 2C) with high&#8208;voltage cathodes and wide&#8208;temperature adaptability. This work advances the rational design of multi&#8208;scale ion&#8208;conductive frameworks and the pivotal role of lithium halide in regulating Li deposition kinetics, offering a transformative strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state battery systems.

         <title>Regiodivergent Photocatalytic Annulation for the Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regiodivergent photocatalytic annulation of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea with olefins or bicyclobutanes (BCBs) has been developed. The regioselectivity is controlled by the proper choice of counteranion of the cationic iridium photocatalyst and solvent. This protocol enables straightforward access to diverse cyclic amino hydrocarbons, including functionalized bicyclic scaffolds of distinct three&#8208;dimensional architectures, with precise deployment of the gem&#8208;difluoromethylene groups, cultivating a chemical space for bioisosteres.








Abstract
Regiodivergent synthesis is a powerful strategy for expanding chemical space. Given the significance of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules in pharmaceutical sciences, a regiodivergent [3+2] cycloaddition of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropyl urea to olefins and [1.1.0]&#8208;bicyclobutanes was developed by employing cationic iridium complexes as photocatalysts under visible&#8208;light irradiation. By properly selecting a counteranion of the photocatalyst and tuning the reaction conditions, each regioisomeric cyclic hydrocarbon with a defined gem&#8208;difluoromethylene disposition was directly assembled with high selectivity. Mechanistic elucidation revealed the critical relevance of the basicity of the photocatalyst counteranion to the regiochemical outcome. The reaction diverges depending on the intervention of deprotonation of the initially generated urea radical cation by the pairing anion to form the corresponding neutral radical; this not only governs the regioselective ring opening of the cyclopropane moiety but also modulates the relative reactivity of the two resulting terminal carbon radicals, thereby dictating the dominant pathway.

         <title>Deciphering Tryptophan Oxygenation: Key Modulators of 2&#8208;Oxindole Formation in MarE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that MarE, a heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenase, favors dioxygenation of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan in the absence of ascorbate and demonstrates how structural and redox tuning shifts its reactivity toward selective monooxygenation, yielding a 2&#8208;oxindole scaffold. These findings offer new insights into enzyme&#8208;controlled indole oxidation in tryptophan&#8208;derived natural products.








Abstract
MarE, a heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenase with a histidyl axial ligation, catalyzes the monooxygenation of &#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan to form a 2&#8208;oxindole scaffold central to maremycin biosynthesis. Although structurally similar to tryptophan 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (TDO), which initiates l&#8208;tryptophan catabolism via dioxygenation, MarE exhibits distinct reactivity modulated by ascorbate.

     alt="Deciphering Tryptophan Oxygenation: Key Modulators of 2-Oxindole Formation in MarE"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reveals that MarE, a heme-dependent aromatic oxygenase, favors dioxygenation of &#946;-methyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-tryptophan in the absence of ascorbate and demonstrates how structural and redox tuning shifts its reactivity toward selective monooxygenation, yielding a 2-oxindole scaffold. These findings offer new insights into enzyme-controlled indole oxidation in tryptophan-derived natural products.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MarE, a heme-dependent aromatic oxygenase with a histidyl axial ligation, catalyzes the monooxygenation of &#946;-methyl-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-tryptophan to form a 2-oxindole scaffold central to maremycin biosynthesis. Although structurally similar to tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), which initiates &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-tryptophan catabolism via dioxygenation, MarE exhibits distinct reactivity modulated by ascorbate. While ascorbate has no effect on TDO, it promotes selective monooxygenation by MarE. In its absence, MarE favors dioxygenation and formation of pyrroloindoline products, revealing latent catalytic versatility. Active-site loop sequences differ between the two enzymes, SLGGR in MarE versus GTGGS in TDO, prompting loop-swapping experiments to probe structure-function relationships. Substituting GTGGS in TDO to MarE-like sequences (GTGGA or SLGGS) shifted reactivity toward monooxygenation and formation of C3-hydroxylated, non-oxindole products that underwent further cyclization into tricyclic structures. Conversely, replacing SLGGR in MarE with GTGGS resulted in enhanced C2,C3-dioxygenation nearly 4-fold. These results underscore the active-site loop as a key determinant of oxidation outcome, alongside the modulatory role of ascorbate. By revealing the true catalytic identity of MarE and delineating the roles of small-molecule effectors and loop architecture, this study advances mechanistic understanding and predictive capabilities within the oxygenase superfamily.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Exposed Silver Clusters Enabling Highly Efficient Photocatalytic H2O2 Production in Pure Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully exposed silver clusters were successfully anchored on poly(heptazinimide), demonstrating exceptional photocatalytic activity toward H2O2 generation in pure water from O2. Systematic evaluation revealed that it also exhibited significantly enhanced performance compared to their single&#8208;atom counterpart due to superior electronic properties and synergetic effect between adjacent Ag atoms.








Abstract
Photocatalytic production of H2O2 in pure water holds great potential for sustainable industry. However, this prospect is greatly hindered by its sluggish reaction kinetics involving multistep electron transfer and unstable intermediates. Herein, the fully exposed silver (Ag) clusters were anchored on poly(heptazinimide) (PHI) catalyst, forming a new kind of fully exposed cluster catalysts (FECCs), which can boost photocatalytic generation of H2O2 in pure water, with a rate up to 1075.5&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing its Ag single atoms counterpart and many recent&#8208;reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. In situ characterization and DFT analysis showed that fully exposed Ag clusters can form the electron&#8208;rich centers and optimize the binding energy of the O2 and proton H, which in turn enhances the protonation process of *OOH, reducing the energy barrier of key steps, and finally leading to a high yield of H2O2. Interestingly, its Ag single&#8208;atom counterpart was favorable for decomposing the H2O2 into &#183;OH. Thus, Ag FECCs achieve significantly enhanced tetracycline degradation efficiency with the strategic incorporation of Ag single atoms.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks: Design Strategy, Structure Feature, and Applications in Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the synthesis strategies, structural characteristics, and structural regulation strategies of metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), as well as their electrochemical energy storage performance in various energy storage devices (LIBs, LMBs, ZABs, Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, LSBs, ZIBs, and SCs).








Abstract
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), which can integrate the properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), exhibit high stability, adjustable pore structures, and catalytic activity of metal sites owing to the synergistic interaction between metal sites and covalent backbones. In this regard, MCOFs have gained significant attention as promising electrode materials, where metal ions (Mn+) function as molecular structure switches, providing MCOFs with diverse active sites and modifying their charge density by incorporating different Mn+, thereby imparting unique energy&#8208;storage properties to MCOFs. Furthermore, by optimizing the synthesis strategies of MCOFs, their topological and dimensional structures can be regulated to ensure the stability of the MCOFs. In the challenging landscape of energy storage, MCOFs have surpassed the performance limitations of traditional COFs. Through precise atomic&#8208;level control of metal sites and innovative design of dynamic covalent chemistry, they can significantly enhance the performance of batteries, achieving remarkable performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, and other applications. This review systematically summarizes the research advancements of MCOFs in high&#8208;performance energy storage devices, including lithium&#8208;ion, Li&#8211;CO2, and Zn&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, it examines the synthesis strategies, structural regulation, and structural characteristics of MCOFs to address the challenges encountered in various energy storage devices.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Suppressing Energy Migration via Antiparallel Spin Alignment in One&#8208;Dimensional Mn2+ Halide Magnets with High Luminescence Efficiency&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of one&#8208;dimensional (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC) doped with Cd2+ remains consistently high (&#8764;95%) across the studied composition range (x&#160;=&#160;Cdx/Mn1&#8208;x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.22). By combining PL lifetime measurements, high&#8208;pressure optical absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray diffraction structural analysis, we demonstrate that the PLQY exhibits only minimal dependence on x. This finding contrasts with recent reports,1 claiming that the PLQY initially rises with Cd2+ content up to x&#160;=&#160;0.08, then declines sharply from 95% to 77% at x&#160;=&#160;0.22.








Abstract
The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of tetramethyl ammonium manganese(II) chloride, (CH3)4NMnCl3 (TMMC), doped with Cd2+/Cu2+ is analyzed through photoluminescence measurements, X&#8208;ray diffraction, optical absorption, and time&#8208;resolved excitation and emission under hydrostatic pressure. Contrary to recent studies reporting a PLQY increase up to x&#160;=&#160;Cdx/Mn1&#8208;x&#160;=&#160;0.08 followed by a decline (from 95% to 77% at x&#160;=&#160;0.22),1 we demonstrate that the PLQY remains consistently high (&#8805;95%) across the concentration range x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;0.22.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Sided Multidentate Coordination Strategy Enables Record Birefringence in UV&#8208;Transparent Antimony&#8208;Based Hybrid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;shaped UV&#8208;transparent hybrid birefringence crystal, (C10H6NO2)2SbF (QCSF), with a record&#8208;breaking birefringence of 0.87 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported halide birefringent crystals with SCALPs, was successfully designed and synthesized through a dual&#8208;sided multidentate coordination strategy.








Abstract
Achieving ultrahigh birefringence in UV&#8208;transparent materials remains fundamentally constrained by the trade&#8208;off between strong optical anisotropy and wide bandgap transparency. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly&#8208;shaped UV organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals&#8212;(C6H4NO2)2SbF (PCSF) and (C10H6NO2)2SbF (QCSF)&#8212;in which planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record&#8208;high birefringence of &#916;n&#160;=&#160;0.87 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported lone&#8208;pair&#8208;containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN2O2F] coordination geometry, near&#8208;planar molecular configuration, and extended &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next&#8208;generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.

Herein, we report a dual-sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly-shaped UV organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid crystals&#8212;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbF (PCSF) and (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbF (QCSF)&#8212;in which planar &#960;-conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record-high birefringence of &#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0.87 at 546&#160;nm, surpassing all previously reported lone-pair-containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F] coordination geometry, near-planar molecular configuration, and extended &#960;-electron delocalization. First-principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the &#960;-conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next-generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Sieving Effect of Multi&#8208;Atomic Bismuth Interfaces for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis and Evolution at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;atomic Bi interfaces (Bi0/Bi&#948;+&#8722;O moiety) embedded in porous Bi2O3&#8208;x nanosheets featuring interfacial atomic sieving effect enabling efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion across pH ranges. The simultaneous production of formate on both the cathode and anode was also achieved by coupling CO2 reduction reaction with the methanol oxidation reaction under industrial current density conditions. Further intermediacy of the concentrated formate for C&#8211;N coupling toward urea synthesis, establishing pathway for sustainable evolution.








Abstract
Constructing multi&#8208;atomic interfaces architectures is promising for electrocatalytic CO2 conversion, yet their synthesis and stability under industrial current densities remain challenging. Herein, multi&#8208;atomic Bi interfaces (Bi0/Bi&#948;+&#8722;O moiety) were precisely engineered by embedding atomically dispersed Bi centers, encompassing Bi single atoms and Bi atomic clusters into the substrate of porous Bi2O3&#8208;x nanosheets. The composite showcases outstanding CO2 conversion performance across a wide pH range, attaining remarkable Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEformate) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long&#8208;term stability over 150&#160;h. Depending on the designed CH3OH electrooxidation catalyst (CuOx/ZnCo(OH)x) at the anode to couple with CO2 conversion, symmetrical/asymmetrical electrolyzers were developed. The approach could obtain high&#8208;added value products with FEformate&#160;&gt;90% at both electrodes, achieving a production rate of 4980&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under industrial current density. Combined in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that multiple atomic interfaces featuring interfacial atomic sieving effects effectively enhance preferential binding of *H and *CO2 to form *OCHO, while simultaneously suppressing the undesired recombination of hydrogen species into H2, rationalizing the high selectivity. Further intermediacy of concentrated formate precursors for subsequent C&#8211;N coupling toward urea synthesis, establishing a pathway for sustainable evolution.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Para&#8208;Xylene, Ethylbenzene, and Explicit Exclusion of Ortho&#8208;Xylene from Xylene Isomers Using a Pillar&#8208;Layered MOF with Tuned Pore Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Channel confinement via rigid cylindrical pillaring in a MOF framework enables molecular sieving through elliptical windows, offering a blueprint for ambient&#8208;condition xylene isomer separation.








Abstract
Xylene isomer separation is a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the nearly identical properties of para&#8208;xylene (PX), meta&#8208;xylene (MX), ortho&#8208;xylene (OX), and ethylbenzene (EB). Here, we report a rationally designed pillar&#8208;layered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni&#8208;HDB, incorporating a cylindrical 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) pillar that blocks lateral channels and directs molecular transport through elliptical windows (3.2&#160;&#215;&#160;6.7&#160;&#197;2). These apertures closely match the dimensions of PX and EB, enabling kinetic sieving. As a result, Ni&#8208;HDB exhibits high selectivity for PX and EB, moderate selectivity for MX, and exclusion of OX under ambient conditions. It achieves record liquid&#8208;phase selectivities for EB/OX (1943), PX/OX (951), and MX/OX (158), along with high PX and MX adsorption capacities. Comparative studies with isoreticular analogues confirm that DABCO&#8208;driven confinement is key to enhancing size&#8208;based selectivity. Density functional theory calculations indicate kinetic preference for PX and EB, thermodynamic favorability for MX, and exclusion of OX. Ni&#8208;HDB also shows excellent thermal and structural stability, with no performance loss over ten cycles. These results highlight the importance of channel geometry in MOFs and provide a framework for developing next&#8208;generation adsorbents for energy&#8208;efficient hydrocarbon separations.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Abasic Site&#8208;Reactive Probe (mTAP) Enables the Manipulation of Mitochondrial DNA Levels</title>

         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;targeting water&#8208;soluble probe mTAP exclusively reacts with mitochondrial abasic sites, enabling the manipulation of mitochondrial DNA levels under genotoxic stress. 








Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential genes for mitochondrial and cellular functions and acts as a cell signaling molecule in innate immune and inflammatory responses. Defects in mtDNA are implicated in a range of mitochondrial disorders and human diseases. Currently, no chemical strategy exists to prevent mtDNA loss under genotoxic stress. To address this, we developed a mitochondria&#8208;targeting probe (mTAP) that selectively reacts with key mtDNA repair intermediates&#8211;abasic (AP) sites. We confirmed that mTAP forms oxime conjugates exclusively with mitochondrial AP sites without conjugation with nuclear AP sites. Upon mTAP conjugation, DNA substrates containing AP sites were resistant to cleavage by AP endonuclease (APE1) and mitochondrial extracts. This conjugation significantly reduced the DNA&#8208;binding affinity of APE1 without affecting the DNA&#8208;binding activity of a mtDNA&#8208;packaging factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Importantly, cellular experiments demonstrated that mTAP treatment alleviated the decrease in mtDNA and transcription product levels induced by mitochondrial AP site damage. Functional assays also demonstrated that mTAP treatment did not compromise mtDNA replication activity or increase the overall mtDNA damage level. These findings highlight the potential of mTAP as a valuable chemical tool to modulate mtDNA levels under genotoxic stress.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Hydrogen Oxidation for Hydroxide Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells Catalyzed by Fivefold&#8208;Twinned Nickel Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fivefold&#8208;twinned nickel (Ni) nanoparticles exhibit a pronounced pull&#8208;up strain near the twin boundary (TB), with a gradual increase in the strain effect near the TB. The fivefold&#8208;twinned nanoparticles demonstrate an increased hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) and stable hydrogen binding energy (HBE) at the TB due to the strain effect, generating abundant and highly active sites in proximity to the TB. Special strain effect plays a crucial role in accelerating the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) process.








Abstract
The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer&#8211;N&#248;rskov d&#8208;band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold&#8208;twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high jk,m value of 106.6&#160;mA mgNi&#8722;1, which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with fivefold&#8208;twinned Ni nanoparticles anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with H2/O2 gas feed, which is the highest among Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts reported thus far. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits excellent&#160;long&#8208;term&#160;cycling&#160;performance, taking a giant step forward toward the commercialization of platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free HEMFCs.

         <title>Chiral Tin&#8208;Oxo Cluster Matrices with Fluorophore Embedment for Multichromatic Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantiomeric tin&#8208;oxo clusters form helical supramolecular matrices through directional intermolecular interactions, enabling efficient transfer of optical handedness to encapsulated non&#8208;chiral fluorophores via spatial confinement. These assemblies exhibit tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emissions.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;oxo clusters, characterized by their well&#8208;defined chemical compositions and architectures, are multi&#8208;metal aggregates composed of Sn&#8208;oxide cores and surface ligands. Chirality, a fundamental characteristic governing biological recognition and signal transduction, remains underexplored in stannate clusters compared to extensively studied precious metal clusters. Herein, three enantiomeric pairs of chiral tin&#8208;oxo clusters were constructed using axially chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol (BINOL) ligands. Structural analyses revealed supramolecular helical assemblies mediated by directional C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions, while circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed their intrinsic chirality. Through in situ doping engineering, non&#8208;chiral fluorophores with distinct emission profiles were incorporated during chiral cluster crystallization, yielding composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The optimized system achieved a maximum dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies established that the spiral packing of the tin&#8208;oxo clusters facilitates stereochemical information transfer to the dyes via the spatial confinement effect. This supramolecular chirality induction paradigm offers new insights into the rational design of multifunctional optical materials.

         <title>Fe&#9472;N4&#8208;Anchored Carbon Layer Patched TiO2 Cavities to Construct an &#8220;In&#8208;Lattice Heterojunction&#8221; for Enhanced Photocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;In&#8208;Lattice heterojunction&#8221; was constructed by patching cavities in defective TiO2 with Fe&#9472;N4&#8208;anchored carbon layer. It effectively catalyzes the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) and achieves an NH3 yield of 88&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 by facilitating efficient radial carrier transfer and enhancing N2 adsorption.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation and carrier transfer are critical determinants of the performance of photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) which are critical for agricultural and chemical industries. In this study, a novel type of heterostructure, termed an &#8220;In&#8208;Lattice heterojunction&#8221;, has been constructed by introducing a Fe&#9472;N4&#8208;anchored carbon layer (Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C) onto the surface of defective TiO2 (D&#8208;TiO2), as well as implanting it into the cavities of D&#8208;TiO2. The in&#8208;lattice heterojunction, defined as FNCTO, achieves efficient radial carrier transfer along the Ti&#9472;C&#9472;N&#9472;Fe in&#8208;lattice atomic channel and greatly promoted N2 adsorption benefiting photocatalytic NRR. Thus, FNCTO exhibits an excellent photocatalytic N2 reduct`ion into NH3 activity (88&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), obviously higher than that of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C sites on noncavity P25, illustrating the crucial role of cavity patch induced in&#8208;lattice heterojunction. This study paves a way for the development of high&#8208;performance Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C atomic photocatalysts based on noncarbon materials.

         <title>A Homobimetallic Frustrated Lewis Pair Cobalt Catalyst for the Methanolysis of Hydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] shows excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, reaching TOF values of ca. 50&#160;000&#160;h&#8722;1. This behavior can be ascribed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which allows for a frustrated Lewis pair mechanism, resulting in a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond, as substantiated by DFT calculations. 








Abstract
The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (1) has shown excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, surpassing the related bimetallic Co(I)/Co(&#8211;I) complex [Co(CO)(PMe2Ph)(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)][Co(CO)4] (2), the Co(II) complex [Co(Cl)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)] (3), and the Co(I) complex [Co(CO)2(&#954;3&#8208;P,N,P&#8208;PNHP)]Cl (4). A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PNHP ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si&#9472;H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(&#8211;I) centers. Then, the PhSiH2 group at the Co(&#8211;I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ cation, regenerating the [Co(CO)4]&#8211; species. [H2SiPh(HOMe)]+ protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH&#8208;assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.

         <title>Restructured Three&#8208;Coordinated Ni&#9472;Se Catalytic Sites for Enhanced Cross&#8208;Condensation of Methanol and Ethanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Se&#8208;doping reconstructs the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites that effectively catalyze MeOH and EtOH conversion to aldehyde intermediates while suppressing further decomposition, thus significantly promoting their cross&#8208;condensation to C5+ higher alcohols.








Abstract
The cross&#8208;condensation of methanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH) offers a promising, carbon&#8208;neutral pathway for the production of higher alcohols (HAS) from both CO2 and biomass resources. However, this process is often hampered by the low efficiency of C5+ alcohol (C5+OH) synthesis, high catalyst production costs, and limited water tolerance. Here, we report for the first time a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance Ni&#8208;based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C5+OH) in the cross&#8208;condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three&#8208;coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross&#8208;condensation to C5+OH.

The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C&lt;sub&gt;5+&lt;/sub&gt;OH) in the cross-condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three-coordinated Ni&#9472;Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross-condensation to C&lt;sub&gt;5+&lt;/sub&gt;OH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Bathing Strategy with Ultra&#8208;Wide Processing Window for Making High&#8208;efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent bathing strategy with ultra&#8208;wide processing window (10 s&#8211;10&#160;min) is proposed to achieve high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The bathing process is in situ monitored via time&#8208;resolved UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, systematically unrevealing the crystallization kinetics for different antisolvents. The PCE of CF&#8208;bathed device achieves 24.49% in ambient air, representing the record for antisolvent bathing method.








Abstract
Most record&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin&#8208;coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during R2R fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed the antisolvent&#8208;bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent&#8208;antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in&#8208;situ crystallization monitoring via time&#8208;resolved UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30%&#8211;50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by the antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256&#160;h storage in N2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied by an ultra&#8208;wide processing window (10&#160;s&#8211;10&#160;min bathing duration, &gt;2&#160;min post&#8208;bathing delay tolerance).

We report the design and fabrication of a self&#8208;powered blue&#8208;light photodetector based on boronate&#8208;ester&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;5) film, synthesized using hexahydroxytriphenylene and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediboronic acid organic linkers. The p&#8208;COF&#8208;5/n&#8208;Si photodetector exhibits an ultra&#8208;short rise time of 41&#160;&#181;s and a decay time of 222 &#181;s under 0&#160;V bias.








Abstract
Covalent organic framework materials have recently garnered significant interest from the scientific community due to their fascinating properties that include highly ordered porosity, structural versatility, high chemical and thermal stabilities, and facile surface modification. Herein, for the first time, we present the design and fabrication of a self&#8208;powered blue&#8208;light photodetector based on boronate&#8208;ester&#8208;linked 2D covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;5) film, synthesized using hexahydroxytriphenylene and 1,4&#8208;phenylenediboronic acid organic linkers. Specifically, we have developed a COF&#8208;5/n&#8208;Si photodetector that exhibits an ultra&#8208;short rise response time of 41&#160;&#181;s and a decay response time of 222 &#181;s under 0&#160;V bias. Our work integrated rapid response times and the distinctive benefit of self&#8208;powering, setting it apart from existing COF&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Production of Ethylene from Bicarbonate Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report direct electroreduction of bicarbonate to C2+ products using Cu mesh catalysts. The effect of mesh thickness, pore size, catholyte composition, and thermal treatment was systematically studied. Our finding shows that thinner Cu mesh showed enhanced C2+ selectivity due to improved mass transport, while heat&#8208;treated meshes form oxide&#8208;derived surfaces that shift selectivity from hydrogen evolution to efficient eCO2R.








Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction directly from a reactive carbon solution (e.g., (bi)carbonate) provides a promising approach for integrating CO2 capture and conversion. Compared to CO2 conversion in gas&#8208;fed systems, this system typically suffers from low Faradaic efficiency (FE), especially for multicarbon (C2+) products. Here, we report an engineered material structuring to selectively produce C2+ products directly from a N2&#8208;saturated bicarbonate solution. Multiphysics modeling studies reveal the critical role of local current density distribution and the spatio&#8208;selective evolution of C2+ products, which is favored in thinner catalysts (240&#160;&#181;m thickness). By jointly tailoring catalyst configuration and mass transport in bicarbonate electroreduction, adjusting the thickness, porosity, and surface oxidation of copper (Cu) mesh catalysts, as well as catholyte composition, we achieved a maximum C2H4 FE of 39% and total C2+ FE over 55% at 150&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a 240&#160;&#181;m thick Cu mesh. The system is also stable for over 160&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with maintained C2H4 FE over 20%. Our electrolysis system converts bicarbonate to C2+ with over 90% CO2 utilization efficiency, reducing regeneration and separation costs. Optimizing catalyst pore structure, and copper surface oxide is a key to maximizing C2H4 production from bicarbonate solutions.

         <title>Precision Screening and Surgical Resection of Pan&#8208;Cancer Using a Tandem&#8208;Locked NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Probe with Optimized Activation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic cyanine&#8208;based NIR II fluorescent probe, ACy&#8208;H&#8208;NTR, employs a &#8220;tandem&#8208;locked and doubly quenched&#8221; strategy combined with an &#8220;interstitial activation&#8211;lysosome retention&#8221; mechanism, enabling high&#8208;precision pan&#8208;cancer imaging and surgical resection. 








Abstract
The development of fluorescent probes for cancer detection and imaging that balance high sensitivity, precision, and broad applicability remains a significant challenge. Although &#8220;dual&#8208;locked&#8221; probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan&#8208;cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy&#8208;H&#8208;NTR, a cascaded&#8208;activation, doubly quenched NIR&#8208;II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity&#8212;universal tumor hallmarks&#8212;it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan&#8208;cancer screening and imaging.

     alt="Precision Screening and Surgical Resection of Pan-Cancer Using a Tandem-Locked NIR-II Fluorescent Probe with Optimized Activation Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anionic cyanine-based NIR II fluorescent probe, ACy-H-NTR, employs a &#8220;tandem-locked and doubly quenched&#8221; strategy combined with an &#8220;interstitial activation&#8211;lysosome retention&#8221; mechanism, enabling high-precision pan-cancer imaging and surgical resection. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of fluorescent probes for cancer detection and imaging that balance high sensitivity, precision, and broad applicability remains a significant challenge. Although &#8220;dual-locked&#8221; probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan-cancer use. We address these gaps with &lt;b&gt;ACy-H-NTR&lt;/b&gt;, a cascaded-activation, doubly quenched NIR-II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity&#8212;universal tumor hallmarks&#8212;it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan-cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem-locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan-tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR-II emission and &#8220;activation&#8211;retention&#8221; mechanism enhance tumor imaging efficacy and effectively tackle issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9-fold higher tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan-cancer models, it enabled high-contrast imaging (T/N &#8764;7.8) and precise resection with sub-2&#160;mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem-locked and doubly quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR-II imaging capabilities, and activation-retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan-cancer identification and surgical navigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Guest Cation Screening Principle for Enabling Customized Cathode/Electrolyte Interface Chemistry and Self&#8208;Enhanced Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural instability and slow reaction kinetics restrict the application of MnO2 cathode in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This research proposes a guest cation screening principle, identifying Sr2+ as the promising intercalation ion. As demonstrated, it enables in situ forming customized SrSO4 CEI that suppresses Mn dissolution and boosts the de&#8208;solvation of hydrated zinc ions, yet stabilizes the MnO2 host structure.








Abstract
Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO2 cathode in high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high&#8208;efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de&#8208;solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self&#8208;optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr&#8208;MnO2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A g&#8722;1), better rate capability (115&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A g&#8722;1), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2&#160;A g&#8722;1, when compared with pure &#948;&#8208;MnO2 electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and beyond.

         <title>Regioselective Hydration of Terpenes with Cofactor&#8208;Independent Carotenoid 1,2&#8208;Hydratase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a highly regioselective and cofactor&#8208;independent enzymatic approach to terpene and terpenoid hydration using a carotenoid 1,2&#8208;hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus. Beyond detailing reaction optimization strategies, an extensive substrate scope, and scale&#8208;up potential, it explores mutagenesis and structural modeling to identify key catalytic residues and improve enzymatic activity.








Abstract
Terminally hydrated terpenes are highly sought&#8208;after compounds in the flavor and fragrance industries. However, their selective synthesis remains a considerable challenge in catalysis. Regioselective hydration of non&#8208;activated C&#9472;C double bonds is typically hindered by poor selectivity and low atom efficiency in conventional methods. In this study, we harness the underexplored potential of the acyclic carotenoid 1,2&#8208;hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus IL144, employing it as a whole&#8208;cell biocatalyst for cofactor&#8208;independent terminal hydration of a diverse range of terpenes. This enzyme demonstrates exceptional activity across more than 20 C12&#9472;C20 terpenes and shows notable tolerance to various functional groups, establishing it as a valuable tool for sustainable organic synthesis. We emphasize the critical influence of expression system choice in maximizing enzymatic performance, enabling high&#8208;yield transformations on the gram scale. Through a combination of homology modeling, consensus analysis, and targeted mutagenesis, essential residues involved in catalytic activity were identified. Notably, enhanced catalytic efficiency was only achievable through the epistatic effect of three specific mutations. These findings highlight the biocatalytic potential of acyclic carotenoid hydratase, offering a green and efficient route to the production of valuable tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Ordered Copper Triangular Atomic Sites for Industrial&#8208;Grade Electromethanation of CO2 via Self&#8208;Regulated Adsorption of Reactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ordered copper triangular atomic site motifs loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI) were synthesized via a precise ion exchange strategy. Cu TAS/PHI enables enhanced CO2 coverage and activation with balanced proton supply through self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, as well as unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, achieving an FECH4 of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an FECD4 of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Copper single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown considerable potential for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methane but face constraints of low selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities (&gt;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and limited economic viability. Herein, we report an ion exchange strategy to precisely construct ordered Cu triangular atomic sites loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI), achieving a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.5% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and &gt;60% across 100&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, it enables CO2 deuteration to high&#8208;value methane&#8208;d4 with an FE of 75.1% at 700&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an estimated annual return on investment of 425.35%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu triangular atomic sites enable strengthened adsorption and activation of CO2, as well as balanced proton supply via self&#8208;regulated adsorption of reactants, thus favoring CO2 deep hydrogenation over hydrogen evolution. Moreover, Cu TAS/PHI unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH)2 pathway, circumventing the conventional *CO pathway that typically yields diverse CO2RR products. This work demonstrates a strategy to construct ordered multiatomic sites for highly selective CO2RR at industrial&#8208;grade current density and highlights the extraordinary financial potential of electrocatalytic CO2RR to produce high&#8208;value deuterated chemicals.

         <title>Multipoint Coordinative Capture of Olefinic Substrates Utilizing Metal&#8208;Carbon Bonds by Macrocyclic Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a macrocyclic tetranuclear palladium complex, which has four coordination sites within its inner cavity as a host molecule. The complex captured squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with six C&#9552;C double bonds, through multipoint palladium&#8208;carbon bonds, and formed a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. The host also selectively captured methyl &#945;&#8208;linolenate over methyl oleate and methyl linoleate.








Abstract
Terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids containing C&#9552;C double bonds are biologically and synthetically important compounds. The transformation of these substrates catalyzed by proteins relies on precise molecular capture. However, achieving precise molecular recognition of C&#9552;C double bonds using synthetically designed hosts remains a significant challenge. We now report a macrocyclic palladium tetranuclear complex that functions as a synthetic receptor featuring coordination sites within its inner cavity. This receptor selectively binds specific double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates. Squalene (C30H50), a linear triterpene with chemically similar six isoprenoid units, was captured by the macrocyclic complex through the coordination of four out of the six C&#9552;C double bonds, leading to a unique host&#8208;guest complex with a folded&#8208;squalene structure. Furthermore, the macrocyclic complex exhibited stronger binding affinity for methyl linolenate compared to methyl oleate or methyl linoleate through multipoint coordinative capture. This unprecedented approach to multipoint coordination of specific unsaturated bonds contrasts sharply with biological and traditional artificial receptors, which typically rely on intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic effects.

     alt="Multipoint Coordinative Capture of Olefinic Substrates Utilizing Metal-Carbon Bonds by Macrocyclic Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have developed a macrocyclic tetranuclear palladium complex, which has four coordination sites within its inner cavity as a host molecule. The complex captured squalene (C&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;), a linear triterpene with six C&#9552;C double bonds, through multipoint palladium-carbon bonds, and formed a unique host-guest complex with a folded-squalene structure. The host also selectively captured methyl &#945;-linolenate over methyl oleate and methyl linoleate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terpenoids and unsaturated fatty acids containing C&#9552;C double bonds are biologically and synthetically important compounds. The transformation of these substrates catalyzed by proteins relies on precise molecular capture. However, achieving precise molecular recognition of C&#9552;C double bonds using synthetically designed hosts remains a significant challenge. We now report a macrocyclic palladium tetranuclear complex that functions as a synthetic receptor featuring coordination sites within its inner cavity. This receptor selectively binds specific double bonds of unsaturated hydrocarbon substrates. Squalene (C&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;), a linear triterpene with chemically similar six isoprenoid units, was captured by the macrocyclic complex through the coordination of four out of the six C&#9552;C double bonds, leading to a unique host-guest complex with a folded-squalene structure. Furthermore, the macrocyclic complex exhibited stronger binding affinity for methyl linolenate compared to methyl oleate or methyl linoleate through multipoint coordinative capture. This unprecedented approach to multipoint coordination of specific unsaturated bonds contrasts sharply with biological and traditional artificial receptors, which typically rely on intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic effects. By achieving precise capture and folding of flexible olefinic substrates, this study establishes a new paradigm for the design of artificial host molecules and a novel platform for enzyme-like reaction vessels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocatalytic Alkylation of Ambident Nucleophiles Enables Selective N&#8208;Functionalization of Heterocycles and Late&#8208;Stage Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes are key structural motifs in bioactive compounds, but their regioselective synthesis via coupling of readily available azoles with haloalkanes remains very challenging. Here, we present a mild biocatalytic approach that proceeds on gram&#8208;scale, is highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, offering rapid access to valuable N&#8208;alkylated building blocks and enabling demanding late&#8208;stage alkylations.








Abstract
The alkylation with electrophilic haloalkanes is a key methodology in chemical synthesis to build desired molecules. Although alkylation of compounds bearing a single nucleophilic site is routine, the selective alkylation of polyfunctional molecules with multiple competing nucleophilic positions of comparable reactivity is often very challenging. In this work, we report a generalizable solution for selective alkylation chemistry that combines the selectivity of enzyme catalysis with the reactivity of off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf alkylation reagents. We employ engineered transferases in a modular cyclic cascade and use functionalized N&#8208;heteroarenes as challenging proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept substrates. This catalytic alkylation approach is mild, highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective, proceeds on gram&#8208;scale, provides rapid access to important N&#8208;alkylated heterocyclic building blocks and enables challenging late&#8208;stage alkylations. This study demonstrates a generalizable strategy to streamline synthetic routes to many pharmaceutically important compounds by selective biocatalytic alkylation of polyfunctional molecules and ambident nucleophiles.

         <title>Tertiary Phosphine Diversification via Photochemical P&#9472;C Chemoselective Cleavage of Phosphonium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a pentacoordinated&#8208;phosphorane EDA complex system to achieve chemoselective P&#9472;C cleavage. Through iterative implementation, this protocol realized consecutive aryl substitutions, yielding tri&#8208;diverse&#8208;aryl phosphines with customizable architectures. The metal&#8208;free and one&#8208;pot strategy demonstrated wide applications in gram&#8208;scale synthesis, post&#8208;modification of commercial ligands, and construction of P&#8208;stereogenic centers.








Abstract
Differentially substituted phosphines are indispensable in medicines, materials, and catalysis, yet their customizable synthesis, traditionally depending on unstable P&#9472;H/halogen reagents, remains formidably challenging. Here, we report a photoredox strategy enabling controllable aryl substitution through chemoselective P&#9472;C cleavage. By engineering electron donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between phosphonium salts and tertiary amines, this metal&#8208;free protocol realizes three consecutive hydrocarbyl exchanges for delivering tri&#8208;diverse&#8208;aryl phosphines with transition metal contamination elimination and broad functional group tolerance including unprotected amines and hydroxyls, facilitating late&#8208;stage modification of drugs/commercial ligands and construction of P,O,S&#8208;tridentate architectures and chiral P&#8208;stereogenic centers. Mechanistic studies reveal the dynamic pentacoordinated&#8208;phosphorane&#8208;complex formation nature and the radical&#8208;intermediate pathway, while the chemoselectivity originates from different P&#9472;C bond strengths. This work establishes a modular and sustainable platform for programming&#8208;level precision phosphine engineering.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sila&#8208;Cycloaddition of Dichlorodisilanes: Selective Si&#9472;Cl Activation for Cyclic Disilanes and Enantioenriched Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes enables efficient access to diverse cyclic disilanes via selective Si&#9472;Cl activation. The method tolerates broad diene scope, offers an enantioselective variant, and reveals a unique Ni&#8304;&#8208;mediated SN2&#8208;type activation pathway.








Abstract
Disilanyl architectures holds significant value across diverse fields, particularly in the development of advanced materials. However, their limited accessibility has hindered broader exploration. Herein, we report a catalytic strategy for the synthesis of structurally diverse cyclic disilanes through a [4&#160;+&#160;2] sila&#8208;cycloaddition between readily available dichlorodisilanes and 1,3&#8208;dienes. This transformation proceeds under mild, reductive nickel catalysis via an unusual Si&#9472;Cl bond activation pathway and accommodates a broad range of dienes, including bulk feedstocks, cyclic, multi&#8208;substituted, aliphatic, aromatic dienes, and trienes. An asymmetric variant further enables the efficient construction of chiral disilane frameworks with high enantioselectivity. The resulting disilacarbocycle adopts boat&#8208;like conformations, as revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis, due to the elongated Si&#9472;Si and Si&#9472;C bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest that a triplet Ni0 species engages in an SN2&#8208;type oxidative addition to the Si&#9472;Cl bond, favoring this pathway over a concerted Si&#9472;Si activation. The resulting Si&#9472;Ni(I) intermediates are energetically preferred over Si&#9472;Ni(II) analogs in the subsequent diene insertion step.

         <title>Prolonging Exciton Diffusion Length via Modulating Aggregation Structures for Binary Organic Photovoltaics Approaching 20% Certified Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exciton diffusion length (LD) and fluid mechanics were effectively optimized by modulating the polymer aggregation structure. The printing PPHJ flexible OPVs exhibits more than 18% efficiency, and the flexible device maintained 90.4% of the initial PCE after 2000 bending cycles, showing excellent mechanical stability. Meanwhile, the rigid device exhibits 20% efficiency (certified19.68%, the highest value for the eco&#8208;friendly solvent system). Notably, the fabricated 23.60&#160;cm2 large&#8208;area module was 15.60% PCE.








Abstract
The performance of flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaics (OPVs) constrained by low short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), resulting in diminished power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compromised mechanical stability. Enhancing the exciton diffusion length (LD) is pivotal for improving device parameters, including PCE. However, the underlying mechanisms governing exciton diffusion dynamics, influenced by the aggregation structure of conjugated polymers, remain insufficiently understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interchain free energy distribution [&#916;G(r)] and strategically modulates the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor PM6 by controlling its molecular weight (MW). Medium&#8208;MW PM6 demonstrates optimized aggregation behavior, leading to extended LD and precisely tuned fluid mechanics, which facilitate the formation of a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. These advancements enable PPHJ&#8208;based all&#8208;polymer flexible devices to achieve a PCE of 18.01%, with notable improvements in JSC and FF, and retain 90.4% of their initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. Encouraged by these advantages, a record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.0% (certified 19.68%) was achieved for eco&#8208;friendly, printed OPVs (PM6//L8&#8208;BO) with small&#8208;area devices (0.0621&#160;cm2), whereas large&#8208;area modules (23.60&#160;cm2) reached an efficiency of 15.60%.

         <title>Isotope Engineering of Tetraphenylethylene: Aggregate&#8208;Dependent Enhancement of Luminescence Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends the fluorescence lifetimes of tetraphenylethylene (TPE) by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances intermode coupling and internal conversion.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE&#8208;5d, TPE&#8208;10d, and TPE&#8208;20d), combined with steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter&#8208;mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE&#8208;20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure&#8211;property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Ferroelectric Induced Multifield Coupling Effect Accelerates Charge Spatial Separation for Boosting Tandem Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupled with ferroelectric polarization in plasmonic&#8208;ferroelectric WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 heterojunction accelerates spatial separation and directional extraction of charge carriers, thereby ultimately boosting photocatalytic CO2 reduction integrated with benzylicalcohol C&#9472;C coupling.








Abstract
Integrating solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic&#8208;ferroelectric heterojunction (WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO3&#8208;x and ferroelectric polarization in K4Nb6O17, thereby not only promoting energetic hot&#8208;carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot&#8208;electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K4Nb6O17 surface for CO2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO3&#8208;x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is 9.87 and 6.27&#8208;folds higher than that of K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K4Nb6O17 and WO3&#8208;x, WO3&#8208;x/K4Nb6O17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C&#9472;C coupling for directed production of more value&#8208;added hydrobenzoin (313.15&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multifield coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.

         <title>Donor Engineering for High Performance n&#8208;Type OECT Materials with Exceptional Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor engineering with 2,3&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)fumaronitrile (DTFMCN) enables high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) polymers (S/B&#8208;DTFMCN). These materials achieve ultra&#8208;low threshold voltages and long&#8208;term operational stability, alongside efficient ion&#8208;electron transport. The study confirms that tailored donor design optimizes electrochemical stability and device longevity, demonstrating donor engineering as a key strategy for robust n&#8208;type OECTs with balanced performance and durability.








Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (PMIECs) have been widely used in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their structural diversity and the tunability of their frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels. However, the slower development of n&#8208;type materials compared to p&#8208;type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene&#8208;based donor building block, 2,3&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)fumaronitrile (DTFMCN), for D&#8211;A conjugated n&#8208;type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. DTFMCN can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one&#8208;step process. The DTFMCN&#8208;based D&#8211;A conjugated polymers, S&#8208;DTFMCN and B&#8208;DTFMCN, exhibit extremely low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n&#8208;type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra&#8208;low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high &#181;C* values of 13.49 and 13.57&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n&#8208;type OECT devices reported to date. This study highlights the effectiveness of DTFMCN in improving the operational stability of n&#8208;type OECT devices, offering promising potential for applications in bioelectronics.

         <title>When Bigger is Better: Lanthanum Complexes of Bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) FAlen Ligands as Unique Catalysts for the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Racemic &#946;&#8208;Lactones</title>

         <dc:description>
Discrete lanthanum complexes supported by new bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) ligands act as highly efficient ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) catalysts of simple and functional &#946;&#8208;propiolactones rac&#8208;BLR under mild conditions, returning in a controlled manner the corresponding linear polymers PBLR with high isoselectivity, no matter the nature and polarity of the solvent used.








Abstract
Discrete yttrium and lanthanum complexes supported by new bis(phenoxy&#8208;amidine) ligands have been prepared in high yields. Some of these so&#8208;called FAlen ligands, when coordinated onto the large La3+ in contrast to the small Y3+, can adopt an &#951;3 coordination mode of both amidine moieties. These La&#8208;FAlen complexes, either previously isolated or conveniently prepared in situ, act as highly efficient ROP catalysts of simple and functional &#946;&#8208;propiolactones rac&#8208;BLR (R&#160;=&#160;Me, CH2OiPr, CH2OSitBuMe2) under mild conditions, returning the corresponding linear polymers PBLR with high control over the molecular weights and narrow dispersities. More uniquely, when substituents with appropriate bulkiness are installed on the phenoxy and amidine moieties, the polymers all feature high isotacticity (Pm up to 0.93). High activity and isoselectivity are maintained, no matter the nature and polarity of the solvent used.

         <title>Backbone Protecting Groups for Enhanced Peptide and Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive account of the use of backbone N&#8208;protecting groups in peptide synthesis. It includes detailed synthetic methods relating to their introduction and removal and their application to &#8220;difficult&#8221; peptides and proteins of biological significance in both academic and industry contexts.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis has become an indispensable technique for the routine preparation of linear peptides of up to approximately 40 amino acids in length. However, the solid&#8208;phase approach is still hampered by chain insolubility and aggregation, which reduces synthetic yields. Moreover, many of the deletion impurities that can form are often chromatographically inseparable from the target sequence, which diminishes final product purity. The use of backbone N&#8208;protecting groups can ameliorate this synthetic inefficiency by increasing peptide chain solubility and suppressing aggregation. Backbone protection is also useful for promoting peptide macrocyclization, suppressing common side reactions in peptide chemistry, and improving solution&#8208;phase handling. Commercially available precursors containing benzyl&#8208;based groups and pseudoprolines have found widespread use, in academic laboratories and industry. A range of other strategies have also been investigated in a bid to increase the utility of backbone protecting groups and to develop more efficient methods for their introduction and removal. This review provides a comprehensive account of the state of the art, and includes detailed synthetic methods relating to the use of backbone protection, and its application to &#8220;difficult&#8221; peptides and proteins of biological significance. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are analyzed, and a commentary on future directions is provided.

         <title>Controlling Asymmetry Amplification Through Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, using two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept chiral (S)&#8208;1 and (R)&#8208;1 Pt(II) complexes along with a model achiral compound 2, we demonstrate the ability of supramolecular polymorphism to control and amplify asymmetry. By strategically merging the distinct properties of polymorphs of (S)&#8208;1 and 2, we achieved a remarkable synergistic communication between chirality and luminescence in their coassemblies, paving the way for adaptive supramolecular materials with emergent functionalities. 








Abstract
Supramolecular polymorphism has recently emerged as a powerful concept, enabling a single chemical entity to form distinct, stable assemblies in solution with diverse morphological, photophysical, and electronic properties. Despite this progress, the interplay between supramolecular polymorphism and chirality remains unexplored. Herein, we harness supramolecular polymorphism to control the amplification of asymmetry in supramolecular polymerization (SP). For this purpose, we designed two Pt(II) complexes bearing &#960;&#8208;extended ligands and S&#8208; or R&#8208;chiral side chains (compounds (S)&#8208;1 and (R)&#8208;1) that self&#8208;assemble into two distinct supramolecular polymorphs in methylcyclohexane: nonemissive short fibers with parallel molecular packing (AggI) and thermodynamically more stable helical fibers with a rotationally offset stacking, closer Pt&#8943;Pt contacts, and weak 3MMLCT luminescence (AggII). These polymorphs exhibit markedly different amplification of asymmetry in majority rules (MR) and sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers (SaS) studies, with the thermodynamic polymorph displaying superior performance. Ultimately, coassembly studies between the achiral model compound 2&#8212;which exhibits strong 3MMLCT emission in the assembled state&#8212;and the chiral but weakly emissive AggII reveal a synergistic communication between chirality and luminescence, culminating in the emergence of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). This study broadens the scope of supramolecular polymorphism and expands the design toolbox for adaptive supramolecular materials with emergent and synergistic functionalities.

         <title>Doping Bulky Fluorinated Organic Anion to Construct Highly Efficient Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Type Photosensitizers for Cancer Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to enhance the fluorescence intensity and to modulate cellular uptake of anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIE PSs by doping bulky fluorinated anions tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (FTB) into nanoparticles was proposed. The optimized DF&#8208;FTB8 (FTB:DPBCF&#8208;Br&#160;=&#160;8:1) exhibited superior cellular uptake, outstanding imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation level, enabling efficient cancer photodynamic therapy. 








Abstract
Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature have demonstrated promising potential in photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer. However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the &#960;+ core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF&#8208;Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE&#8208;PEG2000 to obtain NPs (named DF&#8208;TBX or DF&#8208;FTBX, X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF&#8208;Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X&#160;=&#160;8 in DF&#8208;TB8 and DF&#8208;FTB8, resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF&#8208;FTB8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion&#8208;&#960;+ type photosensitizers.

A complex featuring an Au(0)&#8211;Au(0) &#963;&#8208;bond is stabilized by tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P ligands, with the &#963;&#8208;bond serving as a two&#8208;electron donor to the Mg centers and enabling two&#8208;electron reductions of various substrates. This work highlights the significance of ligand design for stabilizing low&#8208;valent Au center and provides new cases to explore the properties of dinuclear Au(0) complexes.








Abstract
Despite significant advances in gold chemistry, the synthesis and stabilization of gold centers in a low oxidation state, particularly dinuclear Au(0) species, remain a considerable challenge. In this work, we report the successful isolation of a novel dinuclear Au(0) complex stabilized by tridentate P&#8211;Mg&#8211;P ligands. Computational studies demonstrate that the Au(0)&#8211;Au(0) &#963;&#8208;bond acts as a two&#8208;electron donor to the Mg centers. Reactivity studies further revealed the complex's unprecedented ability to perform two&#8208;electron reductions on a range of substrates, akin to the behavior of well&#8208;established Mg(I) and Zn(I) dimers.

         <title>Macromolecule&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Polymerization Induced by Crowding Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study is presented that investigates the influence of the excluded volume effect by macromolecules on supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. Upon crowding, the discotic supramolecular monomers sequentially assemble into polymers and higher&#8208;order aggregates (HOAs), affected by the macromolecule's concentration, size and polarity. The proven tunability and general applicability of this entropically driven assembly open new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.








Abstract
Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in biological systems by regulating dynamic processes, yet its effects in fully synthetic environments remain largely unexplored. Here, we systematically investigate how excluded volume effects influence supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. We employ various discotic supramolecular monomers that assemble sequentially into polymers and kinetically&#8208;controlled higher&#8208;order aggregates (HOAs) only in the presence of macromolecular crowders. The phase diagram of the supramolecular assemblies reveals a strong dependence on the macromolecule concentration, size, and polarity, which can be tuned to control polymerization. Remarkably, at high crowder concentrations, large condensed and aligned assemblies were observed in dried samples, suggesting a transition to phase&#8208;separated states. By testing different monomers, macromolecules, and solvents, we establish the general applicability and versatility of macromolecular crowding in guiding supramolecular polymerization. This work provides fundamental insights into assembly processes in crowded environments and opens new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.

&lt;p&gt;A systematic study is presented that investigates the influence of the excluded volume effect by macromolecules on supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. Upon crowding, the discotic supramolecular monomers sequentially assemble into polymers and higher-order aggregates (HOAs), affected by the macromolecule's concentration, size and polarity. The proven tunability and general applicability of this entropically driven assembly open new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.

         <title>Exploring Mesoionic Imine&#8208;Carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) Adducts: 1,3 H&#8208;Shift, N(I) Compounds and Guanidinate&#8208;Type Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the unique reactivity of a mesoionic imine with bis&#8208;aryl carbodiimides, forming an MII&#8208;CDI adduct at room temperature via a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;H shift. These MII&#8208;CDI adducts serve as important synthons for mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene&#8208;stabilized nitreones (I) and guanidinate&#8208;type ligands.








Abstract
In this study, we report our recent findings on the synthesis and reactivity of a novel 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine&#8208;type mesoionic imine&#8208;carbodiimide (MII&#8208;CDI) adduct. Unlike reported NHC&#8208;CDI adducts, formed by the reactions of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) with CDI, these zwitterionic compounds undergo a spontaneous 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift (1,3&#8208;H shift), resulting in guanidine&#8208;type compounds. The mechanism of this 1,3&#8208;H shift has been investigated through quantum chemical calculations. The MII&#8208;CDI adduct serves as a valuable synthon for the synthesis of mesoionic carbene&#8208;acyclic diamino carbene (MIC&#8208;ADC)&#8208;based nitreone (N(I)) compounds. We have conducted a detailed investigation into the electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and electrochemical behavior of these nitreone (N(I)) compounds. Additionally, the potential of these MII&#8208;CDI adducts as guanidinate ligands is explored. Our investigations here display the distinct reactivities of MII in contrast to their N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (NHI) congeners.

         <title>Gram&#8208;Scale Access to (3,11)&#8208;Cyclotaxanes&#8212;Synthesis of 1&#8208;Hydroxytaxuspine C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Belonging to the family of complex taxanes, 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C is a densely functionalized natural product. The synthesis was realized via a semisynthetic approach, starting from commercially available 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III. A late&#8208;stage photocyclization was utilized to install the characteristic transannular bond of complex taxanes, transforming the classical framework into the intricate cyclotaxane skeleton on gram&#8208;scale.








Abstract
Herein, we present the semisynthesis of complex taxane diterpenoid 1&#8208;hydroxytaxuspine C. Starting from cheap and abundant 10&#8208;deacetylbaccatin III, a scalable and robust route was developed, enabling an unprecedented gram&#8208;scale access to the intricate (3,11)&#8208;cyclotaxane scaffold. In addition, this represents the first synthetic access to C1&#8208;hydroxylated cyclotaxanes. The natural product is synthesized in 17 steps, with the reactions being performed on decagram&#8208;scale up to an advanced intermediate, establishing the scalability of this approach.

         <title>Anionic Coordination&#8208;Regulated Metal&#8208;Organic Cages for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic coordination strategy has been developed to construct a halogen&#8208;coordinated Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cage (MOC) for the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is found that iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d orbitals and iodide p orbitals, facilitating electron transfer from the Ni center to the adsorbed CO2 (TEOA&#160;=&#160;triethanolamine).








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) provides a promising strategy for producing high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels. However, developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for CO2 reduction remains a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate the stabilization of intermediates by constructing halogen&#8208;coordinated metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) (Ni8L12X4, X = Cl, Br, I). Theoretical calculations show that the formation of *COOH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d and iodide p orbitals, enhancing electron transfer from the Ni center to adsorbed CO2 and promoting the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni8L12I4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl&#8208; and Br&#8208;coordinated Ni MOC by 200&#8208; and 5&#8208;fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Plasmonic Hot Spot Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence microscopy is used to investigate in situ turnover frequency of photon emission on a series of shell&#8208;isolated plasmonic nanoamplifier (AuNR@mSiO2). Turnover frequency heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images present the distinct distribution of plasmonic hot spots along a single nanoamplifier. This platform provides an intuitive insight and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects, offering a sight to construct efficient nanoarchitectures of plasmonic electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), an important optical property of noble metal nanomaterials, is extensively applied in electrochemistry. However, the specific LSPR effects on metallic nanoparticles are difficult to unravel and evaluate, owing to simultaneous factors like intrinsic electroactivity and surface interactions. Herein, we designed a series of shell&#8208;isolated nanostructures, with mesoporous silica shells and plasmonic Au Nanorod cores (AuNR@mSiO2), for precisely investigating both LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. Single&#8208;molecule electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging was employed to monitor the in situ turnover frequency (TOF) of photon emissions on individual plasmonic nanoamplifiers to determine the dominant factors influencing LSPR and nanoconfinement effects. TOF heatmaps and super&#8208;resolution ECL images unveiled distinct hot spot distributions along the plasmonic nanostructures. Our approach provides insight into and in&#8208;depth understanding of plasmonic effects during electrochemical reactions, thereby facilitating precise electrocatalyst design based on the physiochemical properties of LSPR.

         <title>Low Molecular Weight Multistate Photoswitches Based on Simple Norbornadiene&#8208;Triazine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our new polyswitchable norbornadiene&#8208;triazine hybrids are promising candidates for molecular based data storage. These small, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecules can be both symmetric or contain different NBD chromophors and exhibit an unprecedently high variety of distinct switching states. By incorporating acid/base&#8208;responsive moieties, the number of achievable states can be doubled.








Abstract
We have synthesized and characterized a series of simple norbornadiene(NBD)&#8208;triazine architectures, including multistate photoswitches with unprecedentedly high information storage densities. The simple mono&#8208;NBDs served as suitable model systems to investigate the underlying absorption and switching characteristics. To increase the complexity stepwise, a bis&#8208;NBD derivative with a symmetric substitution pattern was investigated next. By combining different NBD substituents with varying electron demands, two asymmetric compounds, one bis&#8208;NBD and one tris&#8208;NBD, were prepared and investigated. In the case of the tris&#8208;NBD, the selective switching of the individual NBD chromophores is hampered by the too closely related optical properties of all three NBD units. On the other hand, the asymmetric photoswitch system containing two NBD&#8208;substituents fulfilled the requirements of a selectively addressable multistate system with an extremely high information storage density. Nearly all possible NBD/quadricyclane (QC) combinations could be realized here, including their reversible interconversion and the respective protonated forms. Quantum chemical calculations corroborated our experimental findings.

         <title>In Situ Tracking of Ni&#8208;MOF Reconstruction into Active Ni(OH)2 OER Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a key bottleneck in electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), composed of one&#8208;dimensional Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains interconnected by 1,4&#8208;ndc linker, into catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. This top&#8208;down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4&#8208;ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni&#8211;(&#956;3&#8208;OH)/(&#956;2&#8208;H2O)&#8211;Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional (thickness ~ 1.5&#8208;2.6 nm), defect&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm&#8208;2, surpassing commercial IrO2. In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH&#8208; and potential&#8208;dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni&#8211;O bond contraction from 2.06 &#197; to 1.89 &#197; under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbed oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high&#8208;performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Recyclable Hybrid Polymer Networks using Whole Biomass</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whole&#8208;plant biomass from non&#8208;agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole&#8208;cell spirulina, a green&#8208;blue algae, into robust hybrid algae&#8208;polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The hybrid algae&#8208;based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all&#8208;synthetic equivalents.&#160;These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled hybrid materials which is facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust hybrid materials, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Tough 3D Printable Elastomers with Human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;Loop Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;performance elastomers for additive manufacturing requires overcoming complex property trade&#8208;offs that challenge conventional material discovery pipelines. Here, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress&#8211;strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi&#8208;component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (&gt;10 MPa) and high strain at break (&gt;200%). Analysis of the high performing materials revealed structure&#8211;property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine&#8208;guided, human&#8208;augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi&#8208;objective materials optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>Progressive Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Single&#8208;Atom Metal Oxide Catalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high&#8208;activity candidates. High&#8208;throughput screening of 261 transition metal single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped metal oxides (MSA&#8208;MOx) identified nine top&#8208;performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential &lt; 0.5 V), including MnSA&#8208;RuO2 and FeSA&#8208;TiO2 (theoretical overpotential &lt; 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant&#8208;potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of MnSA&#8208;RuO2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, machine learning prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Photodegradable and Thermo&#8211;reversible, Soft, Transparent Dithioacetal Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8211;reversible, chemically cross&#8211;linked polymers capable of altering their physicochemical and mechanical properties on demand, upon application of external stimuli (e.g., light, temperature), are highly desirable for the development of multifunctional materials. Herein, we report a facile chemical platform for the synthesis of photodegradable and thermo&#8211;reversible, model hydrogels consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the elastic strands and dithioacetal moieties at the cross&#8211;link points. The gels were synthesized via an acid&#8211;catalyzed step&#8211;growth reaction of a difunctional PEG&#8211;thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross&#8208;linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross&#8722;links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation, endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV (&#955; = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm&#8211;1) and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating, were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by 1H NMR spectroscopy kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.</dc:description>

         <title>Balancing Tetrahedral and Cation Entropies for Long&#8208;lifespan Low&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, their&#160;application&#160;is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low&#8208;temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with&#160;the desolvation&#160;kinetics&#160;of&#160;Zn2+. We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3&#8208;butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable&#160;glass&#8208;forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid&#8208;liquid transition temperature from &#8208;16.4 to &#8208;101 &#176;C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn&#178;&#8314;&#160;to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by&#8208;reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long&#8208;term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at &#8208;40 &#176;C&#160;under 0.1 mA cm&#8208;2/0.1 mAh cm&#8208;2,&#160;and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (&#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C). This work offers a guideline to design stable&#160;and low&#8208;temperature AZIBs, expanding the application scope&#160;for aqueous electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Co sites in n&#8208;n type heterojunction enable selective electrochemical co&#8208;valorization of HMF and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial&#8208;engineered CoS/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C n&#8208;n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record&#8208;low onset potential of 1.12 V (vs. RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO2RR, which outperform the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO2RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50&#8208;hour continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co&#8208;N4 electron&#8208;deficient and Co&#8208;S electron&#8208;rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction via charge accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Reinforce Buried Interface Anchoring for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been commonly used as a single&#8208;component hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but suffer from facile &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and self&#8208;aggregations in solution and consequently poor anchoring ability with the atop perovskite layer. Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn&#8208;SAM) strategy through blending a non&#8208;planar molecule 3,3&#8208;(4&#8208;amino&#8208;4H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3,5&#8208;diyl)&#8208;dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me&#8208;4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi&#8208;device compatibility. The single&#8208;junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn&#8208;SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm2) for 1.56 eV and 1.68 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively. Moreover, this approach is beneficial for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on fully textured surfaces of heterojunction (HJT) silicon bottom cells, affording PCEs of 31.56% (area: 1.07 cm2) and 26.57% (area: 20.06 cm2). All devices exhibit excellent long&#8208;term storage and thermal stability even under non&#8208;encapsulated conditions</dc:description>

         <title>Zwitterionic Electrolyte Additive for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Ammonium Alkyl Sulfonate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte additive is an important component of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. At present, commercial film&#8208;forming additives can only work on either anode or cathode so as to increase the complexity and decrease the efficiency of the electrolyte. In this work, we designed and synthesized a novel zwitterionic 3&#8208;(triethylammonium)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (TEAPS) additive, which can adsorb on the surface of both graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. The kinetically and thermodynamically favorable film&#8208;forming reaction of TEAPS promotes the formation of a robust F/S/N&#8208;species Domaine interface, thereby enables greatly improved cycling performance. It is believed that the zwitterionic TEAPS will work as a novel versatile additive for high&#8208;performance LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>C(sp2)&#8211;H Bond Activation with a Heterometallic Nickel&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present a ligand&#8208;catalysed bond breaking and making process that occurs with a Ni&#8211;&#8205;Al heterometallic complex. While combinations of Ni pre&#8208;catalysts and Al additives are known for site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H functionalisation, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD)2] and [(BDI)AlH2] (1; BDI = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methyldiketiminate), results in facile formation of a Ni&#8211;&#8205;Al heterometallic complex [(&#951;4&#8209;COD)Ni{&#956;&#8209;H)2Al(BDI)}] (2; COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp2)&#8211;H activation of 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H2 evolution; a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy3. The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labelling studies, and modelling. The reaction is 1st order in PCy3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9&#8208;1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C&#8211;H oxidative addition and H2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible, and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps, may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Co Coordination Mode in COF Nanosheets for Efficient Solar&#8208;driven Reduction of Non&#8208;neat CO2 into Syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO2&#160;where&#160;CO2 enrichment and purification&#160;is an energy&#8208;intensive process. Herein, we report a Co&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF with asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO2. The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst Co17.7&#8208;COOH&#8208;COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from neat CO2 and 180.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;from 40 vol% CO2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from neat CO2 and 116.0 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 from 40 vol% CO2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits widely and continuously adjustable CO/H2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the COF by formation of atomic dispersed N&#8208;Co&#8208;O4 sites, enhances dissociation of water and CO2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for design of high&#8208;performance catalysts for the photoreduction CO2 to syngas.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Electrochemical Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring stable and functional linkages through  facile   one&#8208;pot   cyclocondensation reactions represents one of the frontiers in the development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which can enhance structural robustness and diversity while broadening their application potential. In this study, we report a facile synthetic strategy using p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) as a proton mediator to construct two imidazole&#8208;linked COFs (TABQ&#8208;COF and TAPT&#8208;COF) via one&#8208;pot cyclocondensation of aromatic aldehydes with ortho&#8208;diamines. These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity, but also exhibit excellent physico&#8208;chemical stability and contain abundant redox&#8208;active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT&#8208;COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.05 A g&#8208;1while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (&lt;0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox&#8208;active centers (C=O and C=N groups), which enable efficient Na+ storage through multi&#8208;electron redox mechanisms. This study highlights the strategic advantage of structurally stable COFs with precisely engineered redox&#8208;active motifs via facile synthesis for advancing high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Embracing Complexity: Peptides as Tuneable Scaffolds in the Construction of Discrete Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has advanced rapidly, with scientists using fundamental understanding to generate function from simple building blocks. However, synthetic systems are still in their infancy when compared to biology. The increasing use of peptides in supramolecular structures provides a clear roadmap to more complex function; introducing chiral, information&#8208;rich, building blocks from a readily available pool. Peptides have historically been incorporated as modular additions to discrete supramolecular architectures, to interface with biological systems. More recently, supramolecular chemists have embraced the complexity of secondary and tertiary structures, and peptides&#8217; intrinsic propensity for folding, to enable the formation of supramolecular architectures built from peptides, leveraging their innate properties. We explore the urgent need to embrace complex, chiral, folded building blocks in discrete supramolecular architectures, and illustrate how this will provide opportunities for novel functions and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Metallic Binding Characteristics of the Intermetalloid f&#8208;/p&#8208;Block Cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8211;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non&#8208;standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In2Bi11)2Bi2]6&#8722; and the complex [La(C5Me4H)3] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)&#8211;Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron&#8208;rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe&#8208;Salpeter&#8208;equation (GW&#8208;BSE) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Structure&#8208;Selective On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Isokekulene versus Kekulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role of different facets of metal nanoparticles in steering reaction pathways is crucial for the design of heterogeneous catalysts with superior selectivity. As a prominent class of reactions, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;hydrogen (C&#8208;H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92 %, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (&gt; 99 %). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO&#8208;functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule&#8208;substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly&#8208;selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Single Ag atoms induce Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on WO3 for ultrastable acid ammonia synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia from nitrate&#8208;containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag&#8208;N/O bonds on one&#8208;dimensional WO3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeds ~90% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.6 ~ &#8722;0.2 VRHE with a maximum FE of approaching 100% at &#8722;0.4 VRHE and a maximum NH3 yield reaching 5.24 &#177; 0.41 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.55 VRHE. The catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm&#8722;2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ~94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly, we succeeded in obtaining a NH3 production rate of 104.08 mmol h&#8208;1 at &#8722;3.5 V, and maintained the stability toward NO3RR for over 30 h with FE &gt; 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate&#160;that the formation of Ag&#8208;N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of *NO&#8594;*NHO, considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioelectrosynthesis of Signaling Molecules for Selective Modulation of Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioelectrosynthesis holds great potential for studying and regulating biological systems through the in situ synthesis and delivery of cell signaling molecules with high spatiotemporal precision. Despite recent advancements, precise control over multiple signaling molecules within a single platform remains challenging. Here, we introduce a bioelectrosynthesis approach capable of selectively producing two types of signaling molecules from a single precursor. This system leverages multi&#8208;metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH3), from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on&#8208;demand modulation of NO&#8208; or NH3&#8208;mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines. By combining electrochemical precision with selective cell control, this strategy may advance the study and regulation of biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nano Ir&#8208;Based Alloy Clusters&#160;by Hierarchical Confinement Effect for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sub&#8208;nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for&#160;enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge.&#160;In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy&#160;which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high&#8208;temperature sintering.&#160;Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (~1 nm) Ir&#8208;based alloy clusters,&#160;including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo, and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub&#8208;nanoscale&#160;IrCo alloy clusters&#160;(denoted as sub&#8208;IrCo cluster)&#160;demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA/cm&#178; and a remarkable mass activity 87.5&#160;times greater than that of commercial IrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between&#160;Ir atoms and the support,&#160;which inhibits particle agglomeration. This&#160;work provides an&#160;effective strategy for&#160;preventing&#160;particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves&#160;precise size control&#160;at sub&#8208;nanoscale,&#160;opening&#160;a new avenue for the development&#160;of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8211;Thiosumanene Isomeric Lewis Bases for Synergistic Defect Passivation and Hole Extraction Enables over 26% Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interface defects between the perovskite layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) seriously limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we designed two isomers, 4BT and 5BT, based on 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;thiosumanene&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as novel Lewis bases with dual capabilities for deep&#8208;level defects (Pb2+, VI) passivation and promoting hole extraction. By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration&#8208;functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theorical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT&#160;enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep&#8208;level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT&#8208;modified n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol. This work offers a unique molecular designing mechanism to address the interfacial&#8208;related issues for high&#8208;performance PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Metastable Macrocyclic Bis&#8208;Meisenheimer Adduct</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electron&#8208;deficient tetranitroazacalixarene is shown to undergo reversible cyanide capture via nucleophilic aromatic substitution, yielding an unprecedented class of metastable dianionic macrocycle incorporating two Meisenheimer units, fully characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and electronic absorption spectroscopies. Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non&#8208;covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Establishing 3d&#8208;4d Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Photothermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photothermal catalytic CO2 conversion offers a promising way to address the energy and environmental issues, however, the development of self&#8208;supporting catalyst with high activity and selectivity remains a great challenge. Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self&#8208;supporting carbon cloth with N&#8208;doped carbon arrays (PdCo&#8208;NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3d&#8208;4d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz2&#8208;5&#963; and dyz&#8208;2&#960;* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self&#8208;supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO2 methanation while serves as a photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat converter to improve the temperature of reaction system. As a result, PdCo&#8208;NC/CC exhibits unprecedent photothermal performance toward CO2 methanation, delivering a CH4 generation rate as high as 15.23 mol gmetal&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source. Moreover, the continuous flow photothermal reaction can be smoothly proceeded over 100 h, demonstrating the high stability of PdCo&#8208;NC/CC in CO2 hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Assisted Confined Synthesis of Metal Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Enzyme&#8208;Metal Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The integration of enzymatic and metal catalysis in cascade reactions offers a highly efficient approach for producing high&#8208;value chemicals, such as chiral pharmaceuticals. However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme&#8208;assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme&#8208;metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions.&#160;The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co&#8208;encapsulation and dual&#8208;optimization of both components.&#160;Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2&#8208;fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1&#8208;phenylethylamine (1&#8208;PEA), and a 2.7&#8208;fold enhancement in racemization&#160;conversion,&#160;compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers&#160;~91% yield, &gt;98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal&#8208;enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme&#8208;metal cascade systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Insights into Phase Formation of Sodium Layered Cathodes Materials with Prominent Electrochemical Performances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical performances of layered cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are intimately dependent on their structural characteristics. However, realizing accurate regulation of phase structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. In this study, a series of P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of structural insights into P'2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn&#8208;valence changes during synthesis process, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P'2&#8208;P2 phase transition. Moreover, these structural insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during electrochemical cycling, the obtained P'2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.05Ti0.1Mn0.85O2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ~40 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ~93 mAh g&#8208;1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%. This research significantly advances the comprehension of both synthesis mechanism and electrochemical properties optimization mechanisms of P'2 phase materials, offering a pragmatic strategy for elevating the performance of SIB materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of CDK12/13 and BRD4 Molecular Glue Degraders</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) is an emerging therapeutic approach for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;related proteins. While molecular glue degraders exhibit drug&#8208;like properties, their discovery has traditionally been serendipitous and often requires post&#8208;hoc rationalization. In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism&#8208;guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin&#8208;dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage&#8208;binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine&#8208;reactive warhead to a bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Structural Oscillation Mediates Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic dissolution of active species of electrocatalysts suffers severe durability issues thus limiting practical sustainable electrochemical application despite the enormous strides in the activity. An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni&#8208;O2&#8208;Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy with S, Co co&#8208;doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillation. In&#8208;situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution while the electron&#8208;withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co&#8208;O2&#8208;Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800 h (5000&#8208;h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05 kWh Nm&#8208;3 H2 @ 4000 A m&#8208;2. The levelized cost of hydrogen of US$2.315/KgH2 overmatches the European Commission's target for the coming decade (&lt;US$ 2.5/kgH2).</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer of Ag(II) CF2X Carboxylates: Quantum Yield and Electrophotocatalytic Arene Fluoroalkylation Tuned by X</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporation of CF2X groups beyond CF3 into arene scaffolds is underdeveloped despite these groups&#8217; utility as halogen&#8208;bond donors and as precursors to bioisosteres. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization, and comparative photochemistry of a suite of [Ag(II)(bpy)2O2CCF2X]+ and Ag(II)(bpy)(O2CCF2X)2 (bpy = 2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine, X = F, CF3, Cl, Br, H, CH3) carboxylate complexes. We find a dramatic effect of the X substituent on the efficiency of generating CF2X radicals by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT), with Ag(II) photoreduction rates varying by over an order of magnitude and quantum yields spanning over 20%. We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)&#8211;O2CCF2X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)&#8208;mediated electrophotocatalytic CF2X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes. This work expands the nascent field of Ag(II)&#8208;based photocatalysis by allowing for (hetero)aryl&#8211;CF2X functionalization directly from unactivated fluoroalkyl carboxylate precursors.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Scale Interfacial Water Management Switching Reaction Pathway of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H2O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon&#8208;related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H2O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H2O is critical during CO2RR process, as H2O molecules are directly involved in CO2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper&#8208;based catalyst, containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities, to investigate the influence of H2O molecules on CO2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H2O molecules, instead of asymmetric H&#8208;bonded H2O or ice&#8208;like H2O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C1 FE to 70% C2 FE. We unveil, via in&#8208;situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurement, that the H2O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO2 reduction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>PCR&#8208;Free Site&#8208;Directed Mutagenesis on Repetitive Sequences Using Single&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Assisted Double&#8208;Stranded DNA Nicking by DNAzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (SDM) is a key driver for many biochemical investigations and biotechnological applications. Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR&#8208;free SDM method that uses DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double&#8208;stranded DNA, we employed single&#8208;stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;assisted double&#8208;stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double&#8208;stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target&#8208;specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR&#8208;incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost&#8208;effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Protected Organozirconium Catalyzes C&#8211;H Alumination of Saturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface grafted organozirconium&#8208;catalyzes C&#8211;H/Et&#8211;Al exchange reactions, involving saturated hydrocarbons and AlEt3, to afford organoaluminum compounds and ethane. The Zr(OtBu)3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;700 (1) catalyst contains monopodal &#8801;SiO&#8211;Zr(OtBu)3 and only a few residual silanols (&lt;5%). Nonetheless, these silanols are the Achille&#8217;s heel of 1, providing a pathway for surface and catalyst degradation during catalysis, limiting the alkylaluminum yield and catalyst turnover. Support degradation, involving the cleavage of Si&#8211;O bonds by activated surface organometallics, is inhibited by capping silanols with &#8211;SiMe3. Residual silanols in 1 react with allyltrimethylsilane, as determined by solid&#8208;state 13C and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and reaction stoichiometry, to form Zr(OtBu)3/SiMe3@SiO2&#8208;Al2O3&#8208;700 (2), which is resistant to degradation by AlEt3. CH alumination of dodecane catalyzed by 2 produces higher yields of the 1&#8208;dodecylaluminum product in comparison to 1, and in &gt;95% selectivity. Additionally, methane undergoes 2&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H alumination, providing a route to AlMe3.</dc:description>

         <title>Janus&#8208;Type Photophysics of Rotational Isomers in a Diphenylanthracene Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecular dimers serve as valuable model systems for manipulating and exploring interchromophore interactions. However, the structural flexibility introduced by linker or chromophore rotation gives rise to conformational isomers with distinct atomic arrangements, complicating the interpretation of photophysical processes. In this study, we investigate 9,9,10,10&#8217;&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bianthracene (TPBA) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA. To address the &#8216;Janus&#8208;type&#8217; photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation&#8208;wavelength&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment&#8208;dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in&#8208;depth study of the Janus&#8208;like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing New Natural&#8208;Mimetic Phosphatidic Acid: a Versatile and Innovative Synthetic Strategy for Glycerophospholipid Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) play important roles in cellular compartmentalization and signaling. Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL&#8208;mediated signaling pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Multisite Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Facilitates Oxidative Photocatalysis in a Molecular Zr&#8208;Based Coordination Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of mediators that harness visible light to drive proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) offers a promising pathway to achieving challenging redox transformations in a more sustainable manner and with enhanced thermochemical efficiency. However, designing photocatalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant metals while gaining precise control over their excited&#8208;state reactivity remains a significant challenge. Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr3(O)(OH)3 nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O&#8211;H and C&#8211;H bonds (70&#8211;100 kcal&#183;mol&#8722;1). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground&#8208;state, pre&#8208;association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedent ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.</dc:description>

         <title>SmI2&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling of Alkyl Housane Ketones and Alkenes in an Approach to Norbornanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling strategies involving strain&#8208;release have gained significant recent attention for the construction of complex molecular frameworks, particularly in the context of preparing bioisosteres for medicinal chemistry. While the reactivity of cyclopropanes and bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) has been extensively studied, higher homologues are emerging as valuable substrates for synthesis. For example, methods for the fragmentation and coupling of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, or housane, ketones show promise, but are currently limited in substrate scope. Here, we describe a mild, atom&#8208;economical, samarium diiodide (SmI2) catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a versatile class of hosts for heterogeneous photocatalysis. Herein, we present a nickel&#8208;decorated pyrene&#8208; and bipyridine&#8208;based olefin&#8208;linked COF (  Ni@COF1  ) as a robust and recyclable catalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven aromatic Finkelstein and retro&#8208;Finkelstein reactions. The extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation within the COF framework enhances light absorption, promotes charge transport, and facilitates in situ Ni(0) generation from the pre&#8208;installed Ni(II) centers. Compared to its reduced counterpart (  Ni@COF1R  ),  Ni@COF1  exhibits remarkable catalytic performance. The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late&#8208;stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram&#8208;scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number &gt;850. These results highlight the significance of olefin&#8208;linked COFs in advancing sustainable photocatalysis and expanding their role in fine chemical synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrosilylation of Alkyl gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes to Construct Carbon and Silicon Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of aliphatic alkenes without auxiliary or stabilizing groups presents a significant challenge in modern organic synthesis. We report herein the nickel&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of alkyl&#8208;substituted gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes, which enables the generation of chiral &#945;&#8208;difluoromethylsilanes with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Moreover, the simultaneous construction of carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers was achieved with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity using prochiral silanes. This method provides an efficient approach to access sp3&#8208;enriched C&#8208;stereogenic centers equipped with high&#8208;value difluoromethyl groups. The resulting enantioenriched silanes could undergo a range of stereospecific transformations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the detailed mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Platform for Enhanced Drug Delivery to Glioblastoma using Targeted Multidomain Protein Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled&#8208;coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7&#8208;fold increased encapsulation of doxorubicin (Dox) compared to TRAP and demonstrates improved uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye&#8208;labelled TMPA (NIR&#8208;TMPA) is injected into mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and fit to a 2&#8208;compartment pharmacokinetic model. NIR&#8208;TMPA demonstrates prolonged short&#8208;phase half&#8208;life in tumor&#8208;bearing mice compared to control with similar slow&#8208;phase half&#8208;life, leading to an increased area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve clearance and pointing to its sequestration in the tumor site. Endpoint fluorescence analysis of mouse organs ex vivo also supports this conclusion. TMPA and its future derivatives therefore bear potential for targeted treatment of GBM.</dc:description>

         <title>Pt Colloidosomes with Broadband Absorption for Near&#8208;Infrared Light Photocatalysis through d&#8208;Band Hot&#8208;Carriers Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interband and intraband electronic excitations in transition metals as nanocatalysts are crucial for the generation of hot carriers. Unlike the well&#8208;known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d&#8208;band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by Finite&#8208;Different&#8208;Time&#8208;Domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub&#8208;100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (&#8804; 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low&#8208;energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser&#8208;generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn3O4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.</dc:description>

         <title>The Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction as a Mechanistic Probe for Vibrational Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vibrational Strong Coupling (VSC) has been reported to alter reaction kinetics. Hypotheses on how it does this have been proposed, but open questions remain regarding the importance of the polarity of the reaction mechanism and of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), among other factors. We propose the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed&#8208;width cavities and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3&#8208;diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C=C bond. In all cases, no changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Realizing Unconventional Tandem Nitrate Reduction for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis Enabled by Co,Fe Dual&#8208;Site Conjugated Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for carbon&#8208;neutral chemical synthesis, while the intricate multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer processes and unstable intermediates pose significant challenges in attaining high selectivity and efficiency. This study demonstrates a Co,Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe&#8208;cMOFs) that enable efficient NO3RR via an unconventional [6+2] electron&#8208;transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2+6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO3&#8722; to *NH2OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO2&#8722; and guarantees selective NH3 production. The CoFe&#8208;cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH3&#8208;producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery prototype incorporating CoFe&#8208;cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm&#8722;2 peak power density with stable NH3 production. This work proposes a mechanistic breakthrough in tandem pathway regulation for selective electrochemical ammonia synthesis.</dc:description>

First, the gram&#8208;scale preparation of the reactive yet stable pentafluorosulfur hypofluorite (FOSF5) as well as its spectroscopic data are reported. Then, the preparation and full characterization of the corresponding fluorosulfonyl pentafluorooxosulfate (FSO3SF5, FSPO) by the fluoro&#8208;pentafluorooxosulfanylation of SO2 are highlighted. This liquid reagent (b.p. 39.6&#176;C) was later successfully used for modulable release of [cat][OSF5] ion&#8208;pair. The selective, in&#8208;solution release of SOF4 and SOF4/SO2F2 species was also demonstrated. Finally, the SuFEx reactivity was investigated and showed interesting reservoir ability. Indeed, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of sulfonyl fluoride (&#8208;SO2F) and sulfurimidoyl fluoride (&#8208;N=S(O)F2) species.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;infrared Light Catalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction by Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current CO2 photocatalytic systems mainly work in ultraviolet and visible light regions, and the inability to utilize the abundant near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation or the low utilization rate is still a bottleneck for practical applications. We address this challenge through the strategic synthesis of metal&#8208;free conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM, to enhance the NIR absorption capabilities, achieving a CO production rate of ~74.7 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in gas&#8208;solid phase CO2 reduction, surpassing typical NIR&#8208;responsive catalysts. Meanwhile, PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can obtain a CO production rate of 344.1 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in full&#8208;spectrum irradiated CO2 reduction. Infrared thermography reveals that the non&#8208;radiative attenuation of PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM led to high photothermal temperature under NIR irradiation, which accounts for its reduction performance. Mechanistic studies combining fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy and in situ infrared characterization elucidate the photocatalytic pathway and intermediate formation. This result indicates that PAF&#8208;332&#8208;DCM can be a promising metal&#8208;free catalyst for practical solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Predicting A&#8208;Element Substitution and MXene Formation in Reactions Between MAX Phases and Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective etching has emerged as a key method for synthesizing 2D materials, with the conversion of MAX phases to MXenes being by far the most widely studied and reported example. While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process&#8208;specific phase diagrams to model A&#8208;element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti3AlC2, V2AlC and Ti2AlN in ZnCl2 molten salt we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Inositol Pyrophosphate Toolbox: Stereoselective Synthesis and Application of PP&#8208;InsP4 Isomers in Plant Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well&#8208;characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP&#8208;InsPs, such as 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP5 (5&#8208;InsP7) and 1,5&#8208;(PP)2&#8208;InsP4 (1,5&#8208;InsP8), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31P&#8208;NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18O&#8208;labeled PP&#8208;InsP4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE&#8208;MS), enabling the assignment of PP&#8208;InsP4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation&#8208;induced root&#8208;specific PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer does not match any 5&#8208;PP&#8208;InsP4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 and [3&#8208;OH]&#8208;InsP5 at the 5&#8208;position, while other InsP5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP&#8208;InsP4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP&#8208;InsP4, providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.</dc:description>

         <title>Imaging&#8208;Based High&#8208;Content Screening with Clickable Probes Identifies XPB Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS&#8217;s ability to directly assess drug&#8208;protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging&#8208;based HCS and bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we synthesized a probe TL&#8208;alkyne (TL&#8208;alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe&#8208;labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated the XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1,874 FDA&#8208;approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with Cys342 of XPB, suppressed XPB&#8217;s ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio&#8208;orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Indium Single&#8208;Atom Sites Anchored on a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Single&#8208;Layer Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 into Formic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electroreduction of CO2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. We developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr&#8208;oxo clusters of a single&#8208;layer zirconium metal&#8208;organic framework (denoted as Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH = 1.67) at &#8722;1.8 V vs. RHE, the Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3 mA cm&#8722;2. The system maintains operational stability over 20 hours without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid&#8208;state electrolyte at 4 V full&#8208;cell voltage, Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5 mmol L&#8722;1, 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5&#8208;fold higher than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: (i) the low&#8208;coordinated In(III) single&#8208;atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single&#8208;intermediate adsorption on high&#8208;coordination metal centers; and (ii) the single&#8208;layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Crystalline&#160;2D&#160;Conjugated&#160;Metal&#8211;Organic&#160;Framework&#160;for Superior Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) have emerged as promising electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, developing 2D c&#8208;MOFs with multiple redox&#8208;active sites and well&#8208;defined structures to enhance the performance of SIBs and elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationship remains challenging. Herein, a 2D c&#8208;MOF single crystal (Cu&#8208;TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH&#8208;TBP) ligand. Three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic&#8208;level crystal structure of Cu&#8208;TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer&#8208;stacking. Cu&#8208;TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox&#8208;active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu&#8208;TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.25 A g&#8722;1, exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g&#8722;1). Experimental studies combined with theoretical calculations further elucidate the Na+ storage mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Organic Cages as Building Blocks for Framework Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Confined nanospaces play a fundamental role in nature, inspiring synthetic analogues that emulate biological precision and efficiency. Among these, porous crystalline materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and molecular cage compounds have emerged as powerful platforms for catalysis, separation, and energy storage. Recent developments highlight the potential of porous organic cages (POCs) as modular building blocks for the construction of advanced materials. In this Minireview, their integration into extended frameworks, such as Cage&#8208;COFs and Cage&#8208;MOFs, is described, as they allow precise control over porosity and enhance chemical robustness. These hybrids merge the structural regularity of COFs with the discrete functionality of cages, enabling the design of lightweight, hierarchically organised materials. In addition, polymer&#8208;containing Cage&#8208;POPs and supramolecular frameworks are discussed. Collectively, these developments position POCs as versatile synthons for next&#8208;generation porous materials, unlocking pathways toward functional, adaptive, and recyclable architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing HaloTag and SNAP&#8208;Tag Chemical Inducers of Dimerization to Probe Receptor Oligomerization and Downstream Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling protein&#8208;protein interactions is critical for dissecting signaling pathways, especially those initiated by ligand&#8208;receptor interactions which alter receptor oligomerization and drive downstream signaling cascades. Traditional methods for driving protein&#8208;protein complexes are using antibodies that face limitations in terms of stoichiometry, geometric rigidity, and antibody specificity. Chemical Inducers of Dimerization (CIDs) for fusion proteins such as HaloTag (Halo) and SNAP&#8208;Tags (SNAP) offer precise and covalent control of protein proximities, overcoming limitations of antibody&#8208;dependent methods. In this study, we expand the toolkit of Halo and SNAP CIDs with (1) benzylguanine (BG) and HaloTag ligand (HTL) crosslinkers featuring varying polyethylene glycol linker lengths and update this kit with (2) a FRET&#8208;based dimerizing sensor to induce and verify protein proximity. Here we establish our CIDs on extracellularly Halo&#8208; and SNAP&#8208;tagged TGF&#946;, BMP, neurotrophic factor and metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby elucidating the signaling potential of ligand&#8208;independent dimerization in a heteromeric fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Unsaturated Phosphine Oxides for Modular Antibody Rebridging and Single Reagent Peptide&#8208;Cyclisation&#8208;Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals; especially in the context of antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple&#8208;reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO&#8208;reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody&#8208;conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2&#8208;step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine&#8208;labeling with bicyclo[6.1.0]non&#8208;4&#8208;yne (BCN) or trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO&#8208;rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2+ cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl&#8208;phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl&#8208;ditriazolyl&#8208;phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single&#8208;reagent peptide&#8208;cyclization&#8208;bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide&#8208;protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide&#8208;cyclization and peptide&#8208;protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Protein Profiling Using Nanopores and Dimeric Aptamer&#8208;Modified DNA Carriers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well&#8208;suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore&#8208;based detection strategy utilising an aptamer&#8208;protein&#8208;aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double&#8208;stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge&#8208;based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub&#8208;picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer&#8208;binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real&#8208;time monitoring of ligand&#8208;induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single&#8208;molecule&#8208;based diagnostics.</dc:description>

         <title>From Triplet to Twist: The Photochemical E/Z&#8208;Isomerization Pathway of the Near&#8208;Infrared Photoswitch peri&#8208;Anthracenethioindigo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, significant progress has been made in the effort to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long&#8208;wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of &#960;&#8208;extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared absorption. The excited&#8208;state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including (TD&#8208;)DFT and ADC(2) calculations as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that E&#8208;to&#8208;Z photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead shows that photoswitching proceeds on the T&#8321; PES. These insights enhance our understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the &#960;&#8208;system and peri&#8208;connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red&#8208;shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference from oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid&#8208;based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Application of high&#8208;pressure conditions in chemical synthesis has proven to access a wide range of novel nitrogen&#8208;rich compounds and to overcome the stability of the dinitrogen molecule. In the present work, we report the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature (HPHT) synthesis of Bi7C10N18(N3(1&#8208;x)O3x), which features double&#8208;layers of poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine) [C4N6x&#8208;]n and non&#8208;polymerized guanidinate anions CN35&#8208;. The structure model was determined by means of synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and is fully corroborated by theoretical calculations. The poly&#8208;N&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;guanidine) illustrates an example of a 2D polymerized anionic C&#8211;N network and represents the first intermediate between highly charged CN35&#8208; anions and fully condensed graphitic carbon nitride networks achieved by HPHT conditions. This opens a pathway to widely varied family of hydrogen&#8208;free nitridocarbonates, which has the potential to develop into an alternative synthesis route to classical polycondensation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Poly&#8208;Lewis Acids Allow the Controlled Release of Guests</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Presently, there is a notable interest in poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLAs), their host&#8208;guest chemistry and their application in catalytic processes. The present study combines PLAs with redox&#8208;active dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctatetraene (dbCOT) units. dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs can be planarised by a two&#8208;electron reduction. The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc&#8208;XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended &#960;&#8208;systems. This &#960;&#8208;system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al&#8211;P coordination polymer. sc&#8208;XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT&#8208;based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Ion Transport at Primary Interparticle Boundaries of Polycrystalline Lithium&#8208;Rich Oxide in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polycrystalline lithium&#8208;rich oxide (PLRO) is a promising high&#8208;capacity cathode for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). However, its full potential is hindered by sluggish Li+ transport at primary interparticle boundaries, mainly due to the limited flowability of inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SEs). Additionally, infiltrating conventional SEs into PLRO can lead to severe interfacial side reactions because of high melting points. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature (&lt;200 &#176;C) co&#8208;sintering process that simultaneously synthesizes the SE and infiltrates it into the primary interparticle boundaries of PLRO, creating an integrated composite cathode for ASSBs. This process forms a continuous Li+ transport network, enabling deep bulk activation of PLRO. Meanwhile, the co&#8208;sintering process modulates the energy bands of the antibonding transition metal 3d&#8208;O 2p and nonbonding O 2p at the surface, achieving greater orbital overlap to suppress oxygen release and mitigate interfacial phase transformation. As a result, the PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit an impressive discharge capacity of 271 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C, 212 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5C, and retain 80.0% capacity after 150 cycles. This study highlights the importance of enhancing ion transport to maximize the performance of PLRO&#8208;based ASSBs, offering a practical solution for advancing energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrodotoxin is a neurotoxic marine alkaloid, first isolated in 1909 from pufferfish and named after the biological order tetraodontiformes. Since its structural elucidation in 1964, it has attracted the interest of synthetic organic chemists due to its exceptional polarity, complex architecture, and important biological activity. This review highlights the diversity of the tetrodotoxin natural product family and discusses the origins of derivatives, biosynthetic hypotheses, and biological activities. Furthermore, potential therapeutic applications and structure activity relationship studies are covered, along with the total syntheses of the natural product and selected derivatives that were published to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of Cyclopropyl Diboronates via 1,2&#8208;Boronate Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of polysubstituted cyclopropanes has garnered considerable attention in the field of synthetic chemistry in recent years. The introduction of boron groups into cyclopropane structures enables efficient functional modification of cyclopropane frameworks through downstream derivatization of carbon&#8208;boron bonds. Herein, we report an efficient method for the rapid construction of cyclopropyl diboronates from&#160;gem&#8208;bis(boronates) and thianthrenium (TT) salts. This transformation proceeds through a 1,2&#8208;rearrangement of&#160;tetra&#8208;coordinated boron species, delivering 1,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopropane diboronates in high efficiency. Subsequent borate derivatization provides access to highly diastereoselective polysubstituted cyclopropanes. This method offers a scalable and stereocontrolled approach to cyclopropane synthesis and functional diversification, expanding opportunities for the design of complex cyclopropyl architectures in medicinal chemistry, materials science, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Performance of Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zinc Ion Batteries via Zincophilic Solubilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogel electrolytes hold great promise in tackling severe issues facing aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, to satisfy the quest of flexible and eco&#8208;friendly batteries, developing low&#8208;cost and high mechanical durability hydrogel electrolyte remains a challenge. Here, employing the zincophilic solubilizer urea, we break the classical concentration limits of the low&#8208;cost Zn(Ac)2 salt and introduce it into the hydrogel skeleton. The &#8220;salting out&#8221; effect give the polymer chain sediments a tighter bundle and twist effect. The as&#8208;formed hydrogel electrolyte can endure 557% high elongation and 3.7 MPa compressive strength to resist repeated zinc plating/striping process and external physical stimuli. The in&#8208;situ polyurea solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer leads to thermodynamically stable anode/electrolyte interface. Utilizing the hydrogel electrolyte, the zinc anode shows high reversibility, leading to an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.93% for 150 cycles on the Zn//Cu battery. When assembled with NH4V4O10 cathode (NVO), the full battery delivers a high capacity of 253.8 mAh g&#8208;1 beyond 1000 cycles longevity at 1 A g&#8208;1. The pouch battery also shows a high capacity of 280.7 mAh g&#8208;1 at 500 mA g&#8208;1 and operate steadily for 90.13% retention after 200 cycles, and maintained a stable voltage even experienced bending and folding.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release Driven Arsenium Ion Bond Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although it marks a cornerstone of pnictenium ion [R2Pn]+ reactivity, the insertion of arsenium ions [R2As]+ into non&#8208;polar bonds remains highly challenging. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed, which circumvents the limitations of insertion reactivity of [R2As]+ (e.g. formal redox state of +V at As) via alleviation of ring strain in the substrate. Thus, unlocking arsenium ion bond insertion delivers the ring&#8208;expanded complexes [{LnM}(&#951;3&#8209;Pn3AsCy2][TEF] ({LnM} = Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Ni, Pn = P (1); {LnM} = {CpMo(CO)2}, Pn = P (2), As (5); Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217; = 1,2,4&#8208;tBu3C5H2, [TEF]&#8208; = [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8208;). Computational analysis of the reaction mechanism and quantum crystallographic investigation of 1 highlight the release of ring strain as the crucial driving force for this reactivity. This rational is corroborated by the isolation of the arsenium ion coordinated [{CpMo(CO)2}2(&#956;,&#951;2:2&#8208;P2AsCy2)][TEF] (3) as well as the phosphenium ion inserted [{CpMo(CO)2}(&#951;3&#8209;As3PPh2)][TEF] (4).</dc:description>
