      <title>Molecular Ligand&#8208;Mediated Assembly of Multicomponent Nanosheet Superlattices for Compact Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Inspired by the self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticle superlattices, we report herein a general methodology that exploits long&#8208;chain molecular ligands to induce ordered assembly of colloidal nanosheets (NSs), resulting in 2D laminate superlattices with high packing density. Co&#8208;assembly of two types of NSs further enables 2D/2D heterostructured superlattices. As a proof of concept, co&#8208;assembly of Ti  3  C  2  T  x  and graphene oxide (GO) NSs followed by thermal annealing leads to MXene&#8208;rGO superlattices with tunable microstructures, which exhibit significantly higher capacitance than their filtrated counterparts, delivering an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 1443 F cm  &#8208;3  at 2 mV S  &#8208;1  . Moreover, the as&#8208;fabricated binder&#8208;free symmetric supercapacitors show a high volumetric energy density of 42.1 Wh L  &#8208;1  , which is among the best ever reported for MXene&#8208;based materials in aqueous electrolytes. This work paves the way toward rational design of 2D material&#8208;based superstructures for energy applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Heterochiral Self&#8208;Discrimination&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Decanuclear Gold(I)&#8208;Sulfido Complexes into 2D Nanostructures with Chiral Anions&#8208;Tuned Morphologies</title>
      <dc:description>Chiral self&#8208;recognition and self&#8208;discrimination are of vital importance to biological processes. In this work, 2D regular rhombic nanocrystals (  RS  &#8208;NC  ) were fabricated through heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination between chiral polynuclear gold(I)&#8208;sulfido complex enantiomers, [(  R  &#8208;BINAP)  4  Au  10  S  4  ]Cl  2  (  R  &#8208;Au  10  ) and [(  S  &#8208;BINAP)  4  Au  10  S  4  ]Cl  2  (  S  &#8208;Au  10  ), in MeOH without the need for any surfactants or templates. The monitoring of nanocrystals (NCs) formation by TEM and DLS has uncovered the self&#8208;assembly process and shape evolution of the NCs and revealed a screw&#8208;dislocation dictated spiral growth of the rhombic NCs. Upon addition of chiral anions, the morphology of the gold NCs was found to change from rhombic to strip and quasi&#8208;hexagonal nanosheets, arising from reverse and rotational layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking to give the bilayer NCs. By applying a high temperature, rhombic gold nanoisland films were obtained from the rhombic NCs. The current study has provided a simple strategy towards the construction of regular geometric 2D NCs as well as their chiral anion&#8208;tuned and reverse and rotational stacking&#8208;determined morphology change via heterochiral self&#8208;discrimination.</dc:description>

      <title>Stereoselective Seed Induced Living Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
      <dc:description>Stereoselective and temporally controlled supramolecular polymerizations are ubiquitous in nature and is a desirable attribute to the design of chiral, well&#8208;defined functional materials. Kinetically controlled, living supramolecular polymerization (LSP) has emerged recently to synthesize supramolecular polymers with controlled length and narrow dispersity. On the other hand, stringent design requirements for chiral discriminating monomers precludes the stereoselective control of the supramolecular polymer&#8217;s structure. Herein we report a synergetic stereo and structural control of supramolecular polymerization by the realization of an unprecedented stereoselective seed induced LSP.

      <title>Accelerating Electrochemical Reactions in a Voltage&#8208;Controlled Interfacial Microreactor</title>
      <dc:description>Microdroplet chemistry is attracting increasing attention for accelerated reactions at the air/solution interface. We report here a novel voltage&#8208;controlled interfacial microreactor allowing acceleration of electrochemical reactions which are not observed in bulk or conventional electrochemical cells. The microreactor is formed at the interface of the Taylor cone in an electrospray emitter with a large orifice. This allows continuous contact of the electrode and the reactants at/near the interface. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, electro&#8208;oxidative C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H coupling and electro&#8208;oxidation of benzyl alcohol were shown to be accelerated by more than an order of magnitude compared to the corresponding bulk reactions. The new electrochemical microreactor has unique features that allow i) voltage&#8208;controlled acceleration of electrochemical reactions achieved by voltage&#8208;dependent formation of the interfacial microreactor; ii) &#8220;reversible&#8221; electrochemical derivatization; and iii)  in situ  mechanistic study and capture of key radical intermediates when coupled with mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

      <title>Amplified FRET Nanoflare: An Endogenous mRNA&#8208;Powered Nanomachine for Intracellular MicroRNA Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>It is of great value to detect the biological molecules in live cells. However, probes for imaging low abundance targets in live cells are limited by the &#8220;one&#8208;to&#8208;one&#8221; signal&#8208;triggered model. Here, we introduce the concept of amplified FRET nanoflare, which employs high abundance endogenous mRNA as fuel strands to amplify the detection of low abundance intracellular miRNA. As far as we know, this is the first report of an endogenous mRNA&#8208;powered nanomachine for intracellular molecular detection. We experimentally prove the mechanism of the nanomachine, and demonstrate its specificity and sensitivity. The proposed amplified FRET nanoflare can act as an excellent intracellular molecular detection strategy that is promising for biological and medical applications.</dc:description>

The proposed amplified FRET nanoflare can act as an excellent intracellular molecular detection strategy that is promising for biological and medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Bisporphyrin&#8208;Fused Pentacenes Exhibiting Abnormal High Stability</title>
      <dc:description>A series of largely  &#960;  &#8208;extended multichromophoric molecules including cross&#8208;conjugated, half cross&#8208;conjugated, conjugation&#8208;interrupted and linearly conjugated systems were synthesized and characterized. These multichromophoric molecular systems revealed interesting structural&#8208;property relationships. While the cross&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenequinone chromophores displayed broad UV&#8208;Vis absorption bands spanning from 350 nm through 650 nm, the linearly&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacene chromophores exhibited much red&#8208;shifted absorptions at 800 &#8211; 900 nm. Bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  showed rich redox chemistry with 7 and 8 observable redox states respectively. The linearly&#8208;conjugated bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes (  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  ) possess much narrower HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps (1.65 and 1.42 eV redox, respectively) and higher HOMO energy levels than those of their pentacene analogues (2.23 and 2.01 eV redox, respectively), similar to those of much unstable hexacenes and heptacenes. Counterintuitively,  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  demonstrated unusual stability. An estimated half&#8208;life of &gt; 945 h was obtained for bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacene  Pen&#8208;2a, which is remarkably much longer than that of its pentacene analogue (  BPE&#8208;P,&#160;half&#8208;life, 33 h). Investigations of the abnormal stability of  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a  using femtosecond transient absorption technique suggested nickel porphyrin centered photo&#8208;events leading to a short&#8208;lived intermediate charge transfer state, consequently blocking the photodegradation pathways. This charge transfer event is believed to play a major role in causing the abnormal stability of  Pen&#8208;1b  and  Pen&#8208;2a. Steric effect and decreased LUMO energy level also contributed to stabilizing the bisporphyrin&#8208;fused pentacenes.</dc:description>

      <title>Construction of Organelle&#8208;like Architecture via Dynamic DNA Assembly in Living Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Intracellular construction of artificial organelle&#8208;like architectures is an emerging paradigm for recreating cellular functions and interfering disease process. Design of controllable dynamic systems is vital for the construction of organelle&#8208;like architectures in living cells, but has proven to be remarkably difficult due to the lack of control over defined topology and topological transformation of self&#8208;assembled structures. Herein, we report a DNA based dynamic assembly system that achieves lysosomal acidic microenvironment specifically inducing topological transformation from nanoparticles to organelle&#8208;like hydrogel architecture in living cells. Designer DNA nanoparticles are constructed from double&#8208;stranded DNA with cytosine&#8208;rich stick ends (C&#8208;monomer) by a condensation process mediated with magnesium ions and are internalized into cells via lysosomal pathway. The lysosomal acidic microenvironment can activate the polymerization of linear DNA monomers, inducing transformation from nanoparticles to micro&#8208;sized organelle&#8208;like hydrogel which could further escape into cytoplasm. We show how the organelle&#8208;like hydrogel regulates the cellular behaviors: cytoskeleton is deformed, cell tentacles are significantly shortened, and cell migration is promoted.

      <title>Truxenone&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework as All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;ion Battery Cathode with High Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have been recognized as one of the ideal choices for energy storage techniques for practical applications given their safety and long&#8208;term stability. However, limited availability of electrode active materials with high capacity and long&#8208;term stability fabricated through low cost procedure remains a bottleneck. Herein, we report a truxenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;TRO) as cathode materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIBs. The high&#8208;density carbonyl groups combined with the ordered crystalline COF structure greatly facilitate lithium ion storage via reversible redox reactions. As a result, a high specific capacity of 268 mAh g  &#8208;1  , almost 97.5% of the calculated theoretical capacity was achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest capacity among all COF&#8208;based cathode materials for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIBs reported so far. Moreover, the excellent cycling stability (99.9% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C rate) shown by COF&#8208;TRO suggests such truxenone&#8208;based COFs have great potential in energy storage applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the Reactivity of a Heterogeneous Catalyst using N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligands for C&#8208;H Activation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>We report in this communication the dramatic impact of the addition of N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands on the reactivity and selectivity of heterogeneous Ru catalysts in the context of C&#8208;H activation reactions. Using a simple and robust protocol, we have prepared a series of new air stable catalysts starting from commercially available Ru on carbon (Ru/C) and differently substituted NHCs. Associated with C&#8208;H deuteration processes, depending on Ru/C&#8208;NHC ratios, the chemical outcome can be controlled to a large extent. Indeed, tuning the reactivity of the Ru catalyst with NHC has allowed: i) to increase the chemoselectivity and the regioselectivity for the deuteration of alcohols in organic media; ii) to synthesize fragile pharmaceutically relevant deuterated heterocycles (azine, purine) otherwise completely reduced using unmodified commercial catalysts; iii) to discover a novel reactivity for such heterogeneous Ru catalysts: the selective C&#8208;1 deuteration of aldehydes.</dc:description>

      <title>Optical Control of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system for gene editing using photolabile crRNA</title>
      <dc:description>Currently CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 is a widely used efficient tool for gene editing. Precise control over CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system in temporal and spatial resolution is essentially important for studying gene regulation and editing. Here, we presented a novel light&#8208;controlled crRNA via coupling vitamin E and a photolabile linker at 5&#8217; terminus to inactivate CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 system. The vitamin E modification did not affect ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation of Cas9/crRNA /tracrRNA complexes, but did inhibit the association of RNP with the target DNA. Upon light irradiation, vitamin E caged crRNA was successfully activated to achieve light&#8208;induced genome editing of Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor A (VEGFA) in human cells through T7E1 assay and Sanger sequencing as well as gene knockdown of EGFP expression in EGFP stably expressing cells. This new caging strategy for crRNA is readily achievable and will possibly provide new methods for spatiotemporal photoregulation of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 mediated gene editing.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts from Multivariate MOFs for Highly Selective Reduction of CO2 at Low Pressures</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are of great interest due to their ultrahigh activity and selectivity. However, the lack of general synthetic protocol makes it difficult in the construction of model SACs to discern activity difference of diverse single&#8208;atom metal species. Herein, a universal synthetic strategy towards single&#8208;atom metal implanted N&#8208;doped carbon (M1&#8208;N&#8208;C; M = Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) has been developed based on multivariate MOFs. The M1&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts, featuring identical parameters in chemical environment and support, provide an ideal platform to identify the differentiated activity of single&#8208;atom metal species. Upon being employed toward electrocatalytic CO2  reduction, Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C exhibits a very high CO faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 96.8%, far surpassing Fe&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Cu&#8208;based M1&#8208;N&#8208;C. Remarkably, the best&#8208;performed Ni1&#8208;N&#8208;C even possesses excellent CO FE at low CO2  pressures, which is more challenging, demonstrating a promising opportunity for the direct use of dilute CO2  feedstock.</dc:description>

However, MAT probe, if entering the cell as a whole, might not be optimal for each individual therapeutic agent (with different physicochemical properties), to achieve their best performance, which hinders the strategy optimization.

      <title>Solar Reforming of Biomass with Homogeneous Carbon Dots</title>
      <dc:description>A sunlight&#8208;powered process is reported that employs carbon dots (CDs) as light absorber for the conversion of lignocellulose into sustainable H  2  fuel and organics. This photocatalytic system operates in pure and untreated sea water using a benign pH (2&#8208;8) at ambient temperature and pressure. The CDs can be produced in a scalable synthesis directly from biomass itself and their solubility allows for good interactions with the insoluble biomass substrates. They also display excellent photophysical properties with a high fraction of long&#8208;lived charge carriers and the availability of a reductive and an oxidative quenching pathway. The presented CD&#8208;based biomass photoconversion system opens new avenues for sustainable, practical, and renewable fuel production through biomass valorization.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Cooperative Photoswitching in Dihydropyrene Dimers</title>
      <dc:description>We present a strategy to achieve highly cooperative photoswitching, where the initial switching event greatly facilitates subsequent switching of the neighboring unit. By linking donor/acceptor substituted dihydropyrenes via suitable&#160;p&#8208;conjugated bridges, the quantum yield for the second photochemical ring&#8208;opening process could be enhanced by more than two orders of magnitude as compared to the first ring&#8208;opening. As a result, the intermediate mixed switching state is not detected during photoisomerization although it is formed during the thermal back reaction. Comparing the switching behavior of various dimers, both experimentally and computationally, helped to unravel the crucial role of the bridging moiety connecting both photochromic units. The presented dihydropyrene dimer serves as model system for longer cooperative switching chains, which, in principle, should enable efficient and directional transfer of information along a defined path. Moreover, our concept allows to enhance the photosensitivity in oligomeric and polymeric systems and materials thereof.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Electrochemical side reactions, often referred to as &#8220;electrode fouling&#8221;, are known to be a major challenge in electro&#8208;organic synthesis and the functionality of modern batteries.

      <title>Idiosyncratic Ag7Pt2O7, an Electron Imprecise yet Diamagnetic, Small Band Gap Oxide</title>
      <dc:description>The seminal qualitative concepts of chemical bonding, as presented by Walter Kossel and Gilbert Newton Lewis back in 1916, have proven to be of lasting general validity. Even nowadays, these basic rules of chemical valence still serve as a touchstone for validating the plausibility of composition and constitution of a given chemical compound. Here, we report on Ag  7  Pt  2  O  7  , the composition of which violates the basic rules of chemical valence and displays an exotic crystal structure. The first coordination sphere of platinum is characteristic of tetravalent platinum. Thus, the electron count corresponds to Ag  7  Pt  2  O  7  *e  &#8208;  , where excess electrons are associated with the silver sub&#8208;structure. For such a scenario, one would expect that the excess electrons are either itinerant or localized forming Ag&#8211;Ag bonds. Neither of these assumptions complies with the experiment. The material does not show metallic conductivity, nor does the structure feature Ag&#8211;Ag pairs. Instead, indications have been obtained that the excess electrons organize themselves in 2e &#8211; 4c bonds within the silver sub&#8208;structure. This finding of a subvalent silver oxide, taken together with singular previous similar reports, is suited to reveal a new general facet pertinent to the chemistry of silver.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thin zeolitic nanosheets have emerged as fascinating materials for catalysis and separation. The controllability of nanosheets stacking is extremely challenging in the chemistry of two&#8208;dimensional zeolitic materials. So far, the organization of zeolitic nanosheets in hydrothermal synthesis has been limited by the lack of tunable control over the guest&#8208;host interactions between organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) and zeolitic nanosheets. Here, we report a direct synthetic methodology that enables systematic manipulation of the aluminosilicate MWW&#8208;type nanosheets stacking. Variable control of guest&#8208;host interactions is rationally achieved by synergistically altering the charge density of OSDAs and synthetic silica&#8208;to&#8208;alumina composition. These finely&#8208;controlled interactions allow the successful preparation of series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) zeolites with MWW&#8208;layer stacking in wide ranges from variations of disorder to fully&#8208;order, leading to tunable catalytic activity in cracking reaction. These results highlight unprecedented opportunities to modulate zeolitic nanosheets arrangement in 3D zeolites whose structure can be tailored for catalysis and separation.</dc:description>

The Pt SACs with controlled oxidation state were then employed for oxidation of CO, CH4, or NO, and their activity was compared with Pt NPs.

      <title>Toward Efficient Synthesis of Chiral Zeolites: A Rational Strategy for Fluoride&#8208;Free Synthesis of STW&#8208;Type Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>The STW&#8208;type zeolite is significantly attractive for developing novel enantioselective syntheses/separation of chiral compounds because it is the only chiral zeolitic microporous material whose enantioenriched synthesis has been achieved. Besides the conventional industries where zeolites are used, STW should have diverse industrial applications such as in the pharmaceutical and food industries. However, the toxic and caustic fluoride required for synthesizing STW severely hinders its commercialization by mass production. Here, we report the first example of fluoride&#8208;free STW synthesis, where the two roles of fluoride&#8212;formation of a zeolitic framework rich in tetravalent T&#8208;atoms and promotion of double 4&#8208;membered ring unit formation&#8212;were substituted by dry gel conversion and Ge addition, respectively. The obtained STW was highly crystalline, with a similar micropore volume and thermal stability as those of original fluoride&#8208;based STW. Our approach is promising not only for the fluoride&#8208;free synthesis of enantiomeric STW but also for general fluoride&#8208;free syntheses.</dc:description>

      <title>Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water by Macrocycle&#8208;Containing Covalent Polymer Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Access to clean drinking water is a recognized societal need that touches on the health and livelihood of millions of people worldwide. This is providing an incentive to develop new water&#8208;treatment technologies. Traditional technologies, while widespread, are usually inefficient at removing organic pollutants from sewage or so&#8208;called grey water. Macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks have begun to attract attention in the context of water treatment owing to the inherent stability provided by the polymer backbones and their ability to capture micropollutant guests as the result of tunable macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances (from 2016 to mid&#8208;2020) involving the removal of organic micropollutants from water using macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks.

      <title>Suppressing Interfacial Charge Recombination in Electron Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 21%</title>
      <dc:description>The performances of reported electron transport layer (ETL)&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still inferior to ETL&#8208;containing devices. This is mainly due to severe interfacial charge recombination occurred at the transparent conducting oxide (TCO)/perovskite interface, where the photo&#8208;injected electrons in the TCO can travel back to recombine with holes in the perovskite layer. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate that a non&#8208;annealed, insulating, amorphous metal oxyhydroxide, atomic&#8208;scale thin interlayer (~3 nm) between the TCO and perovskite facilitates electron tunnelling and suppresses the interfacial charge recombination. This largely reduced the interfacial charge recombination loss and achieved a record efficiency of 21.1% for  n&#8208;i&#8208;p  structured ETL&#8208;free PSCs, outperforming their ETL&#8208;containing metal oxide counterparts (18.7%), as well as narrowing the efficiency gap with high&#8208;efficiency PSCs employing highly crystalline TiO  2  ETLs.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferromagnetically Coupled S = 1 Chains in Crystals of Verdazyl&#8208;Nitronyl Nitroxide Diradicals</title>
      <dc:description>Thermally stable organic diradicals with a triplet ground state along with large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap have significant potential for advanced technological applications. A series of phenylene&#8208;bridged diradicals with oxoverdazyl and nitronyl nitroxide units were synthesized  via  a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the corresponding iodoverdazyls with a nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide gold(I) complex with high yields (up to 82%). The synthesized diradicals exhibit high stability and do not decompose in an inert atmosphere up to 180 &#176;C. The magnetic properties of prepared phenylene&#8208;coupled diradicals were investigated and magneto&#8208;structural correlations were established. For the studied diradicals, both substantial antiferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#187; &#8208;64&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) and ferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#179; 25 and 100&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) intramolecular exchange interactions were observed. The sign of the exchange interaction is determined both by the bridging moiety (  para  &#8208; or  meta  &#8208;phenylene) and by the type of oxoverdazyl block (  C  &#8208;linked or  N  &#8208;linked). Upon crystallization, diradicals with the triplet ground state form unique one&#8208;dimensional exchange&#8208;coupled chains with strong intra&#8208; and weak inter&#8208;diradical ferromagnetic coupling.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thermally stable organic diradicals with a triplet ground state along with large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap have significant potential for advanced technological applications. A series of phenylene&#8208;bridged diradicals with oxoverdazyl and nitronyl nitroxide units were synthesized  via  a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the corresponding iodoverdazyls with a nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide gold(I) complex with high yields (up to 82%). The synthesized diradicals exhibit high stability and do not decompose in an inert atmosphere up to 180 &#176;C. The magnetic properties of prepared phenylene&#8208;coupled diradicals were investigated and magneto&#8208;structural correlations were established. For the studied diradicals, both substantial antiferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#187; &#8208;64&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) and ferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#179; 25 and 100&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) intramolecular exchange interactions were observed. The sign of the exchange interaction is determined both by the bridging moiety (  para  &#8208; or  meta  &#8208;phenylene) and by the type of oxoverdazyl block (  C  &#8208;linked or  N  &#8208;linked). Upon crystallization, diradicals with the triplet ground state form unique one&#8208;dimensional exchange&#8208;coupled chains with strong intra&#8208; and weak inter&#8208;diradical ferromagnetic coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Surface Reconstruction of Ultrathin Palladium Nanosheets during Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>A surface reconstructing phenomenon is discovered on a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin Pd nanosheets catalyst for aqueous CO2 electroreduction. The pristine nanosheets with dominant (111) facet sites are transformed into crumpled sheet&#8208;like structures prevalent in electrocatalytically active (100) sites. The reconstruction increases the density of active sites and reduces the CO binding strength on Pd surfaces, remarkably promoting the CO2 reduction to CO. A high CO faradaic efficiency of 93% is achieved with a site&#8208;specific activity of 6.6 mA cm&#8208;2 at a moderate overpotential of 590 mV on reconstructed 50 nm Pd nanosheets. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest the CO intermediate as a key factor driving the structural transformation during CO2 reduction. This study highlights the dynamic nature of defective metal nanosheets under reaction conditions and suggests new opportunities in surface engineering of 2D metal nanostructures to tune their electrocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Negative pressure pyrolysis induced highly accessible single sites dispersed on 3D graphene frameworks for enhanced oxygen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>The surface structure of supports is related to the properties of catalytic sites and their spatial structure also plays a dominant role in the mass transfer during catalysis process. Herein, we report a negative pressure pyrolysis to access dense single metal sites (Co, Fe, Ni etc.) with high accessibility dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) graphene frameworks (GFs), during which the differential pressure between inside and outside of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) promotes the cleavage of the derived&#8208;carbon layers and gradual expansion of mesopores. In situ transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller tests reveal the formed 3D GFs possess an enhanced mesoporosity and external surface area, which greatly favor the mass transport and utilization of metal sites. This contributes to an excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.901 V vs. RHE). Theoretical calculations verify that selective carbon cleavage near Co centers can efficiently lower the overall ORR theoretical overpotential in comparison with intact atomic configuration. This work discovers the structure&#8208;property correlations that provides an idea of designing highly accessible catalysts for practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Invoked Through Norbornyl&#8208;Driven Intermolecular Interaction Intensification with Anomalous Reversible Solid&#8208;State Photochromism</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, norbornyl (NB), a bulky annular nonconjugated (CN&#8208;type) spacer, is melded into &#960; systems to construct two groups of ladder&#8208;type room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) luminogens. The effect of the CN&#8208;type moiety on &#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions, packing modes and RTP performance is explored systematically. The experimental and computational results demonstrate the versatility of NB in reducing &#960;&#8722;&#960; distances and synergistically intensifying the intermolecular interactions, which not only induces intersystem crossing from S 1  to T n  but also diminishes the nonradiative decay of triplet excitons. Impressively, 1800&#8208;fold phosphorescence lifetime enhancement is achieved in comparison with the reference compounds without NB. The molecular packing and RTP performance can be further modulated by the length of the backbones and terminal end&#8208;groups. It is quite peculiar that NB&#8208;annulated phthalic acid exhibits reversible photochromism in the solid state, likely due to the formation of persistent radical pairs. Our study paves an ingenious avenue towards enhancing intermolecular interactions and provides significant implications for a better comprehensive understanding of the origin of their RTP and the inherent photophysical mechanism.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The utilization of N&#8208;centered radicals to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds has attracted considerable attention recently, due to their powerful reactivities and the concomitant construction of C&#8722;N bonds. However, the generation and control of N&#8208;centered radicals remain particularly challenging. Herein we report a tethering strategy using SOMO&#8208;HOMO converted distonic radical anions for the site&#8208;specific aminations of imidates and amidines with aid of the non&#8208;covalent interaction, which features a remarkably broad substrate scope including the late&#8208;stage functionalizations of bioactive molecules. Furthermore, after the kinetic studies, Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the reaction mechanism is thoroughly investigated, revealing the aminations likely involve the directly homolytic cleavage of N&#8722;H bonds and subsequently controllable 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer.</dc:description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Assembly of Active Liquid Metal Colloidal Cluster</title>
      <dc:description>We report the reconfigurable assembly of rod&#8208;shaped eutectic gallium&#8208;indium alloy (EGaIn) liquid metal colloidal motors by mimicking the dandelion flower&#8217;s growing process. The EGaIn nanorod with a diameter of 210 nm and a length of 850 nm was synthesized via an ultrasound&#8208;assisted physical dispersion and demonstrated to be a core&#8208;shell structure with a 30 nm GaOOH shell and zero&#8208;valent liquid core. The EGaIn motors could autonomously move at a speed of 41.2 &#956;m/s under an acoustic field. By modulating the frequency of applied acoustic field, these acoustically&#8208;driven EGaIn colloidal motors could self&#8208;organize into various stripe and round patterns and then a stably dandelion flower&#8208;like cluster, like a flower&#8217;s growing process. This dandelion flower&#8208;like EGaIn colloidal motor clusters could collectively move and redisperse by changing the applied acoustic frequency. Numerical simulation reveals that the reconfigurable EGaIn dandelion flower&#8208;like clusters were synergistically performed by the acoustic propulsion in combination with steric repulsion and hydrodynamics. Compared with passive nanospheres, the EGaIn colloidal motors were proved with promising ability of locomotion and assembly. Such an active dandelion flower&#8208;like cluster provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solution to prepare reconfigurable active liquid metal colloidal assembles with controlled shapes and locomotion.</dc:description>

      <title>A Gallium(III) Complex that Engages Protein Disulfide Isomerase A3 (PDIA3) as an Anticancer Target</title>
      <dc:description>Gallium(III)&#8208;based drugs have gained momentum in cancer therapy for the relevance to iron&#8208;dependent anticancer activity. Judicious choice of ligands is critical to design Ga(III) drugs with improved oral bioavailability, antitumor efficacy and even the distinct mechanism from simple Ga(III) salts. Herein, we first describe Ga(III) complexes of planar tetradentate salen ligands (salen=2,3&#8208;bis[(4&#8208;dialkylamino&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)amino] but&#8208;2&#8208;enedinitrile)) as well as labile axial solvent ligands, which display tumor growth inhibition  in vitro  and  in vivo  comparable to cisplatin. Extensive chemical biology approaches employing confocal fluorescence microscopy, western blotting, mRNA profiling, chemical proteomics and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) provide compelling evidences that PDIA3, one member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response functionally, is a direct target of  Ga&#8208;1  in&#8197;vitro  and in cells. This work offers a new route to designing and synthesizing Ga&#8208;based drugs supported by planar tetradentate ligands, and reveals that PDIA3 inhibition is an important target that triggers ER stress, mitochondria dysfunction, and subsequent cell death.</dc:description>

      <title>How to Remove the Capping Agent from Pd Nanocubes without Destructing Their Surface Structure for the Maximization of Catalytic Activity?</title>
      <dc:description>We report a robust method for effectively removing the chemisorbed Br&#8722; ions, a capping agent, from the surface of Pd nanocubes to maximize their catalytic activity. The Br&#8722; ions can be removed by simply heating the sample in water, but the desorption of Br&#8722; ions will expose the underneath Pd atoms to the O2 from air for the formation of a relatively thick oxide layer. During potential cycling, the oxide layer evolves into detrimental features such as steps and terraces. By introducing a trace amount of hydrazine into the system, the Br&#8722; ions can be removed by heating without forming a thick oxide layer. The as&#8208;cleaned nanocubes show greatly enhanced activity toward formic acid oxidation. This cleaning method can also remove Br&#8722; ions from Rh nanocubes and it is expected to work for other combinations of nanocrystals and capping agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Water&#8208;Induced Structural Dynamic Process in Molecular Sieve&#160;under Mild Hydrothermal Conditions: A Novel Ship&#8208;in&#8208;Bottle Strategy for Acidity Identification and Catalyst Modification</title>
      <dc:description>Water is the most important and universal substance in nature. People have been striving to pursue and discover water&#8208;related processes and imitate these important discoveries for the benefit of mankind. As a successful example of human imitating the formation of natural materials, molecular sieves have been synthesized under hydrothermal condition and applied in industry. Herein, we reveal an unforeseen observation on a very special water&#8208;induced structural dynamic process of these materials. Dynamic and reversible breakage&#8208;bonding of T&#8208;O&#8208;T bonds in silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) occurs due to interactions between gaseous water and molecular sieve framework under mild hydrothermal conditions and is confirmed by successful detection of the incorporation of  17  O from H  2  17  O into molecular sieve framework. Successfully encapsulation of bulky molecules trimethylphosphine and pyridine (kinetic diameters much larger than the pore size of SAPO&#8208;34) into CHA cavities consolidated the water&#8208;induced dynamic process. Consequently, new insights into the dynamic features of molecular sieve in the atmosphere of water are provided.

      <dc:description>The electroreduction of carbon dioxide using renewable electricity is an appealing strategy for the sustainable synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Extensive research has focused on the production of ethylene, ethanol and  n  &#8208;propanol, but more complex C  4  molecules have been scarcely reported.

Electrolyses of possible molecular intermediates, coupled with density functional theory, led us to propose that CO  2  first electroreduces to acetaldehyde&#8212;a key C  2  intermediate to 1&#8208;butanol.

      <dc:description>Nature has developed amazing supramolecular constructs to deliver outstanding charge transport capabilities using metalloporphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular arrays. Here we are incorporating simple, naturally inspired supramolecular interactions via the axial complexation of metalloporphyrins into the formation of a single&#8208;molecule wire in a nanoscale gap. We observe that small structural changes in the axial coordinating linkers result in dramatic changes in the transport properties of the metalloporphyrin&#8208;based wire. In a nutshell, the increased flexibility of a pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;methanethiol ligand due to an extra methyl group, as compared to a more rigid 4&#8208;pyridinethiol linker, allows the former to adopt an unexpected highly conductive stacked structure between the two junction electrodes and the metalloporphyrin ring. DFT calculations reveal a molecular junction structure composed of a shifted stack of the three molecular backbones, namely the two pyridine ligands sandwiching the metalloporphyrin ring, which is stabilized by a combination of the porphyrin metal center coordinating the pyridinic N and the pyridine/porphyrin p&#8208;p overlapping. Contrarily, the more rigid 4&#8208;mercaptopyridine ligand presents a more expected octahedral coordination of the metalloporphyrin metal center, leading to a longer electron pathway of lower conductance. Furthermore, we show that a mechanical perturbation imposed along the main molecular junction axis results in a rich variety of more extended supramolecular structures between the pyridine linkers and the porphyrin ring spanning the tunneling gap, some of them involving the substituents phenyl groups of the porphyrin ring, and reaching also high conductance values. This works sets an illustrative example of the use of supramolecular chemistry in the construction of efficient molecular conduits towards the development of supramolecular electronics, a concept already exploited in natural organisms.</dc:description>

      <title>Openwork@Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles for Lactate Depletion and Tumor Microenvironment Regulation</title>

The latter event facilitates the activation of a co&#8208;delivered prodrug for enhancing anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis efficacy.

      <title>Salivary excretion of renal clearable silver nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Salivary elimination is an important pathway for the body to excrete small molecules and digestive enzymes. However, it has never been considered in the elimination of engineered nanoparticles.   Herein, we reported an interesting finding that renal clearable near&#8208;infrared emitting glutathione coated silver nanoparticles of ~2nm (GS&#8208;AgNPs) can selectively accumulate in the submandibular salivary gland, followed by being excreted in its   excretory duct.

      <title>Identifying the Geometric Site Dependence of Spinel Oxides for the Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
      <dc:description>Co&#8208;based spinel oxides are considered as promising catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high&#8208;value chemicals. Co  3  O  4  &#160;is of mixed valences with the presence of both Co  2+  &#160;and Co  3+  &#160;at different atom locations. Identifying the activity of each atomic site is critical to propose the design principle of advanced electrocatalysts, and tuning the geometrical sites at the atom level in Co  3  O  4  &#160;could lead to significant modifications&#160;on its electronic and thus modulate the catalytic activities for the electrooxidation of HMF. A typical spinel lattice contains a tetrahedral Co  2+  &#160;site and two octahedral Co  3+  &#160;sites. In this work, the impact of different sites in Co  3  O  4  was uncovered by selectively building block in the tetrahedral site and&#160;the octahedral site by Zn  2+  &#160;and Al  3+  &#160;respectively. It was found that the Co  3+  &#160;in octahedral site tends to be oxidized to the high valence of cobalt oxyhydroxide as the active centers and thus has higher activity than tetrahedral Co  2+  &#160;sites for HMF oxidation. The NH  3  &#160;TPD results indicate that the tetrahedral Co  2+  &#160;has abundant Lewis acidic adsorption sites in Co  3  O  4&#160;  and CoAl  2  O  4,  &#160;and the tetrahedral sites can provide chemical adsorption sites for HMF oxidation. Based on the finding of the geometric site dependence, the HMF oxidation activity was further improved by the replacement with Cu  2+  &#160;in the tetrahedral site of spinel oxides (CuCo  2  O  4  ). The CuCo  2  O  4  &#160;shows 4&#8208;fold enhancement for the HMF oxidation&#160;relative to Co  3  O  4  &#160;and shows a record performance among Co&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Integrating Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging Information by Single&#8208;Luminophore Dual Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>The fact that the lifetime of photoluminescence often is difficult to access because of&#160; the weakness of the emission signals, seriously limits the possibility to gain local bioimaging information in time&#8208;resolved luminescence probing. We herein aim to provide a solution to this problem by creating a general photophysical strategy based on the use of molecular probes designed for single&#8208;luminophore dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The structural and conformational design makes the dual TADF strong both in diluted solution and in aggregated state, enabling less sensitivity to oxygen quenching and a unique dual&#8208;channel time&#8208;resolved imaging capability. As the two TADF signals show mutual complementarity during probing, a dual&#8208;channel mean lifetime mapping is established to reduce the time&#8208;resolved&#160; imaging distortion by 30&#8208;40%. Consequently, the leading intracellular local imaging information is serialized and integrated as compared to any single time&#8208;resolved signal, leading to a significant improvement of the probing capacity.</dc:description>

      <title>DMSO Enabled Selective Radical O&#8208;H Activation of 1,3(4)&#8208;Diols</title>
      <dc:description>Selectivity control is one of the central topics in organic chemistry.

      <title>Catalytic oxidation of CO on a curved Pt(111) surface: simultaneous ignition at all facets through a transient CO&#8208;O complex</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) on transition metals, such as platinum (Pt), is commonly viewed as a sharp transition from the CO&#8208;inhibited surface to the active metal, covered with oxygen (O). However, we find that minor amounts of O are present in the CO&#8208;poisoned layer that explain why, surprisingly, CO desorbs at stepped and flat Pt crystal planes at once, regardless of the reaction conditions. Using near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoemission and a curved Pt(111) crystal we probe the chemical composition at surfaces with variable step density during the CO oxidation reaction. The systematic analysis of carbon and oxygen core levels across the curved crystal reveals that, right before light&#8208;off, subsurface O builds up within (111) terraces. This is key to trigger the simultaneous ignition of the catalytic reaction at different Pt surfaces, as indicated by ab&#8208;initio theory: a CO&#8208;Pt&#8208;O complex is formed that equals the CO chemisorption energy at terraces and steps, leading to the abrupt desorption of poisoning CO from all crystal facets at the same temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>The Power of Iodane&#8208;Guided C&#8722;H Coupling: A Group&#8208;Transfer Strategy in Which a Halogen Works for Its Money</title>
      <dc:description>
I of the tiger: The iodine atom in Ar&#8722;I bonds is commonly conceived as a leaving group. This Minireview discusses a powerful alternative reactivity of iodine substituents by which &#955;3&#8208;iodoarenes direct C&#8722;H coupling events at the corresponding aromatic ring.







Abstract
Hypervalent organoiodane reagents are ubiquitous in organic synthesis, both as oxidants and as electrophilic group&#8208;transfer agents. In addition to these hallmark applications, a complementary strategy is gaining momentum that exploits the ability of &#955;3&#8208;iodanes to undergo iodine&#8208;to&#8208;arene group transfer, for example, via iodonio&#8208;Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement processes. This Minireview discusses recent advances in the use of this method to access a variety of the C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalized iodoarenes. While Section&#8197;2 is focused on the ortho C&#8722;H propargylation, allylation, and the more unusual para C&#8722;H benzylation, Section&#8197;3 is devoted to the C&#8208;arylation of enol and phenol substrates. The accompanying discussion includes mechanistic considerations and goes into the synthetic applications of the final iodoarene cores. The Minireview concludes with further conceptual extensions of the method, including the use of non&#8208;conventional coupling partners (for example, cyanoalkylation), improved access to &#955;3&#8208;iodane building blocks, and the development of iterative approaches to polysubstituted iodoarenes.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Biomolecule&#8208;Based Hydrogels and Their Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Having control: Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with triggered stiffness properties are attracting growing interest as smart materials for different applications. The Review discusses the design of biomolecule&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels and their applications as self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;memory, and controlled drug&#8208;release matrices, as well as mechanical actuators. Surface&#8208;confined switchable hydrogels and their uses are also introduced.







Abstract
This Review presents polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins as functional stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer scaffolds that yield hydrogels with controlled stiffness. Different physical or chemical triggers can be used to structurally reconfigure the crosslinking units and control the stiffness of the hydrogels. The integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular complexes and stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecular units as crosslinkers leads to hybrid hydrogels undergoing reversible triggered transitions across different stiffness states. Different applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogels are discussed. The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogel films on surfaces and their applications are discussed. The coating of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles with stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels for controlled drug release is also presented.

The integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular complexes and stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecular units as crosslinkers leads to hybrid hydrogels undergoing reversible triggered transitions across different stiffness states. Different applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogels are discussed. The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogel films on surfaces and their applications are discussed. The coating of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles with stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels for controlled drug release is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reversible Luminescent Switching in an Organic Cocrystal: Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Phase Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformation of organic cocrystals under multiple external stimuli, such as solvent vapor and heating, accompanied by reversible luminescent switching, is demonstrated by B. Xu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002220). The results indicate that the luminescence switching originates from the unique molecular rearrangement of a hydrogen/halogen bond&#8208;directed stack to a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;directed stack in response to an external stimulus.
