         <title>Multi&#8208;component Copolymerized Donors&#160;enable Frozen Nano&#8208;morphology and Superior Ductility for Efficient&#160;Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;component copolymerized donors (MCDs)&#160;have gained significant interest and have been rapidly developed in flexible organic solar cells (f&#8208;OSCs) in recent years. However, ensuring the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;OSCs while retaining ideal mechanical properties remains an enormous challenge. The fracture strain (FS) value of typical high&#8208;efficiency blend films is generally less than 8%, which is far from the application standards of wearable photovoltaic devices. Therefore, we developed a series of novel MCDs after meticulous molecular design. Among them, the consistent MCD backbone and end&#8208;capped functional group formed a highly conjugated molecular plane, and the solubilization and mechanical properties were effectively optimized by modifying the proportion of solubilized alkyl chains. Consequently, due to the formation of entangled structures with a frozen blend film morphology considerably improved the high ductility of the active layer, P10.8/P20.2&#8208;TCl exhibited efficient PCE in rigid (18.53%) and flexible (17.03%) OSCs, along with excellent FS values (16.59%) in pristine films, meanwhile, the outstanding FS values of 25.18% and 12.3% were achieved by P10.6/P20.4&#8208;TCl &#8208;based pristine and blend films, respectively, which were one of the highest records achieved by end&#8208;capped MCD&#8208;based binary OSCs, demonstrating promising application to synchronize the realization of high&#8208;efficiency and mechanically ductile flexible OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rare Earth Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;S Full Battery with Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries have many advantages but still face problems such as retarded polysulfides redox kinetics and Li dendrite growth. Most reported single atom catalysts (SACs) for Li&#8722;S batteries are based on d&#8208;band transition metals whose d orbital constitutes active valence band, which is inclined to occur catalyst passivation. SACs based on 4f inner valence orbital of rare earth metals are challenging for their great difficulty to be activated. In this work, we design and synthesize the first rare earth metal Sm SACs which has electron&#8208;rich 4f inner orbital to promote catalytic conversion of polysulfides and uniform deposition of Li. Sm SACs enhance the catalysis by the activated 4f orbital through an f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization. Using Sm&#8208;N3C3 modified separators, the half cells deliver a high capacity over 600 mAh g&#8722;1 and a retention rate of 84.3% after 2000 cycles. The fabricated S/CNTs|Sm&#8208;N3C3@PP|Sm&#8208;N3C3&#8208;Li full batteries can provide an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of a retention rate of 80.6% at 0.2 C after 100 cycles, one of the best full Li&#8722;S batteries. This work provides a new perspective for the development of rare earth metal single atom catalysis in electrochemical reactions of Li&#8722;S batteries and other electrochemical systems for next&#8208;generation energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Opening and Constructing Stable Lithium&#8208;ion Channels within Polymer Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries play an integral role in various aspects of daily life, yet there is a pressing need to enhance their safety and cycling stability. In this study, we have successfully developed a highly secure and flexible solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte (SPE) through the in&#8208;situ polymerization of allyl acetoacetate (AAA) monomers. This SPE constructed an efficient Li+ transport channel inside and effectively improved the solid&#8208;solid interface contact of solid&#8208;state batteries to reduce interfacial impedance. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent thermal stability, an ionic conductivity of 3.82&#215;10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1 at room temperature (RT), and a Li+ transport number (tLi+) of 0.66. &#160;The numerous oxygen vacancies on layered inorganic SiO2 created an excellent environment for TFSI&#8208; immobilization. Free Li+ migrated rapidly at the C=O equivalence site with the poly(allyl acetoacetate) (PAAA) matrix. Consequently, when cycled at 0.5 C and RT, it displayed an initial discharge specific capacity of 140.6 mAh g&#8208;1 with a discharge specific capacity retention rate of 70% even after 500 cycles. Similarly, when cycled at a higher rate of 5 C, it demonstrated an initial discharge specific capacity of 132.3 mAh g&#8208;1 while maintaining excellent cycling stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Radical and Cationic Single&#8208;Unit Monomer Insertions for Engineering Polymer Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The single&#8208;unit monomer insertion (SUMI), derived from living/controlled polymerization, can be directly functionalized at the end or within the chain of polymers prepared by living/controlled polymerization, offering potential applications in the preparation of polymers with complex architectures. Many scenarios demand the simultaneous incorporation of monomers suitable for different polymerization methods into complex polymers. Therefore, it becomes imperative to utilize SUMI technologies with diverse mechanisms, especially those that are compatible with each other. Here, we reported the orthogonal SUMI technique, seamlessly combining radical and cationic SUMI approaches. Through the careful optimization of monomer and chain transfer agent pairs and adjustments to reaction conditions, we can efficiently execute both radical and cationic SUMI processes in one pot without mutual interference. The utilization of orthogonal SUMI pairs facilitates the integration of radical and cationic reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various configurations. This flexibility enables the synthesis of diblock, triblock, and star polymers that incorporate both cationically and radically polymerizable monomers. Moreover, we have successfully implemented a mixing mechanism of free radicals and cations in RAFT step&#8208;growth polymerization, resulting in the creation of a side&#8208;chain sequence&#8208;controlled polymer brushes.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Synthesis of Hollow Fiber SSZ&#8208;13 Zeolite Membranes for High&#8208;Pressure CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;silica CHA zeolite membranes are highly desired for natural gas upgrading because of their separation performance in combination with superior mechanical and chemical stability. However, the narrow synthesis conditions range significantly constrains scale&#8208;up preparation. Herein, we proposed a facile interzeolite conversion approach using FAU zeolite to prepare SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite seeds, featuring a shorter induction and a longer crystallization period of the membrane synthesis. The membrane thickness was constant at ~3 &#956;m over a wide span of synthesis time (24 ~ 96 h), while the selectivity (separation efficiency) was easily improved by extending synthesis time without compromising permeance (throughput). At 0.2&#160;MPa feed pressure and 303 K, the membranes showed an average CO2 permeance of (5.2 &#177; 0.5) &#215; 10&#8208;7 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1&#183;Pa&#8208;1 (1530&#160;GPU), with an average CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity of 143 &#177; 7. Minimal defects ensure a high selectivity of 126 with a CO2 permeation flux of 0.4 mol&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;s&#8208;1 at 6.1&#160;MPa feed pressure, far surpassing requirements for industrial applications. The feasibility for successful scale&#8208;up of our approach was further demonstrated by the batch synthesis of 40 cm&#8208;long hollow fiber SSZ&#8208;13 zeolite membranes exhibiting CO2/CH4 mixture selectivity up to 400 (0.2 MPa feed pressure and 303 K) without using sweep gas.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In this paper,&#160;we report a high&#8208;performance carbon nitride supported Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring defected low&#8208;coordination Cu&#8208;N2 motif (Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V). Lead many recently reported photocatalysts and its Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4 counterparts, Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to ethanol, delivering 69.8 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 ethanol production rate, 97.8% electron&#8208;based ethanol selectivity, and a yield of ~10 times higher than Cu&#8208;N3 and Cu&#8208;N4. Revealed by the extensive experimental investigation combined with the DFT calculation, the superior photoactivity of Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V stems from its unique defected Cu&#8208;N2 configuration. Firstly, Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V exist in Cu+/Cu2+ dual valence states, although predominantly in Cu+. The Cu+ sites support CO2 activation and the Cu+/Cu2+ sites are conducive for strong *CO adsorption and subsequent *CO&#8208;*CO dimerization enabling C&#8208;C coupling. Secondly, the Cu sites in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V are rich in electrons and thus highly active. Together they dictate the rate&#8208;determining step on CO2 photoreduction to ethanol and lower the Gibbs free energy change. Furthermore, the defected configuration also promotes light adsorption and charge separation efficiency. Collectively, these make Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V an effective and high&#8208;performance catalyst for solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion to ethanol. This study also reveals the valence state change of Cu in Cu&#8208;N2&#8208;V during the CO2 photoreduction reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric 1,n&#8208;Remote Aminoacetoxylation of Unactivated Internal Alkenes Enabled by Palladium Catalysis**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A palladium &#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,n&#8208;remote aminoacetoxylation of cis&#8208;alkenes has been developed using PhI(OAc)2 as oxidant, providing the acetoxylated lactams with excellent enantioselectivities under mild reaction conditions. The sterically hindered pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) L3 with a tert&#8208;butyl group in oxazoline ring and propyl group in C6 position of pyridinyl is vital for the reaction, where the former is good for asymmetric aminopalladation step and the latter for the chain walking process. The enantioenriched lactam products were proven to be good building blocks for the synthesis of azabicycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Thiophenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unexpectedly facile dearomative intramolecular (4+3) cycloadditions of thiophenes with epoxy enolsilanes, providing sulfur&#8208;bridged cycloadducts, are reported. A total of fifteen thiophene substrates have been found to undergo (4+3) cycloaddition smoothly to produce endo and exo (4+3) adducts in yields of up to 83% with moderate to good diastereoselectivity. Complete conservation of enantiomeric purity was observed when the optically enriched epoxide was used. The desulfurizing transformations of the sulfur&#8208;bridged skeleton of the cycloadducts provide functionalized 6,7&#8208;fused bicyclic frameworks consisting of 1,3&#8208;cycloheptadiene subunits. Density functional theory calculations reveal the origins of the facile dearomatization of thiophenes in these (4+3) cycloadditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Curiosity&#8208;driven innovations on the design and synthesis of nonplanar polycyclic aromatic/heteroaromatic compounds with new molecular topologies unfold exciting opportunities for harnessing their intriguing supramolecular properties and thereby the development of novel functional organic materials. This work presents such an innovative synthetic concept of a bottom&#8208;up molecular topology engineering through a unique orchestrated octuple C&#8211;H activation reaction, toward the rapid synthesis of a novel class of double heptagon&#8208;incorporated nitrogen&#8208;doped laterally&#8208;fused polycyclic compounds with rarely reported wavy structural configuration. The profound impact of the molecular wavy structures of these compounds on their properties is manifested by weak and tunable solid&#8208;state intermolecular interactions controlling the electronic properties of the materials, leading to reversibly switchable fluorochromism in the solid state and thin films with mechanical force and solvent vapors as external stimuli, thereby indicating their potential applicability in rewritable fluorescent optical recording media, security papers, mechanosensors, volatile organic compound (VOC) sensors etc.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hydroxylamine&#8208;Mediated Amidination of Lysine Residues That Retains the Protein's Positive Charge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine&#8208;specific peptide and protein modification strategies are widely used to study charge&#8208;related functions and applications. However, these strategies often result in the loss of the positive charge on lysine, significantly impacting the charge&#8208;related properties of proteins. Herein, we report a strategy to preserve the positive charge and selectively convert amines in lysine side chains to amidines using nitriles and hydroxylamine under aqueous conditions. Various unprotected peptides and proteins were successfully modified with a high conversion rate. Moreover, the reactive amidine moiety and derived modification site enable subsequent secondary modifications. Notably, positive charges were retained during the modification. Therefore, positive charge&#8208;related protein properties, such as liquid&#8210;liquid phase separation behaviour of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, were not affected. This strategy was subsequently applied to a lysine rich protein to develop an amidine&#8208;containing coacervate DNA complex with outstanding mechanical properties. Overall, our innovative strategy provides a new avenue to explore the characteristics of positively charged proteins.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent flippers have been introduced as small&#8208;molecule probes to image membrane tension in living systems.&#160; This study describes the design, synthesis, spectroscopic and imaging properties of flippers that are elongated by one and two alkynes inserted between the push and the pull dithienothiophene domains.&#160; The resulting mechanophores combine characteristics of flippers, reporting on physical compression in the ground state, and molecular rotors, reporting on torsional motion in the excited state, to take their photophysics to new level of sophistication. &#160;Intensity ratios in broadened excitation bands from differently twisted conformers of core&#8208;alkynylated flippers thus report on mechanical compression.&#160; Lifetime boosts from ultrafast excited&#8208;state planarization and lifetime drops from competitive intersystem crossing into triplet states report on viscosity.&#160; In standard lipid bilayer membranes, core&#8208;alkynylated flippers are too long for one leaflet and tilt or extend into disordered interleaflet space, which preserves rotor&#8208;like torsional disorder and thus weak, blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence.&#160; Flipper&#8208;like planarization occurs only in highly ordered membranes of matching leaflet thickness, where they light up and selectively report on these thick membranes with red&#8208;shifted, sharpened excitation maxima, high intensity and long lifetime.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Chemical Reactivity of Y&#8208;Stabilized ZrO2 Surfaces: Importance for the Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface structure and chemical properties of Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia (YSZ) have been subjects of intense debate over the past three decades. However, a thorough understanding of chemical processes occurring at YSZ powders faces significant challenges due to the absence of reliable reference data acquired for well&#8208;controlled model systems. Here, we present results from polarization&#8208;resolved infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) obtained for differently oriented, Y&#8208;doped&#160; ZrO2 single&#8208;crystal surfaces after exposure to CO and D2O. The IRRAS data reveal that the polar YSZ(100) surface undergoes reconstruction, characterized by an unusual, red&#8208;shifted CO band at 2132 cm&#8208;1. Density functional theory calculations allowed to relate this unexpected observation to under&#8208;coordinated Zr4+ cations in the vicinity of doping&#8208;induced O vacancies. This reconstruction leads to a strongly increased chemical reactivity and water spontaneously dissociates on YSZ(100). The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where &#160;only associative adsorption was observed.&#160; Together with a novel analysis scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ&#8208;based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.</dc:description>

The latter, which is an important requirement for catalysing the water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction, is absent for YSZ(111), where &#160;only associative adsorption was observed.&#160; Together with a novel analysis scheme these reference data allowed for an operando characterisation of YSZ powders using DRIFTS (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy). These findings facilitate rational design and tuning of YSZ-based powder materials for catalytic applications, in particular CO oxidation and the WGS reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cobaltaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activation for Central and Axial Double Enantio&#8208;Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, enantioselective electrocatalysis has surfaced as an increasingly&#8208;effective platform for sustainable molecular synthesis. Despite indisputable progress, strategies that allow the control of two distinct stereogenic elements with high selectivity remain elusive. In contrast, we, herein, describe electrochemical cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activations that enable the installation of chiral stereogenic centers along with a chiral axis with high levels of enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. The developed electrocatalysis strategy allowed for C&#8211;H/N&#8211;H activations/annulations with cyclic and non&#8208;cyclic alkenes providing expedient access to various central as well as atropo&#8208;chiral dihydroisoquinolinones paired to the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction. Studies on the atropo&#8208;stability of the obtained compounds demonstrated that the exceedingly mild conditions ensured by the electrocatalytic process were key for the achieved high stereoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Pure Covalent Tubes Exhibiting Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we successfully synthesized four structurally analogous, self&#8208;assembled chiral molecular tubes with relatively high yields. This achievement involved the condensation of six equivalents of enantiomerically pure trans&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine (trans&#8208;CHDA) and three equivalents of the corresponding tetraformyl precursor. Each precursor was equipped with a luminescent linker terminated by two m&#8208;phthalaldehyde units. Even though these tetraformyl precursors are barely soluble in almost all organic solvents, the molecular tubes are highly soluble in nonpolar solvents such as chloroform, allowing us to fully characterize them in solution. The stereo&#8208;chirality of the chiral bisamino building blocks endows the frameworks of molecular tubes with planar chirality. As a consequence, all of these molecular tubes exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with relatively large dissymmetry values |glum| up to 7 &#215; 10&#8722;3, providing an efficient method for synthesizing CPL&#8208;active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Unimolecular Chemiexcited Oxygenation of Pathogenic Amyloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pathogenic protein aggregates, called amyloids, are etiologically relevant to various diseases, including neurodegenerative Alzheimer disease. Catalytic photooxygenation of amyloids, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;), reduces their toxicity; however, the requirement for light irradiation may limit its utility in large animals, including humans, due to the low tissue permeability of light. Here, we report that Cypridina luciferin analogs, dmCLA&#8208;Cl and dmCLA&#8208;Br, promoted selective oxygenation of amyloids through chemiexcitation without external light irradiation. Further structural optimization of dmCLA&#8208;Cl led to the identification of a derivative with a polar carboxylate functional group and low cellular toxicity: dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid. dmCLA&#8208;Cl&#8208;acid promoted oxygenation of A&#946; amyloid and reduced its cellular toxicity without photoirradiation. The chemiexcited oxygenation developed in this study may be an effective approach to neutralizing the toxicity of amyloids, which can accumulate deep inside the body, and treating amyloidosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of 1&#8208;Octene with [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene as non&#8208;activated model substrate with neutral water as H&#8208;donor is reported, using [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)(Cl)] (1) as the catalyst, to form octane with high faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96% and a kobs of 87 s&#8211;1. Cyclic voltammetry with 1 revealed that two subsequent reductions trigger the elimination of Cl&#8211; and afford the highly reactive anionic Ir(I) hydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)]&#8211; (2), a previously merely proposed intermediate for which we now report first experimental data by mass spectrometry. In absence of alkene, the stoichiometric electrolysis of 1 in THF with water selectively affords the Ir(III) dihydride complex [(tBuPCP)Ir(H)2] (3) in 88% FE from the reaction of 2 with H2O. Complex 3 then hydrogenates the alkene in classical fashion. The presented electro&#8208;hydrogenation works with extremely high FE, because the iridium hydrides are water stable, which prevents H2 formation. Even in strongly alkaline conditions (Bu4NOH added), the electro&#8208;hydrogenation of 1&#8208;octene with 1 also proceeds cleanly (89% FE), suggesting a highly robust process that may rely on H2O activation, reminiscent to transfer hydrogenation pathways, instead of classical H+ reduction. DFT calculations confirmed oxidative addition of H2O as a key step in this context.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds&#160;Regulate Zinc Plating/Stripping Behaviors for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial interfaces provide a comprehensive approach to controlling zinc dendrite and surface corrosion in zinc&#8208;based aqueous batteries (ZABs). However, due to consistent volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, traditional interfacial layers cannot consistently adapt to the dendrite surface, resulting in uncontrolled dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution. Herein, dynamic covalent bonds exhibit the Janus effect towards zinc deposition at different current densities, presenting a holistic strategy for stabilizing zinc anode. The PBSC intelligent artificial interface consisting of dynamic B&#8208;O covalent bonds is developed on zinc anode to mitigate hydrogen evolution and restrict dendrite expansion. Owing to the reversible dynamic bonds, PBSC exhibits shape self&#8208;adaptive characteristics at low current rates, which rearranges the network to accommodate volume changes during zinc plating/stripping, resisting hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the rapid association of B&#8208;O dynamic bonds enhances mechanical strength at dendrite tips, presenting a shear&#8208;thickening effect and suppressing further dendrite growth at high current rates. Therefore, the assembled symmetrical battery with PBSC maintains a stable cycle of 4500 hours without significant performance degradation and the PBSC@Zn||V2O5 pouch cell demonstrates a specific capacity exceeding 170 mAh g&#8208;1. Overall, the intelligent interface with dynamic covalent bonds provides innovative approaches for zinc anode interfacial engineering and enhances cycling performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;State Control over Supramolecular Chirality through Dynamic Chemistry Mediated Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic chemistry utilizing both covalent and noncovalent bonds provides valid protocols in manipulating properties of self&#8208;assemblies and functions. Here we employ dynamic chemistry to realize multiple&#8208;route control over supramolecular chirality up to five states. N&#8208;protected fluorinated phenylalanine in the carboxylate state self&#8208;assembled into achiral nanoparticles ascribed to the amphiphilicity. Protonation promoted one&#8208;dimensional growth into helices with shrunk hydrophilicity, which in the presence of disulfide pyridine undergo chirality inversion promoted by the hydrogen bonding&#8208;directed coassembly. Further interacting with the water&#8208;soluble reductant cleavages the disulfide bond to initiate the rearrangement of coassemblies with a chirality inversion as well. Finally, by tuning the pH environments, aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction between reduced products and perfluorinated phenylalanine occurs, giving distinct chiral nanoarchitectures with emerged luminescence and circularly polarized luminescence. We thus realized a particular five&#8208;state control by combining dynamic chemistry at one chiral compound, which greatly enriches the toolbox in fabricating responsive chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclooctatetraene&#8208;Embedded Carbon Nanorings</title>

Molecular Nanorings Featuring Hoop&#8208;Shaped Segments of Carbon Schwarzites. We describe three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings (COTCNRs) which can be recognized as hoop&#8208;shaped segments of distinctive carbon schwarzites. COTCNR3 complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70) and forms one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular wires with ambient electrical conductivities of up to (7.11&#177;0.14)&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
With the prosperity of the development of carbon nanorings, certain topologically or functionally unique units&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings have sprung up in the past decade. Herein, we report the facile and efficient synthesis of three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings (COTCNRs) that contain three (COTCNR1 and COTCNR2) and four (COTCNR3) COT units in a one&#8208;pot Yamamoto coupling. These nanorings feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of Gyroid (G&#8208;), Diamond (D&#8208;), and Primitive (P&#8208;) type carbon schwarzites. The conformations of the trimeric nanorings COTCNR1 and COTCNR2 are shape&#8208;persistent, whereas the tetrameric COTCNR3 possesses a flexible carbon skeleton which undergoes conformational changes upon forming host&#8211;guest complexes with fullerenes (C60 and C70), whose co&#8208;crystals may potentially serve as fullerene&#8208;based semiconducting supramolecular wires with electrical conductivities on the order of 10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (for C60&#8834;COTCNR3) and 10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (for C70&#8834;COTCNR3) under ambient conditions. This research not only describes highly efficient one&#8208;step syntheses of three cyclooctatetraene&#8208;embedded carbon nanorings which feature hoop&#8208;shaped segments of distinctive topological carbon schwarzites, but also demonstrates the potential application in electronics of the one&#8208;dimensional fullerene arrays secured by COTCNR3.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Cephalotaxus Diterpenoids and Their Structural Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unified synthetic approach inspired by biosynthesis is presented for producing three subgroups of cephalotaxus diterpenoids. By selectively introducing carbon atoms and expanding rings, cephalotane&#8208;type C18 dinorditerpenoids can be transformed into troponoid&#8208;type C19 norditerpenoids and intact cephalotane&#8208;type C20 diterpenoids. Several natural products, including fortalpinoid C and cephanolide E, were successfully synthesized.







Abstract
Herein, we present a unified chemical synthesis of three subgroups of cephalotaxus diterpenoids. Key to the success lies in adopting a synthetic strategy that is inspired by biosynthesis but is opposite in nature. By employing selective one&#8208;carbon introduction and ring expansion operations, we have successfully converted cephalotane&#8208;type C18 dinorditerpenoids (using cephanolide B as a starting material) into troponoid&#8208;type C19 norditerpenoids and intact cephalotane&#8208;type C20 diterpenoids. This synthetic approach has enabled us to synthesize cephinoid H, 13&#8208;oxo&#8208;cephinoid H, 7&#8208;oxo&#8208;cephinoid H, fortalpinoid C, 7&#8208;epi&#8208;fortalpinoid C, cephanolide E, and 13&#8208;epi&#8208;cephanolide E. Furthermore, through the development of an intermolecular asymmetric Michael reaction between &#946;&#8208;oxo esters and &#946;&#8208;substituted enones, we have achieved the enantioselective synthesis of advanced intermediates within our synthetic sequence, thus formally realizing the asymmetric total synthesis of the cephalotaxus diterpenoids family.

         <title>Ultrathin Free&#8208;Standing Porous Aromatic Framework Membranes for Efficient Anion Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin free&#8208;standing porous aromatic framework (PAF) membranes were prepared by liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization, and applied in the anion conduction for the first time, with excellent performance in hydroxide conductivity and stability due to the rational presence of transporting sites and rigid structure of PAF.







Abstract
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) show promising potential in anionic conduction due to their high stability and customizable functionality. However, the insolubility of most PAFs presents a significant challenge in their processing into membranes and subsequent applications. In this study, continuous PAF membranes with adjustable thickness were successfully created using liquid&#8208;solid interfacial polymerization. The rigid backbone and the stable C&#8722;C coupling endow PAF membrane with superior chemical and dimensional stabilities over most conventional polymer membranes. Different quaternary ammonium functionalities were anchored to the backbone through flexible alkyl chains with tunable length. The optimal PAF membrane exhibited an OH&#8722; conductivity of 356.6&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. Additionally, the PAF membrane exhibited outstanding alkaline stability, retaining 95&#8201;% of its OH&#8722; conductivity after 1000&#8197;hours in 1&#8197;M NaOH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of PAF materials in anion exchange membranes, achieving the highest OH&#8722; conductivity and exceptional chemical/dimensional stability. This work provides the possibility for the potential of PAF materials in anionic conductive membranes.

         <title>A Minimalistic Covalent Bond&#8208;Forming Chemical Reaction Cycle that Consumes Adenosine Diphosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials that consume chemical energy are fundamental to the development of synthetic active matter, yet the complexity of their reaction cycles hinders understanding how energy is used. The creation of a fully characterised minimalistic metabolic cycle based on the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) driven assembly of building blocks has allowed insight to be gained into the way energy is dissipated by the network and uncover general design principles for driven systems.







Abstract
The development of synthetic active matter requires the ability to design materials capable of harnessing energy from a source to carry out work. Nature achieves this using chemical reaction cycles in which energy released from an exergonic chemical reaction is used to drive biochemical processes. Although many chemically fuelled synthetic reaction cycles that control transient responses, such as self&#8208;assembly, have been reported, the generally high complexity of the reported systems hampers a full understanding of how the available chemical energy is actually exploited by these systems. This lack of understanding is a limiting factor in the design of chemically fuelled active matter. Here, we report a minimalistic synthetic responsive reaction cycle in which adenosine diphosphate (ADP) triggers the formation of a catalyst for its own hydrolysis. This establishes an interdependence between the concentrations of the network components resulting in the transient formation of the catalyst. The network is sufficiently simple that all kinetic and thermodynamic parameters governing its behaviour can be characterised, allowing kinetic models to be built that simulate the progress of reactions within the network. While the current network does not enable the ADP&#8208;hydrolysis reaction to populate a non&#8208;equilibrium composition, these models provide insight into the way the network dissipates energy. Furthermore, essential design principles are revealed for constructing driven systems, in which the network composition is driven away from equilibrium through the consumption of chemical energy.

Exploring New Paths for Solar Energy Storage: A Win&#8208;Win Approach for rGO/CdS to Improve the Energy Conversion Efficiency and Stability of Integrated Photorechargeable Li&#8722;S Batteries.







Abstract
Integrating solar energy into rechargeable battery systems represents a significant advancement towards sustainable energy storage solutions. Herein, we propose a win&#8208;win solution to reduce the shuttle effect of polysulfide and improve the photocorrosion stability of CdS, thereby enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of rGO/CdS&#8208;based photorechargeable integrated lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PRLSBs). Experimental results show that CdS can effectively anchor polysulfide under sunlight irradiation for 20&#8197;minutes. Under a high current density (1&#8197;C), the discharge&#8208;specific capacity of the PRLSBs increased to 971.30&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is 113.3&#8201;% enhancement compared to that of under dark condition (857.49&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Remarkably, without an electrical power supply, the PRLSBs can maintain a 21&#8197;hours discharge process following merely 1.5&#8197;hours of light irradiation, achieving a breakthrough solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion efficiency of up to 5.04&#8201;%. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman analysis corroborate the effectiveness of this complementary weakness approach in bolstering redox kinetics and curtailing polysulfide dissolution in PRLSBs. This work showcases a feasible strategy to develop PRLSBs with potential dual&#8208;functional metal sulfide photoelectrodes, which will be of great interest in future&#8208;oriented off&#8208;grid photocell systems.

         <title>Cyclopropenes as Chemical Reporters for Dual Bioorthogonal and Orthogonal Metabolic Labeling of DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual biorthogonal and orthogonal metabolic labeling of genomic DNA in HeLa cells was demonstrated by combining the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl&#8208;tetrazine dye conjugate and the photoclick reaction with a pyrene&#8208;tetrazole using isomeric cyclopropenes as chemical reporters.







Abstract
Dual bioorthogonal labeling enables the investigation and understanding of interactions in the biological environment that are not accessible by a single label. However, applying two bioorthogonal reactions in the same environment remains challenging due to cross&#8208;reactivity. We developed a pair of differently modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides that solved this issue for dual and orthogonal labeling of DNA. Inverse&#8208;electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder and photoclick reactions were combined to attach two different fluorogenic labels to genomic DNA in cells. Using a small synthetic library of 1&#8208; and 3&#8208;methylcyclopropenyl&#8208;modified 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxynucleosides, two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines were identified to be the fastest&#8208;reacting ones for each of the two bioorthogonal reactions. Their orthogonal reactivity could be evidenced in vitro. Primer extension experiments were performed with both 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines investigating their replication properties as substitutes for thymidine and evaluating subsequent labeling reactions on the DNA level. Finally, dual, orthogonal and metabolic fluorescent labeling of genomic DNA was demonstrated in HeLa cells. An experimental procedure was developed combining intracellular transport and metabolic DNA incorporation of the two 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridines with the subsequent dual bioorthogonal labeling using a fluorogenic cyanine&#8208;styryl tetrazine and a fluorogenic pyrene&#8208;tetrazole. These results are fundamental for advanced metabolic labeling strategies for nucleic acids in the future, especially for live cell experiments.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Crystallinity and Suppressing Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Completely Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) can enhance dipole moment and induce more positive surface electrostatic potential, contributing to the compact and diverse molecular stacking, thus promoting exciton delocalization for efficient charge generation. Besides, AHS suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination loss and enabling PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 to yield the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V.







Abstract
High open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received increasing attention because of their promising application in tandem devices and indoor photovoltaics. However, the lack of a precise correlation between molecular structure and stacking behaviors of wide band gap electron acceptors has greatly limited its development. Here, we adopted an asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) and synthesized two completely non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), HF&#8208;BTA33 and HCl&#8208;BTA33. The results show that AHS significantly enhances the molecular dipoles and suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in enhanced intramolecular/intermolecular interactions and decreased nonradiative decay. As a result, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HF&#8208;BTA33 realizes a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.232&#8197;V, higher than that of symmetric analogue F&#8208;BTA33 (PCE=10.02&#8201;%, Voc=1.197&#8197;V). Notably, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 achieves the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V due to the long&#8208;range ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing and enhanced surface electrostatic interactions thereby facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work not only proves that asymmetric halogenation of completely NFREAs is a simple and effective strategy for achieving both high PCE and Voc, but also provides deeper insights for the precise molecular design of low cost completely NFREAs.

         <title>Secondary Amine Catalysis in Enzyme Design: Broadening Protein Template Diversity through Genetic Code Expansion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of protein templates in artificial enzyme design is illustrated through genetic code expansion. Incorporation of a secondary amine into the nucleotide&#8208;binding DHFR and multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR resulted in catalytic entities, with the former favoring the use of NADPH as the hydride source for reactions, whereas the latter required biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH).







Abstract
Secondary amines, due to their reactivity, can transform protein templates into catalytically active entities, accelerating the development of artificial enzymes. However, existing methods, predominantly reliant on modified ligands or N&#8208;terminal prolines, impose significant limitations on template selection. In this study, genetic code expansion was used to break this boundary, enabling secondary amines to be incorporated into alternative proteins and positions of choice. Pyrrolysine analogues carrying different secondary amines could be incorporated into superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), multidrug&#8208;binding LmrR and nucleotide&#8208;binding dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Notably, the analogue containing a D&#8208;proline moiety demonstrated both proteolytic stability and catalytic activity, conferring LmrR and DHFR with the desired transfer hydrogenation activity. While the LmrR variants were confined to the biomimetic 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as the hydride source, the optimal DHFR variant favorably used the pro&#8208;R hydride from NADPH for stereoselective reactions (e.r. up to 92&#8201;:&#8201;8), highlighting that a switch of protein template could broaden the nucleophile option for catalysis. Owing to the cofactor compatibility, the DHFR&#8208;based secondary amine catalysis could be integrated into an enzymatic recycling scheme. This established method shows substantial potential in enzyme design, applicable from studies on enzyme evolution to the development of new biocatalysts.

         <title>Dimerized Acceptors with Conjugate&#8208;Break Linker Enable Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling connecting sites and halogen substitutions, four dimerized acceptors were designed and synthesized. Thanks to the modification of molecular structure, a champion efficiency of 18.07&#8201;% was achieved in FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid devices. Importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based intrinsically stretchable devices achieved high performance (power conversion efficiency=14.29&#8201;%) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain=18.23&#8201;%).







Abstract
Designing new acceptors is critical for intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) with high efficiency and mechanical robustness. However, nearly all stretchable polymer acceptors exhibit limited efficiency and high&#8208;performance small molecular acceptors are very brittle. In this regard, we select thienylene&#8208;alkane&#8208;thienylene (TAT) as the conjugate&#8208;break linker and synthesize four dimerized acceptors by the regulation of connecting sites and halogen substitutions. It is found that the connecting sites and halogen substitutions considerably impact the overall electronic structures, aggregation behaviors, and charge transport properties. Benefiting from the optimization of the molecular structure, the dimerized acceptor exhibits rational phase separation within the blend films, which significantly facilitates exciton dissociation while effectively suppressing charge recombination processes. Consequently, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid OSCs render the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.07&#8201;% among reported acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linker. Most importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based IS&#8208;OSCs achieve high PCE (14.29&#8201;%) and remarkable stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS]=18.23&#8201;%), significantly surpassing Y6&#8208;based counterpart (PCE=12.80&#8201;% and COS=8.50&#8201;%). To sum up, these findings demonstrate that dimerized acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linkers have immense potential in developing highly efficient and mechanically robust OSCs.

         <title>Bioinspired Synthesis of Allysine for Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic approach was developed for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of the side chain of dimethyl lysine. The reaction exhibits broad substrate scope and modifies dimethyl lysine and tertiary amines to form aldehydes in small molecules, peptides, proteins and cells.







Abstract
Inspired by the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which selectively converts the side chain of lysine into allysine, an aldehyde&#8208;containing post&#8208;translational modification, we report herein the first chemical method for the synthesis of allysine by selective oxidation of dimethyl lysine. This approach is highly chemoselective for dimethyl lysine on proteins. We highlight the utility of this biomimetic approach for generating aldehydes in a variety of pharmaceutically active linear and cyclic peptides at a late stage for their diversification with various affinity and fluorescent tags. Notably, we utilized this approach for generating small&#8208;molecule aldehydes from the corresponding tertiary amines. We further demonstrated the potential of this approach in generating cellular models for studying allysine&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Responsive Anionophores with AND Logic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular platform for accessing stimuli&#8208;responsive anionophores, triggered by multiple stimuli of biological relevance including light, redox, and an esterase, is reported, and accessed via post&#8208;synthetic modification of a dynamic hydrogen bonding anionophore. By utilizing two different cages, a responsive anionophore with AND logic activation, requiring two different stimuli, was achieved.







Abstract
Artificial ion transport systems have emerged as an important class of compounds that promise applications in chemotherapeutics as anticancer agents or to treat channelopathies. Stimulus&#8208;responsive systems that offer spatiotemporally controlled activity for targeted applications remain rare. Here we utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of a 4,6&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;isophthalamide core to generate a modular platform enabling access to stimuli&#8208;responsive ion transporters that can be activated in response to a wide variety of external stimuli, including light, redox, and enzymes, with excellent OFF&#8208;ON activation profiles. Alkylation of the two free hydroxyl groups with stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties locks the amide bonds through intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hence makes them unavailable for anion binding and transport. Triggering using a particular stimulus to cleave both cages reverses the hydrogen bonding arrangement, to generate a highly preorganized anion binding cavity for efficient transmembrane transport. Integration of two cages that are responsive to orthogonal stimuli enables multi&#8208;stimuli activation, where both stimuli are required to trigger transport in an AND logic process. Importantly, the strategy provides a facile method to post&#8208;functionalize the highly active transporter core with a variety of stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties for targeted activation with multiple triggers.

         <title>6&#8208;Strand to Stable 10/12 Helix Conformational Switch by Incorporating Flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly in the Homooligomers of Camphor Derived &#946;&#8208;Amino Acid: NMR and X&#8208;Ray Crystallographic Evidence</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks (CDA) derived from naturally occuring camphor are introduced as new design tools to construct diverse secondary structures. Specifically, the conformational switching to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix, by simply inserting flexible achiral &#946;&#8208;hGly spacers in a 6&#8208;strand stabilizing CDA&#8208;homooligomers, exemplifies the potential of the CDAs in backbone regulation and in developing functional foldamers.







Abstract
Rational design of unnatural amino acid building blocks capable of stabilizing predictable secondary structures similar to protein fragments is pivotal for foldamer chemistry/catalysis. Here, we introduce novel &#946;&#8208;amino acid building blocks: [1S,2R,4R]exoCDA and [1S,2S,4R]endoCDA, derived from the abundantly available R(+)&#8208;camphor, which is traditionally known for its medicinal value. Further, we demonstrate that the homooligomers of exoCDA adopt 6&#8208;strand conformation, which switches to a robust 10/12&#8208;helix simply by inserting flexible &#946;&#8208;hGly spacer at alternate positions (1&#8201;:&#8201;1 &#946;&#8208;hGly/exoCDA heterooligomers), as evident by DFT&#8208;calculations, solution&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of crystalline&#8208;state structure of left&#8208;handed 10/12&#8208;mixed helix, that is free from the conventional approach of employing &#946;&#8208;amino acids of either alternate chirality or alternate &#946;2/&#946;3 substitutions, to access the 10/12&#8208;helix. The results also show that the homooligomers of heterochiral exoCDA don&#8242;t adopt helical fold, instead exhibit banana&#8208;shaped strands, whereas the homodimers of the other diastereomer endoCDA, nucleate 8&#8208;membered turns. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;exoCDA and hetero&#8208;[&#946;&#8208;hGly&#8208;exoCDA] oligomers are found to exhibit self&#8208;association properties with distinct morphological features. Overall, the results offer new possibilties of constructing discrete stable secondary and tertiary structures based on CDAs, which can accommodate flexible residues with desired side&#8208;chain substitutions.

The charge of a compound strongly influences the affinity towards anionic donors. Accordingly, comparing vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) for Lewis acids of varying charge states is of limited use. Here, the systematic evaluation of the FIA of &gt;700 literature&#8208;known cationic Lewis acids suggests how to tackle this charge problem and explores the influence of counteranions.







Abstract
The quantification of Lewis acidity is of fundamental and applied importance in chemistry. However, if neutral and charged Lewis acids are compared, a coherent ranking has been elusive, and severe uncertainties were accepted. With this study, we present a systematic computational analysis of Lewis base affinities of 784 mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and tricationic Lewis acids and their comparison with 149 representative neutral Lewis acids. Evaluating vacuum fluoride ion affinities (FIA) reveals a charge&#8208;caused clustering that prohibits any meaningful ranking. Instead, solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv is identified as a metric that overcomes charge sensitivity in a balanced manner, allowing for a coherent evaluation of Lewis acidity across varying charge states. Analyzing the impact of molecular volume on solvation&#8208;induced FIA damping provides rationales for fundamental trends and guidelines for the choice or design of neutral and cationic Lewis acids in the condensed phase. Exploring alternative scales, explicit counteranion effects, and selected experimental case studies reaffirms the advantages of solvation&#8208;corrected FIAsolv as the most versatile and practical approach for the quantitative ranking of general (thermodynamic) Lewis acidity.

         <title>An Enzymatic Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage and Aldol Reaction Cascade Converts an Angular Scaffold into the Linear Tetracyclic Core of Ochraceopones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones originates from a common angular tetracycle through a cascade of enzymatic C&#8722;C bond cleavage and construction. The multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH facilitates the cleavage of a C&#8722;C bond in the angular tetracycle by an unprecedented free&#8208;radical&#8208;initiated process. The subsequent new aldolase OchL constructs a C&#8722;C bond through an aldol reaction to generate the linear tetracycle.







Abstract
Meroterpenoids of the ochraceopones family featuring a linear tetracyclic scaffold exhibit exceptional antiviral and anti&#8208;inflammatory activities. The biosynthetic pathway and chemical logic to generate this linear tetracycle, however, remain unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized all biosynthetic enzymes to afford ochraceopones and elucidated the complete biosynthetic pathway. We demonstrated that the linear tetracyclic scaffold of ochraceopones was derived from an angular tetracyclic precursor. A multifunctional cytochrome P450 OchH was validated to catalyze the free&#8208;radical&#8208;initiated carbon&#8208;carbon bond cleavage of the angular tetracycle. Then, a new carbon&#8208;carbon bond was verified to be constructed using a new aldolase OchL, which catalyzes an intramolecular aldol reaction to form the linear tetracycle. This carbon&#8208;carbon bond fragmentation and aldol reaction cascade features an unprecedented strategy for converting a common angular tetracycle to a distinctive linear tetracyclic scaffold in meroterpenoid biosynthesis.

         <title>Bending, Twisting, and Propulsion of Photoreactive Crystals by Controlled Gas Release</title>

Hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in liquid media and excited by light.







Abstract
The rapid release of gas by a chemical reaction to generate momentum is one of the most fundamental ways to elicit motion that could be used to sustain and control the motility of objects. We report that hollow crystals of a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular metal complex that releases gas by photolysis can propel themselves or other objects and advance in space when suspended in mother solution. In needle&#8208;like regular crystals, the reaction occurs mainly on the surface and results in the formation of cracks that evolve due to internal pressure; the expansion on the cracked surface of the crystal results in bending, twisting, or coiling of the crystal. In hollow crystals, gas accumulates inside their cavities and emanates preferentially from the recess at the crystal terminus, propelling the crystals to undergo directional photomechanical motion through the mother solution. The motility of the object which can be controlled externally to perform work delineates the concept of &#8220;crystal microbots&#8221;, realized by photoreactive organic crystals capable of prolonged directional motion for actuation or delivery. Within the prospects, we envisage the development of a plethora of light&#8208;weight, efficient, autonomously operating robots based on organic crystals with high work capacity where motion over large distances can be attained due to the large volume of latent gas generated from a small volume of the crystalline solid.

         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Gradient&#8208;Distributed Dielectric Properties toward Dendrite&#8208;free Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gradient&#8208;distributed&#8208;dielectric carbon host (GDD&#8208;CH) is synthesized by introducing a grading content of polyantimonic acid (PAA) under the facile method of electrospinning technology and followed by carbonization progress. The gradient dielectric properties trigger a polarized electric field; the dipole moment is formed and arranged at the interface due to the directional migration of electrons and ions. This effectively regulates the Li&#8208;ion flux diffusion pathway, thus equalizing the ion concentration gradient within the host. As a result, the GDD&#8208;CH host enables dendrite&#8208;free Li plating/stripping behaviors for more than 2000&#8197;h at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The conventional conductive three&#8208;dimensional (3D) host fails to effectively stabilize lithium metal anodes (LMAs) due to the internal incongruity arising from nonuniform lithium&#8208;ion gradient and uniform electric fields. This results in undesirable Li &#8220;top&#8208;growth&#8221; behavior and dendritic Li growth, significantly impeding the practical application of LMAs. Herein, we construct a 3D hierarchical host with gradient&#8208;distributed dielectric properties (GDD&#8208;CH) that effectively regulate Li&#8208;ion diffusion and deposition behavior. It comprises a 3D carbon fiber host modified by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer bottom&#8208;up attenuating Sb particles, which could promote Li&#8208;ion homogeneously distribution and reduce ion concentration gradient via unique gradient dielectric polarization. Sb transforms into superionic conductive Li3Sb alloy during cycling, facilitating Li&#8208;ion dredging and pumps towards the bottom, dominating a bottom&#8208;up deposition regime confirmed by COMSOL Multiphysics simulations and physicochemical characterizations. Consequently, a stable cycling performance of symmetrical cells over 2000&#8197;h under a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. The GDD&#8208;CH&#8208;based lithium metal battery shows remarkable cycling stability and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 378&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a low N/P ratio (1.51). This strategy of dielectric gradient design broadens the perspective for regulating the Li deposition mechanism and paves the way for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal anodes with long durability.

         <title>Atropisomeric Carboxylic Acids Synthesis via Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioconvergent Carboxylation of Aza&#8208;Biaryl Triflates with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2 has been realized via dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive carboxylation of racemic aza&#8208;biaryl triflates. Compared with previous routes to atropisomeric carboxylic acids, this work features good functional group tolerance, easy to scale&#8208;up, facile transformation and avoids cumbersome steps, handling organometallic reagents and using stoichiometric chiral materials, which expands the synthetic utility of CO2 chemistry.







Abstract
Upgrading CO2 to value&#8208;added chiral molecules via catalytic asymmetric C&#8722;C bond formation is a highly important yet challenging task. Although great progress on the formation of centrally chiral carboxylic acids has been achieved, catalytic construction of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2 has never been reported to date. Herein, we report the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO2, which is enabled by nickel&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive carboxylation of racemic aza&#8208;biaryl triflates. A variety of important axially chiral carboxylic acids, which are valuable but difficult to obtain via catalysis, are generated in an enantioconvergent version. This new methodology features good functional group tolerance, easy to scale&#8208;up, facile transformation and avoids cumbersome steps, handling organometallic reagents and using stoichiometric chiral materials. Mechanistic investigations indicate a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process induced by chiral nickel catalysis.

Herein, we report the first catalytic asymmetric synthesis of axially chiral carboxylic acids with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is enabled by nickel-catalyzed dynamic kinetic asymmetric reductive carboxylation of racemic aza-biaryl triflates. A variety of important axially chiral carboxylic acids, which are valuable but difficult to obtain via catalysis, are generated in an enantioconvergent version. This new methodology features good functional group tolerance, easy to scale-up, facile transformation and avoids cumbersome steps, handling organometallic reagents and using stoichiometric chiral materials. Mechanistic investigations indicate a dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation process induced by chiral nickel catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immobilization of Amino&#8208;site into a Pore&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Highly Efficient Separation of Propyne/Propylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2 with densely decorated amino sites and partitioned nanospaces is capable of efficiently producing polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 from C3H4&#8208;containing mixtures.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation of propyne/propylene (C3H4/C3H6) is a crucial yet complex process, however, it remains a great difficulty in developing porous materials that can meet the requirements for practical applications, particularly with an exceptional ability to bind and store trace amounts of C3H4. Functionalization of pore&#8208;partitioned metal&#8211;organic frameworks (ppMOFs) is methodically suited for this challenge owing to the possibility of dramatically increasing binding sites on highly porous and confined domains. We here immobilized Lewis&#8208;basic (&#8722;NH2) and Lewis&#8208;acidic (&#8722;NO2) sites on this platform. Along with an integrated nature of high uptake of C3H4 at 1&#8197;kPa, high uptake difference of C3H4&#8722;C3H6, moderated binding strength, promoted kinetic selectivity, trapping effect and high stability, the NH2&#8208;decorated ppMOF (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NH2) can efficiently produce polymer&#8208;grade C3H6 (99.95&#8201;%, 8.3&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) at room temperature, which is six times more than the NO2&#8208;decorated crystal (NTU&#8208;100&#8208;NO2). The in situ infrared spectroscopy, crystallographic analysis, and sequential blowing tests showed that the densely packed amino group in this highly porous system has a unique ability to recognize and stabilize C3H4 molecules. Moving forward, the strategy of organic functionalization can be extended to other porous systems, making it a powerful tool to customize advanced materials for challenging tasks.

         <title>Regulating Lateral Adsorbate Interaction for Efficient Electroreforming of Bio&#8208;polyols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation was proposed. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which effectively tuned the adsorption energies and tailored the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products.







Abstract
Tailoring the selectivity at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface is one of the greatest challenges for heterogeneous electrocatalysis, and complementary strategies to catalyst structural designs need to be developed. Herein, we proposed a new strategy of controlling the electrocatalytic pathways by lateral adsorbate interaction for the bio&#8208;polyol oxidation. Redox&#8208;innocent 1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (HFIP) anion possesses the alcoholic property that facilely adsorbs on the nickel oxyhydroxide catalyst, but is resistant to oxidation due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl groups. The alien HFIP adsorbents can compete with bio&#8208;polyols and form a mixed adsorbate layer that creates lateral adsorbate interaction via hydrogen bonding, which achieved a &gt;2&#8208;fold enhancement of the oxalate selectivity to 55&#8201;% for the representative glycerol oxidation and can be extended to various bio&#8208;polyol substrates. Through in situ spectroscopic analysis and DFT calculation on the glycerol oxidation, we reveal that the hydrogen&#8208;bonded adsorbate interaction can effectively tune the adsorption energies and tailor the oxidation capabilities toward the targeted products. This work offers an additional perspective of tuning electrocatalytic reactions via introducing redox&#8208;innocent adsorbates to create lateral adsorbate interactions.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Linkage Chemistry and Its Critical Role in The Evolution of &#960; Electronic Structures and Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of non&#8208;conjugated, partially &#960;&#8208;conjugated, and fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkages was explored to integrate typical &#960; units into 2D polymeric lattices, which led to the creation of 2D layer frameworks. The linkage plays a pivotal role in growing 2D electronic structures and determines electronic functions, unveiling a full picture of linkage chemistry and offering a general yet transformative guidance for designing electronic framework materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a molecular platform for designing a novel class of functional materials with well&#8208;defined structures. A crucial structural parameter is the linkage, which dictates how knot and linker units are connected to form two&#8208;dimensional polymers and layer frameworks, shaping ordered &#960;&#8208;array and porous architectures. However, the roles of linkage in the development of ordered &#960; electronic structures and functions remain fundamental yet unresolved issues. Here we report the designed synthesis of COFs featuring four representative linkages: hydrazone, imine, azine, and C=C bonds, to elucidate their impacts on the evolution of &#960; electronic structures and functions. Our observations revealed that the hydrazone linkage provides a non&#8208;conjugated connection, while imine and azine allow partial &#960; conjugation, and the C=C bond permits full &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Importantly, the linkage profoundly influences the control of &#960; electronic structures and functions, unraveling its pivotal role in determining key electronic properties such as band gap, frontier energy levels, light absorption, luminescence, carrier density and mobility, and magnetic permeability. These findings highlight the significance of linkage chemistry in COFs and offer a general and transformative guidance for designing framework materials to achieve electronic functions.

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economical and efficient electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrogenation is described. The reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. Notably, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides can be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation of alkene and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection.







Abstract
Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well&#8208;established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. In addition, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides could be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection. The practicability of our method has been demonstrated by the success of large&#8208;scale synthesis using catalytic amount of electrolyte and a minimal amount of solvent. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic studies were performed, which support a NiII/0 catalytic cycle and the pre&#8208;coordination of the substrate to the nickel center.

         <title>Programming of Supercrystals Using Replicable DNA&#8208;Functionalized Colloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner by integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem for producing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies.







Abstract
The development of self&#8208;replicating systems is of great importance in research on the origin of life. As the most iconic molecules, nucleic acids have provided prominent examples of the fabrication of self&#8208;replicating artificial nanostructures. However, it is still challenging to construct sophisticated synthetic systems that can create large&#8208;scale or three&#8208;dimensionally ordered nanomaterials using self&#8208;replicating nanostructures. By integrating a template system containing DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal seeds with a simplified DNA strand&#8208;displacement circuit programmed subsystem to produce DNA&#8208;functionalized colloidal copies, we developed a facile enthalpy&#8208;mediated strategy to control the replication and catalytic assembly of DNA&#8208;functionalized colloids in a time&#8208;dependent manner. The replication efficiency and crystal quality of the resulting superlattice structures can be effectively increased by regulating the molar ratio of the template to the copy colloids. By constructing binary systems from two types of gold nanoparticles (or proteins), superlattice structures with different crystal symmetries can be obtained through the replication and catalytic assembly processes. This programmable enthalpy&#8208;mediated approach was easily leveraged to achieve the phase transformation and catalytic amplification of colloidal crystals starting from different initial template crystals. This work offers a potential way to construct self&#8208;replicating artificial systems that exhibit complicated phase behaviors and can produce large&#8208;scale superlattice nanomaterials.

         <title>Trifluoromethylation of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: A Mild Functionalization and Tunable p&#8208;Type Doping Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and versatile method is reported for the functionalization of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 with surface&#8208;bound trifluoromethyl groups using an easily&#8208;prepared electrophilic trifluoromethylation reagent. The nature of the adlayer is extensively characterized to reveal covalent bonding of trifluoromethyl groups at surface chalcogens and defect sites. Trifluoromethylation induces tunable p&#8208;type doping as demonstrated through photoluminescence and charge transport measurements.







Abstract
Chemical modification is a powerful strategy for tuning the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. Here we report the electrophilic trifluoromethylation of 2D WSe2 and MoS2 under mild conditions using the reagent trifluoromethyl thianthrenium triflate (TTT). Chemical characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the trifluoromethyl groups bind covalently to surface chalcogen atoms as well as oxygen substitution sites. Trifluoromethylation induces p&#8208;type doping in the underlying 2D material, enabling the modulation of charge transport and optical emission properties in WSe2. This work introduces a versatile and efficient method for tailoring the optical and electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Distinguish MnO2/Mn2+ Conversion/ Zn2+ Intercalation/ H+ Conversion Chemistries at Different Potentials in Aqueous Zn||MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte with an extended electrochemical stability window of approximately 3.0&#8197;V in a water&#8208;rich environment (76&#8197;wt&#8201;%). This widened window enables high&#8208;voltage scanning to initiate the MnO2/Mn2+ redox conversion at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. By employing specific surfactant (e.g., hexadecyl pyridinium chloride monohydrate), the electrolyte potentially segregates Zn2+ and H+ intercalation processes. The tailored amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte facilitates the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V, exclusive Zn2+ intercalation at an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau of approximately 1.33&#8197;V, and H+ intercalation/conversion at plateaus near 1.12&#8197;V.







Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 chemistry has been extensively explored, but its electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in the context of MnO2/Mn2+ conversion and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, remain not fully understood. Here, we designed an amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte, which distinguished the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion, Zn2+ intercalation, and H+ intercalation and conversion processes at three distinct discharge plateaus of an aqueous Zn||MnO2 battery. The amphiphilic hydrogel electrolyte is featured with an extended electrochemical stability window up to 3.0&#8197;V, high ionic conductivity, Zn2+&#8208;selective ion tunnels, and hydrophobic associations with cathode materials. This specifically designed electrolyte allows the MnO2/Mn2+ conversion reaction at a discharge plateau of 1.75&#8197;V. More interesting, the discharge plateaus of ~1.33&#8197;V, previously assigned as the co&#8208;intercalation of Zn2+ and H+ ions in the MnO2 cathode, are specified as the exclusive intercalation of Zn2+ ions, leading to an ultra&#8208;flat voltage plateau. Furthermore, with a distinct three&#8208;step electrochemical energy storage process, a high areal capacity of 1.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high specific energy of 0.858&#8197;Wh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even at a low MnO2 loading mass of 0.5&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 are achieved. To our knowledge, this is the first report to fully distinguish different mechanisms at different potentials in aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries.

         <title>Tailoring Second Coordination Sphere for Tunable Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfacial Charge Transfer toward Enhanced Photoelectrochemical H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8211;liquid interfacial charge transfer dynamics of p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated by designing the metal centers and first/second coordination spheres of molecular catalysts in the electrolyte. The p&#8208;Si/Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 photocathode system exhibits efficient and durable photoelectrochemical hydrogen production.







Abstract
The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers severely limits the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2 production. Here, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by optimizing the charge transfer dynamics at the solid&#8211;liquid interface via molecular catalyst design. Specifically, the surface of a p&#8208;Si photocathode is modulated using molecular catalysts with different metal atoms and organic ligands to improve H2 production performance. Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2 is identified as an efficient and durable catalyst for H2 production through the rational design of metal centers and first/second coordination spheres. The modulation with Co(pda&#8208;SO3H)2, which contains an electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8722;SO3H group in the second coordination sphere, elevates the flat&#8208;band potential of the polished p&#8208;Si photocathode and nanoporous p&#8208;Si photocathode by 81&#8197;mV and 124&#8197;mV, respectively, leading to the maximized energy band bending and the minimized interfacial carrier transport resistance. Consequently, both the two photocathodes achieve the Faradaic efficiency of more than 95&#8201;% for H2 production, which is well maintained during 18&#8197;h and 21&#8197;h reaction, respectively. This work highlights that the band&#8208;edge engineering by molecular catalysts could be an important design consideration for semiconductor&#8211;catalyst hybrids toward PEC H2 production.

         <title>Precision Engineering of the Co&#8208;immobilization of Enzymes for Cascade Biocatalysis</title>

A double&#8208;layered coating approach was developed for the precise and sequential immobilization of dual&#8208;enzyme systems on resin particles using two biorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition. The method enables the combined purification and the ordered immobilization of enzymes and significantly enhances the catalytic efficiency and recyclability of multienzyme systems.







Abstract
The design and orderly layered co&#8208;immobilization of multiple enzymes on resin particles remain challenging. In this study, the SpyTag/SpyCatcher binding pair was fused to the N&#8208;terminus of an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an aldo&#8208;keto reductase (AKR), respectively. A non&#8208;canonical amino acid (ncAA), p&#8208;azido&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (p&#8208;AzF), as the anchor for covalent bonding enzymes, was genetically inserted into preselected sites in the AKR and ADH. Employing the two bioorthogonal counterparts of SpyTag/SpyCatcher and azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition for the immobilization of AKR and ADH enabled sequential dual&#8208;enzyme coating on porous microspheres. The ordered dual&#8208;enzyme reactor was subsequently used to synthesize (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;chlorophenyl)ethanol asymmetrically from the corresponding prochiral ketone, enabling the in situ regeneration of NADPH. The reactor exhibited a high catalytic conversion of 74&#8201;% and good reproducibility, retaining 80&#8201;% of its initial activity after six cycles. The product had 99.9&#8201;% ee, which that was maintained in each cycle. Additionally, the double&#8208;layer immobilization method significantly increased the enzyme loading capacity, which was approximately 1.7&#8197;times greater than that of traditional single&#8208;layer immobilization. More importantly, it simultaneously enabled both the purification and immobilization of multiple enzymes on carriers, thus providing a convenient approach to facilitate cascade biocatalysis.

         <title>Selective Stereoretention of Carbohydrates upon C&#8722;C Cleavage Enabling D&#8208;Glyceric Acid Production with High Optical Purity over a Ag/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative stereostructure&#8208;retention strategy enabled the preservation of a stereogenic center and precise C2&#8722;C3 cleavage in sugars. D&#8208;Glyceric acid production with the highest yield reported to date (86.8&#8201;%) and &gt;99&#8201;% ee was achieved without the use of an asymmetric catalyst. This approach overcomes the current limitation of poor enantioselectivity and suggests new possibilities for chiral chemical production from renewable biomass.







Abstract
Chiral carboxylic acid production from renewable biomass by chemocatalysis is vitally important for reducing our carbon footprint, but remains underdeveloped. We herein establish a strategy that make use of a stereogenic center of biomass to achieve a rare example of D&#8208;glyceric acid production with the highest yield (86.8&#8201;%) reported to date as well as an excellent ee value (&gt;99&#8201;%). Unlike traditional asymmetric catalysis, chiral catalysts/additives are not required. Ample experiments combined with quantum chemical calculations established the origins of the stereogenic center and catalyst performance. The chirality at C4 in D&#8208;xylose was proved to be retained and successfully delivered to C2 in D&#8208;glyceric acid during C&#8722;C cleavage. The remarkable cooperative&#8208;roles of Ag+ and Ag0 in the constructed Ag/&#947;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst are disclosed as the crucial contributors. Ag+ was responsible for low&#8208;temperature activation of D&#8208;xylose, while Ag0 facilitated the generation of active O* from O2. Ag+ and active O* cooperatively promoted the precise cleavage of the C2&#8722;C3 bond, and more importantly O* allowed the immediate fast oxidization of the D&#8208;glyceraldehyde intermediate to stabilize D&#8208;glyceric acid, thereby inhibiting the side reaction that induced racemization. This strategy makes a significant breakthrough in overcoming the limitation of poor enantioselectivity in current chemocatalytic conversion of biomass.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Switchable Peroxidase/Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of Carbon Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) are synthesized using polyaniline as a precursor. O/N&#8208;CQDs possess photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity that can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity dynamically. Using such an artificial &#8220;light switch&#8221;, it is feasible to autonomously manipulate the ROS level that is adaptive to the development of diseases, providing an intelligent therapeutic strategy for precise medicine.







Abstract
Nanozymes possess multi&#8208;enzyme activities over the natural enzymes, which produce multi&#8208;pathway synergistic effects for varies of biomedical applications. Unfortunately, their multi&#8208;enzyme activities are in fighting, significantly reducing the synergistic effects. Dynamic regulation of their multi&#8208;enzyme activities is the bottleneck for intelligent therapies. Herein, we construct a novel oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) with peroxidase&#8208;like (Reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer) activity. Interestingly, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity can be reversibly converted to catalase&#8208;like (ROS scavenger) activity under visible light irradiation. It is found that both the peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity. The mechanism of switchable enzyme activities is attributed to the polarization of quinoid nitrogen in polyaniline (PANI) precursor retained on O/N&#8208;CQDs under visible light, which consumes the ROS to produce O2 and H2O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we are able to non&#8208;intrusively up and down regulate the ROS level in cells successfully by simply switching off and on the light respectively, potentially facilitating the precise medicine based on the development of the disease. Indeed, the photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs opens a non&#8208;invasive strategy for better manipulations of the multi&#8208;activity of nanozymes, promising their wider and more intelligent biomedical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Nitrate in a NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O Ternary Electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>
The glut in NH3 production has resulted in a heavily imbalanced N&#8208;cycle causing massive accumulation of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in our ecosystems, destroying the environment. Upcycling these Nr via electrochemical conversion into NH3 can partially close the N&#8208;cycle and reduce reliance on the carbon&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosh process. Here we report the remarkable performance of a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni catalyst at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
A glut of dinitrogen&#8208;derived ammonia (NH3) over the past century has resulted in a heavily imbalanced nitrogen cycle and consequently, the large&#8208;scale accumulation of reactive nitrogen such as nitrates in our ecosystems has led to detrimental environmental issues. Electrocatalytic upcycling of waste nitrogen back into NH3 holds promise in mitigating these environmental impacts and reducing reliance on the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Herein, we report a high&#8208;performance electrolyzer using an ultrahigh alkalinity electrolyte, NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O, for low&#8208;cost NH3 electrosynthesis. At 3,000&#8197;mA/cm2, the device with a Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst achieves an unprecedented faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5&#177;1.5&#8201;% under a low cell voltage of 3.83&#8197;V; whereas at 1,000&#8197;mA/cm2, an FE of 96.5&#177;4.8&#8201;% under a cell voltage of only 2.40&#8197;V was achieved. Techno&#8208;economic analysis revealed that our device cuts the levelized cost of ammonia electrosynthesis by ~40&#8201;% ($30.68 for Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni vs. $48.53 for Ni foam per kmol&#8208;NH3). The NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H2O electrolyte together with the Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst can enable the high&#8208;throughput nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia applications for affordable and scalable real&#8208;world wastewater treatments.

Techno-economic analysis revealed that our device cuts the levelized cost of ammonia electrosynthesis by ~40&#8201;% ($30.68 for Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni vs. $48.53 for Ni foam per kmol-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The NaOH&#8722;KOH&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O electrolyte together with the Fe&#8722;Cu&#8722;Ni ternary catalyst can enable the high-throughput nitrate-to-ammonia applications for affordable and scalable real-world wastewater treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How to Decarbonize N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (NHCs): The simple Alane Adducts (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlR3 (R=H, Me, Et)</title>

A case study on different decomposition channels of a backbone saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene in the coordination sphere of alanes is reported. This study provides evidence that NHCs, nowadays ubiquitous ligands in transition metal and main group chemistry, are not always inert bystanders and &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligands, as often considered.







Abstract
The reaction of the amine&#8208;stabilized alane (NMe3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 1 with the backbone&#8208;saturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) SIDipp (SIDipp=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;{2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;phenyl}&#8208;imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) at 0&#8201;&#176;C yielded the NHC alane adduct (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2. Reaction at elevated temperatures or prolonged reaction at room temperature gave the product of a ring expansion reaction (RER) of the NHC, (NMe3)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH(RER&#8208;SIDippH2) 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NMe3). Subsequent reaction of the latter with sterically less hindered NHCs (IMeMe {=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, IiPrMe {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, and IiPr {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}) afforded the NHC&#8208;stabilized RER&#8208;products (NHC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH(RER&#8208;SIDippH2) 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NHC) (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe, IiPr), while no reaction was observed with the sterically more demanding NHCs IDipp (=1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;{2,6&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;phenyl}&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), SIDipp and ItBu (=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene). The compounds 3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(NHC) were also obtained starting from (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2 and NHC at room temperature. Heating solutions of (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlH3 2 without additional base to 95&#8201;&#176;C resulted in decarbonization of the NHC and substitution of the carbene carbon atom with aluminum hydride under loss of ethene. Subsequent dimerization afforded cis&#8208;[AlH{&#956;&#8208;N(Dipp)CH2CH2N(Dipp)}]2 4_dimer. Heating solutions of the NHC&#8208;ligated aluminum alkyls (SIDipp)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;AlR3 2R (R=Me, Et) to 145&#8201;&#176;C instead led to complete scission of the NHC backbone with evolution of ethene and isolation of the dialkylaluminium(III) amidinates {DippNC(R)NDipp}AlR2 5R (R=Me, Et).

         <title>Reticular Modulation of Piezofluorochromic Behaviors in Organic Molecular Cages by Replacing Non&#8208;Luminous Components</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A luminescent organic molecular cage (OMC) that displays piezochromic behavior has been synthesized by incorporating aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) chromophores into its structure. Changing the rigidity of the cage by replacing the non&#8208;luminous components enabled further modulation of the flexibility and versatility of the OMCs, with a remarkable luminescence peak shift observed upon hydrostatic compression.







Abstract
Organic piezochromic materials that manifest pressure&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responses are important in various fields such as data storage and anticounterfeiting. The manipulation of piezofluorochromic behaviors for these materials is promising but remains a great challenge. Herein, a non&#8208;luminous components regulated strategy is developed and organic molecular cages (OMCs), a burgeoning class of crystalline organic materials with structural dynamics, are first explored for the design of piezofluorochromic materials with tunable luminescence. A series of OMCs based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) chromophores, termed Cage&#8197;1&#8211;3, are synthesized and their piezofluorochromic behaviors are investigated by diamond anvil cell technique. Due to the sufficient voids between its flexible chromophores offered by the OMC structure, Cage&#8197;1 exhibits thermofluorochromic and piezofluorochromic properties. Moreover, the piezofluorochromic performance of this OMC could be further promoted by replacing its non&#8208;luminous components with improved flexibilities, and a remarkable luminescence peak shift by 150&#8197;nm together with a response sensitivity of 13.8&#8197;nm&#8201;GPa&#8722;1 was achieved upon hydrostatic compression. The cage structure plays a vital role in facilitating efficient and reversible piezofluorochromic behaviors. This study has shed light on the rational design and exploitation of OMCs as an exceptional platform to accomplish customizable piezofluorochromic behaviors and enlarge their potential applications in pressure&#8208;based luminescence.

         <title>Transesterification Induced Multifunctional Additives Enable High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole dimethylphosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyltrimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazole trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. Among them, DTMSP removes H2O and HF, and DITFA promotes the dissolution of LiNO3 in carbonate electrolyte. Both DTMSP and DITFA have low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), tending to preferentially redox decompose to produce a high&#8208;quality electrode electrolyte interphase layer.







Abstract
The electrolyte chemistry is crucially important for promoting the practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate (DIDP) and trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetate (TMSF) can undergo in situ transesterification in carbonate electrolyte to generate dimethyl trimethylsilyl phosphate (DTMSP) and 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolium trifluoroacetate (DITFA) as multifunctional additives for LMBs. H2O and HF can be removed by the Si&#8722;O group in DTMSP to improve the moisture resistance of electrolyte and the stability of cathode. Furthermore, the dissolution of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) in carbonate electrolyte can be promoted by the trifluoroacetate anion (TFA&#8722;) in DITFA, thereby optimizing the solvation structure and transport kinetics of Li+. More importantly, both DTMSP and DITFA tend to preferential redox decomposition due to the low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Consequently, a thin and robust layer rich in P/N/Si on the cathode and an inorganic&#8208;rich layer (e.g. Li3N/Li3P) on the anode can be constructed and superior electrochemical performances are achieved. This artificial transesterification strategy to introduce favorable additives paves an efficient and ingenious route to high&#8208;performance electrolyte for LMBs.

         <title>Constructing Dynamic Anode/Electrolyte Interfaces Coupled with Regulated Solvation Structures for Long&#8208;Term and Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic anode/electrolyte interface coupled with regulated solvation structures strategy is firstly realized with Tris additive for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract solvated&#8208;Zn2+, then promote the de&#8208;solvation by the orientation polarization, the volume rejection effect and strong intermolecular force of the vertically&#8208;adsorbed Tris, leading to an improved Zn2+&#8208;transport kinetics and the inhibition of side reactions.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) show a great potential for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their high safety and high energy density. However, the severe side reactions of zinc negative electrode largely hinder the further application of AZIBs. Herein, trace tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) additive with rich lone&#8208;pair&#8208;electrons and zincophilic sites is firstly introduced to achieve long&#8208;term and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Specifically, Tris not only regulates the solvation structure of Zn2+, but is also adsorbed vertically on the Zn anode surface with a changed coordination intensity during the plating/stripping process of Zn to generate an in situ dynamic adsorption layer for the first time. The dynamic adsorption layer could successively attract the solvated Zn2+ and then promote the de&#8208;solvation of the solvated Zn2+ owing to the orientation polarization with regularly&#8208;changed applied electric field, the volume rejection effect, and strong intermolecular force towards H2O of the vertically&#8208;adsorbed Tris. Therefore, an improved Zn2+&#8208;transport kinetics as well as the inhibition of side reactions of Zn anode are successfully realized. Accordingly, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell provides an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 2600&#8197;h. Furthermore, the Zn||MnO2 full cell with Tris could demonstrate a high capacity and structural stability for practical applications.

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution in Neutral Media by Differential Intermediate Binding at Charge&#8208;Modulated Sites of a Bimetallic Alloy Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential binding of H* and OH* on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of amorphous Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam, resulting in an ultralow overpotential of 50&#177;9&#8197;mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential intermediate binding on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam (NF), where the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1&#8197;M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is only 50&#177;9&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It has a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.18&#8197;s&#8722;1, mass activity of 13.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;200&#8197;mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and produces 16&#8197;ml H2 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;300&#8197;mV vs. RHE, more than double that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C. The Mo&#948;+ and Co&#948;&#8722; sites adsorb OH*, and H*, respectively, and the electron injection from Co to H&#8722;O&#8722;H cleaves the O&#8722;H bond to form the Mo&#8722;OH* intermediate. Operando spectral analyses indicate a weak H&#8208;bonded network for facilitating the H2O*/OH* transport, and a potential&#8208;induced reversal of the charge density from Co to the more electronegative Mo, because of the electron withdrawing Co&#8722;H* and Mo&#8722;OH* species. Co85Mo15/NF can also drive the complete electrolysis of neutral water at only 1.73&#8197;V (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In alkaline, and acidic media, it demonstrates a Pt&#8208;like HER activity, accomplishing &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 161&#177;7, and 175&#177;22&#8197;mV, respectively.

         <title>Novel Stereo&#8208;Induction Pattern in Pudovik Addition/Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement Towards Chiral Trisubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical methodology has been developed to synthesize axially chiral phosphorus allenes through a PPS&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Pudovik addition followed by phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. Mechanistic experiments have demonstrated that the enantio&#8208;determining step is the 1,2&#8208;addition, with the subsequent rearrangement undergoing a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Despite the significance of chiral allene skeletons in catalysis, organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry et&#8197;al., there is a scarcity of reports on axially chiral allenyl phosphorus compounds. Here, we disclosed an efficient and straightforward cascade reaction between ethynyl ketones and phosphine oxides, resulting in a broad array of trisubstituted allenes incorporating a phosphorus moiety in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities facilitated by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis, Additionally, comprehensive series of mechanistic experiments have been conducted to elucidate that this cascade reaction proceeds via an asymmetric Pudovik addition reaction followed by a subsequent phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement that occurs concomitantly with kinetic resolution, representing a stereospecific rearrangement and protonation process facilitating central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer in a cascade manner. We anticipate that our research will pave the way for a promising exploration of novel stereo&#8208;induction pattern in the Pudovik addition/phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement cascade reaction.

         <title>Vertically Concentrated Quantum Wells Enabling Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a thermal&#8208;gradient annealing treatment to address the issue of vertical quantum well (QW) polydispersity in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable n=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained, which enables a narrow and stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) based on quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) systems exist heightened sensitivity to the domain distribution. The top&#8208;down crystallization mode will lead to a vertical gradient distribution of quantum well (QW) structure, which is unfavorable for deep&#8208;blue emission. Herein, a thermal gradient annealing treatment is proposed to address the polydispersity issue of vertical QWs in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The formation of large&#8208;n domains at the upper interface of the perovskite film can be effectively inhibited by introducing a low&#8208;temperature source in the annealing process. Combined with the utilization of NaBr to inhibit the undesirable n=1 domain, a vertically concentrated QW structure is ultimately attained. As a result, the fabricated device delivers a narrow and stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 458&#8197;nm with an impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.82&#8201;%. Green and sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with remarkable EQE of 21.83&#8201;% and 17.51&#8201;% are also successfully achieved, respectively, by using the same strategy. The findings provide a universal strategy across the entire quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, paving the way for future practical application of PeLEDs.

Green and sky-blue PeLEDs with remarkable EQE of 21.83&#8201;% and 17.51&#8201;% are also successfully achieved, respectively, by using the same strategy. The findings provide a universal strategy across the entire quasi-2D perovskites, paving the way for future practical application of PeLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Completely Non&#8208;Fused Low&#8208;Cost Acceptor Enables Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 17&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By successive changes in molecular configuration and branching position of alkoxy side chains, we designed and synthesized a completely non&#8208;fused acceptor, TBT&#8208;26, with a narrow band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV and excellent stability. TBT&#8208;26 has a significantly low raw material cost of about 12&#8197;$/g. The TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based device gives outstanding power conversion efficiency of 17.0&#8201;% for small area device and 14.3&#8201;% for large area module with an area of 28.8&#8197;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
To meet the industrial requirements of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, it is imperative to accelerate the development of cost&#8208;effective materials. Thiophene&#8208;benzene&#8208;thiophene central unit&#8208;based acceptors possess the advantage of low synthetic cost, while their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is relatively low. Here, by incorporating a para&#8208;substituted benzene unit and 1st&#8208;position branched alkoxy chains with large steric hindrance, a completely non&#8208;fused non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, TBT&#8208;26, was designed and synthesized. The narrow band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV ensures the effective utilization of sunlight. The favorable phase separation morphology of TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based blend film facilitates the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in corresponding OPV cell. Therefore, the TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based small&#8208;area cell achieves an impressive PCE of 17.0&#8201;%, which is the highest value of completely non&#8208;fused OPV cells. Additionally, we successfully demonstrated the scalability of this design by fabricating a 28.8&#8197;cm2 module with a high PCE of 14.3&#8201;%. Overall, our work provides a practical molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost acceptors, paving the way for industrial applications of OPV technology.

         <title>Light&#8208;induced Delivery of Charged Species using Ion&#8208;selective Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell POT&#8208;membrane nanoparticles are synthesized and characterized. By tailoring the composition of the membrane in the shell, the selective encapsulation and light&#8208;driven release of cations is demonstrated through optical and electrochemical experiments. On&#8208;off cycles of irradiation allowed for subsequent delivery/encapsulation of cations from/to the NPs, which is useful for future on&#8208;demand drug delivery nanoplatforms.







Abstract
Controlled release systems have gained considerable attention owing to their potential to deliver molecules, including ions and drugs, in a customized manner. We present a light&#8208;induced ion&#8208;transfer platform consisting of a dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs, ~300&#8197;nm) with the conductive polymer poly(3&#8208;octylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (POT) in the core and a potassium (K+)&#8208;selective membrane in the shell. Owing to the photoactive nature of POT, POT NPs can be used for a dual purpose: as a host for positively charged species and as an actuator to trigger the subsequent release. POT0 and doped POT+ coexist in the core, allowing K+ encapsulation in the shell. As POT0 is photo&#8208;oxidized to POT+, K+ is released to the (aqueous) dispersion phase to preserve the neutrality of the NPs. This process is reversible and can be simultaneously assessed using the native fluorescence of POT0 and via potentiometric measurements. The NP structure and its mechanism of action were thoroughly studied with a series of control experiments and complementary techniques. Understanding the NP and its surrounding interactions will pave the way for other nanostructured systems, facilitating sophisticated applications. The delivery of ionic drugs and interference/pollutant catching for advanced sensing/restoration will be considered in future research.

         <title>Stiffness Modulation and Pulsatile Release in Dual Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hydrogels that similar to living organisms can maintain or adapt their properties and internal structure upon exposure to a combination of external stimuli. These hydrogels contain both redox and light responsive units, which can operate independently if addressed separately, but show adaptivity and self&#8208;regulation of stiffness when addressed simultaneously.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, self&#8208;regulation can be introduced in synthetic hydrogels by incorporating chemo&#8208;mechanical signals or coupled chemical reactions to maintain or adapt the material's physico&#8208;chemical properties when exposed to external triggers. In this work, we present redox and light dual stimuli responsive hydrogels capable of rapidly adapting the polymer crosslinking network while maintaining hydrogel stability. Upon irradiation with UV light, polymer hydrogels containing redox responsive disulfide crosslinks and light responsive ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl moieties show a release of payload accompanied by adaptation of the hydrogel network towards higher stiffness due to in situ crosslinking by S&#8208;nitrosylation. Whereas the hydrogel design allows the network to either become softer in presence of reducing agent glutathione or stiffer upon UV irradiation, simultaneous application of both stimuli induces network self&#8208;regulation resulting in a pulsatile form of payload release from the hydrogel. Finally, adaptive stiffness was used to make tunable hydrogels as substrates for different cell lines.

         <title>Monitoring ROS Responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based Nanoparticle Mediated Ferroptosis and Immunotherapy via 129Xe MRI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supplying ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4 nanoparticle was designed to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy by ROS&#8208;mediated size reduction and charge reversion. Moreover, the 129Xe MRI of lung metastases showed significant differences in lung ventilation defects in the treatment and control groups, indicating the great potential of 129Xe MRI for monitoring the immunotherapeutic efficacy of lung metastatic cancer.







Abstract
The immune checkpoint blockade strategy has improved the survival rate of late&#8208;stage lung cancer patients. However, the low immune response rate limits the immunotherapy efficiency. Here, we report a ROS&#8208;responsive Fe3O4&#8208;based nanoparticle that undergoes charge reversal and disassembly in the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the uptake of Fe3O4 by tumor cells and triggering a more severe ferroptosis. In the tumor microenvironment, the nanoparticle rapidly disassembles and releases the loaded GOx and the immune&#8208;activating peptide Tuftsin under overexpressed H2O2. GOx can consume the glucose of tumor cells and generate more H2O2, promoting the disassembly of the nanoparticle and drug release, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effect of ferroptosis. Combined with Tuftsin, it can more effectively reverse the immune&#8208;suppressive microenvironment and promote the recruitment of effector T cells in tumor tissues. Ultimately, in combination with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, there is significant inhibition of the growth of lung metastases. Additionally, the hyperpolarized 129Xe method has been used to evaluate the Fe3O4 nanoparticle&#8208;mediated immunotherapy, where the ventilation defects in lung metastases have been significantly improved with complete lung structure and function recovered. The ferroptosis&#8208;enhanced immunotherapy combined with non&#8208;radiation evaluation methodology paves a new way for designing novel theranostic agents for cancer therapy.

         <title>Achieving Efficient Dark Blue Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence with Ultra&#8208;Wide Range Tunable&#8208;Lifetime</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of efficient dark blue room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials with tunable&#8208;lifetime have been prepared. The phosphorescence lifetime of the doped films can be continuously increased from 32.8&#8197;ms to 1925.8&#8197;ms. The reason is that the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group can modulate the HOMO&#8211;LUMO and singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, as well as the interactive force with methyl benzoate derivatives and polyvinyl alcohol.







Abstract
Tunable&#8208;lifetime room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been widely studied due to their broad applications. However, only few reports have achieved wide&#8208;range lifetime modulation. In this work, ultra&#8208;wide range tunable&#8208;lifetime efficient dark blue RTP materials were realized by doping methyl benzoate derivatives into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix. The phosphorescence lifetimes of the doped films can be increased from 32.8&#8197;ms to 1925.8&#8197;ms. Such wide range of phosphorescence lifetime modulation is extremely rare in current reports. Moreover, the phosphorescence emission of the methyl 4&#8208;hydroxybenzoate&#8208;doped film is located in the dark blue region and the phosphorescence quantum yield reaches as high as 15.4&#8201;%, which broadens their applications in organic optoelectronic information. Further studies demonstrated that the reason for the tunable lifetime was that the magnitude of the electron&#8208;donating ability of the substituent group modulates the HOMO&#8211;LUMO and singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of methyl benzoate derivatives, as well as the ability to non&#8208;covalent interactions with PVA. Moreover, the potential applications of luminescent displays and optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these high&#8208;performance dark blue RTP materials have been conducted.

         <title>Understanding Defects in Amorphous Silicon with Million&#8208;Atom Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning methods and computational chemistry are combined to develop a comprehensive understanding of coordination defects in amorphous silicon. Fivefold&#8208;connected atoms fall into three categories based on their chemical structure, and are found to cluster together, which can be explained based on energetic arguments.







Abstract
The structure of amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si) is widely thought of as a fourfold&#8208;connected random network, and yet it is defective atoms, with fewer or more than four bonds, that make it particularly interesting. Despite many attempts to explain such &#8220;dangling&#8208;bond&#8221; and &#8220;floating&#8208;bond&#8221; defects, respectively, a unified understanding is still missing. Here, we use advanced computational chemistry methods to reveal the complex structural and energetic landscape of defects in a&#8208;Si. We study an ultra&#8208;large&#8208;scale, quantum&#8208;accurate structural model containing a million atoms, and thousands of individual defects, allowing reliable defect&#8208;related statistics to be obtained. We combine structural descriptors and machine&#8208;learned atomic energies to develop a classification of the different types of defects in a&#8208;Si. The results suggest a revision of the established floating&#8208;bond model by showing that fivefold&#8208;bonded atoms in a&#8208;Si exhibit a wide range of local environments&#8211;analogous to fivefold centers in coordination chemistry. Furthermore, it is shown that fivefold (but not threefold) coordination defects tend to cluster together. Our study provides new insights into one of the most widely studied amorphous solids, and has general implications for understanding defects in disordered materials beyond silicon alone.

         <title>Electro/Ni Dual&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions of Carboxylates and Aryl Bromide</title>

Electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions of widely available carboxylate nucleophiles with aryl bromides are developed. The electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral cross&#8208;coupling expands the chemical space of paired electrosynthesis and represents a sustainable method for the construction of the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond.







Abstract
Paired redox&#8208;neutral electrolysis offers an attractive green platform for organic synthesis by avoiding sacrificial oxidants and reductants. Carboxylates are non&#8208;toxic, stable, inexpensive, and widely available, making them ideal nucleophiles for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Here, we report the electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral decarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions of pristine carboxylates with aryl bromides. At a cathode, a NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate is formed through the activation of Ar&#8722;Br bond by a NiI&#8208;bipyridine catalyst and subsequent reduction. At an anode, the carboxylates, including amino acid, benzyl carboxylic acid, and 2&#8208;phenoxy propionic acid, undergo oxidative decarboxylation to form carbon&#8208;based free radicals. The combination of NiII(Ar)(Br) intermediate and carbon radical results in the formation of C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling products. The adaptation of this electrosynthesis method to flow synthesis and valuable molecule synthesis was demonstrated. The reaction mechanism was systematically studied through electrochemical voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT) computational studies. The relationships between the electrochemical properties of carboxylates and the reaction selectivity were revealed. The electro/Ni dual&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions described herein expand the chemical space of paired electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling and represent a promising method for the construction of the C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds because of the ubiquitous carboxylate nucleophiles and the innate scalability and flexibility of electrochemical flow&#8208;synthesis technology.

         <title>Homochiral &#960;&#8208;Rich Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabled Chirality Imprinting in Conjugated Polymers: Confined Polymerization and Chiral Memory from Scratch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) were synthesized through confined polymerization within &#960;&#8208;rich homochiral covalent organic frameworks, utilizing a chiral imprinting process. The isolated OACPs retained chirality and displayed robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids.







Abstract
Optically active &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (OACPs) have garnered increasing research interest for their resemblance to biological helices and intriguing chirality&#8208;related functions. Traditional methods for synthesizing involve decorating achiral conjugated polymer architectures with enantiopure side substituents through complex organic synthesis. Here, we report a new approach: the templated synthesis of unsubstituted OACPs via supramolecularly confined polymerizations of achiral monomers within nanopores of 2D or 3D chiral covalent organic frameworks (CCOFs). We show that the chiral &#960;&#8208;rich nanospaces facilitate the in situ enantiospecific polymerization and self&#8208;propagation, akin to nonenzymatic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, resulting in chiral imprinting. The stacked polymer chains are kinetically inert enough to memorize the chiral information after liberating from CCOFs, and even after treatment at temperature up to 200&#8201;&#176;C. The isolated OACPs demonstrate robust enantiodiscrimination, achieving up to 85&#8201;%&#8197;ee in separating racemic amino acids. This underscores the potential of utilizing CCOFs as templates for supramolecularly imprinting optical activity into CPs, paving the way for synthetic evolution and advanced functional exploration of OACPs.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Using an Osmium Complex as a Panchromatic Self&#8208;Photosensitized Catalyst: Utilization of Blue, Green, and Red Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Os complex that absorbs longer&#8208;wavelength light (350&#8211;700&#8197;nm) has been developed as a panchromatic self&#8208;photosensitized catalyst for CO2 reduction to give mainly carbon monoxide (CO) with a total turnover number (TON) of 625 under photoirradiation (&#955;&#8805;400&#8197;nm). CO2 photoreduction also proceeded with monochromatic blue (&#955;0=405&#8197;nm), green (&#955;0=525&#8197;nm), or red (&#955;0=630&#8197;nm) light with a high CO selectivity of &gt;90&#8201;%.







Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) represents an attractive approach for solar&#8208;energy storage and leads to the production of renewable fuels and valuable chemicals. Although some osmium (Os) photosensitizers absorb long wavelengths in the visible&#8208;light region, a self&#8208;photosensitized, mononuclear Os catalyst for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction has not yet been exploited. Here, we discovered that the introduction of an Os metal to a PNNP&#8208;type tetradentate ligand resulted in the absorption of light with longer&#8208;wavelength (350&#8211;700&#8197;nm) and that can be applied to a panchromatic self&#8208;photosensitized catalyst for CO2 reduction to give mainly carbon monoxide (CO) with a total turnover number (TON) of 625 under photoirradiation (&#955;&#8805;400&#8197;nm). CO2 photoreduction also proceeded under irradiation with blue (&#955;0=405&#8197;nm), green (&#955;0=525&#8197;nm), or red (&#955;0=630&#8197;nm) light to give CO with &gt;90&#8201;% selectivity. The quantum efficiency using red light was determined to be 12&#8201;% for the generation of CO. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on the detection of intermediates using various spectroscopic techniques, including transient absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and UV/Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Dual Enhancement of Phosphorescence and Circularly Polarized Luminescence through Entropically Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropically driven self&#8208;assembled system based on a platinum complex displays a dual enhancement of phosphorescence and chiroptical response, both in the ground state and excited state (glum value increases from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06), upon elevating the temperature of the supramolecular system. The strategy developed in this work overcomes the customary trade&#8208;off between QY and glum, a prevalent challenge in most CPL materials.







Abstract
Addressing the dual enhancement of circular polarization (glum) and luminescence quantum yield (QY) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) systems poses a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative strategy utilizing the entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic phosphorescent platinum(II) complexes (L&#8722;Pt) with tetraethylene glycol chains, resulting in unique temperature dependencies. The entropically driven self&#8208;assembly of L&#8722;Pt leads to a synergistic improvement in phosphorescence emission efficiency (QY was amplified from 15&#8201;% at 25&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;% at 60&#8201;&#176;C) and chirality, both in the ground state and the excited state (glum value has been magnified from 0.04&#215;10&#8722;2 to 0.06) with increasing temperature. Notably, we observed reversible modulation of phosphorescence and chirality observed over at least 10&#8197;cycles through successive heating and cooling, highlighting the intelligent control of luminescence and chiroptical properties by regulating intermolecular interactions among neighboring L&#8722;Pt molecules. Importantly, the QY and glum of the L&#8722;Pt assembly in solid state were measured as 69&#8201;% and 0.16 respectively, representing relatively high values compared to most self&#8208;assembled CPL systems. This study marks the pioneering demonstration of dual thermo&#8208;enhancement of phosphorescence and CPL and provides valuable insights into the thermal effects on high&#8208;temperature and switchable CPL materials.

         <title>Spontaneous Curvature Induction in an Artificial Bilayer Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous curvature induction in an artificial supramolecular bilayer membrane and its transformation into vesicles in pure water is demonstrated. Compositional asymmetry resulting from the autogenous protonation of amines led to the formation of an asymmetric membrane and curvature induction. The stability provided by the hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of the supramolecular structure in water appears to be critical in the dynamic morphological transformations.







Abstract
Maintaining lipid asymmetry across membrane leaflets is critical for functions like vesicular traffic and organelle homeostasis. However, a lack of molecular&#8208;level understanding of the mechanisms underlying membrane fission and fusion processes in synthetic systems precludes their development as artificial analogs. Here, we report asymmetry induction of a bilayer membrane formed by an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with oxyalkylene side chains bearing terminal tertiary amine moieties (BA1) in water. Autogenous protonation of the tertiary amines in the periphery of the bilayer by water induces anisotropic curvature, resulting in membrane fission to form vesicles and can be monitored using time&#8208;dependent spectroscopy and microscopy. Interestingly, upon loss of the induced asymmetry by extensive protonation using an organic acid restored bilayer membrane. The mechanism leading to the compositional asymmetry in the leaflet and curvature induction in the membrane is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Studies extended to control molecules having changes in hydrophilic (BA2) and hydrophobic (BA3) segments provide insight into the delicate nature of molecular scale interactions in the dynamic transformation of supramolecular structures. The synergic effect of hydrophobic interaction and the hydrated state of BA1 aggregates provide dynamicity and unusual stability. Our study unveils mechanistic insight into the dynamic transformation of bilayer membranes into vesicles.

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Linker Strategy for the Construction of Sulfone&#8208;Containing D&#8211;A&#8211;A Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>

Sulfone&#8208;containing D&#8211;A&#8211;A covalent organic framework photocatalyst was synthesized via a mixed&#8208;linker strategy to facilitate charge transport and surface reactions with water. High photocatalytic H2O2 production activity was achieved to create solutions that can be used directly for the degradation of organic pollutants.







Abstract
The solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from water and oxygen using semiconductor catalysts offers a promising approach for converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production is often restricted by the low photo&#8208;generated charge separation, slow surface reactions and inadequate stability. Here, we developed a mixed&#8208;linker strategy to build a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8211;A) type covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF. The FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF structure features extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation that improves charge mobility, while the introduction of sulfone units not only as active sites facilitates surface reactions with water but also bolsters stability through increased interlayer forces. The resulting FS&#8208;OHOMe&#8208;COF has a low exciton binding energy, long excited&#8208;state lifetime and high photo&#8208;stability that leads to high performance for photocatalytic H2O2 production (up to 1.0&#8197;mM&#8201;h&#8722;1) with an H2O2 output of 19&#8197;mM after 72&#8197;hours of irradiation. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrates high stability, which sustained activity over 192&#8197;hours of photocatalytic experiment.

Carbon dioxide hydrate upon low temperature compression transforms into different crystalline polymorphs of elusive carbonic acid. In view of the widespread diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in the Universe, this finding represents a valuable support for understanding and modelling the complex crustal composition of Solar and exoSolar icy bodies.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is widespread in astrochemically relevant environments, often coexisting with water (H2O) ices and thus triggering a great interest regarding the possible formation of their adducts under various thermodynamic conditions. Amongst them, solid carbonic acid (H2CO3) remains elusive, yet being widely studied. Synthetic routes followed for its production have always been characterised by drastic irradiation on solid ice mixtures or complex procedures on fluid samples (such as laser heating at moderate to high pressures). Here we report about a simpler yet effective synthetic route to obtain two diverse carbonic acid crystal structures from the fast, cold compression of pristine clathrate hydrate samples. The two distinct polymorphs we obtained, differing in the water content, have been deeply characterised via spectroscopic and structural techniques to assess their composition and their astonishing pressure stability, checked up to half a megabar, also highlighting the complex correlations between them so to compile a detailed phase diagram of this system. These results may have a profound impact on the prediction and modelisation of the complex chemistry which characterises many icy bodies of our Solar System.

         <title>Catalytic Ring Expanding Difluorination: An Enantioselective Platform to Access &#946;,&#946;&#8208;Difluorinated Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An I(I)/I(III)&#8208;catalysed ring expanding fluorination of cyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters has been developed to generate gem&#8208;difluorinated 6&#8211;10 membered rings (up to 95&#8201;%). Validation of an enantiodivergent variant is also disclosed using a chiral C2&#8208;symmetric resorcinol catalyst (up to 7&#8201;:&#8201;93&#8197;e.r.) and X&#8208;ray analyses of selected products reveals the subtle impact of difluorination on widening the internal &#8736;CCC angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C).







Abstract
Cyclic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;carbonyl compounds have a venerable history as drug discovery leads, but limitations in the synthesis arsenal continue to impede chemical space exploration. This challenge is particularly acute in the arena of fluorinated medium rings where installing the difluoromethylene unit subtly alters the ring conformation by expanding the internal angle (&#8736;C&#8722;CF2&#8722;C&gt;&#8736;C&#8722;CH2&#8722;C): this provides a handle to modulate physicochemistry (e.g. pKa). To reconcile this disparity, a highly modular ring expansion has been devised that leverages simple &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters and amides, and processes them to one&#8208;carbon homologated rings with concomitant geminal difluorination (6 to 10 membered rings, up to 95&#8201;% yield). This process is a rare example of the formal difluorination of an internal alkene and is enabled by sequential I(III)&#8208;enabled O&#8208;activation. Validation of enantioselective catalysis in the generation of unprecedented medium ring scaffolds is reported (up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7&#8197;e.r.) together with X&#8208;ray structural analyses and product derivatization.

         <title>Upcycling of Carbon Fiber/Thermoset Composites into High&#8208;Performance Elastomers and Repurposed Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites (CFRCs) are fabricated through complexation of aromatic pinacol&#8208;crosslinked polyurethane thermosets with CF cloths. Upon heating CFRCs in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, polyurethane thermosets are cleaved into linear polymers, which generates non&#8208;destructive CF cloths and value&#8208;added healable and reprocessable elastomers with high mechanical strength and damage resistance.







Abstract
Recycling of carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer composites (CFRCs) based on thermosetting plastics is difficult. In the present study, high&#8208;performance CFRCs are fabricated through complexation of aromatic pinacol&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polyurethane (PU&#8722;AP) thermosets with carbon fiber (CF) cloths. PU&#8722;AP thermosets exhibit a breaking strength of 95.5&#8197;MPa and toughness of 473.6&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 and contain abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding groups, which can have strong adhesion with CFs. Because of the high interfacial adhesion between CF cloths and PU&#8722;AP thermosets and high toughness of PU&#8722;AP thermosets, CF/PU&#8722;AP composites possess a high tensile strength of &gt;870&#8197;MPa. Upon heating in N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at 100&#8201;&#176;C, the aromatic pinacols in the CF/PU&#8722;AP composites can be cleaved, generating non&#8208;destructive CF cloths and linear polymers that can be converted to high&#8208;performance elastomers. The elastomers are mechanically robust, healable, reprocessable, and damage&#8208;resistant with an extremely high tensile strength of 74.2&#8197;MPa and fracture energy of 149.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2. As a result, dissociation of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites enables the recovery of reusable CF cloths and high&#8208;performance elastomers, thus realizing the upcycling of CF/PU&#8722;AP composites.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Catalyzes Oxidative Coupling Formation of Insecticidal Dimeric Indole Piperazine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fungal cytochrome P450 (CpsD) and its associated cps cluster were discovered from 37208 CYP450s by genome mining. CpsD catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to give a group of unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight&#8208;ring&#8208;scaffold heterodimeric compounds through the formation of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds. Dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the pest Galleria mellonella.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling is an efficient strategy for using simple building blocks to construct complex structural scaffolds of natural products. Among them, heterodimeric coupling between two different monomers is relatively scarce, and the corresponding CYP450s are largely undiscovered. In this study, we discovered a fungal CYP450 (CpsD) and its associated cps cluster from 37208 CYP450s of Pfam PF00067 family member database and subsequently identified a group of new skeleton indole piperazine alkaloids (campesines A&#8722;G) by combination of genome mining and heterologous synthesis. Importantly, CYP450 CpsD mainly catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to generate an unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight&#8208;ring scaffold through the formation of one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;N bonds, illuminating its first dimerase role in this family of natural products. The proposed catalytic mechanism of CpsD was deeply investigated by diversified substrate derivatization. Moreover, dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the global honeybee pest Galleria mellonella. Our study shows a representative example of discovering new skeleton monomeric and dimeric indole piperazine alkaloids from microbial resources, expands our knowledge of bond formation by CYP450s and supports further development of the newly discovered and engineered campesine family compounds as potential biopesticides.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Supporting Atomic Bi&#8722;N2O2 Sites for High&#8208;Efficiency Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation effect and interlayer coordination of Bi3+ ions result in an oriented variation of the exposed crystal plane and the slight lattice strain of the original hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework, forming a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework for high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Single atomic catalysts (SACs) offer a superior platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to obtain well&#8208;defined and novel site configuration owing to the uncertainty of functional framework&#8208;derived SACs through calcination. Herein, a novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) is reported directly for CO2RR. In flow cell, the target catalyst Bi1&#8208;HOF maintains a faradaic efficiency (FE) HCOOH of over 90&#8201;% at a wide potential window of 1.4&#8197;V. The corresponding partial current density ranges from 113.3 to 747.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. And, Bi1&#8208;HOF exhibits a long&#8208;term stability of over 30&#8197;h under a successive potential&#8208;step test with a current density of 100&#8211;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Density function theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the novel Bi&#8722;N2O2 site supported on the (1&#8201;1&#8201;0) plane of HOF effectively induces the oriented electron transfer from Bi center to CO2 molecule, reaching an enhanced CO2 activation and reduction. Besides, this study offers a versatile method to reach series of M&#8722;N2O2 sites with regulable metal centers via the same intercalation mechanism, broadening the platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during CO2RR.

         <title>Robust Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts for H2O2 Production: Linkage Position Matters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>

The linkage position matters: Changing para&#8208; to ortho&#8208;position linkage in covalent organic framework photocatalysts results in a high hydrogen peroxide rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 in water without sacrificial reagents, and significantly improved long&#8208;term continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance from about 6 to 48&#8197;h.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis. However, the nature of organic polymers makes the balance between high activity and stability challenging. We demonstrate that the linkage position matters in the design of robust COF photocatalysts with durable high activity without sacrificial reagents. COFs with ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;linkages (o&#8208;COFs and p&#8208;COFs) were constructed by 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol with benzene&#8208;, pyridine&#8208;, pyrazine&#8208;orthodiamines and paradiamines. The pyrzaine&#8208;containing o&#8208;COFs with two pyridinic nitrogen atoms exhibited a H2O2 production rate of 4396&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 together with long&#8208;time continuous H2O2 photosynthesis performance in pure water (48&#8197;h), superior to the corresponding p&#8208;COFs. A four&#8208;step reaction mechanism is proposed by density function calculations. Moreover, the active sites and origin of stability enhancement for o&#8208;COFs are clarified. This work provides a simple and effective molecular design strategy in the design of robust COF photocatalysts for artificial H2O2 photosynthesis.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorption/Fluorescence of D&#8211;A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers Composed of Strong Electron Acceptors Based on Boron&#8208;Fused Azobenzene Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Novel strong electron&#8208;accepting units for providing second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence with donor&#8211;acceptor polymers are presented. Introducing trifluoromethyl group to boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes improves both their electron&#8208;accepting ability and solubility. Owing to their bulky structures and excellent light&#8208;absorption ability, bright NIR&#8208;II fluorescence is observed from polymer solutions, films, and nanoparticles.







Abstract
Luminescence in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1,000&#8211;1,700&#8197;nm) window is beneficial especially for deep tissue imaging and optical sensors because of intrinsic high permeability through various media. Strong electron&#8208;acceptors with low&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are a crucial unit for donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (CPs) with the NIR&#8208;II emission property, however, limited kinds of molecular skeletons are still available. Herein, D&#8211;A CPs involving fluorinated boron&#8208;fused azobenzene complexes (BAz) with enhanced electron&#8208;accepting properties are reported. Combination of fluorination at the azobenzene ligand and trifluoromethylation at the boron can effectively lower the LUMO energy level down to &#8722;4.42&#8197;eV, which is much lower than those of conventional strong electron&#8208;acceptors. The synthesized series of CPs showed excellent absorption/fluorescence property in solution over a wide NIR range including NIR&#8208;II. Furthermore, owing to the inherent solid&#8208;state emissive property of the BAz skeleton, obvious NIR&#8208;II fluorescence from the film (up to &#955;FL=1213&#8197;nm) and the nanoparticle in water (&#955;FL=1036&#8197;nm, brightness=up to 29&#8197;cm&#8722;1&#8201;M&#8722;1) were observed, proposing that our materials are applicable for developing next&#8208;generation of NIR&#8208;II luminescent materials.

         <title>Mechanically Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Liquid Crystal&#8208;Templated Chiral Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal&#8208;templated chiral perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with mechanically tunable circularly polarized luminance (CPL) were fabricated by in situ chemical cross&#8208;linking of judiciously designed polymerizable CsPbX3 PQD nanomonomers into cholesteric elastic networks. This work can pave an avenue for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in dynamic information encryption, flexible 3D displays, and beyond.







Abstract
Endowing perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) offers great promise for innovative chiroptical applications, but the existing strategies are inefficient in acquiring stimuli&#8208;responsive flexible chiral perovskite films with large, tunable dissymmetry factor (glum) and long&#8208;term stability. Here, we report a strategy for the design and synthesis of luminescent cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (Lumin&#8208;CLCE) films with mechanically tunable CPL, which is enabled by liquid crystal&#8208;templated chiral self&#8208;assembly and in situ covalent cross&#8208;linking of judiciously designed photopolymerizable CsPbX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) PQD nanomonomers into the elastic polymer networks. The resulting Lumin&#8208;CLCE films showcase circularly polarized structural color in natural light and noticeable CPL with a maximum glum value of up to 1.5 under UV light. The manipulation of CPL intensity and rotation direction is achieved by controlling the self&#8208;assembled helicoidal nanostructure and the handedness of soft helices. A significant breakthrough lies in the achievement of a reversible, mechanically tunable perovskite&#8208;based CPL switch activated by biaxial stretching, which enables flexible, dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels capable of decrypting preset information in specific polarization states. This work can provide new insights for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in information encryption, flexible 3D displays, and beyond.

&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) and long-term stability. Here, we report a strategy for the design and synthesis of luminescent cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (Lumin-CLCE) films with mechanically tunable CPL, which is enabled by liquid crystal-templated chiral self-assembly and in situ covalent cross-linking of judiciously designed photopolymerizable CsPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (X=Cl, Br, I) PQD nanomonomers into the elastic polymer networks. The resulting Lumin-CLCE films showcase circularly polarized structural color in natural light and noticeable CPL with a maximum &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; value of up to 1.5 under UV light. The manipulation of CPL intensity and rotation direction is achieved by controlling the self-assembled helicoidal nanostructure and the handedness of soft helices. A significant breakthrough lies in the achievement of a reversible, mechanically tunable perovskite-based CPL switch activated by biaxial stretching, which enables flexible, dynamic anti-counterfeiting labels capable of decrypting preset information in specific polarization states. This work can provide new insights for the development of advanced chiral perovskite materials and their emerging applications in information encryption, flexible 3D displays, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Stereo&#8208;Selective Isomerization of Borylated 1,3&#8208;Dienes Enabled by Selective Energy Transfer Catalysis</title>

         <dc:description>
Sorbic acid&#8208;based C5 units are ubiquitous in natural products. To complement biosynthesis algorithms, a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective isomerization of &#946;&#8208;boryl&#8208;substituted dienes has been achieved by selective energy transfer catalysis (E&#8201;:&#8201;Z up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). Application of the method in stereospecific [4+2] and [2+2] cycloaddition processes is also disclosed to generate cyclic products with four contiguous stereocenters.







Abstract
Configurationally&#8208;defined dienes are pervasive across the bioactive natural product spectrum, where they typically manifest themselves as sorbic acid&#8208;based fragments. These C5 motifs reflect the biosynthesis algorithms that facilitate their construction. To complement established biosynthetic paradigms, a chemical platform to facilitate the construction of stereochemically defined, functionalizable dienes by light&#8208;enabled isomerization has been devised. Enabled by selective energy transfer catalysis, a variety of substituted &#946;&#8208;boryl sorbic acid derivatives can be isomerized in a regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective manner (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3). Directionality is guided by a stabilizing nO&#8594;pB interaction in the product: this constitutes a formal anti&#8208;hydroboration of the starting alkyne. This operationally simple reaction employs low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) and is complete in 1&#8197;h. X&#8208;ray analysis supports the hypothesis that the nO&#8594;pB interaction leads to chromophore bifurcation: this provides a structural foundation for selective energy transfer.

         <title>Regulated Dual Defects of Bridging Organic and Terminal Inorganic Ligands in Iron&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nodes for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regulated dual defects of bridging organic ligands and terminal ligands of hydroxyls (OH&#8722;) and H2O induce the formation of exposed coordinatively unsaturated Fe centers as active sites in a Fe&#8208;based MOF catalyst, resulting in the efficient activation of inert N2 molecules and thus the enhanced photocatalytic NH3 production.







Abstract
Engineering advantageous defects to construct well&#8208;defined active sites in catalysts is promising but challenging to achieve efficient photocatalytic NH3 synthesis from N2 and H2O due to the chemical inertness of N2 molecule. Here, we report defective Fe&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) photocatalysts via a non&#8208;thermal plasma&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy, where their NH3 production capability is synergistically regulated by two types of defects, namely, bridging organic ligands and terminal inorganic ligands (OH&#8722; and H2O). Specially, the optimized MIL&#8208;100(Fe) catalysts, where there are only terminal inorganic ligand defects and coexistence of dual defects, exhibit the respective 1.7&#8208; and 7.7&#8208;fold activity enhancement comparable to the pristine catalyst under visible light irradiation. As revealed by experimental and theoretical calculation results, the dual defects in the catalyst induce the formation of abundant and highly accessible coordinatively unsaturated Fe active sites and synergistically optimize their geometric and electronic structures, which favors the injection of more d&#8208;orbital electrons in Fe sites into the N2 &#960;* antibonding orbital to achieve N2 activation and the formation of a key intermediate *NNH in the reaction. This work provides a guidance on the rational design and accurate construction of porous catalysts with precise defective structures for high&#8208;performance activation of catalytic molecules.

         <title>Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with Approaching 20&#8201;% Efficiency and Improved Photostability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed organic solar cells with approaching 20% efficiency and improved photostability were fabricated by incorporating a new trimeric guest acceptor named Tri&#8208;V into PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X binary blend, wherein Tri&#8208;V can effectively restrict the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X, thus leading to favorable phase&#8208;separation morphology and desirable molecular packing.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) processed from non&#8208;halogenated solvents is crucially important for their scale&#8208;up industry production. However, owing to the difficulty of regulating molecular aggregation, there is a huge efficiency gap between non&#8208;halogenated and halogenated solvent processed OSCs. Herein, we fabricate o&#8208;xylene processed OSCs with approaching 20&#8201;% efficiency by incorporating a trimeric guest acceptor named Tri&#8208;V into the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X host blend. The incorporation of Tri&#8208;V effectively restricts the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X, regulates the molecular packing and optimizes the phase&#8208;separation morphology, which leads to mitigated trap density states, reduced energy loss and suppressed charge recombination. Consequently, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X:Tri&#8208;V&#8208;based device achieves an efficiency of 19.82&#8201;%, representing the highest efficiency for non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processed OSCs reported to date. Noticeably, with the addition of Tri&#8208;V, the ternary device shows an improved photostability than binary PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X&#8208;based device, and maintains 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after continuous illumination for 1380&#8197;h. This work provides a feasible approach for fabricating high&#8208;efficiency, stable, eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, and sheds new light on the large&#8208;scale industrial production of OSCs.

Detailed electronic structure analysis of the global minimum geometry of In4H+ cluster having a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen atom reveal that the proposal by Huo et&#8197;al. having multi&#8208;reference character is over ambiguous.







Abstract
Recently, Huo et&#8197;al. has commented on our communication (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312, DOI: 10.1002/anie.202317312), regarding the multireference character (MRC) of our proposed cluster. Their argument is based on small HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, fractional occupation density (FOD) and CASPT2(12,13) calculations. They also proposed that the singlet planar In4H+ cluster cannot be observed. We present our calculations which reveals that some of their arguments are based on wrong interpretation of data and inadequate use of methodology. While we certainly agree with the strong physical ground of FOD, CASSF and CASPT2 methodology, we believe that such analysis for clusters is not adequate.

Multi&#8208;configurational second&#8208;order perturbation theory calculations revealed that the low&#8208;lying isomers of In4H+ reported by Kalita et&#8197;al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312) all showed the obvious multi&#8208;reference characters and the desired D4h isomer with a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH) was only the fifth lowest isomer, which was 5.05&#8197;kcal/mol higher than the global minimum in C4v symmetry and having a quasi&#8208;ptH, so the perfect ptH cannot be observed in In4H+ system.







Abstract
In a recent communication (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2024, 63, e202317312), Kalita et&#8197;al. studied In4H+ system within the frame of single&#8208;reference approximation (SRA) and found that the global energy minimum (1&#8201;a) adopted the singlet state and a planar tetracoordinate hydrogen (ptH), while the second lowest isomer (1&#8201;b) located 3.0&#8197;kcal/mol above 1&#8201;a and adopted the triplet state as well as non&#8208;planar structure with a quasi&#8208;ptH. They assessed the reliability of SRA by checking the T1&#8208;diagnostic values of coupled cluster calculations. However, according to our multi&#8208;configurational second&#8208;order perturbation theory calculations at the CASPT2(12,13)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVQZ (aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVQZ&#8208;PP for In) level, both 1&#8201;a and 1&#8201;b exhibit obvious multi&#8208;referential characters, as reflected by their largest reference coefficients of 0.928 (86.1&#8201;%) and 0.938 (88.0&#8201;%), respectively. Moreover, 1&#8201;b is 5.05&#8197;kcal/mol lower than 1&#8201;a at this level, that is, what can be observed in In4H+ system is the quasi&#8208;ptH.

CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems are activated by the formation of a ribonucleoprotein and its binding to the target nucleic acid sequence. Both binding processes are important for the overall performance. In their Communication (e202404069) Hongquan Zhang, X.&#8197;Chris Le et&#8197;al. describe a new method to study the binding kinetics and report the rate constants (kon and koff) and dissociation constant (Kd) for the activation of Cas13a by its RNA target. The method can unravel and quantify the kinetics of activation and enzymatic cleavage in a dynamic system. Artwork created by Jeffrey Tao.

A bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) strategy opens a new window to develop essential enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical products. In their Communication (e202402886), Weiwei Tang et&#8197;al. report a novel crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization method using BCA that demonstrates the dual functions of cocrystallization and catalytic racemization. This BCA strategy could address the incompatibility between cocrystallization and racemization reaction conditions.

In&#8208;silico screening of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is reported by Kazuhiro&#8197;J. Fujimoto, Takeshi Yanai, Shigehiro Yamaguchi et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202403829). Using a two&#8208;boron&#8208;doping/two&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fusion strategy anchored on the perylene scaffold, comprehensive structure generation followed by DFT calculations produces promising candidates. The validity of this approach is underscored by the experimental synthesis of dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene, showcasing intense NIR&#8208;emission.

         <title>Towards More Sustainable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) generally display high safety and environmental friendliness. However, their large&#8208;scale applications will generate huge amounts of depleted batteries, leading to environmental concern and resource waste. Therefore, the sustainability of AZIBs have to highly considered. This minireview aims to make AZIBs more sustainable from the focus on material design and their recycling techniques, including active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes, and aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as the promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their high safety, low cost and environmental benignity. The large&#8208;scale applications of AZIBs will inevitably result in a large amount of spent AZIBs, which not only induce the waste of resources, but also pose environmental risks. Therefore, sustainable AZIBs have to be considered to minimize the risk of environmental pollution and maximize the utilization of spent compounds. Herein, this minireview focuses on the sustainability of AZIBs from material design and recycling techniques. The structure and degradation mechanism of AZIBs are discussed to guide the recycling design of the materials. Subsequently, the sustainability of component materials in AZIBs is further analysed to pre&#8208;evaluate their recycling behaviors and mentor the selection of more sustainable component materials, including active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes, and aqueous electrolytes, respectively. According to the features of component materials, corresponding green and economic approaches are further proposed to realize the recycling of active materials in cathodes, Zn anodes and electrolytes, respectively. These advanced technologies endow the recycling of component materials with high efficiency and a closed&#8208;loop control, ensuring that AZIBs will be the promising candidates of sustainable energy storage devices. This review will offer insight into potential future directions in the design of sustainable AZIBs.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks in Adsorption and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discussed the fields of catalysis and adsorption for ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs), highlighting the relationship between ionic structures and properties. The insights into the future development of design strategies and applications based on ionic COFs are also offered.







Abstract
The ion extraction and electro/photo catalysis are promising methods to address environmental and energy issues. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a class of promising template to construct absorbents and catalysts because of their stable frameworks, high surface areas, controllable pore environments, and well&#8208;defined catalytic sites. Among them, ionic COFs as unique class of crystalline porous materials, with charges in the frameworks or along the pore walls, have shown different properties and resulting performance in these applications with those from charge&#8208;neutral COFs. In this review, current research progress based on the ionic COFs for ion extraction and energy conversion, including cationic/anionic materials and electro/photo catalysis is reviewed in terms of the synthesis strategy, modification methods, mechanisms of adsorption and catalysis, as well as applications. Finally, we demonstrated the current challenges and future development of ionic COFs in design strategies and applications.

This perspective aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application to enable bottlebrush physics to be more approachable.







Abstract
Bottlebrush networks (BBNs) are an exciting new class of materials with interesting physical properties derived from their unique architecture. While great strides have been made in our fundamental understanding of bottlebrush polymers and networks, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary for the field to accelerate advancements. This review aims to act as a primer to BBN chemistry and physics for both new and current members of the community. In addition to providing an overview of contemporary BBN synthetic methods, we developed a workflow and desktop application (LengthScale), enabling bottlebrush physics to be more approachable. We conclude by addressing several topical issues and asking a series of pointed questions to stimulate conversation within the community.

         <dc:description>
Recent developments in the field of chemical RNA synthesis are discussed, starting with protection concepts, followed by selected nucleoside modifications that are challenging to incorporate into RNA. Comments on the chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs, the enzymatic ligation of synthetic RNA, and RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modifications using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functional groups complete this minireview.







Abstract
Ribonucleic acids (RNAs) play a vital role in living organisms. Many of their cellular functions depend critically on chemical modification. Methods to modify RNA in a controlled manner&#8212;both in vitro and in vivo&#8212;are thus essential to evaluate and understand RNA biology at the molecular and mechanistic levels. The diversity of modifications, combined with the size and uniformity of RNA (made up of only 4 nucleotides) makes its site&#8208;specific modification a challenging task that needs to be addressed by complementary approaches. One such approach is solid&#8208;phase RNA synthesis. We discuss recent developments in this field, starting with new protection concepts in the ongoing effort to overcome current size limitations. We continue with selected modifications that have posed significant challenges for their incorporation into RNA. These include deazapurine bases required for atomic mutagenesis to elucidate mechanistic aspects of catalytic RNAs, and RNA containing xanthosine, N4&#8208;acetylcytidine, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylcytidine, 3&#8208;methylcytidine, 2&#8242;&#8208;OCF3, and 2&#8242;&#8208;N3 ribose modifications. We also discuss the all&#8208;chemical synthesis of 5&#8242;&#8208;capped mRNAs and the enzymatic ligation of chemically synthesized oligoribonucleotides to obtain long RNA with multiple distinct modifications, such as those needed for single&#8208;molecule FRET studies. Finally, we highlight promising developments in RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA modification using cofactors that transfer bioorthogonal functionalities.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of 14N Nuclei</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperpolarization of quadrupolar 14N nuclei was demonstrated for the first time. This was achieved using pairwise addition of parahydrogen to tetraalkylammonium salts with vinyl or allyl moieties followed by polarization transfer from 1H to 14N nuclei using PH&#8208;INEPT pulse sequence. After optimization of interpulse delays by both simulations and experiments, up to 760&#8208;fold signal enhancement at 7&#8197;T was obtained.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization techniques provide a dramatic increase in sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. In spite of the outstanding progress in solution&#8208;state hyperpolarization of spin&#8208;1/2 nuclei, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar nuclei remains challenging. Here, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar 14N nuclei with natural isotopic abundance of &gt;99&#8201;% is demonstrated. This is achieved via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to tetraalkylammonium salts with vinyl or allyl unsaturated moieties followed by a subsequent polarization transfer from 1H to 14N nuclei at high magnetic field using PH&#8208;INEPT or PH&#8208;INEPT+ radiofrequency pulse sequence.

The performance of PH&#8208;INEPT and PH&#8208;INEPT+ pulse sequences was optimized with respect to interpulse delays, and the resultant experimental dependences were in good agreement with simulations.

     alt="Parahydrogen-Induced Polarization of 14N Nuclei"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarization of quadrupolar &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclei was demonstrated for the first time. This was achieved using pairwise addition of parahydrogen to tetraalkylammonium salts with vinyl or allyl moieties followed by polarization transfer from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H to &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclei using PH-INEPT pulse sequence. After optimization of interpulse delays by both simulations and experiments, up to 760-fold signal enhancement at 7&#8197;T was obtained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarization techniques provide a dramatic increase in sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. In spite of the outstanding progress in solution-state hyperpolarization of spin-1/2 nuclei, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar nuclei remains challenging. Here, hyperpolarization of quadrupolar &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclei with natural isotopic abundance of &amp;gt;99&#8201;% is demonstrated. This is achieved via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to tetraalkylammonium salts with vinyl or allyl unsaturated moieties followed by a subsequent polarization transfer from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H to &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N nuclei at high magnetic field using PH-INEPT or PH-INEPT+ radiofrequency pulse sequence. Catalyst screening identified water-soluble rhodium complex [Rh(P(&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Na)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl] as the most efficient catalyst for hyperpolarization of the substrates under study, providing up to 1.3&#8201;% and up to 6.6&#8201;% &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H polarization in the cases of vinyl and allyl precursors, respectively. The performance of PH-INEPT and PH-INEPT+ pulse sequences was optimized with respect to interpulse delays, and the resultant experimental dependences were in good agreement with simulations.

         <title>Bifunctional Chiral Agent Enables One&#8208;pot Spontaneous Deracemization of Racemic Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization method using a bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) was developed. The BCA helps achieve the dual functions of catalytic racemization and cocrystallization with the resulting enantiomers (see picture). This method was successfully implemented for the deracemization of chiral drugs containing one or multiple stereocenters, thus extending current strategies to the enantioseparation of racemic compounds.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot deracemization method using a bifunctional chiral agent (BCA) is proposed for the first time to convert a racemate to the desired enantiomer. Specifically, chiral &#945;, (&#945;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidinemethanol) formed enantiospecific cocrystals with racemic dihydromyricetin, and used its own alkaline catalysis to catalyze the racemization between the (2R,3R)&#8208;enantiomer and (2S,3S)&#8208;enantiomer in solution, achieving a one&#8208;pot spontaneous deracemization. This strategy was also successfully extended to the deracemization of three other racemic compound drugs: (R,S)&#8208;carprofen, (R,S)&#8208;indoprofen, and (R,S)&#8208;indobufen. The one&#8208;pot deracemization method based on the BCA strategy provides a feasible approach to address the incompatibility between cocrystallization and racemization reactions that are commonly encountered in the cocrystallization&#8208;induced deracemization process and opens a new window to develop essential enantiomerically pure pharmaceutical products with atom economy.

         <title>Na2C3O2: The First Crystalline Compound with the Elusive &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double deprotonation of propiolic acid yielded the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; anion, which coordinates to the sodium cation in crystalline Na2C3O2 both via its carboxylate group and via its acetylide unit in a Janus&#8208;faced manner.







Abstract
By reaction of sodium electride or NaC2H with the anhydrous sodium salt of propiolic acid, Na(OOC&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;H), in liquid ammonia crystalline powders of Na2C3O2 were obtained. The structure analysis based on synchrotron powder diffraction data revealed that Na2C3O2 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (I2/a, Z=4) exhibiting the elusive Y&#8208;shaped &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; anion, which is unprecedented in a crystalline compound up to now. IR/Raman and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic investigations with assignments supported by DFT&#8208;based ab initio calculations confirm this finding. Reaction with sodium electride led to a higher crystallinity of the product, but additionally a by&#8208;product apparently due to decomposition and polymerization of Na2C3O2 was formed. No such by&#8208;product was observed in the reaction with NaC2H, which turned out to be a milder metalation route. However, the product of the latter reaction is less crystalline.

Time&#8208;resolved tandem catalysis: Palladium catalyzes the regioselective Heck reaction between A and B, while triflic acid mediates the skeleton rearrangement of the resulting Heck products D to dihydrofurans C.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols, the reactivity of 3&#8208;vinylazetidin&#8208;3&#8208;ols 1 and 3&#8208;vinyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;ols 2 under transition metal catalysis remains largely unexplored. We report herein their unique reactivity under dual palladium and acid catalysis. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2(PPh3)2, AgTFA and triflic acid, the reaction of 1 or 2 with aryl iodides affords 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydrofurans, which are valuable heterocycles in organic synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that this arylative ring&#8208;expansion reaction proceeds via a domino process involving Heck arylation of alkene, acid&#8208;catalyzed transposition of allylic alcohol and ring opening of the azetidine/oxetane by an internal hydroxyl group.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Allylation of Indoles with gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective allylation of indoles with gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes is developed under rhodium catalysis. The reaction shows exceptional branched regioselectivity and excellent enantioselectivity with a bulky ligand, which provides an efficient route to enantioenriched C2 and C3 fluoroallylated indoles with wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.







Abstract
The use of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) as fluoroallyl surrogates under transition&#8208;metal catalysis has drawn considerable attention recently but such reactions are restricted to producing achiral or racemic mono&#8208;fluoroalkenes. Herein, we report the first enantioselective allylation of indoles under rhodium catalysis with gem&#8208;DFCPs. This reaction shows exceptional branched regioselectivity towards rhodium catalysis with gem&#8208;DFCPs, which provides an efficient route to enantioenriched fluoroallylated indoles with wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.

&lt;p&gt;The use of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluorinated cyclopropanes (&lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-DFCPs) as fluoroallyl surrogates under transition-metal catalysis has drawn considerable attention recently but such reactions are restricted to producing achiral or racemic mono-fluoroalkenes. Herein, we report the first enantioselective allylation of indoles under rhodium catalysis with &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-DFCPs. This reaction shows exceptional branched regioselectivity towards rhodium catalysis with &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-DFCPs, which provides an efficient route to enantioenriched fluoroallylated indoles with wide substrate scope and good functional group tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoactivated Circularly Polarized Luminescent Organic Radicals in Doped Amorphous Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivated CPL radicals are developed by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system. The photoactivated luminescent radicals display a robust quantum yield of 57.8% and the dissymmetry factor of 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2. As a result, information displays, flexible objects and anti&#8208;counterfeiting are successfully prepared.







Abstract
Luminescent organic radicals, especially those with photoactivated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) features, hold great significance for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic applications, but their development still remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to achieve photoactivated CPL radicals by bonding two phosphine centers within an axial chiral system, yielding a compound of R/S&#8208;5,5&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bibenzo[d][1,3]dioxole (R/S&#8208;BDP). The photoactivated R/S&#8208;BDP molecules in polymer matrix display a robust quantum yield of 19.8&#8201;% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;4, marking this work as the first example of photoactivated CPL radicals. Furthermore, the glum is improved to 1.0&#215;10&#8722;2 by using a liquid crystal as host. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that R/S&#8208;BDP molecules, endowed with double phosphine cores in axial chirality, offer a direct way for intramolecular electron transfer upon photoirradiation. This leads to the generation of radical ionic pairs, which subsequently trigger the donor&#8208;acceptor arrangement through intermolecular electron transfer, thereby resulting in stable radical emission. The extended photoactivated BDP&#8208;F exhibits a remarkably high quantum efficiency of 57.8%. Ultimately, the distinctive photo&#8208;responsive CPL radical luminescence has been successfully used for information displays and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Constructing &#960;&#8211;&#960; Superposition Effect of Tetralithium Naphthalenetetracarboxylate with Electron Delocalization for Robust Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conductive network composites i.e. carbon nanotubes interwoven tetralithium 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylate achieve great lithium&#8208;ion storage performance due to the multiple conjugated carboxyls, great electron delocalization in naphthalene and extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect from the interface.







Abstract
Organics are gaining significance as electrode materials due to their merits of multi&#8208;electron reaction sites, flexible rearrangeable structures and redox reversibility. However, organics encounter finite electronic conductivity and inferior durability especially in organic electrolytes. To circumvent above barriers, we propose a novel design strategy, constructing conductive network structures with extended &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect by manipulating intermolecular interaction. Tetralithium 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylate (LNTC) interwoven by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) forms LNTC@CNTs composite firstly for Li&#8208;ion storage, where multiple conjugated carboxyls contribute sufficient Li&#8208;ion storage sites, the unique network feature enables electrolyte and charge mobility conveniently combining electron delocalization in &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, and the enhanced &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect between LNTC and CNTs endows laudable structural robustness. Accordingly, LNTC@CNTs maintain an excellent Li&#8208;ion storage capacity retention of 96.4&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles. Electrochemical experiments and theoretical simulations elucidate the fast reaction kinetics and reversible Li&#8208;ion storage stability owing to the electron delocalization and &#960;&#8211;&#960; superposition effect, while conjugated carboxyls are reversibly rearranged into enolates during charging/discharging. Consequently, a dual&#8208;ion battery combining this composite anode and expanded graphite cathode exhibits a peak specific capacity of 122&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long cycling life with a capacity retention of 84.2&#8201;% after 900&#8197;cycles.

         <title>In Silico Screening and Experimental Verification of Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Emissive Two&#8208;Boron&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in silico screening method based on a comprehensive structure generation followed by TD&#8208;DFT calculations was established for developing near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Using perylene as a scaffold, a two&#8208;boron&#8208;doping/two&#8208;thiophene&#8208;fusion strategy was applied to provide ca. 2500 possible structures. One of the promising candidates, extracted using several criteria, was synthesized and exhibited intense NIR&#8208;emission.







Abstract
Embedding two boron atoms into a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) leads to the formation of a neutral analogue that is isoelectronic to the corresponding dicationic PAH skeleton, which can significantly alter its electronic structure. Based on this concept, we explore herein the identification of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive PAHs with the aid of an in silico screening method. Using perylene as the PAH scaffold, we embedded two boron atoms and fused two thiophene rings to it. Based on this design concept, all possible structures (ca. 2500 entities) were generated using a comprehensive structure generator. Time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations were conducted on all these structures, and promising candidates were extracted based on the vertical excitation energy, transition dipole moment, and atomization energy per bond. One of the extracted dithieno&#8208;diboraperylene candidates was synthesized and indeed exhibited emission at 724&#8197;nm with a quantum yield of 0.40 in toluene, demonstrating the validity of this screening method. This modification was further applied to other PAHs, and a series of thienobora&#8208;modified PAHs was synthesized.

         <title>Final Stages in the Biosynthesis of the [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Active Site</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The final stages of the biosynthesis of the [FeFe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases are elucidated by a combination of organometallic synthesis and biophysical analysis. The complex [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; containing the unprecedented aminomethylthiolate ligand, allows maturation of HydA1 in the presence of HydF and the established cocktail of reagents and proteins. The same complex maturates HydA1 using a simplified protein&#8208;free recipe.







Abstract
The paper aims to elucidate the final stages in the biosynthesis of the [2Fe]H active site of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases. The recently hypothesized intermediate [Fe2(SCH2NH2)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722; ([1]2&#8722;) was prepared by a multistep route from [Fe2(S2)(CN)(CO)5]&#8722;. The following synthetic intermediates were characterized in order: [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CNBEt3)(CO)5]&#8722;, [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)&#8722;(CO)5]&#8722;, and [Fe2(SCH2NHFmoc)2(CN)2(CO)4]2&#8722;, where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). Derivatives of these anions include [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]+, PPh4+ and PPN+ salts as well as the 13CD2&#8208;isotopologues. These Fe2 species exist as a mixture of two isomers attributed to diequatorial (ee) and axial&#8208;equatorial (ae) stereochemistry at sulfur. In vitro experiments demonstrate that [1]2&#8722; maturates HydA1 in the presence of HydF and a cocktail of reagents. HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.

The following synthetic intermediates were characterized in order: [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHFmoc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CNBEt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHFmoc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&#8722;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NHFmoc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl). Derivatives of these anions include [K(18-crown-6)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and PPN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; salts as well as the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-isotopologues. These Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species exist as a mixture of two isomers attributed to diequatorial (ee) and axial-equatorial (ae) stereochemistry at sulfur. In vitro experiments demonstrate that [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; maturates HydA1 in the presence of HydF and a cocktail of reagents. HydA1 can also be maturated using a highly simplified cocktail, omitting HydF and other proteins. This result is consistent with HydA1 participating in the maturation process and refines the roles of HydF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes Fabricated on Flexible Polymer Supports for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand back diffusion&#8208;assisted bipolymer&#8208;directed metal ion distribution strategy gives metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes with areas over 2,400&#8197;cm2 and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8211;130&#8197;nm). Three spiral wound membrane modules with an area of 4,800&#8197;cm2 were prepared. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930&#8197;GPU for C3H6) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C3H6/C3H8).







Abstract
Ultrathin continuous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes have the potential to achieve high gas permeance and selectivity simultaneously for otherwise difficult gas separations, but with few exceptions for zeolitic&#8208;imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) membranes, current methods cannot conveniently realize practical large&#8208;area fabrication. Here, we propose a ligand back diffusion&#8208;assisted bipolymer&#8208;directed metal ion distribution strategy for preparing large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes on flexible polymeric support layers. The bipolymer directs metal ions to form a cross&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network with a uniform distribution of metal ions on support layers. Ligand back diffusion controls the feed of ligand molecules available for nuclei formation, resulting in the continuous growth of large&#8208;area ultrathin MOF membranes. We report the practical fabrication of three representative defect&#8208;free MOF membranes with areas larger than 2,400&#8197;cm2 and ultrathin selective layers (50&#8211;130&#8197;nm), including ZIFs and carboxylate&#8208;linker MOFs. Among these, the ZIF&#8208;8 membrane displays high gas permeance of 3,979&#8197;GPU for C3H6, with good mixed gas selectivity (43.88 for C3H6/C3H8). To illustrate its scale&#8208;up practicality, MOF membranes were prepared and incorporated into spiral&#8208;wound membrane modules with an active area of 4,800&#8197;cm2. The ZIF&#8208;8 membrane module presents high gas permeance (3,930&#8197;GPU for C3H6) with acceptable ideal gas selectivity (37.45 for C3H6/C3H8).

         <title>A Sensitive Technique Unravels the Kinetics of Activation and Trans&#8208;Cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method enables kinetic studies of the binding (kobs, kon, koff, and Kd) and trans&#8208;cleavage of CRISPR&#8208;Cas systems, which reveals that once the crRNA&#8208;Cas13a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is activated by its binding with the RNA activator, the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas13a is sustained over a broad temperature range (7&#8211;37&#8201;&#176;C). Cas13a at the ambient temperature is useful for transcriptomic and diagnostic applications.







Abstract
Activation of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system requires the formation of a crRNA&#8208;Cas13a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and the binding of an RNA activator to the RNP. These two binding processes play a crucial role in the performance of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a system. However, the binding kinetics remain poorly understood, and a main challenge is the lack of a sensitive method for real&#8208;time measurements of the dynamically formed active CRISPR&#8208;Cas13a enzyme. We describe here a new method to study the binding kinetics and report the rate constants (kon and koff) and dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding between Cas13a and its activator. The method is able to unravel and quantify the kinetics of binding and cleavage separately, on the basis of measuring the real&#8208;time trans&#8208;cleavage rates of the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system and obtaining the real&#8208;time concentrations of the active CRISPR&#8208;Cas ternary complex. We further discovered that once activated, the Cas13a system operates at a wide range of temperatures (7&#8211;37&#8201;&#176;C) with fast trans&#8208;cleavage kinetics. The new method and findings are important for diverse applications of the Cas13a system, such as the demonstrated quantification of microRNA at ambient temperatures (e.g., 25&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Stereodivergent Synthesis of Spiroaminals via Chiral Bifunctional Hydrogen Bonding Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals via chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance.







Abstract
Spiroaminals represent novel structural motifs prevalent in diverse natural products and biologically active molecules. Achieving their enantioselective synthesis is a highly desirable and challenging task in synthetic endeavors due to their intricate molecular frameworks. Herein, we accomplished the first stereodivergent construction of spiroaminals using chiral bifunctional organocatalyzed intramolecular 1,2&#8208;addition followed by an oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade in a high atom and step economical pathway. A proper modulation of the cinchona&#8208;derived squaramide catalysts efficiently provided access to all the possible stereoisomers with high yield, diastereoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity while displaying a broad substrate tolerance. Additionally, we validated the scalability of the reaction and demonstrated the synthesis of variable spiroaminal scaffolds, confirming the viability of our protocol.

         <dc:description>
For &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; &#945;, &#946;&#8208;conjugated lactone, 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (DPO), cyclopentadiene is used as the &#8220;chaperone&#8221; to assist the polymerization of the monomer via simple Diels&#8211;Alder reaction and its retro reaction. The exclusive presence of trans C=C double bond make the polymer PDPO exhibit enhanced thermal properties, with much higher Tm value and thermal stability than its structural anologue, PVL. Finally, the polymer PDPO undergoes ring&#8208;closing metathesis and recycles back to its original monomer, enabling the closed&#8208;loop circularity of &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; DPO.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of polymers to monomers presents a promising solution to the escalating crisis associated with plastic waste. Despite considerable progress made in this field, the primary efforts have been focused on redesigning new monomers to produce readily recyclable polymers. In contrast, limited research into the potential of seemingly &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; monomers has been conducted. Herein, we propose a paradigm that leverages a &#8220;chaperone&#8221;&#8208;assisted strategy to establish closed&#8208;loop circularity for a &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; &#945;, &#946;&#8208;conjugated lactone, 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (DPO). The resulting PDPO, a structural analogue of poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) (PVL), exhibits enhanced thermal properties with a melting point (Tm) of 114&#8201;&#176;C and a decomposition temperature (Td,5%) of 305&#8201;&#176;C. Notably, owing to the structural similarity between DPO and &#948;&#8208;VL, the copolymerization generates semi&#8208;crystalline P(DPO&#8208;co&#8208;VL)s irrespective of the DPO incorporation ratio. Intriguingly, the inherent C=C bonds in P(DPO&#8208;co&#8208;VL)s enable their convenient post&#8208;functionalization via Michael&#8208;addition reaction. Lastly, PDPO was demonstrated to be chemically recyclable via ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM), representing a significant step towards the pursuit of enabling the closed&#8208;loop circularity of &#8220;non&#8208;polymerizable&#8221; lactones without altering the ultimate polymer structure.

         <title>Stepwise Dissipative Control of Multimodal Motion in a Silver(I) Catenate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>

Not one, not two, not three, but four! Filling four receptor sites with Ag+ as chemical fuel is the key to the transient and successive self&#8208;assembly of two multicomponent devices. While the first device displays two nanomechanical movements (shuttling and sliding), the second exhibits a sliding motion at increased speed.







Abstract
Stepwise dissipative control of two distinct motions, i.e., shuttling and sliding, is demonstrated in a single multicomponent device. When [2]rotaxane 1, which acts as a biped, and deck 2 were treated with AgBF4/PhCH2Br+NEt3 as chemical fuel, the transient catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ was instantly generated showing multimodal motion and autonomous return to 1 and 2. In the dissipative process, catenate [Ag(1)]+&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ cleanly transformed into the follow&#8208;up transient device (1)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[Ag3(2)]3+ exhibiting only sliding motion. Two interference&#8208;free dissipative cycles proved the resilience and robustness of the process.

         <title>Dynamic Chalcogen Squares for Material and Topological Control over Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce and entirely new dynamic, non&#8208;covalent bonding interaction based on selenadiazole chalcogen squares which are capable of tuning bulk glass transition temperature, increase toughness, imbue self&#8208;healing abilities, and control hydrodynamic diameter of solvated macromolecular architectures. All of these properties can be accessed via a single selenadiazole containing molecule, easily and quickly incorporated into a broad array of polymer systems via Passerini and Biginelli multicomponent reactions.







Abstract
Herein we introduce chalcogen squares via selenadiazole motifs as a new class of dynamic supramolecular bonding interactions for the modification and control of soft matter materials. We showcase selenadiazole motifs in supramolecular networks of varying primary chain length prepared through polymerization using tandem step&#8208;growth/Passerini multicomponent reactions (MCRs). Compared to controls lacking the selenadiazole motif, these networks display increased glass transition temperatures and moduli due to the chalcogen bonding linkages formed between chains. These elastomeric networks were shown to autonomously heal at room temperature, retaining up to 83&#8201;% of the ultimate tensile strength. Lastly, we use post&#8208;polymerization modification via the Biginelli MCR to add selenadiazole motifs to narrowly dispersed polymers for controlled topology in solution. Chalcogen squares via selenadiazoles introduce an exciting exchange mechanism to the realm of dynamic materials.

         <title>Bis(Aluminyl)Magnesium: A Source of Nucleophilic or Radical Aluminium&#8208;Centred Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 22, May 27, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnesium bis(aluminyl) compound Mg[Al(NON)]2 reacts thermally with MeI via nucleophilic attack through Al, consistent with a formal description as an Al(I)&#8722;Mg(II)&#8722;Al(I) trimetallic species. Under photolytic activation, reaction with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene leads to the transannular cycloaddition products, consistent with radical chemistry, emphasizing the covalent nature of the Mg&#8722;Al bonds and a description as an Al(II)&#8722;Mg(0)&#8722;Al(II) synthon.







Abstract
The homoleptic magnesium bis(aluminyl) compound Mg[Al(NON)]2 (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene) can be accessed from K2[Al(NON)]2 and MgI2 and shown to possess a non&#8208;linear geometry (&#8736;Al&#8722;Mg&#8722;Al=164.8(1)&#176;) primarily due to the influence of dispersion interactions. This compound acts a four&#8208;electron reservoir in the reductive de&#8208;fluorination of SF6, and reacts thermally with polar substrates such as MeI via nucleophilic attack through aluminium, consistent with the QT&#8208;AIM charges calculated for the metal centres, and a formal description as a Al(I)&#8722;Mg(II)&#8722;Al(I) trimetallic. On the other hand, under photolytic activation, the reaction with 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene leads to the stereo&#8208;selective generation of transannular cycloaddition products consistent with radical based chemistry, emphasizing the covalent nature of the Mg&#8722;Al bonds and a description as a Al(II)&#8722;Mg(0)&#8722;Al(II) synthon. Consistently, photolysis of Mg[Al(NON)]2 in hexane in the absence of COD generates [Al(NON)]2 together with magnesium metal.

         <title>Bridged Pt&#8211;OH&#8211;Mn Mediator in N&#8208;coordinated Mn Single Atoms and Pt Nanoparticles for Electrochemical Biomolecule Oxidation and Discrimination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rational design of efficient catalysts for uric acid (UA) electrooxidation, as well as the establishment of structure&#8208;activity relationships, remains a critical bottleneck in the field of electrochemical sensing. To address these challenges, herein, a hybrid catalyst that integrates carbon&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Mn single atoms (PtNPs/MnNC) is developed. The metal&#8208;metal interaction during annealing affords the construction of metallic&#8208;bonded Pt&#8722;Mn pairs between PtNPs and Mn single atoms, facilitating the electron transfer from PtNPs to the support and thereby optimizing the electronic structure of catalysts. More importantly, experiments and theoretical calculations provide visual proof for the &#8216;incipient hydrous oxide adatom mediator&#8217; mechanism for UA oxidation. The Pt&#8722;Mn pairs first adsorb OH* to construct the bridged Pt&#8211;OH&#8211;Mn mediators to serve as a highly active intermediate for N&#8211;H bond dissociation and proton transfer. Benefiting from the unique electronic and geometric structure of the catalytic center and reactive intermediates, PtNPs/MnNC exhibits superior electrooxidation performance. The electrochemical sensor based on PtNPs/MnNC enables sensitive detection and discrimination of UA and dopamine in serum samples. This work offers new insights into the construction of novel electrocatalysis for sensitive sensing platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficiency Co&#8208;Production of Benzoquinone and H2 by Resourcing Waste Phenol in a Hybrid Alkali/Acid Flow Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In both the manufacturing and chemical industries, benzoquinone is a crucial chemical product. A perfect and economical method for making benzoquinone is the electrochemical oxidation of phenol, thanks to the traditional thermal catalytic oxidation of phenol process requires high cost, serious pollution and harsh reaction conditions.&#160;Here, a unique heterostructure electrocatalyst on nickel foam (NF) consisting of nickel sulfide and nickel oxide (Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF) was produced, and this catalyst exhibited a low overpotential (1.35 V vs. RHE) and prominent selectivity (99%) for electrochemical phenol oxidation reaction&#160;(EOP). Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF is beneficial for lowering the reaction energy barrier and boosting reactivity in the EOP process according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Additionally, an alkali/acid hybrid flow cell was successfully established by connecting Ni9S8&#8208;Ni15O16/NF and commercial RuIr/Ti in series to catalyze phenol oxidation&#160;in an alkaline medium&#160;and hydrogen evolution in an acid medium, respectively. A cell voltage of only 0.60 V was applied to produce a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Meanwhile, the system continued to operate at 0.90 V for 12 days, showing remarkable long&#8208;term stability. The unique configuration of the acid&#8208;base hybrid flow cell electrolyzer provides valuable guidance for the efficient and environmentally friendly electrooxidation of phenol to benzoquinone.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;DNA Carriers Co&#8208;Deliver Photosensitizer and siRNA for Light&#8208;Promoted Gene Transfection and Hypoxia&#8208;Relieved Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical internalization is an efficient strategy relying on photodynamic reactions to promote siRNA endosomal escape for the success of RNA&#8208;interference gene regulation, which makes gene&#8208;photodynamic combined therapy highly synergistic and efficient. However, it is still desired to explore capable carriers to improve the delivery efficiency of the immiscible siRNA and organic photosensitizers simultaneously. Herein, we employ a micellar nanostructure (PSNA) self&#8208;assembled from polymer&#8208;DNA molecular chimeras to fulfill this task. PSNA can plentifully load photosensitizers in its hydrophobic core simply by the nanoprecipitation method. Moreover, it can organize siRNA self&#8208;assembly by the densely packed DNA shell, which leads to a higher loading capacity than the typical electrostatic condensation method. The experimental results prove that this PSNA carrier can greatly facilitate siRNA escape from the endosome/lysosome and enhance transfection. Accordingly, the PSNA&#8208;administrated therapy exhibits a significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy owing to the highly efficient co&#8208;delivery capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Ordering Bimetallic Cu&#8208;Pd Catalysts onto Orderly Mesoporous SrTiO3&#8208;Crystal Nanotubular Networks for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photosynthesis of fuels has garnered significant attention, with SrTiO3 emerging as a potential candidate for photocatalysis due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. However, selectively converting CO2 into fuels with desired reaction products remains a grand challenge. Herein, we design an updated method via an aging strategy based on the electrospinning technique to synthesize a single&#8208;crystalline Al&#8208;doped SrTiO3 nanotubular networks with self&#8208;assembled orderly mesopores, further modified by Cu&#8208;Pd alloy. It exhibits both high crystallinity and superior cross&#8208;linked mesoporous structures, effectively facilitating charge carrier transfer, photon utilization, and mass transfer, with a remarkable enhancement from 0.025 mmol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;m&#8208;2 to 1.090 mmol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;m&#8208;2 in the CO production rate. Meanwhile, the ordered arrangement of Cu and Pd atoms on the (111) surface can promote the rate&#8208;determining step (*CO2 to *COOH), which is also responsible for its good activity. The presence of CuO in the reaction confers a significant advantage for CO desorption, leading to a remarkable CO selectivity of 95.54%. This work highlights new insights into developing advanced heterogeneous photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over 79% of 6.3 billion tonnes of plastics produced from 1950 to 2015 have been disposed in lanfills or found their way to the oceans, where they will reside for up to hundreds of years before being decomposed bringing upon significant dangers to our health and ecosystems. Plastic photoreforming offers an appealing alternative by using solar energy and water to transform plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemical commodities, while simultaneously producing green hydrogen via the hydrogen evolution reaction. This review aims to provide an overview of the underlying principles of emerging plastic photoreforming technologies, highlight the challenges associated with experimental protocols and performance assessments, discuss recent global breakthroughs on the photoreforming of plastics, and propose perspectives for future research. A critical assessment of current plastic photoreforming studies shows a&#160;lack of standardised conditions, hindering comparison amongst photocatalyst performance. Guidelines to establish a more accurate evaluation of materials and systems are proposed with the aim to facilitate the translation of promising fundamental discovery in photocatalysts design.</dc:description>

         <title>Breakthrough in CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level Enabled by Active Sites Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient production of value&#8208;added chemicals with high selectivity from CO2 electroreduction at industrial&#8208;level current density is highly demanded, yet remains a big challenge. In a recent issue of Angewandte Chemie, Han and colleagues have elegantly increased the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products to over 70% at amperes level (1.4 A cm&#8208;2) by engineering the active sites for the key reactions involved in the CO2 electroreduction. In this study, the highly dispersed Pd atoms have two unique functions: active sites for water dissociation and to induce the electron rearrangement of the surrounding Cu atoms to form new active sites for CO conversion, while the Cu far from Pd are the active sites for efficient CO2 conversion to CO, the synergistic functions of these three active sites result in high FE and yields of C2+ products at industrial&#8208;level current density. This research is a remarkable step forward in the methodology for developing efficient and durable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Low Volume Resuscitants for the Prehospital Care of Severe Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Globally, traumatic injury is a leading cause of suffering and death. The ability to curtail damage and ensure survival after major injury requires a time&#8208;sensitive response balancing organ perfusion, blood loss, and portability, underscoring the need for novel therapies for the prehospital environment. Currently, there are few options available for damage control resuscitation (DCR) of trauma victims. We hypothesize that synthetic polymers, which are tunable, portable, and stable under austere conditions, can be developed as effective injectable therapies for trauma medicine. In this work, we design injectable polymers for use as low volume resuscitants (LVRs). Using RAFT polymerization, we evaluate the effect of polymer size, architecture, and chemical composition upon both blood coagulation and resuscitation in a rat hemorrhagic shock model. Our therapy is evaluated against a clinically used colloid resuscitant, Hextend. We demonstrate that a radiant star poly(glycerol monomethacrylate) polymer did not interfere with coagulation while successfully correcting metabolic deficit and resuscitating animals from hemorrhagic shock to the desired mean arterial pressure range for DCR &#8211; correcting a 60% total blood volume (TBV) loss when given at only 10% TBV. This highly portable and non&#8208;coagulopathic resuscitant has profound potential for application in trauma medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Macrocyclization of Unprotected Peptides with an Ex Situ Gaseous Linchpin Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide cyclization has dramatic effects on a variety of important properties, enhancing metabolic stability, limiting conformational flexibility, and altering cellular entry and intracellular localization. The hydrophilic, polyfunctional nature of peptides creates chemoselectivity challenges in macrocyclization, especially for natural sequences without biorthogonal handles. Herein, we describe a gaseous sulfonyl chloride&#8208;derived reagent that achieves amine&#8211;amine, amine&#8211;phenol, and amine&#8211;aniline crosslinking via a minimalist linchpin strategy that affords macrocyclic urea or carbamate products. The cyclization reaction is metal&#8208;mediated, and involves a novel application of sulfine species that remains unexplored in aqueous or biological contexts. The aqueous method delivers unique cyclic or bicyclic topologies directly from a variety of natural bioactive peptides without the need for protecting&#8208;group strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Complex&#8208;Templated Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry for the Selection and Identification of Homo&#8208;PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry meets PROTAC screening: Stability of ternary complexes formed by PROTACs is shown to act as selection criterion in multi&#8208;protein templated dynamic combinatorial libraries. Reversible thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry allows rapid identification of novel VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs from complex library mixtures.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) leverages a reversible reaction to generate compound libraries from constituting building blocks under thermodynamic control. The position of this equilibrium can be biased by addition of a target macromolecule towards enrichment of bound ligands. While DCC has been applied to select ligands for a single target protein, its application to identifying chimeric molecules inducing proximity between two proteins is unprecedented. In this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we develop a DCC approach to select bifunctional proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) based on their ability to stabilize the ternary complex. We focus on VHL&#8208;targeting Homo&#8208;PROTACs as model system, and show that the formation of a VHL2&#8201;:&#8201;Homo&#8208;PROTAC ternary complex reversibly assembled using thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange chemistry leads to amplification of potent VHL Homo&#8208;PROTACs with degradation activities which correlated well with their biophysical ability to dimerize VHL. Ternary complex templated dynamic combinatorial libraries allowed identification of novel Homo&#8208;PROTAC degraders. We anticipate future applications of ternary&#8208;complex directed DCC to early PROTAC screenings and expansion to other proximity&#8208;inducing modalities beyond PROTACs.

         <title>Reversal of the Regioselectivity of Iron&#8208;Promoted Hydrogenation and Hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;Difluoroalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described an unprecedented iron&#8208;promoted hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes in reversed regioselectivity for the generation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation and halogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated, chlorodifluoromethylated, bromodifluoromethylate and iododifluoromethylated products respectively. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity.







Abstract
The reaction regioselectivity of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes is dependent on the intrinsic polarity. Thus, the reversal of the regioselectivity of the addition reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we described an unprecedented reversal of regioselectivity of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes triggered by Fe&#8722;H species for the formation of difluoroalkyl radicals. Hydrogenation of the in situ generated radicals gave difluoromethylated products. Mechanism experiments and theoretical studies revealed that the kinetic effect of the irreversible HAT process resulted in the reversal of the regioselectivity of this scenario, leading to the formation of a less stable &#945;&#8208;difluoroalkyl radical regioisomer. On basis of this new reaction of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene, the iron&#8208;promoted hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes for the efficient synthesis of aliphatic chlorodifluoromethyl&#8208;, bromodifluoromethyl&#8208; and iododifluoromethyl&#8208;containing compounds was developed. Particularly, this novel hydrohalogenation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes provided an effect and large&#8208;scale access to various iododifluoromethylated compounds of high value for synthetic application.

         <title>Probing Energy&#8208;Funneling Kinetics in Nanocrystal Sublattices for Superior X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4: Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystals were explored through precise microenvironment engineering within nanocrystal sublattices. The resulting tailorable radioluminescence afterglow enabled high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with an ultralong optical memory.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lasting radioluminescence scintillators have recently attracted substantial attention from both research and industrial communities, primarily due to their distinctive capabilities of converting and storing X&#8208;ray energy. However, determination of energy&#8208;conversion kinetics in these nanocrystals remains unexplored. Here we present a strategy to probe and unveil energy&#8208;funneling kinetics in NaLuF4:Mn2+/Gd3+ nanocrystal sublattices through Gd3+&#8208;driven microenvironment engineering and Mn2+&#8208;mediated radioluminescence profiling. Our photophysical studies reveal effective control of energy&#8208;funneling kinetics and demonstrate the tunability of electron trap depth ranging from 0.66 to 0.96&#8197;eV, with the corresponding trap density varying between 2.38&#215;105 and 1.34&#215;107&#8197;cm&#8722;3. This enables controlled release of captured electrons over durations spanning from seconds to 30&#8197;days. It allows tailorable emission wavelength within the range of 520&#8211;580&#8197;nm and fine&#8208;tuning of thermally&#8208;stimulated temperature between 313&#8211;403&#8197;K. We further utilize these scintillators to fabricate high&#8208;density, large&#8208;area scintillation screens that exhibit a 6&#8208;fold improvement in X&#8208;ray sensitivity, 22 lp/mm high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, and a 30&#8208;day&#8208;long optical memory. This enables high&#8208;contrast imaging of injured mice through fast thermally&#8208;stimulated radioluminescence readout. These findings offer new insights into the correlation of radioluminescence dynamics with energy&#8208;funneling kinetics, thereby contributing to the advancement of high&#8208;energy nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Inducible and Photoactivatable Cellular RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study combines the CRISPR/dCas13b and chemical induced proximity (CIP) techniques to develop a small molecule&#8208;induced photo&#8208;controllable m1A demethylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A) as well as an m1A methylation editing tool (termed AI&#8208;m1A). These m1A editing tools are able to regulate the biological function of targeted RNAs by modulating m1A modifications, which in turn influences cell functions.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) modification is one of the most prevalent epigenetic modifications on RNA. Given the vital role of m1A modification in RNA processing such as splicing, stability and translation, developing a precise and controllable m1A editing tool is pivotal for in&#8208;depth investigating the biological functions of m1A. In this study, we developed an abscisic acid (ABA)&#8208;inducible and reversible m1A demethylation tool (termed AI&#8208;dm1A), which targets specific transcripts by combining the chemical proximity&#8208;induction techniques with the CRISPR/dCas13b system and ALKBH3. We successfully employed AI&#8208;dm1A to selectively demethylate the m1A modifications at A8422 of MALAT1 RNA, and this demethylation process could be reversed by removing ABA. Furthermore, we validated its demethylation function on various types of cellular RNAs including mRNA, rRNA and lncRNA. Additionally, we used AI&#8208;dm1A to specifically demethylate m1A on ATP5D mRNA, which promoted ATP5D expression and enhanced the glycolysis activity of tumor cells. Conversely, by replacing the demethylase ALKBH3 with methyltransferase TRMT61A, we also developed a controllable m1A methylation tool, namely AI&#8208;m1A. Finally, we caged ABA by 4,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl (DMNB) to achieve light&#8208;inducible m1A methylation or demethylation on specific transcripts. Collectively, our m1A editing tool enables us to flexibly study how m1A modifications on specific transcript influence biological functions and phenotypes.

         <title>Bioorthogonal Delivery of Carbon Disulfide in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon disulfide (CS2) is an environmental pollutant, which is deadly hazardous to the workers under chronic or acute exposure. However, the toxicity mechanisms of CS2 are still unclear due to the scarcity of biocompatible donors, which can release CS2 in cells. Here we developed the first bioorthogonal CS2 delivery system based on the &#8220;click&#8208;and&#8208;release&#8221; reactions between mesoionic 1,3&#8208;thiazolium&#8208;5&#8208;thiolates (TATs) and strained cyclooctyne exo&#8208;BCN&#8208;OH. We successfully realized intracellular CS2 releasing and investigated the causes of CS2&#8208;induced hepatotoxicity, including oxidative stress, proteotoxic stress and copper&#8208;dependent cell death. It is found that CS2 can be copper vehicles bypassing copper transporters after reacting with nucleophiles in cytoplasm, and extra copper supplementation will exacerbate the loss of homeostasis of cells and ultimately cell death.&#160;These findings inspired us to explore the anticancer activity of CS2 in combination with copper by introducing a copper chelating group in our CS2 delivery system.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;Nonadjacent Tetrasubstituted Stereocenters Enabled by Pd/Cu&#8208;Cocatalyzed Asymmetric Heck Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of chiral motifs containing nonadjacent stereocenters in an enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective manner has long been a challenging task in synthetic chemistry, especially with respect to their stereodivergent synthesis. Herein, we describe a protocol that enables the enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective construction of 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent tetrasubstituted stereocenters through a Pd/Cu&#8208;cocatalyzed Heck cascade reaction. Notably, a C=C bond relay strategy involving the shift of the &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate was successfully applied in the asymmetric construction of 1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters. The current method allows for the efficient preparation of chiral molecules bearing two privileged scaffolds, oxindoles and non&#8208;natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, with good functional group tolerance. The full complement of the four stereoisomers of products bearing 1,5/1,7&#8208;nonadjacent stereocenters could be readily accessed by a simple combination of two chiral metal catalysts with different enantiomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Ultrathin CuxS Layer on Planar Sb2S3 Photocathode to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p&#8208;type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90 eV, which causes the upward band bending of p&#8208;type Sb2S3, forming a hole&#8208;transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back&#8208;illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches &#8722;5.38 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0 V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44 mA cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0 V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03 mA cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Strategy for the Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of Fluorinated Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated cyclopropanes are highly desired pharmacophores in drug discovery owing to the rigidity nature of the cyclopropane ring and the beneficial effects of C&#8211;F bonds on the pharmacokinetic properties, cell permeability, and metabolic stability of drug molecules. Herein a biocatalytic strategy for the stereoselective synthesis of mono&#8208;fluorinated and gem&#8208;difluoro cyclopropanes is reported though the use of engineered myoglobin&#8208;based catalysts. In particular, this system allows for a broad range of gem&#8208;difluoro alkenes to be cyclopropanated in the presence of diazoacetonitrile with excellent diastereo and enantiocontrol (up to 200:1 d.r. and 99% e.e.), thereby enabling a transformation not currently accessible with chemocatalytic methods. The synthetic utility of the present approach is further exemplified through the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a key gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropane intermediate useful for the preparation of fluorinated bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling Crucial Chemical Processing Parameters Influencing the Performance of Solution&#8208;Processed Inorganic Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical changes occur throughout the entire process of producing thermoelectric materials from particles in solution. Especially during the purification steps, which consequently influences the materials composition, microstructure and ultimately results in variations in the transport properties. Understanding the chemistry that occurs is crucial for material optimization and reproducibility.







Abstract
Production of thermoelectric materials from solution&#8208;processed particles involves the synthesis of particles, their purification and densification into pelletized material. Chemical changes that occur during each one of these steps render them performance determining. Particularly the purification steps, bypassed in conventional solid&#8208;state synthesis, are the cause for large discrepancies among similar solution&#8208;processed materials. In present work, the investigation focuses on a water&#8208;based surfactant free solution synthesis of SnSe, a highly relevant thermoelectric material. We show and rationalize that the number of leaching steps, purification solvent, annealing, and annealing atmosphere have significant influence on the Sn&#8201;:&#8201;Se ratio and impurity content in the powder. Such compositional changes that are undetectable by conventional characterization techniques lead to distinct consolidated materials with different types and concentration of defects. Additionally, the profound effect on their transport properties is demonstrated. We emphasize that understanding the chemistry and identifying key chemical species and their role throughout the process is paramount for optimizing material performance. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive reporting of these steps as a standard practice to ensure material reproducibility.

         <title>A Dicopper(II)&#8208;Based Carbonic Anhydrase Model&#8212;Quantum&#8208;Chemical Evaluation of the Mechanistic Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of ascidians produces large amounts of patellamides, known to form dinuclear copper(II) complexes, which are efficient carbonic anhydrases. However, at the pH in the ascidians, catalysis is shown to be product&#8208;inhibited. All data available support the hypothesis that the function of the patellamides is to transport carbonate from the ascidian to the photosynthetically active symbiont Prochloron.







Abstract
The cyanobacterium Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of different species of colonial ascidians, occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, produces a variety of cyclic peptides. These patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles lead to relatively stable dicopper(II) complexes that are extremely efficient carbonic anhydrase mimics, the most active model systems known so far. Importantly, it recently was shown that copper(II) is coordinated to patellamide derivatives in Prochloron cells. An interesting question therefore is, whether the biological function of patellamide&#8208;type macrocycles is related to the catalytic activity in CO2 hydration or its reverse. Here, we present a computational study to evaluate the energetics of the catalytic cycle in search of a possible answer to these questions and compare the computed energy barriers with the experimental kinetic data. It emerges that release of the bridging carbonate is a critical step and that the catalysis product inhibits catalysis at pH values above approx.&#8197;7. Therefore, carbonate transport rather than CO2 hydrolysis is proposed as the biological function of copper(II)&#8208;patellamide complexes in the Prochloron&#8208;Ascidian symbiosis.

         <title>Regulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics by Coupling Photocatalysis for High&#8208;Performance Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (PA&#8208;LSBs) exhibit outstanding performance through the selective catalysis mechanism of photocatalysis. The PHK composite cathode demonstrates exceptional solar energy conversion capabilities. PA&#8208;LSBs showcase excellent rate performance, long cycling stability, and high areal capacity, emphasizing their practical potential for energy storage applications in this advanced materials context.







Abstract
Challenges such as shuttle effect have hindered the commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), despite their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices. To address these issues, we explore the integration of solar energy into LSBs, creating a photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (PA&#8208;LSB). The PA&#8208;LSB provides a novel and sustainable solution by coupling the photocatalytic effect to accelerate sulfur redox reactions. Herein, a perovskite quantum dot&#8208;loaded MOF material serves as a cathode for the PA&#8208;LSB, creating built&#8208;in electric fields at the micro&#8208;interface to extend the lifetime of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers. The band structure of the composite material aligns well with the electrochemical reaction potential of lithium&#8208;sulfur, enabling precise regulation of polysulfides in the cathode of the PA&#8208;LSB system. This is attributed to the selective catalysis of the liquid&#8208;solid reaction stage in the lithium&#8208;sulfur electrochemical process by photocatalysis. These contribute to the outstanding performance of PA&#8208;LSBs, particularly demonstrating a remarkably high reversible capacity of 679&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C, maintaining stable cycling for 1500&#8197;cycles with the capacity decay rate of 0.022&#8201;% per cycle. Additionally, the photo&#8208;charging capability of the PA&#8208;LSB holds the potential to compensate for non&#8208;electric energy losses during the energy storage process, contributing to the development of lossless energy storage devices.

         <title>N&#8208;(Sulfonio)Sulfilimine Reagents: Non&#8208;Oxidizing Sources of Electrophilic Nitrogen Atom for Skeletal Editing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under rhodium catalysis N&#8208;sulfonio(sulfilimines) act as sulfonitrene precursors. Reaction of such species with indenes presumably delivers N&#8208;sulfonio aziridines, which evolve to isoquinolines via electrocyclic ring expansion. Contrarily, 1&#8208;arycyclobutenes are transformed into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes via ring contraction.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot synthesis of &#955;4&#8208;dibenzothiophen&#8208;5&#8208;imino&#8208;N&#8208;dibenzothiophenium triflate (1) in multigram scale is reported. This compound reacts with Rh2(esp)2 (esp=&#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;benzenedipropionic acid) generating a Rh&#8208;coordinated sulfonitrene species, which is able to transfer the electrophilic nitrene moiety to olefins. When indenes are used as substrates, isoquinolines are obtained in good yields. We assumed that after formation of the corresponding N&#8208;sulfonio aziridine, a ring expansion occurs via selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage and concomitant elimination of dibenzothiophene. Unexpectedly, a similar protocol transforms 1&#8208;arylcyclobutenes into 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;1&#8208;arylcyclopropanes. Our calculations indicate that aziridination is not favored in this case; instead, sulfilimine&#8208;substituted cyclobutyl carbocations are initially formed, and these evolve to the isolated cyclopropanes via ring contraction. Both procedures are operationally simple, tolerate a range of functional groups, including oxidation&#8208;sensitive alcohols and aldehydes, and enable the convenient preparation of valuable 15N&#8208;labelled products. These results demonstrate the potential of 1 to provide alternative pathways for the selective transfer of N&#8208;atoms in organic molecules.

         <title>Unified Approach to Deamination and Deoxygenation Through Isonitrile Hydrodecyanation: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol using isonitrile intermediates. Employing photoredox catalysis, a nucleophilic boryl radical mediates the scission of a relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, accomplishing deletion of the isonitrile group. This strategy applies to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing compounds and extends to the reduction of carbonyls, olefins, and alkyl nitriles.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol of alcohols and amines through a common isonitrile intermediate. To cleave the relatively inert C&#8722;NC bond, we leveraged dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and photoredox catalysis to generate a nucleophilic boryl radical, which readily forms an imidoyl radical intermediate from the isonitrile. Rapid &#946;&#8208;scission then accomplishes defunctionalization. This method has been applied to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biomolecules. We extended this approach to the reduction of carbonyls and olefins to their saturated counterparts, as well as the hydrodecyanation of alkyl nitriles. Both experimental and computational studies demonstrate a facile &#946;&#8208;scission of the imidoyl radical, and reconcile differences in reactivity between nitriles and isonitriles within our protocol.

         <title>SilE&#8208;R and SilE&#8208;S&#8212;DABB Proteins Catalying Enantiospecific Hydrolysis of Organosilyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, members of the DABB protein family, are the first two enzymes described that catalyse the enantiospecific hydrolysis of organosilyl ethers. They accept a wide range of substrates, including TBDMS&#8208;protected alcohols. The natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is still unknown, but their discovery paves the way towards a green and selective transformation of organosilane organosilanol substrates.







Abstract
Silyl ethers fulfil a fundamental role in synthetic organic chemistry as protecting groups and their selective cleavage is an important factor in their application. We present here for the first time two enzymes, SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S, which are able to hydrolyse silyl ethers. They belong to the stress&#8208;response dimeric A/B barrel domain (DABB) family and are able to cleave the Si&#8722;O bond with opposite enantiopreference. Silyl ethers containing aromatic, cyclic or aliphatic alcohols and, depending on the alcohol moiety, silyl functions as large as TBDMS are accepted. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of SilE&#8722;R, determined to a resolution of 1.98&#8197;&#197;, in combination with mutational studies, revealed an active site featuring two histidine residues, H8 and H79, which likely act synergistically as nucleophile and Br&#248;nsted base in the hydrolytic mechanism, which has not previously been described for enzymes. Although the natural function of SilE&#8722;R and SilE&#8722;S is unknown, we propose that these &#8216;silyl etherases&#8217; may have significant potential for synthetic applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Radical Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization of Alloxazine and Flavin through Ground&#8208;State Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of flavin analogues is desirable for property tuning but requires de novo synthesis. A synthetic strategy involving the introduction of a remote redox site followed by copper complexation turns an alloxazine and a flavin into redox&#8208;active structures and activates their aromatic ring for site&#8208;selective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. This unprecedented mechanism opens new vistas in the chemistry of flavins and analogues.







Abstract
Flavins and their alloxazine isomers are key chemical scaffolds for bioinspired electron transfer strategies. Their properties can be fine&#8208;tuned by functional groups, which must be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis as their aromatic ring is inert towards post&#8208;functionalization. We show that the introduction of a remote metal&#8208;binding redox site on alloxazine and flavin activates their aromatic ring towards direct C&#8722;H functionalization. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a synthetic sequence involving ground&#8208;state single electron transfer (SET) with an electrophilic source followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling. This unprecedented reactivity opens new opportunities in molecular editing of flavins by direct aromatic post&#8208;functionalization and the utility of the method is demonstrated with the site&#8208;selective C6 functionalization of alloxazine and flavin with a CF3 group, Br or Cl, that can be further elaborated into OH and aryl for chemical diversification.

         <title>An Indocyanine Green&#8208;Based Nanoprobe for In Vivo Detection of Cellular Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sound of Senescence: A nanostructured organic probe, NanoJaggs, can be used as photoacoustic contrast agent for in vivo imaging of the senescent cell burden in post&#8208;chemotherapy tumors. Made of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers, 30&#8197;nm nanoparticles exploit an active endocytosis mechanism and increase the number of lysosomes to specifically light up senescent cells implicated in cancer initiation and progression.







Abstract
There is an urgent need to improve conventional cancer&#8208;treatments by preventing detrimental side effects, cancer recurrence and metastases. Recent studies have shown that presence of senescent cells in tissues treated with chemo&#8208; or radiotherapy can be used to predict the effectiveness of cancer treatment. However, although the accumulation of senescent cells is one of the hallmarks of cancer, surprisingly little progress has been made in development of strategies for their detection in vivo. To address a lack of detection tools, we developed a biocompatible, injectable organic nanoprobe (NanoJagg), which is selectively taken up by senescent cells and accumulates in the lysosomes. The NanoJagg probe is obtained by self&#8208;assembly of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers using a scalable manufacturing process and characterized by a unique spectral signature suitable for both photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and fluorescence imaging. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies all indicate that NanoJaggs are a clinically translatable probe for detection of senescence and their PAT signal makes them suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the senescence burden in solid tumors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Click Synthesis of Multisugar&#8208;Modified Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional dendrimeric linker was developed that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars in just one step. The method exploits different click reactivities of the linker azides in a copper&#8208;catalyzed reaction with alkynes. The new method is fast, highly selective and allows the modification of the oligonucleotide with multiple sugars at any given position.







Abstract
Nucleic acids in the form of siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides or mRNA are currently explored as new promising modalities in the pharmaceutical industry. Particularly, the success of mRNA&#8208;vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, along with the successful development of the first sugar&#8208;modified siRNA therapeutics has inspired the field. The development of nucleic acid therapeutics requires efficient chemistry to link oligonucleotides to chemical structures that can improve stability, boost cellular uptake, or enable specific targeting. For the siRNA therapeutics currently in use, modification of the 3&#8242;&#8208;end of the oligonucleotides with triple&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)3 was shown to be of significance. This modification is currently achieved through cumbersome multistep synthesis and subsequent loading onto the solid support material. Herein, we report the development of a bifunctional click&#8208;reactive linker that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars, regardless of the position within the oligonucleotide, with remarkable efficiency and in a one&#8208;pot reaction.

         <title>Concomitant Near&#8208;Infrared Photothermy and Photoluminescence of Rod&#8208;Shaped Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 Synthesized Concurrently</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoclusters exhibiting concomitant photothermy (PT) and photoluminescence (PL) under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation are rarely reported, and some fundamental issues remain unresolved for such materials. Herein, we concurrently synthesized two novel rod&#8208;shaped Au nanoclusters, Au52(PET)32 and Au66(PET)38 (PET = 2&#8208;phenylethanethiol), and precisely revealed that their kernels were 4 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 and 5 &#215; 4 &#215; 6 face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structures, respectively, based on the numbers of Au layers in the [100], [010], and [001] directions. Following the structural growth mode from Au52(PET)32 to Au66(PET)38, we predicted six more novel nanoclusters. The concurrent synthesis provides rational comparison of the two nanoclusters on the stability, absorption, emission and photothermy, and reveals the aspect ratio&#8208;related properties. An interesting finding is that the two nanoclusters exhibit concomitant PT and PL under 785 nm light irradiation, and the PT and PL are in balance, which was explained by the qualitative evaluation of the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates. The ligand effects on PT and PL were also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Marine Ladder Polyethers via Endo&#8208;Selective Epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;Epoxonium Ring&#8208;Opening Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Marine ladder polyethers have attracted the attention of chemists and biologists because of their potent biological activities. Synthetic chemists have attempted to construct their polyether frameworks by epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades, as Nakanishi hypothesis describes. However, Baldwin&#8217;s rules of ring closure state that exo&#8208;selective intramolecular cyclization of epoxy alcohols is preferred over endo&#8208;selective cyclization. Herein, we investigated epoxide ring&#8208;opening cascades of polyepoxy alcohols in [EMIM]BF4/PFTB (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate /perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl alcohol) and found that all&#8208;endo products were formed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations (not restricted by Baldwin&#8217;s rules, which only apply to intramolecular hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclizations). We determined that the key factor enabling polyepoxy alcohols to undergo a high proportion of all&#8208;endo&#8208;selective cyclizations was inhibition of exo&#8208;selective hydroxyl&#8208;to&#8208;epoxide cyclization starting from the terminal hydroxyl group of a polyepoxy alcohol. By introducing a slow&#8208;release protecting group to the terminal hydroxyl group, we could markedly increase the cyclization yields of polyether fragments with hydrogen atoms at the ring junctions. For the first time, we constructed consecutively fused six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring and fused seven&#8208;, eight&#8208;, and nine&#8208;membered&#8208;ring polyether fragments by epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclizations through the addition of a suitable Lewis acid. We also suggest that the biosynthesis of marine ladder polyethers may proceed via epoxide&#8208;to&#8208;epoxonium ring&#8208;opening cyclization of polyepoxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;breaking of Dibenzo[b,d]thiophene Sulfone Enhancing Polaron Generation for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current bottleneck in the development of efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution is the limited availability of high&#8208;performance acceptor units. Over the past nine years, dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (DBS) has been the preferred choice for the acceptor unit. Despite extensive exploration of alternative structures as potential replacements for DBS, a superior substitute remains elusive. In this study, a symmetry&#8208;breaking strategy was employed on DBS to develop a novel acceptor unit, BBTT&#8208;1SO. The asymmetric structure of BBTT&#8208;1SO proved beneficial for increasing multiple moment and polarizability. BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;containing polymers showed higher efficiencies for hydrogen evolution than their DBS&#8208;containing counterparts by up to 166%. PBBTT&#8208;1SO exhibited an excellent hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 222.03 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 27.5% at 500 nm. Transient spectroscopic studies indicated that the BBTT&#8208;1SO&#8208;based polymers facilitated electron polaron formation, which explains their superior HERs. PBBTT&#8208;1SO also showed 14% higher HER in natural seawater splitting than that in deionized water splitting. Molecular dynamics simulations highlighted the enhanced water&#8208;PBBTT&#8208;1SO polymer interactions in salt&#8208;containing solutions. This study presents a pioneering example of a substitute acceptor unit for DBS in the construction of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Spirobifluorene Trimers : High Triplet Pure Hydrocarbon Hosts for Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pure aromatic hydrocarbon materials (PHC) represent a new generation of host materials for phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs), free of heteroatoms. They reduce the molecular complexity, can be easily synthesized and are an important direction towards robust devices. As heteroatoms can be involved in bonds dissociations in operating OLEDs through exciton induced degradation process, developing novel PHCs appear particularly relevant for the future of this technology. In the present work, we report a series of extended PHCs constructed on the assembly of three spirobifluorene fragments. The resulting positional isomers present a high triplet energy level, a wide HOMO/LUMO difference and improved thermal and morphological properties compared to previously reported PHCs. These characteristics are beneficial for the next generation of host materials for PhOLEDs and provide relevant design guidelines. Used as host in blue&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs, which are still the weakest link of the field, a very high EQE of 24 % and low threshold voltage of 3.56 V were obtained with a low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off. This high performance strengthens the position of PHC strategy as an efficient alternative for OLED technology and opens the way to a more simple electronic.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Approaches to Carbene Generation in Catalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbene transfer reactions have a century&#8208;old history in organic chemistry and are a primary method for the synthesis of cyclopropanes. Much of the work in this field has focused on the use of diazo compounds and related precursors, which can transfer a carbene fragment to a catalyst with concomitant loss of a stable byproduct. Despite the utility of this approach, there are persistent limitations in the scope of viable carbenes, most notably those lacking stabilizing substituents. By coupling carbene transfer chemistry with two&#8208;electron redox cycles, it is possible to expand the available starting materials that can be used as carbene precursors. In this Minireview, we discuss emerging catalytic reductive cyclopropanation reactions using either gem&#8208;dihaloalkanes or carbonyl compounds. This strategy is inspired by classic stoichiometric transformations, such as the Simmons&#8211;Smith cyclopropanation and the Clemmensen reduction, but instead entails the formation of a catalytically generated transition metal carbene or carbenoid. We also present recent efforts to generate carbenes directly from methylene (CR2H2) groups via a formal dehydrogenation. These reactions are currently restricted to substrates containing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which serve to facilitate deprotonation and subsequent oxidation of the anion.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate arylations of electron&#8208;poor alkenes are highly selective processes for C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) bond formation. &#948;&#8208;Selective hydroarylations of electron&#8208;poor 1,3&#8208;dienes are less well developed and reactions that deliver high enantioselectivity while giving single alkene isomer products are elusive. Here we report the Rh&#8208;catalyzed &#948;&#8208;arylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes that gives nearly exclusive Z&#8208;1,4&#8208;addition products (generally with &gt;95:5 positional and geometrical selectivity). This remote functionalization provides access to chiral diarylated alkenes from readily available precursors poised for further functionalization, including in the synthesis of bioactive molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that protonolysis of a Rh&#8208;allyl intermediate generated by diene insertion into a Rh&#8208;aryl is the turnover limiting step and occurs by an inner&#8208;sphere proton transfer pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical generation of aryl radicals from organoboron reagents enabled by pulsed electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryl radicals play a pivotal role as reactive intermediates in chemical synthesis, commonly arising from aryl halides and aryl diazo compounds. Expanding the repertoire of sources for aryl radical generation to include abundant and stable organoboron reagents would significantly advance radical chemistry and broaden their reactivity profile. While traditional approaches utilize stoichiometric oxidants or photocatalysis to generate aryl radicals from these reagents, electrochemical conditions have been largely underexplored. Through rigorous mechanistic investigations, we identified fundamental challenges hindering aryl radical generation. In addition to the high oxidation potentials of aromatic organoboron compounds, electrode passivation through radical grafting, homocoupling of aryl radicals, and decomposition issues were identified. We demonstrate that pulsed electrosynthesis enables selective and efficient aryl radical generation by mitigating the fundamental challenges. Our discoveries facilitated the development of the first electrochemical conversion of aryl potassium trifluoroborate salts into aryl C&#8211;P bonds. This sustainable and straightforward oxidative electrochemical approach exhibited a broad substrate scope, accommodating various heterocycles and aryl chlorides, typical substrates in transition&#8208;metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Furthermore, we extended this methodology to form aryl C&#8211;Se, C&#8211;Te, and C&#8211;S bonds, showcasing its versatility and potential in bond formation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Electroreduction of CO2 to CO by Ligand Engineering of Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT = 1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+ &lt; Na+ &lt; K+ &lt; Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>An Amphiphilic Cell&#8208;Penetrating Macrocycle for Efficient Cytosolic Delivery of Proteins, DNA and CRISPR Cas9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of safe platforms that can circumvent the endocytic pathway is of great significance for biological therapeutics that are usually degraded during endocytosis. Here we show that self&#8208;assembled and dynamic macrocycles can passively diffuse through the cell membrane and deliver a broad range of biologics including proteins, CRISPR Cas9 and ssDNA directly to the cytosol while retaining their bioactivity. Cell penetrating macrocycles (CPMs) can be easily prepared from the room temperature condensation of diketopyrrolopyrrole lactams with diamines. We attribute the high cellular permeability of&#160;CPMs to their amphiphilic nature and chameleonic properties. They adopt conformations that partially bury polar groups and expose hydrophobic side chains thus self&#8208;assembling into micellar&#8208;like structures. Their superior fluorescence renders&#160;CPMs&#160;trackable inside cells where they follow the endomembrane system.&#160;CPMs outperformed commercial reagents for biologics delivery and showed high RNA knockdown efficiency of CRISPR Cas9. We envisage that this class of macrocycles will be an ideal starting point to design and synthesize biomimetic macrocyclic tags that can readily facilitate the interaction and uptake of biomolecules and overcome endosomal digestion.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Donor Skeleton on Intramolecular Electron Transfer Amount for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The passivation of the defects derived from rapid&#8208;crystallization with electron&#8208;donating molecules is always a prerequisite to obtain desirable perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells, thus, the in&#8208;depth understanding on the correlations between molecular structure and passivation capacity is of great importance for screening passivators. Here, we introduce the double&#8208;ended amide molecule into perovskite precursor solution to modulate crystallization process and passivate defects. By regulating the intermediate bridging skeletons with alkyl, alkenyl and benzene groups, the results show the passivation strength highly depends on the spin&#8208;state electronic structure that serves as an intrinsic descriptor to determine the intramolecular charge distribution by controlling orbital electron transfer from the donor segment to acceptor segment. Upon careful optimization, the benzene&#8208;bridged amide molecule demonstrates superior efficacy on improving perovskite film quality. As a physical proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the carbon&#8208;based, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI2Br solar cell delivers a significantly increased efficiency of 15.51% with a remarkably improved stability. Based on the same principle, a champion efficiency of 24.20% is further obtained on the inverted (Cs0.05MA0.05FA0.9)Pb(I0.93Br0.07)3 solar cell. These findings provide new fundamental insights into the influence of spin&#8208;state modulation on effective perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Elevated Water Oxidation by Cation Leaching Enabled Tunable Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis is one promising and eco&#8208;friendly technique for energy storage, yet its overall efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In response, developing strategies to boost OER catalyst performance is crucial. With the advances in characterization techniques, an extensive phenomenon of surface structure evolution into an active amorphous layer was uncovered. Surface reconstruction in a controlled fashion was then proposed as an emerging strategy to elevate water oxidation efficiency. In this work, Cr substitution induces the reconstruction of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 during cyclic voltammetry (CV) conditioning by Cr leaching, which leads to a superior OER performance. The best&#8208;performed NiFe0.25Cr1.75O4 shows a ~1500% current density promotion at overpotential &#951; = 300 mV, which outperforms many advanced NiFe&#8208;based OER catalysts. It is also found that their OER activities are mainly determined by Ni:Fe ratio rather than Fe content in all metal elements. Meanwhile, the turnover frequency (TOF) values based on redox peak and total mass were obtained and analysed, and their possible limitations in the case of NiFexCr2&#8208;xO4 are discussed. Additionally, the high activity and durability were further verified in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) cell, highlighting its potential for practical large&#8208;scale and sustainable hydrogen gas generation.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl Thiazolines from 4&#8208;Hydroxybenzaldehydes Using Vanillyl Alcohol Oxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen heterocycles are commonly found in bioactive natural products and drugs. However, the biocatalytic tools for nitrogen heterocycle synthesis are limited. Herein, we report the discovery of vanillyl alcohol oxidases (VAOs) as efficient biocatalysts for the one&#8208;pot synthesis of 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines from various 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes and aminothiols. The wild&#8208;type biocatalyst features a broad scope of 4&#8208;hydroxybenzaldehydes. Though the scope of aminothiols is limited, it could be improved via semi&#8208;rational protein engineering, generating a variant to produce previously inaccessible cysteine&#8208;derived bioactive 2&#8208;aryl thiazolines using the wild&#8208;type VAO. Benefiting from the derivatizable functional groups in the enzymatic products, we further chemically modified these products to expand the chemical space, offering a new chemoenzymatic strategy for the green and efficient synthesis of structurally diverse 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;thiazoline derivatives to prompt their use in drug discovery and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Swelling and Symmetrization in Siliceous Zeolites due to Hydrogen Insertion at High Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen and helium saturate the 1D pore systems of the high&#8208;silica (Si/Al&gt;30) zeolites Theta&#8208;One (TON), and Mobile&#8208;Twelve (MTW) at high pressure based on x&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Monte Carlo simulations. In TON, a strong 22% volume increase occurs above 5 GPa with a transition from the collapsed P21 to a symmetrical, swelled Cmc21 form linked to an increase in H2 content from 12 H2/unit cell in the pores to 35 H2/unit cell in the pores and in the framework of the material. No transition and continuous collapse of TON is observed in helium indicating that the mechanism of H2 insertion is distinct from other fluids. The insertion of hydrogen in the larger pores of MTW results in a strong 11% volume increase at 4.3 GPa with partial symmetrization followed by a second volume increase of 4.5% at 7.5 GPa, corresponding to increases in hydrogen content from 43 to 67 and then to 93 H2/unit cell. Flexible 1D siliceous zeolites have a very high H2 capacity (1.5 and 1.7 H2/SiO2 unit for TON and MTW, respectively) due to H2 insertion in the pores and the framework, in contrast to other atoms and molecules, thereby providing a mechanism for strong swelling.</dc:description>

         <title>Lone&#8208;Pair&#8208;p Bond Strength Unveiled by a Combined Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) and perylene&#8208;diimide (PDI) connected bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes of iridium (III) have been prepared and fully characterized. The analysis of their NMR spectroscopic features, together their molecular structures show that these species display lone pair&#8208;p interactions between the chloride ligands of the Ir(III) complex and the heterocycles of the NDI/PDI moieties. The detection of this type of interaction in solution is due to the formation of two atropisomers, which are formed as a result of the restricted rotation about the Ir&#8208;Ccarbene bond imposed by the (Cl)lp&#8230;p interaction. Variable temperature 1H NMR analysis allowed to determine the strength of this non&#8208;covalent interaction, which lies between DH = 6.6&#8208;10 kcal/mol. The computational studies performed fully support the experimental findings. Our study demonstrates that this type of lp&#8230;p interaction is comparable to strong hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>[22]Pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) Displaying N&#8208;Fusion, Pyrrole&#8208;Rearrangement, and Dimerization Reactions Upon Oxidation and Metalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of expanded porphyrins with unprecedented reactivities has remained important. Here [22]pentaphyrins(2.0.1.1.0) were synthesized as a constitutional isomer of sapphyrin by acid&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5,10&#8208;diaryltripyrrin with 1,2&#8208;di(pyrro&#8208;2&#8208;ly)ethenes. These pentaphyrins display roughly planar structures and varying aromaticities depending upon the vinylene structures. The 19,20&#8208;ditolyl pentaphyrin gave an N&#8208;fused product and an unprecedented pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product, depending upon the oxidation conditions. Remarkably, upon the metalation with CuCl, the N&#8208;fused product and the pyrrole&#8208;rearranged product afforded an inner b&#8208;b coupled face&#8208;to&#8208;face CuII complex dimer and an outer b&#8208;b coupled lateral CuII complex dimer, respectively, in fairly good yields. Further, [22]pentaphyrin(2.0.1.1.0) fused with a NiII porphyrin was effectively dimerized upon oxidation with MnO2 to give a 16&#8208;16&#8217; directly linked dl&#8208;dimer.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;performance Cobalt&#8208;based Environmental Catalysts from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Unveiling Overlooked Roles of Copper and Aluminum from Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) cathode materials into environmental catalysts has drawn more and more attention. Herein, we fabricated a Co3O4&#8208;based catalyst from spent LiCoO2 LIBs (Co3O4&#8208;LIBs) and found that the role of Al and Cu from current collectors on its performance is nonnegligible. The density functional theory calculations confirmed that the doping of Al and/or Cu upshifts the d&#8208;band center of Co. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation was adopted to evaluate its activity. Interestingly, Al doping strengthened chemisorption for PMS (from &#8208;2.615 eV to &#8208;2.623 eV) and shortened Co&#8208;O bond length (from 2.540 &#197; to 2.344 &#197;) between them, whereas Cu doping reduced interfacial charge&#8208;transfer resistance (from 28.347 k&#937; to 6.689 k&#937;) excepting for the enhancement of the above characteristics. As expected, the degradation activity toward bisphenol A of Co3O4&#8208;LIBs (0.523 min&#8208;1) was superior to that of Co3O4 prepared from commercial CoC2O4 (0.287 min&#8208;1). Simultaneously, the reasons for improved activity were further verified by comparing activity with catalysts doped Al and/or Cu into Co3O4. This work reveals the role of elements from current collectors on the performance of functional materials from spent LIBs, which is beneficial to the sustainable utilization of spent LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching Reagent for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we propose a unified mechanism for photoswitching in super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging by analyzing various photoswitching reagents. We found that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process. Based on this systematic investigation, sodium azide is suggested as a new photoswitching reagent.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized optical microscopy by exceeding the diffraction limit and revealing previously unattainable nanoscale details of cellular structures and molecular dynamics. This super&#8208;resolution imaging capability relies on fluorophore photoswitching, which is crucial for optimizing the imaging conditions and accurately determining the fluorophore positions. To understand the general on and off photoswitching mechanisms of single dye molecules, various photoswitching reagents were evaluated. Systematic measurement of the single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level fluorescence on and off rates (kon and koff) in the presence of various photoswitching reagents and theoretical calculation of the structure of the photoswitching reagent&#8208;fluorophore pair indicated that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, which is related to the power of the illuminating laser and bond dissociation energy of this pair. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the molecular photoswitching mechanism in SMLM imaging and provides a basis for designing improved photoswitching reagents with potential applications extending to materials science and chemistry.

         <title>PolyBorylated Alkenes as Energy&#8208;Transfer Reactive Groups: Access to Multi&#8208;Borylated Cyclobutanes Combined with Hydrogen Atom Transfer Event</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A site&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of polyborylated cyclobutanes by photochemical [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is reported. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to the polyborylated alkenes and operates with a wide array of polyborylated alkenes, and olefins, allowing for the creation of polyborylated&#8208;biradical intermediates. A side&#8208;product resulting from a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (HAT) via a photo&#8208;ene&#8208;type reaction was also obtained.







Abstract
While polyborylated alkenes are being recognized for their elevated status as highly valuable reagents in modern organic synthesis, allowing efficient access to a diverse array of transformations, including the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds, their potential as energy&#8208;transfer reactive groups has remained unexplored. Yet, this potential holds the key to generating elusive polyborylated biradical species, which can be captured by olefins, thereby leading to the construction of new highly&#8208;borylated scaffolds. Herein, we report a designed energy&#8208;transfer strategy for photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of poly&#8208;borylated alkenes with various olefins enabling the regioselective synthesis of diverse poly&#8208;borylated cyclobutane motifs, including the 1,1&#8208;di&#8208;, 1,1,2&#8208;tri&#8208;, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated cyclobutanes. In fact, these compounds belong to a family that presently lacks efficient synthetic pathways. Interestingly, when &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene was used, the reaction involves an interesting 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Mechanistic deuterium&#8208;labeling studies have provided insight into the outcome of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process. In addition, the polyborylated cyclobutanes are then demonstrated to be useful in selective oxidation processes resulting in the formation of cyclobutanones and &#947;&#8208;lactones.

     alt="PolyBorylated Alkenes as Energy-Transfer Reactive Groups: Access to Multi-Borylated Cyclobutanes Combined with Hydrogen Atom Transfer Event"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A site- and regioselective synthesis of polyborylated cyclobutanes by photochemical [2+2]-cycloaddition is reported. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to the polyborylated alkenes and operates with a wide array of polyborylated alkenes, and olefins, allowing for the creation of polyborylated-biradical intermediates. A side-product resulting from a 1,5-hydrogen-atom-transfer (HAT) via a photo-ene-type reaction was also obtained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While polyborylated alkenes are being recognized for their elevated status as highly valuable reagents in modern organic synthesis, allowing efficient access to a diverse array of transformations, including the formation of C&#8722;C and C-heteroatom bonds, their potential as energy-transfer reactive groups has remained unexplored. Yet, this potential holds the key to generating elusive polyborylated biradical species, which can be captured by olefins, thereby leading to the construction of new highly-borylated scaffolds. Herein, we report a designed energy-transfer strategy for photosensitized [2+2]-cycloadditions of poly-borylated alkenes with various olefins enabling the regioselective synthesis of diverse poly-borylated cyclobutane motifs, including the 1,1-di-, 1,1,2-tri-, and 1,1,2,2-tetra-borylated cyclobutanes. In fact, these compounds belong to a family that presently lacks efficient synthetic pathways. Interestingly, when &#945;-methylstyrene was used, the reaction involves an interesting 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). Mechanistic deuterium-labeling studies have provided insight into the outcome of 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer process. In addition, the polyborylated cyclobutanes are then demonstrated to be useful in selective oxidation processes resulting in the formation of cyclobutanones and &#947;-lactones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Confinement of Sustainable Carbon Dots Results in Long Afterglow Emitters and Photocatalyst for Radical Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots originating from cellulose confined in a silica matrix result in long afterglow emission indicating formation of triplet states. Their use as sensitizer in radical photopolymerization results either in free radical polymerization or controlled radical polymerization based on a photo&#8208;ATRP protocol depending on the composition. Metal&#8208;free setup indicated less uniformity while a trace of CuBr2/TPMA resulted in dispersity approaching to unity depending on concentration.







Abstract
Sustainable carbon dots based on cellulose, particularly carboxymethyl cellulose carbon dots (CMCCDs), were confined in an inorganic network resulting in CMCCDs@SiO2. This resulted in a material exhibiting long afterglow covering a time frame of several seconds also under air. Temperature&#8208;dependent emission spectra gave information on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) while photocurrent experiments provided a deeper understanding of charge availability in the dark period, and therefore, its availability on the photocatalyst surface. The photo&#8208;ATRP initiator, ethyl &#945;&#8208;bromophenylacetate (EBPA), quenched the emission from the millisecond to the nanosecond time frame indicating participation of the triplet state in photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Both free radical and controlled radical polymerization based on photo&#8208;ATRP protocol worked successfully. Metal&#8208;free photo&#8208;ATRP resulted in chain extendable macroinitiators based on a reductive mechanism with either MMA or in combination with styrene. Addition of 9&#8197;ppm Cu2+ resulted in Mw/Mn of 1.4 while an increase to 72&#8197;ppm improved uniformity of the polymers; that is Mw/Mn=1.03. Complementary experiments with kerria laca carbon dots confined materials, namely KCDs@SiO2, provided similar results. Deposition of Cu2+ (9&#8197;ppm) on the photocatalyst surface explains better uniformity of the polymers formed in the ATRP protocol.

         <title>Reaction Environment Regulation for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) in acidic electrolytes, focusing on engineering reaction environments. It discusses strategies for electrocatalyst design, electrode modification, and electrolyte optimization to enhance CO2RR while suppressing hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Inward Isomerization Hydroaminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization and hydraminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides has been developed. The combination isomerization&#8208;responsible catalyst and hydrocarbonylation&#8208;responsible catalyst was found to be a highly effective strategy to render the reaction feasible. The reaction shows highly functional group compatibility and site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
In contrast to the kinetically favored outward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, the disfavored inward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes remains an important challenge. Herein, we have developed a novel and effective palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes and aniline hydrochlorides for the formation of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides in high yields and high site&#8208;selectivities. The high efficiency of the reaction is attributed to a relay catalysis strategy, in which the Markovnikov&#8208;favored [PdH]&#8208;PtBu3 catalyst is responsible for inward isomerization, while the [PdH]&#8208;Ruphos catalyst is responsible for hydroaminocarbonylation of the resulting conjugated aryl alkenes. The reaction exhibits highly functional group tolerance and provides a new method for formal carbonylation of remote C(sp3)&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Mitigating Sodium Ordering for Enhanced Solid Solution Behavior in Layered NaNiO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective reduction of multiple phase transformations in NaNiO2 has been achieved through divalent Mg2+ doping, which deshields the electron density from Na+ ions. This outcome can be attributed to the more ionic nature of Mg&#8722;O bond, creating free space for the mobility of Na+ ions and mitigating the Na+ion ordering.







Abstract
The O&#8208;type layered nickel oxides suffer from undesired cooperative Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion stemming from Ni3+ ions and undergo multiple biphasic structural transformations during the insertion/extraction of large Na+ ions, posing a significant challenge to stabilize the structural integrity. We present here a systematic investigation of the impact of substituting 5&#8201;% divalent (Mg2+) or trivalent (Al3+ or Co3+) ions for Ni3+ to alleviate Na+ion ordering and perturb the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect to enhance structural stability. We gauge a fundamental understanding of the Mg&#8722;O and Na&#8722;O or Mg&#8722;O&#8722;Na bonding interactions, noting that the ionicity of the Mg&#8722;O bond deshields the electronic cloud of oxygen from Na+ ions. Furthermore, calculations of the Van Vleck distortion modes reveal a relaxation of NiO6 octahedra from Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion and a reduced electron density at the interlayer with Mg2+ substitution. Long&#8208;range (operando
X&#8208;ray diffraction) and short&#8208;range (magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance) structural analyses provide insights into reduced ordering, allowing a stable continuous solid solution. Overall, Mg&#8208;substitution results in a high&#8208;capacity retention of ~96&#8201;% even after 100&#8197;cycles, showcasing the potential of this strategy for overcoming the structural instabilities and enhancing the performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Art: Visualizing the Near&#8208;Symmetry of Molecules in Piet Mondrian's De Stijl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can we use asymmetric art to show symmetry? A new plot style, the Mondrian graph, is proposed as a method of displaying the concerted distortions of molecules, highlighting symmetry and the contribution of normal modes to solid&#8208;state conformation. The method of display borrows its artistic stylings from the works of Piet Mondrian&#8212;and speaks to how artistic and scientific conceptions of symmetry can be brought together.







Abstract
Symmetry and shape are essential aspects of molecular structure and how we interpret molecules and their properties. We, as chemists, are comfortable with pictorial representations of structure, in which some nuance is lost&#8212;investigating molecular shape numerically by looking at how closely it fits a reference, such as a plane, or a set of vectors or coordinates, is informative, though far from engaging. Often relationships between chemical structure and derived values are obscured. Taking our inspiration from Piet Mondrian's Compositions, we have depicted the symmetry information encoded within 3D data as blocks of color, to show clearly how chemical arguments and resultant molecular distortion may contribute to symmetry. Great art gives us a new perspective on the world; as a pastiche, this art may allow us to look at familiar molecules, such as porphyrins, in a new light, understanding how their shape and properties are intertwined.

         <title>The 18F&#8208;Difluoromethyl Group: Challenges, Impact and Outlook</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the progress radiochemists have made to access the difluoromethyl group in radiolabelled form. Particular attention is given to challenges they have faced, as well as the strategies employed to access this new radiochemical space.







Abstract
The difluoromethyl functionality has proven useful in drug discovery, as it can modulate the properties of bioactive molecules. For PET imaging, this structural motif has been largely underexploited in (pre)clinical radiotracers due to a lack of user&#8208;friendly radiosynthetic routes. This Minireview provides an overview of the challenges facing radiochemists and summarises the efforts made to date to access 18F&#8208;difluoromethyl&#8208;containing radiotracers. Two distinct approaches have prevailed, the first of which relies on 18F&#8208;fluorination. A second approach consists of a 18F&#8208;difluoromethylation process, which uses 18F&#8208;labelled reagents capable of releasing key reactive intermediates such as the [18F]CF2H radical or [18F]difluorocarbene. Finally, we provide an outlook for future directions in the radiosynthesis of [18F]CF2H compounds and their application in tracer radiosynthesis.

         <title>A Zeolitic Octahedral Metal Oxide with Ultrahigh Porosity for High&#8208;temperature and High&#8208;humidity Alkyne/Alkene Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide based on phosphomolybdate is synthesized. The micropore of material is readily opened, which is suitable for adsorption of small molecules. The material shows high separation performance of alkyne and alkene particularly under high temperature and humidity conditions.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxide is a newly synthesized all&#8208;inorganic zeolitic material and has been used for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Herein, a new zeolitic octahedral metal oxide was synthesized and characterized. The porous framework was established through the assembly of [P2Mo13O50] clusters with PO4 linkers. Guest molecules occupied the framework, which could be removed through heat treatment, thereby opening the micropores. The pore characteristics were controlled by the cations within the micropore, enabling the adjustment of the interactions with alkynes and alkenes. This resulted in good separation performance of ethylene/acetylene and propylene/propyne even under high temperature and humidity conditions. The high stability of the material enabled the efficient recovery and reuse without discernible loss in the separation performance. Due to the relatively weak interaction between the adsorbed alkyne and the framework, the adsorbent facilitated the recovery of a highly pure alkyne. This feature enhances the practical applicability of the material in various industrial processes.

         <title>Aerobic Oxidative Synthesis of Formamides from Amines and Bioderived Formyl Surrogates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aerobic oxidative N&#8208;formylation of amines to formamides by sustainable formyl surrogate derived from biobased feedstocks such as 1,3&#8208;dihydroxyacetone, glyceraldehyde and glycolaldehyde is achieved over C3N4&#8208;supported single CuN4 sites with 100&#8201;% utilization efficiency of carbon atoms and much higher turnover frequency (TOF) than noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
Herein we present a new strategy for the oxidative synthesis of formamides from various types of amines and bioderived formyl sources (DHA, GLA and GLCA) and molecular oxygen (O2) as oxidant on g&#8208;C3N4 supported Cu catalysts. Combined characterization data from EPR, XAFS, XRD and XPS revealed the formation of single CuN4 sites on supported Cuphen/C3N4 catalysts. EPR spin trapping experiments disclosed &#8901;OOH radicals as reactive oxygen species and &#8901;NR1R2 radicals being responsible for the initial C&#8722;C bond cleavage. Control experiments and DFT calculations showed that the successive C&#8722;C bond cleavage in DHA proceeds via a reaction mechanism co&#8208;mediated by &#8901;NR1R2 and &#8901;OOH radicals based on the well&#8208;equilibrated CuII and CuI cycle. Our catalyst has much higher activity (TOF) than those based on noble metals.

         <title>Hidden Impurities Generate False Positives in Single Atom Catalyst Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are an emerging class of materials, leveraging maximum atom utilization and distinctive structural and electronic properties to bridge heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis. Direct imaging methods, such as aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, are commonly applied to confirm the atomic dispersion of active sites. However, interpretations of data from these techniques can be challenging due to simultaneous contributions to intensity from impurities introduced during synthesis processes, as well as any variation in position relative to the focal plane of the electron beam. To address this matter, this paper presents a comprehensive study on two representative SACs containing isolated nickel or copper atoms. Spectroscopic techniques, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, were employed to prove the high metal dispersion of the catalytic atoms. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging combined with single&#8208;atom&#8208;sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, we scrutinized thin specimens of the catalysts to provide an unambiguous chemical identification of the observed single&#8208;atom species and thereby distinguish impurities from active sites at the single&#8208;atom level. Overall, the study underscores the complexity of SACs characterization and establishes the importance of the use of spectroscopy in tandem with imaging at atomic resolution to fully and reliably characterize single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic sp&#8208;Chain Ligands: Isoelectronic B/N Analogues of E. O. Fischer's Alkynylcarbynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borylation of a tungsten&#8208;bound N2 ligand and halide abstraction provides access to a cationic complex with an unprecedented linear NNBR ligand. This complex undergoes [3+2] cycloaddition with azides, and an unexpected chain&#8208;extension reaction with an iminoborane, leading to a complex with a five&#8208;atom B/N chain. These two [NNBR]&#8208;containing complexes, inorganic analogues of E. O. Fischer's alkynylcarbynes, are very rare examples of molecules containing all&#8208;inorganic chains of sp&#8208;hybridized atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Heteroatom&#8208;Linked Non&#8208;Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers hold significant fascination, not only for their prevalence in natural compounds but also for their biological importance and wide&#8208;ranging applications as chiral materials, ligands, and organocatalysts. While biaryl and heterobiaryl atropisomers are commonly studied, the enantioselective synthesis of less abundant heteroatom&#8208;linked non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers presents a formidable challenge in modern organic synthesis. Unlike classical atropisomers, these molecules allow rotation around two bonds, resulting in low barriers to enantiomerization through concerted bond rotations. In recent years the discovery of new configurationally stable rare non&#8208;biaryl scaffolds such as aryl amines, aryl ethers and aryl sulfones as well as innovative methodologies to control their configuration have been disclosed in the literature and constitute the topic of this minireview.</dc:description>

         <title>On Tautomerism and Amphoterism: An In&#8208;Depth Structural and Physicochemical Characterization of Ammeline and Some of Its Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammeline is a simple, readily available, molecular compound, which has been known for nearly 200 years. Despite that, no proper structural characterization of ammeline has been conducted so far. For this reason, the prevalent tautomeric form of ammeline in the solid remained unknown to this date. In the course of this study, its crystal structure was finally established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. In this structure, ammeline is exclusively found as its 4,6&#8209;diamino&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one tautomer and adopts layered structure with an exceptionally high hydrogen bond density. Ammeline shows an interesting amphoteric behavior. Therefore, the synthesis and structural characterization of some of its salts were carried out to investigate the influence of the protonation degree on its molecular structure. In particular, the crystal structure of silver ammelinate monohydrate was solved as the first reported structure containing deprotonated ammeline. Moreover, the crystal structures of three different modifications of ammelinium perchlorate were elucidated and the transformation conditions between them were studied. Lastly, the crystal structure of ammelinediium diperchlorate monohydrate, containing unprecedented doubly protonated ammeline, was determined. The products&#8217; thermal behavior was studied by differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The perchlorate salts were additionally examined for their potential as insensitive high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Enzymatic Prodrug&#8208;like Route to Thio and Selenoamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>6&#8208;Thioguanine (6TG) is a clinically used antitumor agent that was rationally designed as a DNA&#8208;targeting antimetabolite, but it also occurs naturally. 6TG is a critical virulence factor produced by Erwinia amylovorans, a notorious plant pathogen that causes fire blight of pome fruit trees. The biosynthesis of the rare thioamide metabolite involves an adenylating enzyme (YcfA) and a sulfur&#8208;mobilizing enzyme (YcfC), but the mechanism of sulfur transfer and putative intermediates have remained elusive. Through dissection and in vitro reconstitution of the thionation process using diverse substrates, we uncover an intermediate, prodrug&#8208;like thio&#8208;conjugate and elucidate the precise enzyme functions. YcfA not only adenylates GMP but also transfers the mercapto group of l&#8208;cysteine to the activated carbonyl. A designated C&#8208;S lyase (YcfC) then cleaves the resulting S&#8208;adduct to yield the thioamide. This pathway is distinct from canonical tRNA sulfur modifications and known enzymatic peptide thionations. By exploring a wide range of substrate surrogates, we exploited the tolerance of the enzyme pair to produce even a seleno analogue. This study provides valuable insight into a previously unexplored area of bacterial thioamide formation and lays the groundwork for synthetic biology approaches to produce thioamide antimetabolites.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Sulfinamidines via Asymmetric Nitrogen Transfer from N&#8208;H Oxaziridines to Sulfenamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfinamidines are promising aza&#8208;SIV chiral building blocks in asymmetric synthesis and drug discovery. However, no report has documented their enantioselective synthesis. Here we present an enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamidines via electrophilic amination of sulfenamides using an enantiopure N&#8208;H oxaziridine. The resulting enantiomerically enriched primary sulfinamidines are configurationally stable at 90 oC in solution and show remarkable stability against organic acids and bases under non&#8208;aqueous conditions. We also demonstrate a one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;component, enantioselective synthesis of sulfinamides using N&#8208;H oxaziridine reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Creating High&#8208;entropy Single Atoms on Transition Disulfides through Substrate&#8208;induced Redox Dynamics for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The controllable anchoring of multiple metal single&#8208;atoms (SAs) into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities,while marrying the concentration&#8208;complex multimetallic SAs and high&#8208;entropy SAs (HESAs) into one SAC system remains a substantial challenge.Here, we present a substrate&#8208;mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports, which can precisely control the doping location of SAs. Specially, the contents of SAs can continuously increase until the accessible Mo atoms on TMDs carriers are completely replaced by SAs, thus allowing the of much higher metal contents.In&#8208;depth mechanistic study shows that the well&#8208;controlled synthesis of multimetallic SAs and HESAs is realized by controlling the reversible redox reaction occurred on the TMDs/TM ion interface.As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, a variety of SAs&#8208;TMDs were applied to hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The controllable anchoring of multiple metal single-atoms (SAs) into a single support exhibits scientific and technological opportunities,while marrying the concentration-complex multimetallic SAs and high-entropy SAs (HESAs) into one SAC system remains a substantial challenge.Here, we present a substrate-mediated SAs formation strategy to successfully fabricate a library of multimetallic SAs and HESAs on MoS2 and MoSe2 supports, which can precisely control the doping location of SAs. Specially, the contents of SAs can continuously increase until the accessible Mo atoms on TMDs carriers are completely replaced by SAs, thus allowing the of much higher metal contents.In-depth mechanistic study shows that the well-controlled synthesis of multimetallic SAs and HESAs is realized by controlling the reversible redox reaction occurred on the TMDs/TM ion interface.As a proof-of-concept application, a variety of SAs-TMDs were applied to hydrogen evolution reaction. The optimized HESAs-TMDs (Pt,Ru,Rh,Pd,Re-MoSe2) delivers a much higher activity and durability than state of-the-art Pt. Thus, our work will broaden the family of single-atom catalysts and provide a new guideline for the rational design of high-performance single-atom catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Alumina &#8208; Stabilized SEI and CEI in Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) nanopowder is spin&#8208;coated onto both sides of commercial polypropene separator to create artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and artificial cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) in potassium metal batteries (KMBs). This significantly enhances the stability, including of KMBs with Prussian Blue (PB) cathodes. For example, symmetric cells are stable after 1,000 cycles at 0.5 mA/cm2 &#8208; 0.5 mAh/cm2 and 3.0 mA/cm2 &#8208; 0.5 mAh/cm2. Alumina modified separators promote electrolyte wetting and increase ionic conductivity (0.59 vs. 0.2 mS/cm) and transference number (0.81 vs. 0.23). Cryo&#8208;stage focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) analysis of cycled modified anode demonstrates dense and planar electrodeposits, versus unmodified baseline consisting of metal filaments (dendrites) interspersed with pores and SEI. Alumina&#8208;modified CEI also suppresses elemental Fe crossover and reduces cathode cracking. Mesoscale modeling of metal &#8211; SEI interactions captures crucial role of intrinsic heterogeneities, illustrating how artificial SEI affects reaction current distribution, conductivity and morphological stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Catalytic Construction of Nitrogen Stereogenic Center via Formal Desymmetrization of Remote Diols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of noncarbon stereogenic centers is of profound importance owing to their enormous interest in bioactive compounds and chiral catalyst or ligand design for enantioselective synthesis. Despite various elegant approaches have been achieved for construction of S&#8208;, P&#8208;, Si&#8208; and B&#8208;stereocenters over the past decades, the catalyst&#8208;controlled strategies to govern the formation of N&#8208;stereogenic compounds have garnered less attention. Here, we disclose the first organocatalytic approach for efficient access to a wide range of nitrogen&#8208;stereogenic compounds through a desymmetrization approach. Intriguingly, the pro&#8208;chiral remote diols, which are previously not well addressed with enantiocontrol, are well differentiated by potent chiral carbene&#8208;bound acyl azolium intermediates. Preliminary studies shed insights on the critical importance of the ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) formed between the dimer aggregate of diols to afford the chiral N&#8208;oxide products that feature a tetrahedral nitrogen as the sole stereogenic element with good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, the chiral N&#8208;oxide products could offer an attractive strategy for chiral ligand design and discovery of potential antibacterial agrochemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable MOF&#8208;Type Lead Halide Luminescent Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide molecular ferroelectrics represent an important class of luminescent ferroelectrics, distinguished by their high chemical and structural tunability, excellent processability and distinctive luminescent characteristics. However, their inherent instability, prone to decomposition upon exposure to moisture and light, hinders their broader ferroelectric applications. Herein, for the first time, we present a series of isoreticular metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;type lead halide luminescent ferroelectrics, demonstrating exceptional robustness under ambient conditions for at least 15 months and even when subjected to aqueous boiling conditions. Unlike conventional metal&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) in MOFs adopting highly centrosymmetric structure with limited structural distortion, our lead halide&#8208;based MOFs occupy structurally deformable [Pb2X]+ (X=Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;/I&#8722;) SBUs that facilitate a c&#8208;axis&#8208;biased displacement of Pb2+ centers and substantially contribute to thermoinducible structural transformation. Importantly, this class of MOF&#8208;type lead halide ferroelectrics undergo ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transitions with remarkably high Curie temperature of up to 505 K, superior to most of molecular ferroelectrics. Moreover, the covalent bonding between phosphorescent organic component and the light&#8208;harvesting inorganic component achieves efficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing, resulting in long&#8208;lived afterglow emission. The compelling combination of high stability, ferroelectricity and afterglow emission exhibited by lead halide MOFs opens up many potential opportunities in energy&#8208;conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Processible and Ultrahigh&#8208;temperature Organic Photothermal Material through Spontaneous and Quantitative [2+2] Cycloaddition&#8211;Cycloreversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy conversion, particularly light to heat conversion, has garnered significant attention owing to its prospect in renewable energy exploitation and utilization. Most previous efforts have focused on developing organic photothermal materials for low&#8208;temperature applications, whereas the importance of simplifying the preparation methods of photothermal materials and enhancing their maximum photothermal temperature have been less taken. Herein, we prepare an organic near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal material namely ATT by a spontaneous [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;cycloreversion reaction. In addition to the solution&#8208;based method, ATT could also be readily preapred by ball milling in a high yield of 90% in just 15 min. ATT powder exhibits a broad absorption extending beyond 2000 nm, excellent processability, and thermal stability. Remarkably, ATT powder can reach an unprecedently temperature as high as 450 &#176;C while maintaining excellent photostability upon photoirradiation. Leveraging its extraordinary photothermal and processable properties, ATT was used in the high&#8208;temperature applications, such as photo&#8208;ignition, photo&#8208;controlled metal processing and high&#8208;temperature shape memory, all of which offer spatiotemporal control capabilities. This work provides a new approach to prepare organic photothermal materials with high temperatures, and pave the way for their applications in extreme environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong and Tough MXene Bridging&#8208;induced Conductive Nacre</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nacre is a classic model, providing an inspiration for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites with the two&#8208;dimensional platelets. However, the &#8220;brick&#8221; of nacre, aragonite platelet, is an ideal building block for making high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites. Herein, we demonstrated a strong and tough conductive nacre through reassembling aragonite platelets with bridged by MXene nanosheets and hydrogen bonding, not only providing high mechanical properties but also excellent electrical conductivity. The flexural strength and fracture toughness of the obtained conductive nacre reach ~ 282 MPa and ~ 6.3 MPa m1/2, which is 1.6 and 1.6 times higher than that of natural nacre, respectively. These properties are attributed to densification and high orientation degree of the conductive nacre, which is effectively induced by the combined interactions of hydrogen bonding and MXene nanosheets bridging. The crack propagations in conductive nacre are effectively inhibited through crack deflection with hydrogen bonding, and MXene nanosheets bridging between aragonite platelets. In addition, our conductive nacre also provides a self&#8208;monitoring function for structural damage and offers exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance. Our strategy of reassembling the aragonite platelets exfoliated from waste nacre into high&#8208;performance artificial nacre, provides an avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance bulk nanocomposites through the sustainable reutilization of shell resources.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Arylation of RNA 2&#8242;&#8208;OH Groups via SNAr Reaction with Trialkylammonium Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocyclic trialkylammonium arylating agents are shown to react efficiently with RNA in water, placing aryl ethers at 2&#8242;&#8208;O positions in the biopolymer. The reagents, which are stable for weeks in water but react with RNA in minutes to hours, can be used to modify and label RNA, and to probe its structure.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule reactions at the 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA enable useful applications for transcriptome technology and biology. To date, all reactions have involved carbonyl acylation and mechanistically related sulfonylation, limiting the types of modifications and properties that can be achieved. Here we report that electron&#8208;deficient heteroaryl species selectively react with 2&#8242;&#8208;OH groups of RNA in water via SNAr chemistry. In particular, trialkyl&#8208;ammonium (TAA)&#8208;activated aromatic heterocycles, prepared in one step from aryl chloride precursors, give high conversions to aryl ether adducts with RNAs in aqueous buffer in ~2&#8211;3&#8197;h.

     alt="Selective Arylation of RNA 2&#8242;-OH Groups via SNAr Reaction with Trialkylammonium Heterocycles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heterocyclic trialkylammonium arylating agents are shown to react efficiently with RNA in water, placing aryl ethers at 2&#8242;-O positions in the biopolymer. The reagents, which are stable for weeks in water but react with RNA in minutes to hours, can be used to modify and label RNA, and to probe its structure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-molecule reactions at the 2&#8242;-OH groups of RNA enable useful applications for transcriptome technology and biology. To date, all reactions have involved carbonyl acylation and mechanistically related sulfonylation, limiting the types of modifications and properties that can be achieved. Here we report that electron-deficient heteroaryl species selectively react with 2&#8242;-OH groups of RNA in water via S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar chemistry. In particular, trialkyl-ammonium (TAA)-activated aromatic heterocycles, prepared in one step from aryl chloride precursors, give high conversions to aryl ether adducts with RNAs in aqueous buffer in ~2&#8211;3&#8197;h. Remarkably, a TAA triazine previously used only for reaction with carboxylic acids, shows unprecedented selectivity for RNA over water, reacting rapidly with 2&#8242;-OH groups while exhibiting a half-life in water of &amp;gt;10&#8197;days. We further show that a triazine aryl species can be used as a probe at trace-level yields to map RNA structure in vitro. Finally, we prepare a number of functionalized trialkylammonium triazine reagents and show that they can be used to covalently label RNA efficiently for use in vitro and in living cells. This direct arylation chemistry offers a simple and distinct structural scaffold for post-synthetic RNA modification, with potential utility in multiple applications in transcriptome research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Arylation Polymerization at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylative polymerization. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers with high molecular weights. Notably, the mild reaction conditions are beneficial in terms of chemoselectivity. Our strategy thus opens a new avenue for sustainable and highly selective polymerizations.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization (CHAP) is an attractive tool for constructing &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers in a sustainable manner. However, the existing methods primarily rely on palladium catalysis, which usually entails harsh reaction conditions and branching/cross&#8208;linking. Here we report the first example of an ambient&#8208;temperature ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation polymerization induced by visible light irradiation. The present polymerization can produce various meta&#8208; and para&#8208;linked polymers in excellent yields with high molecular weights. The remarkable feature of our mild reaction platform is represented by high chemoselectivity, leading to polymers that are otherwise inaccessible under conventional reaction conditions at high temperatures.

         <title>Unveiling the Pivotal Role of dx2&#8722;y2 Electronic States in Nickel&#8208;Based Hydroxide Electrocatalysts for Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dx2&#8722;y2 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the Ni(OH)2&#8208;based methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital. The closer of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of dx2&#8722;y2 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. This work provides a new design paradigm for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;efficiency Ni(OH)2&#8208;based catalysts for MOR.







Abstract
The anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enables the sustainable production of the high&#8208;valued formate. Nickel&#8208;based hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as MOR electrocatalyst has attracted enormous attention. However, the key factor determining the intrinsic catalytic activity remains unknown, which significantly hinders the further development of Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst. Here, we found that the 
 electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the whole MOR process. The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of 
 orbital. The closer of 
 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of 
 orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. Our work for the first time clarifies the intrinsic relationship between 
 electronic state and the MOR activities, which adds a new layer of understanding to the methanol electrooxidation research scene.

         <title>3D Printing of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems with Linear and Bottlebrush Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polyelectrolyte complex, comprising anionic bottlebrush polymer and cationic linear polymer, exhibits a broader phase separation diagram and higher salt resistance capacity and vary spherical&#8208;like to core&#8211;shell&#8208;like conformation. Utilizing this system creates a tubular&#8208;like flow structure at the interface of two aqueous liquids, enhancing the structural stability, offering a more efficient and easy method for particle transport.







Abstract
We formed core&#8211;shell&#8208;like polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) from an anionic bottlebrush polymer with poly (acrylic acid) side chains with a cationic linear poly (allylamine hydrochloride). By varying the pH, the number of side chains of the polyanionic BB polymers (Nbb), the charge density of the polyelectrolytes, and the salt concentration, the phase separation behavior and salt resistance of the complexes could be tuned by the conformation of the BBs. By combining the linear/bottlebrush polyelectrolyte complexation with all&#8208;liquid 3D printing, flow&#8208;through tubular constructs were produced that showed selective transport across the PEC membrane comprising the walls of the tubules. These tubular constructs afford a new platform for flow&#8208;through delivery systems.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl electrophile has been developed to access diversified enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;tertiary amino acid with excellent enantioselectivity and broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of this protocol includes the efficient assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Tertiary amino acid derivatives constitute one of the most frequently occurring units in natural products and bioactive molecules. However, the efficient asymmetric synthesis of this motif still remains a significant challenge. Herein, we disclose a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective reductive addition reaction of ketimine using &#945;&#8208;chloro carbonyl compound as a radical precursor, providing expedient access to a diverse array of enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;quaternary amino acid analogues. This protocol exhibits outstanding enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope with excellent functional group tolerance. Preliminary mechanism studies rule out the possibility of Reformatsky&#8208;type addition and confirm the involvement of radical species in stereoselective addition process. The synthetic utility has been demonstrated through the rapid assembly of iterative amino acid units and oligopeptide, showcasing its versatile platform for late&#8208;stage modification of drug candidates.

         <title>Taylor Dispersion&#8208;Induced Phase Separation for the Efficient Characterisation of Protein Condensate Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein phase separation (PPS) is important in functional and disease biology but is challenging to study. We present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS) to study PPS in a reaction&#8208;diffusion system inside a microfluidic capillary.

Biomolecular condensates have emerged as important structures in cellular function and disease, and are thought to form through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Thorough and efficient in vitro experiments are therefore needed to elucidate the driving forces of protein LLPS and the possibility to modulate it with drugs. Here we present Taylor dispersion&#8208;induced phase separation (TDIPS), a method to robustly measure condensation phenomena using a commercially available microfluidic platform. It uses only nanoliters of sample, does not require extrinsic fluorescent labels, and is straightforward to implement. We demonstrate TDIPS by screening the phase behaviour of two proteins that form biomolecular condensates in vivo, PGL&#8208;3 and Ddx4. Uniquely accessible to this method, we find an unexpected re&#8208;entrant behaviour at very low ionic strength, where LLPS is inhibited for both proteins. TDIPS can also probe the reversibility of assemblies, which was shown for both &#945;&#8208;synuclein and for lysozyme, relevant for health and biotechnology, respectively. Finally, we highlight how effective inhibition concentrations and partitioning of LLPS&#8208;modifying compounds can be screened highly efficiently.

&lt;p&gt;Protein phase separation (PPS) is important in functional and disease biology but is challenging to study. We present Taylor dispersion induced phase separation (TDIPS) to study PPS in a reaction-diffusion system inside a microfluidic capillary. The resulting data is highly information-rich and allows for thermodynamic analysis but also efficient screening campaigns of phase separation-modulating compounds using only nanoliters of sample per data point.

         <title>Consolidation of the Oxidant&#8208;Free Au(I)/Au(III) Catalysis Enabled by the Hemilabile Ligand Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview we survey the novel approaches for oxidant&#8208;free Au(I)/Au(III) catalysis focusing on the hemilabile ligand strategy, where (P^N) MeDalphos hemilabile ligand stands as the most successful example. Moreover, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom couplings and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands and novel (C^N) hemilabile ligands are also reviewed.







Abstract
In this minireview we survey the challenges and strategies in gold redox catalysis. Gold's reluctance to oxidative addition reactions due to its high redox potential limits its applicability. Initial attempts to overcome this problem focused on the use of sacrificial external oxidants in stoichiometric amounts to bring Au(I) compounds to Au(III) reactive species. Recently, innovative approaches focused on employing hemilabile ligands, which are capable of coordinating to Au(I) and stabilizing square&#8208;planar Au(III) intermediates, thus facilitating oxidative addition steps and enabling oxidant&#8208;free catalysis. Notable examples include the use of the (P^N) bidendate MeDalphos ligand to achieve various cross&#8208;coupling reactions via oxidative addition Au(I)/Au(III). Importantly, hemilabile ligand&#8208;enabled catalysis allows merging oxidative addition with &#960;&#8208;activation, such as oxy&#8208; and aminoarylation of alkenols and alkenamines using organohalides, expanding gold&#8216;s versatility in C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bond formations and unprecedented cyclizations. Moreover, recent advancements in enantioselective catalysis using chiral hemilabile (P^N) ligands are also surveyed. Strikingly, versatile bidentate (C^N) hemilabile ligands as competitors of MeDalphos have appeared recently, by designing scaffolds where phosphine groups are substituted by N&#8208;heterocyclic or mesoionic carbenes. Overall, these approaches highlight the evolving landscape of gold redox catalysis and its tremendous potential in a broad scope of transformations.

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Ethers to Mitigate Electrode Surface Reactivity in High&#8208;Voltage NCM811&#8208;Li Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a non&#8208;fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolyte to prolong the lifespan of high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich ternary LMBs. The electrolyte simultaneously solves the challenges of both the high&#8208;voltage cathode and Li metal anode by mitigating the electrode surface reactivity. The problems of NiO rock&#8208;salt transition, intragranular crack/microstructural defect formation, gas releases, and over&#8208;growth SEI have been alleviated.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel (Ni)&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes exhibit twice the energy density of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, their lifespan is limited by severe side reactions caused by high electrode reactivity. Fluorinated solvent&#8208;based electrolytes can address this challenge, but they pose environmental and biological hazards. This work reports on the molecular engineering of fluorine (F)&#8208;free ethers to mitigate electrode surface reactivity in high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich LMBs. By merely extending the alkyl chains of traditional ethers, we effectively reduce the catalytic reactivity of the cathode towards the electrolyte at high voltages, which suppresses the oxidation decomposition of the electrolyte, microstructural defects and rock&#8208;salt phase formation in the cathode, and gas release issues. The high&#8208;voltage Ni&#8208;rich NCM811&#8208;Li battery delivers capacity retention of 80&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85&#8201;%, even superior to that in carbonate electrolytes. Additionally, this strategy facilitates passivation of the Li anode by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, boosting the Li reversibility to 99.11&#8201;% with a cycling life of 350&#8197;cycles, which outperforms conventional F&#8208;free ether electrolytes. Consequently, the lifespan of practical LMBs has been prolonged by over 100&#8201;% and 500&#8201;% compared to those in conventional carbonate&#8208; and ether&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively.

         <title>Engineering of Halide Methyltransferase BxHMT through Dynamic Cross&#8208;Correlation Network Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine assumes a crucial role in biocatalytic alkylation. To improve the catalytic ability of BxHMT towards methyl toluene sulfonate, a strategy named dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) was proposed for the identification of potential mutation sites, both distal and proximal. Experimental results proved the efficiency of the approach, which is expected to be a useful tool for other enzyme engineering studies.







Abstract
Halide methyltransferases (HMTs) provide an effective way to regenerate S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosyl homocysteine and reactive electrophiles, such as methyl iodide (MeI) and methyl toluene sulfonate (MeOTs). As compared with MeI, the cost&#8208;effective unnatural substrate MeOTs can be accessed directly from cheap and abundant alcohols, but shows only limited reactivity in SAM production. In this study, we developed a dynamic cross&#8208;correlation network analysis (DCCNA) strategy for quickly identifying hot spots influencing the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme, and applied it to the evolution of HMT from Paraburkholderia xenovorans. Finally, the optimal mutant, M4 (V55T/C125S/L127T/L129P), exhibited remarkable improvement, with a specific activity of 4.08&#8197;U/mg towards MeOTs, representing an 82&#8208;fold increase as compared to the wild&#8208;type (WT) enzyme. Notably, M4 also demonstrated a positive impact on the catalytic ability with other methyl donors. The structural mechanism behind the enhanced enzyme activity was uncovered by molecular dynamics simulations. Our work not only contributes a promising biocatalyst for the regeneration of SAM, but also offers a strategy for efficient enzyme engineering.

         <title>Detergent Chemistry Modulates the Transgression of Planetary Boundaries including Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's detergent o'clock and the role of detergent chemistry in transgressing Earth's resources is reviewed to support future research that secures safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival.







Abstract
Detergent chemistry enables applications in the world today while harming safe operating spaces that humanity needs for survival. Aim of this review is to support a holistic thought process in the design of detergent chemistry. We harness the planetary boundary concept as a framework for literature survey to identify progresses and knowledge gaps in context with detergent chemistry and five planetary boundaries that are currently transgressed, i.e., climate, freshwater, land system, novel entities, biosphere integrity. Our survey unveils the status of three critical challenges to be addressed in the years to come, including (i) the implementation of a holistically, climate&#8208;friendly detergent industry; (ii) the alignment of materialistic and social aspects in creating technical solutions by means of sustainable chemistry; (iii) the development of detergents that serve the purpose of applications but do not harm the biosphere in their role as novel entities. Specifically, medically relevant case reports revealed that even the most sophisticated detergent design cannot sufficiently accelerate drug discovery to outperform the antibiotic resistance development that detergents simultaneously promote as novel entities. Safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival may be secured by directing future efforts beyond sustainable chemistry, resource efficiency, and net zero emission targets.

         <title>Alveoli&#8208;Inspired Carbon Cathodes with Interconnected Porous Structure and Asymmetric Coordinated Vanadium Sites for Superior Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alveoli&#8208;inspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites has been proposed for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The asymmetric electronic distribution and large atom radius of S resulted in the sloping adsorption for polysulfide and low thermodynamic energy barriers, which resulted in enhanced sulfur adsorption&#8208;catalytic conversion and stable long&#8208;cycle performance for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Accelerating sulfur conversion catalysis to alleviate the shuttle effect has become a novel paradigm for effective Li&#8722;S batteries. Although nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom (M&#8722;N4) catalysts have been investigated, further optimizing its utilization rate and catalytic activities is urgently needed for practical applications. Inspired by the natural alveoli tissue with interconnected structure and well&#8208;distributed enzyme catalytic sites on the wall for the simultaneously fast diffusion and in situ catalytic conversion of substrates, here, we proposed the controllable synthesis of bioinspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8722;S1N3 sites for efficient and stable Li&#8722;S batteries. The enzyme&#8208;mimetic V&#8722;S1N3 shows asymmetric electronic distribution and high tunability, therefore enhancing in situ polysulfide conversion activities. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the high charge asymmetry degree and large atom radius of S in V&#8722;S1N3 result in sloping adsorption for polysulfide, thereby exhibiting low thermodynamic energy barriers and long&#8208;range stability (0.076&#8201;% decay over 600&#8197;cycles).

         <title>Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Monohydrosilanes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic kinetic resolution strategy was developed for the access of chiral Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes. By employing Rh&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation, both dihydrobenzosilole&#8208;based organosilanes and monohydrosilane containing ortho&#8208;vinyl group could be prepared with high efficiency and good to excellent selectivity factors in one single operation.







Abstract
The catalytic access of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes remains a big challenge, and largely depends on the desymmetrization of the symmetric precursors with two identical substitutes attached to silicon atom. Here we report the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes via catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic monohydrosilanes with good to excellent selectivity factors. Both Si&#8208;stereogenic dihydrobenzosiloles and Si&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes could be efficiently accessed in one single operation via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular hydrosilylation, employing (R,R)&#8208;Et&#8208;DuPhos as the optimal ligand. This catalytic protocol features mild conditions, a low catalyst loading (0.1&#8197;mol&#8201;% [Rh(cod)Cl]2), high stereoinduction (S factor up to 152), and excellent scalability. Moreover, further derivatizations led to the efficient synthesis of uncommon middle&#8208;size (7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered) Si&#8208;stereogenic silacycles. Preliminary mechanistic study indicates this reaction might undergo a modified Chalk&#8211;Harrod mechanism.

         <title>Fabrication of Large&#8208;Area Multi&#8208;Stimulus Responsive Thin Films via Interfacially Confined Irreversible Katritzky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films were fabricated through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions, vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination.







Abstract
Fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films through irreversible reactions remains a formidable task. This study reports a breakthrough strategy for in situ synthesis of large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The as resulted films are featured with adjustable thickness of 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and an area up to 50&#8197;cm2. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions (a response time of ca 0.1&#8197;s), vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. It was revealed that the reason behind the observable motions is proton transfer from the imine groups to the carbonyl structures within the film induced by photo&#8208; and/or dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;stimulus. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination. This study provides a new strategy for fabricating smart thin films via interfacially confined irreversible Katritzky reaction.

         <title>Stabilization of Pd0 by Cu Alloying: Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Pd3Cu Electrocatalyst for Anodic Methanol Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the anodic electrocarbonylation of methanol to produce DMC, our theoretical studies suggest Cu&#8722;Pd alloy not only stabilizes Pd0, the true active site, but also reduces the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. The theoretically predicted Pd3Cu, synthesized by a two&#8208;step thermal shock method, achieves FEDMC of 93&#8201;%@1.0&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl, far surpassing existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbonylation of CO and CH3OH to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) on metallic palladium (Pd) electrode offers a promising strategy for C1 valorization at the anode. However, its broader application is limited by the high working potential and the low DMC selectivity accompanied with severe methanol self&#8208;oxidation. Herein, our theoretical analysis of the intermediate adsorption interactions on both Pd0 and Pd4+ surfaces revealed that inevitable reconstruction of Pd surface under strongly oxidative potential diminishes its CO adsorption capacity, thus damaging the DMC formation. Further theoretical modeling indicates that doping Pd with Cu not only stabilizes low&#8208;valence Pd in oxidative environments but also lowers the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. Guided by this insight, we developed a facile two&#8208;step thermal shock method to prepare PdCu alloy electrocatalysts for DMC. Remarkably, the predicted Pd3Cu demonstrated the highest DMC selectivity among existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts, reaching a peaked DMC selectivity of 93&#8201;% at 1.0&#8197;V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. (Quasi) in situ spectra investigations further confirmed the predicted dual role of Cu dopant in promoting Pd&#8208;catalyzed DMC formation.

         <title>Anisotropic Semicrystalline Homopolymer Dielectrics for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy have been developed by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films.







Abstract
High&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers are in high demand for powering applications in extreme environments. Here, we have developed high&#8208;temperature homopolymer dielectrics with anisotropy by leveraging the hierarchical structure in semicrystalline polymers. The lamellae have been aligned parallel to the surface in the dielectric films. This structural arrangement resembles the horizontal alignment of nanosheet fillers in polymer nanocomposites and nanosheet&#8208;like lamellae in block copolymers, which has been proven to provide the optimal topological structure for electrical energy storage. The unique ordering of lamellae in our dielectric films endue a significantly increased breakdown strength and a reduced leakage current compared to amorphous films. This novel approach of enhancing the capacitive energy storage properties by controlled orientation of lamellae in homopolymer offers a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics.

         <title>Ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;Based Small Molecular Donor with Multiple Conformation Locks for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.3&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylenedioxythiophene was adopted to construct small molecular donor with multiple conformation locks, which can serve as efficient guest donor in ternary organic solar cells to provide cascade energy levels and two&#8208;dimensional charge transport channels, thus enabling high efficiency of 19.3&#8201;% compared to 18.2&#8201;% of the binary device.







Abstract
Ternary organic solar cells (T&#8208;OSCs) represent an efficient strategy for enhancing the performance of OSCs. Presently, the majority of high&#8208;performance T&#8208;OSCs incorporates well&#8208;established Y&#8208;acceptors or donor polymers as the third component. In this study, a novel class of conjugated small molecules has been introduced as the third component, demonstrating exceptional photovoltaic performance in T&#8208;OSCs. This innovative molecule comprises ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridge and 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine as the end group, with the EDOT unit facilitating the creation of multiple conformation locks. Consequently, the EDOT&#8208;based molecule exhibits two&#8208;dimensional charge transport, distinguishing it from the thiophene&#8208;bridged small molecule, which displays fewer conformation locks and provides one&#8208;dimensional charge transport. Furthermore, the robust electron&#8208;donating nature of EDOT imparts the small molecule with cascade energy levels relative to the electron donor and acceptor. As a result, OSCs incorporating the EDOT&#8208;based small molecule as the third component demonstrate enhanced mobilities, yielding a remarkable efficiency of 19.3&#8201;%, surpassing the efficiency of 18.7&#8201;% observed for OSCs incorporating thiophene&#8208;based small molecule as the third component. The investigations in this study underscore the excellence of EDOT as a building block for constructing conjugated materials with multiple conformation locks and high charge carrier mobilities, thereby contributing to elevated photovoltaic performance in OSCs.

         <title>Electrochemical Asymmetric Radical Functionalization of Aldehydes Enabled by a Redox Shuttle</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminocatalysis and electrochemistry cooperate, enabling SOMO&#8208;type transformations for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. Electricity drives enantioselective radical processes via oxidation of catalytically generated enamines. Key is the use of a biphenyl redox shuttle to prevent catalyst degradation, yielding desired compounds with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Aminocatalysis is a well&#8208;established tool that enables the production of enantioenriched compounds under mild conditions. Its versatility is underscored by its seamless integration with various synthetic approaches. While the combination of aminocatalysis with metal catalysis, photochemistry, and stoichiometric oxidants has been extensively explored, its synergy with electrochemical activation remains largely unexplored. Herein, we present the successful merger of electrochemistry and aminocatalysis to perform SOMO&#8208;type transformations, expanding the toolkit for asymmetric electrochemical synthesis. The methodology harnesses electricity to drive the oxidation of catalytically generated enamines, which ultimately partake in enantioselective radical processes, leading to &#945;&#8208;alkylated aldehydes. Crucially, mechanistic studies highlight how this electrochemical strategy is enabled by the use of a redox shuttle, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxybiphenyl, to prevent catalyst degradation and furnishing the coveted compounds in good yield and high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Photon Upconversion Cooperates with Downshifting in Chiral Systems: Modulation, Amplification, and Applications of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photon upconversion, cooperating with downshifting in chiral systems, offers a powerful method to modulate circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in several ways: (1) Dual upconverted CPL (UCCPL) from the acceptor and downshifting CPL (DSCPL) from the donor can be simultaneously emitted upon excitation with low&#8208;energy light. (2) In dual&#8208;excitation system, the acceptor can produce both UCCPL and DSCPL, each with distinct dissymmetry factor values, depending on whether it is excited by low energy or high energy.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active materials are increasingly recognized for their potential applications such as 3D imaging, data storage, and optoelectronic devices. Typically, CPL materials have required high&#8208;energy (HE) photons for excitation to emit low&#8208;energy (LE) circularly polarized light, a process known as downshifting CPL (DSCPL). However, the emergence of upconverted CPL (UCCPL), where the absorption of multi LE photons results in the emission of a single HE photon with circular polarization, has recently attracted considerable attention. This minireview highlights the intricate relationship between upconversion and CPL phenomena. During upconversion, the dissymmetry factor (glum) value can be improved in certain systems. Additionally, the integration of both LE and HE photons in upconversion&#8208;downshifting&#8208;synergistic systems offers avenues for dual&#8208;excitation or dual&#8208;emission CPL functionalities. More in detail, the emerging UCCPL based on various photon upconversion mechanisms and their synergy with DSCPL are introduced. Additionally, several examples that demonstrate the applications of UCCPL are presented to highlight the future opportunities.

         <title>An Artificial Enzyme for Asymmetric Nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes&#8212;Design and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of an artificial enzyme that features a secondary amine residue by genetic code expansion is described. The designer enzyme was evolved to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of cinnamaldehydes at high conversions with excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The introduction of an abiological catalytic group into the binding pocket of a protein host allows for the expansion of enzyme chemistries. Here, we report the generation of an artificial enzyme by genetic encoding of a non&#8208;canonical amino acid that contains a secondary amine side chain. The non&#8208;canonical amino acid and the binding pocket function synergistically to catalyze the asymmetric nitrocyclopropanation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes by the iminium activation mechanism. The designer enzyme was evolved to an optimal variant that catalyzes the reaction at high conversions with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. This work demonstrates the application of genetic code expansion in enzyme design and expands the scope of enzyme&#8208;catalyzed abiological reactions.

         <title>Chemical Control of Fluorescence Lifetime towards Multiplexing Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the chemical control of fluorescence lifetimes of boron dipyrromethene derivatives through the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process and the intramolecular charge transfer process. The resulting fluorophores were applied in fluorescence lifetime multiplexing imaging both in vitro and in vivo.







Abstract
Fluorescence lifetime imaging has been a powerful tool for biomedical research. Recently, fluorescence lifetime&#8208;based multiplexing imaging has expanded imaging channels by using probes that harbor the same spectral channels and distinct excited state lifetime. While it is desirable to control the excited state lifetime of any given fluorescent probes, the rational control of fluorescence lifetimes remains a challenge. Herein, we chose boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) as a model system and provided chemical strategies to regulate the fluorescence lifetime of its derivatives with varying spectral features. We find electronegativity of structural substituents at the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions is important to control the lifetime for the green&#8208;emitting and red&#8208;emitting BODIPY scaffolds. Mechanistically, such influences are exerted via the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer and the intramolecular charge transfer processes for the 8&#8242; and 5&#8242; positions of BODIPY, respectively. Based on these principles, we have generated a group of BODIPY probes that enable imaging experiments to separate multiple targets using fluorescence lifetime as a signal. In addition to BODIPY, we envision modulation of electronegativity of chemical substituents could serve as a feasible strategy to achieve rational control of fluorescence lifetime for a variety of small molecule fluorophores.

         <title>Similarities and Differences in Benzene Reduction with Ca, Sr, Yb and Sm: Strong Evidence for Tetra&#8208;Anionic Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse sandwich benzene complexes are prone to metal oxidation state ambiguities. Based on comparisons between alkaline&#8208;earth and lanthanide metals, we provide strong evidence for the formal formation of a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex.







Abstract
Inverse sandwich complexes of Yb and Sm stabilized by a bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) ligand have been prepared: (BDI)Ln(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C6H6)Ln(BDI); Ln=lanthanide. Coordinated benzene ligands can be neutral, di&#8208;anionic or, often controversially discussed, even tetra&#8208;anionic. The formal charge on benzene is correlated to assignment of the metal oxidation state which generally poses a problem. Herein, we take advantage of the structural similarities found when comparing CaII with YbII, and SrII with SmII complexes. In this work, we found an excellent overlap of the Ca/Yb inverse sandwich structures but a striking difference for the Sr/Sm pair. The much shorter Sm&#8722;N and Sm&#8208;C6H6 distances are strong evidence for a SmIII&#8208;benzene&#8722;4&#8208;SmIII assignment. This was further supported by NMR spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, reactivity and comprehensive computational investigation.

         <title>Breaking Highly Ordered PtPbBi Intermetallic with Disordered Amorphous Phase for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin amorphous/intermetallic heterophase PtPbBi NSs were synthesized for the first time, which exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in HER and AORs owing to their unique heterointerfaces and abundant exposed active sites. Construction of amorphous/crystalline heterophase structures with multimetallic composition can effectively optimize the Gibbs free energy and enhance the electron transfer from the surface of the catalyst to *CH2OH.







Abstract
Constructing amorphous/intermetallic (A/IMC) heterophase structures by breaking the highly ordered IMC phase with disordered amorphous phase is an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal&#8208;based IMC electrocatalysts because of the optimized electronic structure and abundant heterophase boundaries as active sites. In this study, we report the synthesis of ultrathin A/IMC PtPbBi nanosheets (NSs) for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alcohol oxidation reactions. The resulting A/IMC PtPbBi NSs exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of only 25&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the HER in an acidic electrolyte, together with outstanding stability for 100&#8197;h. In addition, the PtPbBi NSs show high mass activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), which are 13.2 and 14.5 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of amorphous/intermetallic components and multimetallic composition facilitate the electron transfer from the catalyst to key intermediates, thus improving the catalytic activity of MOR. This work establishes a novel pathway for the synthesis of heterophase two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with high electrocatalytic performance across a wide range of electrochemical applications.

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities in Reactivating Inactive Lithium in Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of inactive lithium is one of the main culprits of lithium metal battery failures. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we summarized the formation of inactive lithium and reassessed its impact on battery performance metrics, discussed the cutting&#8208;edge of various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. By concluding existing strategies, we raised some unsolved questions and highlighted opportunities regarding inactive lithium and essential factors for reactivation strategies.







Abstract
The loss of active materials is one of the main culprits of the battery failures. As a typical example, the presence of inactive lithium, also known as &#8220;dead lithium&#8221;, contributes to the rapid capacity deterioration and reduces energy output in lithium batteries. This phenomenon has long been recognized as irreversible. In this Minireview, the first of this kind, we aim to summarize the formation of inactive lithium and reassess its impact on battery performance metrics. Additionally, we explore various strategies that have been devised to rejuvenate inactive lithium. This comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in reactivating inactive lithium not only offers insights into restoring capacity and enhancing battery performance metrics but also provides a foundation for future research in reviving other inactive materials found in next&#8208;generation batteries, such as lithium metal batteries, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, other alkali metal batteries, and liquid flow batteries.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Open&#8208;Shell Conjugated Polymer with High&#8208;Spin Ground&#8208;State and High Intrinsic Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;shell conjugated polymer has been synthesized with the ultralow&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and high&#8208;spin ground&#8208;state, affording a high intrinsic conductivity of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 without additional dopants and a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 in organic thermoelectrics.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers with a high intrinsic conductivity and high&#8208;spin ground state hold considerable promise for applications in organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, two novel acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8211;A) conjugated polymers based on a highly electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal benzodifurandione unit have been developed, namely DPP&#8208;BFDO&#8208;Th and DPP&#8208;BFDO. The incorporation of the quinoidal moiety into the polymers backbones enables deeply aligned lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of below &#8722;4.0&#8197;eV. Notably, DPP&#8208;BFDO exhibits an exceptionally low LUMO (&#8722;4.63&#8197;eV) and a high&#8208;spin ground state characterized by strong diradical characters. Moreover, a self&#8208;doping through intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer is observed for DPP&#8208;BFDO, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. The high carrier concentration in combination with a planar and linear conjugated backbone yields a remarkable electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 1.04&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the &#8220;undoped&#8221; native form, ranking among the highest values reported for n&#8208;type radical&#8208;based conjugated polymers. When employed as an n&#8208;type thermoelectric material, DPP&#8208;BFDO achieves a power factor of 12.59&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2. Furthermore, upon n&#8208;doping, the &#963; could be improved to 65.68&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. This study underscores the great potential of electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal units in constructing dopant&#8208;free n&#8208;type conductive polymers with a high&#8208;spin ground state and exceptional intrinsic conductivity.

         <title>Small Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Based Molecule Drives Strong Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we develop a facile supramolecular modification strategy for the construction of ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule adhesives. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the high adhesion strength could serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of novel adhesive materials. We anticipate that our work will facilitate the advancement and application of small&#8208;molecule adhesives in many burgeoning fields.







Abstract
Nature has inspired scientists to fabricate adhesive materials for applications in many burgeoning areas. However, it is still a significant challenge to develop small&#8208;molecule adhesives with high&#8208;strength, low&#8208;temperature and recyclable properties, although these merits are of great interest in various aspects. Herein, we report a series of strong adhesives based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecular solids driven by the terminal modification of ionic liquids (ILs) and subsequent supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The emergence of high strength and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for these supramolecular aggregates relies on modifying IL with a high melting point motif and enriching the types of noncovalent interactions in the original ILs. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that our IL&#8208;based molecular solids can efficiently obtain a high adhesion strength (up to 8.95&#8197;MPa). Importantly, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the reversible and strong adhesion enabled by monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer transitions. These fundamental findings provide guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance supramolecular adhesive materials.

A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the high adhesion strength could serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of novel adhesive materials. We anticipate that our work will facilitate the advancement and application of small-molecule adhesives in many burgeoning fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature has inspired scientists to fabricate adhesive materials for applications in many burgeoning areas. However, it is still a significant challenge to develop small-molecule adhesives with high-strength, low-temperature and recyclable properties, although these merits are of great interest in various aspects. Herein, we report a series of strong adhesives based on low-molecular-weight molecular solids driven by the terminal modification of ionic liquids (ILs) and subsequent supramolecular self-assembly. The emergence of high strength and liquid-to-solid transitions for these supramolecular aggregates relies on modifying IL with a high melting point motif and enriching the types of noncovalent interactions in the original ILs. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that our IL-based molecular solids can efficiently obtain a high adhesion strength (up to 8.95&#8197;MPa). Importantly, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the reversible and strong adhesion enabled by monomer-to-polymer transitions. These fundamental findings provide guidance for the design of high-performance supramolecular adhesive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of an FeII Complex Exhibiting Intermolecular Proton Shifting Coupled Spin Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline material based on an FeII hydrazone complex was synthesized to observe intermolecular proton shifting. The complex exhibits reversible intermolecular proton shifting&#8208;coupled spin transition. This study paves the way for the development of novel functional materials with tunable properties.







Abstract
In this study, we investigated reversible intermolecular proton shifting (IPS) coupled with spin transition (ST) in a novel FeII complex. The host FeII complex and the guest carboxylic acid anion were connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs). We extended the intramolecular proton transfer coupled ST phenomenon to the intermolecular system. The dynamic phenomenon was confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron crystallography, and infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism of IPS was further validated using density functional theory calculations. The discovery of IPS&#8208;coupled ST in crystalline molecular materials provides good insights into fundamental processes and promotes the design of novel multifunctional materials with tunable properties for various applications, such as optoelectronics, information storage, and molecular devices.

         <title>Upgrading Electrolyte Antioxidant Chemistry by Constructing Potential Scaling Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of advanced electrolytes to improve the high&#8208;voltage capability has been attracting wide attention as one critical solution to enable next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the limited understanding of electrolyte antioxidant chemistry as well as the lack of valid quantization approaches have resulted in knowledge gap, which hinders the formulation of new electrolytes. Herein, we construct a standard curve based on representative solvation structures to quantify the oxidation stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes, which reveals the linear correlation between the oxidation potential and the atomic charge of the least oxidation&#8208;resistant solvent. Dictating by the regularity between solvation composition and oxidation potential, a (Trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte dominated by anion&#8208;less solvation structures was designed to optimize the cycling performance of 4.5 V 30&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;Li||3.8&#8208;mAh cm&#8208;2&#8208;LiCoO2 batteries, which maintained 80% capacity retention even after 440 cycles. The consistency of experimental and computational results validates the proposed principles, offering a fundamental guideline to evaluate and design aggressive electrochemical systems.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazone&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural flexibility, heteroatomic sites, post&#8208;modification ability and high hydrolytic stability have attracted great attention from scientific community. Hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs, as a subclass of Schiff&#8208;base COFs, was firstly reported in 2011 by Yaghi&#8217;s group and later witnessed prosperous development in various aspects. Their adjustable structures, precise pore channels and plentiful heteroatomic sites of hydrazone&#8208;linked structures possess much potential in diverse applications, for example, adsorption/separation, chemical sensing, catalysis and energy storage, etc. Up to date, the systematic reviews about the reported hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs are still rare. Therefore, in this review, we will summarize their preparation methods, characteristics and related applications, and discuss the opportunity or challenge of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs. We hope this review could provide new insights about hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs for exploring more appealing functions or applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Environmentally Friendly Dual&#8208;crosslinking Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (EF&#8208;DCPNs) emerge as breakthrough solutions to address the trade&#8208;off between mechanical robustness and dynamic behaviors, while greatly eliminating environmental impacts. This review summarizes current status of synthesis, properties, and applications of EF&#8208;DCPNs and provides perspectives on the future development in this important field.







Abstract
Environmentally friendly crosslinked polymer networks feature degradable covalent or non&#8208;covalent bonds, with many of them manifesting dynamic characteristics. These attributes enable convenient degradation, facile reprocessibility, and self&#8208;healing capabilities. However, the inherent instability of these crosslinking bonds often compromises the mechanical properties of polymer networks, limiting their practical applications. In this context, environmentally friendly dual&#8208;crosslinking polymer networks (denoted EF&#8208;DCPNs) have emerged as promising alternatives to address this challenge. These materials effectively balance the need for high mechanical properties with the ability to degrade, recycle, and/or self&#8208;heal. Despite their promising potential, investigations into EF&#8208;DCPNs remain in their nascent stages, and several gaps and limitations persist. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the synthesis, properties, and applications of recent progress in EF&#8208;DCPNs. Firstly, synthetic routes to a rich variety of EF&#8208;DCPNs possessing two distinct types of dynamic bonds (i.e., imine, disulfide, ester, hydrogen bond, coordination bond, and other bonds) are introduced. Subsequently, complex structure&#8208; and dynamic nature&#8208;dependent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of EF&#8208;DCPNs are discussed, followed by their exemplary applications in electronics and biotechnology. Finally, future research directions in this rapidly evolving field are outlined.

         <title>Boost the Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence of Chiral Organometallic Platinum Complexes by Hierarchical Assembly into Fibrillar Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thin films of chiral Pt(II) complexes exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934; of ~50&#8201;% in air, as a result of the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. These films display promising potentials in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing circularly polarized light generation from achiral emitters and common LED lamps.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active molecular materials have drawn increasing attention due to their promising applications for next&#8208;generation display and optoelectronic technologies. Currently, it is challenging to obtain CPL materials with both large luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) and high quantum yield (&#934;). A pair of enantiomeric N&#8201;N&#8201;C&#8208;type Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;1 modified with chiral Leucine methyl ester are presented herein. Though the solutions of these complexes are CPL&#8208;inactive, the spin&#8208;coated thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 exhibit giantly&#8208;amplified circularly polarized phosphorescences with |glum| of 0.53 at 560&#8197;nm and &#934;air of ~50&#8201;%, as well as appealing circular dichroism (CD) signals with the maximum absorption dissymmetry factor |gabs| of 0.37&#8211;0.43 at 480&#8197;nm. This superior CPL performance benefits from the hierarchical formation of crystalline fibrillar networks upon spin coating. Comparative studies of another pair of chiral Pt(II) complexes (L/D)&#8208;2 with a symmetric N&#8201;C&#8201;N coordination mode suggest that the asymmetric N&#8201;N&#8201;C coordination of (L/D)&#8208;1 are favorable for the efficient exciton delocalization to amplify the CPL performance. Optical applications of the thin films of (L/D)&#8208;1 in CPL&#8208;contrast imaging and inducing CP light generation from achiral emitters and common light&#8208;emitting diode lamps have been successfully realized.

         <title>Construct Phenylethanoid Glycosides Harnessing Biosynthetic Networks, Protein Engineering and One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade platform was established to synthesize various phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs). In total 12 catalytic enzymes were characterized to illustrate a complex biosynthetic network; 3&#8197;enzymes were engineered to broaden sugar donor and substrate selectivity; 46&#8197;PhGs could be constructed. PhGs with additional glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated liver cell protection effect.







Abstract
Phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) exhibit a multitude of structural variations linked to diverse pharmacological activities. Assembling various PhGs via multienzyme cascades represents a concise strategy over traditional synthetic methods. However, the challenge lies in identifying a comprehensive set of catalytic enzymes. This study explores biosynthetic PhG reconstruction from natural precursors, aiming to replicate and amplify their structural diversity. We discovered 12 catalytic enzymes, including four novel 6&#8242;&#8208;OH glycosyltransferases and three new polyphenol oxidases, revealing the intricate network in PhG biosynthesis. Subsequently, the crystal structure of CmGT3 (2.62&#8197;&#197;) was obtained, guiding the identification of conserved residue 144# as a critical determinant for sugar donor specificity. Engineering this residue in PhG glycosyltransferases (FsGT61, CmGT3, and FsGT6) altered their sugar donor recognition. Finally, a one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade was established, where the combined action of glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases boosted conversion rates by up to 12.6&#8208;fold. This cascade facilitated the reconstruction of 26&#8197;PhGs with conversion rates ranging from 5&#8211;100&#8201;%, and 20 additional PhGs detectable by mass spectrometry. PhGs with extra glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated notable liver cell protection. This work not only provides catalytic tools for PhG biosynthesis, but also serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for cell&#8208;free enzymatic construction of diverse natural products.

         <title>Tuning Electron Delocalization of Redox&#8208;Active Porous Aromatic Framework for Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zn&#8722;K Hybrid Batteries with Air Self&#8208;Chargeability</title>

         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first case of applying redox&#8208;active porous organic polymer for aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid batteries with air self&#8208;chargeability, presenting a redox chemistry with K+ as the charge carriers and regulates Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping, thus showing the impressively electrochemical properties in bending, all&#8208;climate and air self&#8208;charging conditions.







Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries promise to integrate energy harvesting technology and battery systems, potentially overcoming a heavy reliance on energy and the spatiotemporal environment. However, the exploitation of multifunctional air self&#8208;charging battery systems using promising cathode materials and suitable charge carriers remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, we developed low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8722;K hybrid ion batteries (AZKHBs) using a fully conjugated hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based porous aromatic framework as the cathode material, exhibiting redox chemistry using K+ as charge carriers, and regulating Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping. The unique AZKHBs exhibit the exceptional electrochemical properties in all&#8208;climate conditions. Most importantly, the large potential difference causes the AZKHBs discharged cathode to be oxidized using oxygen, thereby initiating a self&#8208;charging process in the absence of an external power source. Impressively, the air self&#8208;charging AZKHBs can achieve a maximum voltage of 1.15&#8197;V, an impressive discharge capacity (466.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and exceptional self&#8208;charging performance even at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, the development of self&#8208;charging AZKHBs offers a solution to the limitations imposed by the absence of a power grid in harsh environments or remote areas.

         <title>A Dielectric MXene&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Built Electric Field in Polymer Electrolyte Triggering Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport and High&#8208;Voltage Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;built electric field strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene, resulting in the formation of LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI enhanced stable interfaces, as evidenced by XPS etching and ToF&#8208;SIMS. It showcases prolonged cycle life at a high voltage up to 4.6&#8197;V, showing promising applications for quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QPE) lithium (Li)&#8208;metal battery holds significant promise in the application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, yet it suffers from low ionic conductivity and poor oxidation stability. Herein, a novel self&#8208;built electric field (SBEF) strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon&#8208;fluorine bond cleavage in LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene. Among them, the SBEF induced by dielectric Nb4C3F2 MXene effectively constructs highly conductive LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI stable interfaces, moreover, enhances the electrochemical performance of the QPE. The related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism and dual&#8208;reinforced stable interface are thoroughly investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics, COMSOL, XPS depth profiling, and ToF&#8208;SIMS. This comprehensive approach results in a high conductivity of 1.34&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, leading to a small polarization of approximately 25&#8197;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 6000&#8197;h. Furthermore, it enables a prolonged cycle life at a high voltage of up to 4.6&#8197;V. Overall, this work not only broadens the application of MXene for QPE but also inspires the great potential of the self&#8208;built electric field in QPE&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.

         <title>Silica Confinement for Stable and Magnetic Co&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet effective spatial confinement strategy is proposed to construct high&#8208;efficiency catalysts through carbonizing a mesoporous silica&#8208;confined Co&#8722;Cu bimetal&#8211;organic framework for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis. The optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst exhibits superior activity, outstanding stability, and magnetic recyclability for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis under extremely mild conditions.







Abstract
Ammonia borane (AB) with 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2 content is widely considered a safe and efficient medium for H2 storage and release. Co&#8208;based nanocatalysts present strong contenders for replacing precious metal&#8208;based catalysts in AB hydrolysis due to their high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, precisely adjusting the active centers and surface properties of Co&#8208;based nanomaterials to enhance their activity, as well as suppressing the migration and loss of metal atoms to improve their stability, presents many challenges. In this study, mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;confined bimetallic Co&#8722;Cu nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (CoxCu1&#8722;x@NC@mSiO2) were synthesized using a facile mSiO2&#8208;confined thermal pyrolysis strategy. The obtained product, an optimized Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 catalyst, exhibits enhanced performance with a turnover frequency of 240.9&#8197;molH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;molmetal&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&#8722;1 for AB hydrolysis at 298&#8197;K, surpassing most noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts. Moreover, Co0.8Cu0.2@NC@mSiO2 demonstrates magnetic recyclability and extraordinary stability, with a negligible decline of only 0.8&#8201;% over 30&#8197;cycles of use. This enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Cu, as well as silica confinement. This work proposes a promising method for constructing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts for AB hydrolysis.

     alt="Silica Confinement for Stable and Magnetic Co&#8722;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles in Nitrogen-Doped Carbon for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile yet effective spatial confinement strategy is proposed to construct high-efficiency catalysts through carbonizing a mesoporous silica-confined Co&#8722;Cu bimetal&#8211;organic framework for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis. The optimized Co&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;@NC@mSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst exhibits superior activity, outstanding stability, and magnetic recyclability for hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis under extremely mild conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia borane (AB) with 19.6&#8197;wt&#8201;% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content is widely considered a safe and efficient medium for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage and release. Co-based nanocatalysts present strong contenders for replacing precious metal-based catalysts in AB hydrolysis due to their high activity and cost-effectiveness. However, precisely adjusting the active centers and surface properties of Co-based nanomaterials to enhance their activity, as well as suppressing the migration and loss of metal atoms to improve their stability, presents many challenges. In this study, mesoporous-silica-confined bimetallic Co&#8722;Cu nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (Co&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;@NC@mSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) were synthesized using a facile mSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-confined thermal pyrolysis strategy. The obtained product, an optimized Co&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;@NC@mSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, exhibits enhanced performance with a turnover frequency of 240.9&#8197;mol&lt;sub&gt;H2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mol&lt;sub&gt;metal&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for AB hydrolysis at 298&#8197;K, surpassing most noble-metal-free catalysts. Moreover, Co&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;@NC@mSiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates magnetic recyclability and extraordinary stability, with a negligible decline of only 0.8&#8201;% over 30&#8197;cycles of use. This enhanced performance was attributed to the synergistic effect between Co and Cu, as well as silica confinement.

This review systematically introduces the cross&#8208;scale applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR, covering electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal structure, and devices, spanning from atomic scales to mesoscopic scales.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhance the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro&#8208;environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable. Synchrotron radiation has been recognized as a versatile characterization platform, garnering widespread attention owing to its high brightness, elevated flux, excellent directivity, strong polarization and exceptional stability. This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron radiationanalytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fourth&#8208;generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron radiation analytical techniques is proposed.
