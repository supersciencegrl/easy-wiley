         <title>Machine Learning Algorithm Guides Catalyst Choices for Magnesium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carefully curated dataset of reactions catalyzed by magnesium&#8208;based catalysts underlies a Machine&#8208;Learning model guiding the choices of catalysts &#8220;optimal&#8221; for reactions unseen during training. When this model is tested by experiment, it suggests catalysts that yield higher ee values, replace rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts, or improve the efficiency of stereoselective transformations relevant to drug discovery.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;chemical literature encompasses large numbers of catalysts and reactions they can effect. Many of these examples are published merely to document the catalysts&#8217; scope but do not necessarily guarantee that a given catalyst is &#8220;optimal&#8221;&#8212;in terms of yield or enantiomeric excess&#8212;for a particular reaction. This paper describes a Machine Learning model that aims to improve such catalyst&#8208;reaction assignments based on the carefully curated literature data. As we show here for the case of asymmetric magnesium catalysis, this model achieves relatively high accuracy and offers out of&#8208;the&#8208;box predictions successfully validated by experiment, e.g., in synthetically demanding asymmetric reductions or Michael additions.

         <title>CdS Quantum Dot Gels as a Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer Photocatalyst for C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS quantum dot gels are potent direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalysts for C&#8722;H bond activation, in which photoexcited CdS directly attracts a hydrogen atom from a C&#8722;H substrate to generate a neutral radical.







Abstract
Here, we report CdS quantum dot (QD) gels, a three&#8208;dimensional network of interconnected CdS QDs, as a new type of direct hydrogen atom transfer (d&#8208;HAT) photocatalyst for C&#8722;H activation. We discovered that the photoexcited CdS QD gel could generate various neutral radicals, including &#945;&#8208;amido, heterocyclic, acyl, and benzylic radicals, from their corresponding stable molecular substrates, including amides, thio/ethers, aldehydes, and benzylic compounds. Its C&#8722;H activation ability imparts a broad substrate and reaction scope. The mechanistic study reveals that this reactivity is intrinsic to CdS materials, and the neutral radical generation did not proceed via the conventional sequential electron transfer and proton transfer pathway. Instead, the C&#8722;H bonds are activated by the photoexcited CdS QD gel via a d&#8208;HAT mechanism. This d&#8208;HAT mechanism is supported by the linear correlation between the logarithm of the C&#8722;H bond activation rate constant and the C&#8722;H bond dissociation energy (BDE) with a Br&#248;nsted slope &#945;=0.5. Our findings expand the currently limited direct hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis toolbox and provide new possibilities for photocatalytic C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>Inducing Immunogenic Cancer Cell Death through Oxygen&#8208;Economized Photodynamic Therapy with Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two NO&#8208;releasing phthalocyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers have been prepared which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration through the NO released upon the interaction with the intracellular glutathione, sparing more oxygen for the photodynamic action. This oxygen&#8208;economized photodynamic therapy can also elicit the release of various damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, effectively triggering immunogenic cell death.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes reactive oxygen species (ROS) for eradication of cancer cells. Its effectiveness is governed by the oxygen content, which is scarce in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We report herein two zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing moieties, namely ZnPc&#8208;2NO and ZnPc&#8208;4NO, which can suppress the mitochondrial respiration, thereby sparing more intracellular oxygen for PDT. Using HT29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and A549 human lung carcinoma cells, we have demonstrated that both conjugates release NO upon interaction with the intracellular glutathione, which can reduce the cellular oxygen consumption rate and adenosine triphosphate generation and alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. They can also relieve the hypoxic status of cancer cells and decrease the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor protein HIF&#8208;1&#945;. Upon light irradiation, both conjugates can generate ROS and induce cytotoxicity even under a hypoxic condition, overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent nature of PDT. Interestingly, the photodynamic action of ZnPc&#8208;2NO elicits the release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, inducing the maturation of dendritic cells and triggering an antitumor immune response. The immunogenic cell death caused by this oxygen&#8208;economized PDT has been demonstrated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.

         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A type selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide derivative (SePDI3) is developed as CIM for OSCs. SePDI3 shows simultaneous superior charge transport and extraction capacity. Finally, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displayed a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy in the development of high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.







Abstract
The cathode interlayer is crucial for the development of organic solar cells (OSCs), but the research on simple and efficient interlayer materials is lagging behind. Here, a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) typed selenophene&#8208;fused perylene diimide (PDI) derivative (SePDI3) is developed as cathode interlayer material (CIM) for OSCs, and a non&#8208;fused PDI derivative (PDI3) is used as the control CIM for comparison. Compared to PDI3, SePDI3 shows a stronger self&#8208;doping effect and better crystallinity, resulting in better charge transport ability. Furthermore, the interaction between SePDI3 and L8&#8208;BO can form an efficient extraction channel, leading to superior charge extraction behavior. Finally, benefitting from significantly enhanced charge transport and extraction capacity, the SePDI3&#8208;based device displays a champion PCE of 19.04&#8201;% with an ultrahigh fill factor of 81.65&#8201;% for binary OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO active layer, which is one of the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs based novel CIMs. Our work prescribes a facile and effective fusion strategy to develop high&#8208;efficiency CIMs for OSCs.

The spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in Co3O4 can be fine&#8208;regulated by a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling involving the CoOh t2g, O 2p, and Ce t2u orbital. Mechanism investigations reveal that&#160;a &#960;&#8208;donation interaction between the bridging O 2p and Ce fyz2 orbital effectively bolsters the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. The obtained electrocatalyst with the eg occupancy optimized to 1.094 presents an excellent water oxidation performance.







Abstract
Spin state is often regarded as the crucial valve to release the reactivity of energy&#8208;related catalysts, yet it is also challenging to precisely manipulate, especially for the active center ions occupied at the specific geometric sites. Herein, a &#960;&#8211;&#960; type orbital coupling of 3d (Co)&#8208;2p (O)&#8208;4f (Ce) was employed to regulate the spin state of octahedral cobalt sites (CoOh) in the composite of Co3O4/CeO2. More specifically, the equivalent high&#8208;spin ratio of CoOh can reach to 54.7&#8201;% via tuning the CeO2 content, thereby triggering the average eg filling (1.094) close to the theoretical optimum value. The corresponding catalyst exhibits a superior water oxidation performance with an overpotential of 251&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, rivaling most cobalt&#8208;based oxides state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; type coupling corroborated by the matched energy levels between Ce t1u/t2u&#8208;O and CoOh t2g&#8208;O &#960; type bond in the calculated crystal orbital Hamilton population and partial density of states profiles, stimulates a &#960;&#8208;donation between O 2p and &#960;&#8208;symmetric Ce 4fyz2 orbital, consequently facilitating the electrons hopping from t2g to eg orbital of CoOh. This work offers an in&#8208;depth insight into understanding the 4f and 3d orbital coupling for spin state optimization in composite oxides.

         <title>A Fragment&#8208;Based Competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR Platform For Hotspot&#8208;Directed Ligand Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fragment screening identified three ligand binding hotspots across the active site of 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase from Mycobacterium abscessus. Fragment sized fluorinated reporters were developed for each hotspot and used in competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR experiments to quantify hotspot&#8208;specific ligand binding affinities across three orders of magnitude, from low mM to low &#956;M.







Abstract
Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F Ligand Based&#8197;NMR (LB&#8208;NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand&#8208;binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4&#8242;&#8208;phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). X&#8208;ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960&#8208;member fragment screen identified three ligand&#8208;binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of 19F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single 19F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR with this suite of 19F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X&#8208;ray crystallography. This quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment&#8208;based competitive 19F&#8197;LB&#8208;NMR screening platform for hotspot&#8208;directed ligand profiling

         <title>The Dependence of Solid Electrolyte Interphase on the Crystal Facet of Current Collector in Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of Cu facets on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and Li deposition behavior are demonstrated using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The strong adsorption of Cu(100) facet to anions guides more anions to participate in the inner Helmholtz plane and promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foil with a single [100] orientation display outstanding performance.







Abstract
The continuous electrolyte decomposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth caused by the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) have largely hindered the development of Li metal batteries. Here, we demonstrate that tuning the facet of current collector can regulate the composition of SEI and the subsequent Li deposition behavior using single&#8208;crystal Cu foils as an ideal platform. The theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the (100) facet of Cu possesses strong adsorption to anions, guiding more anions to participate preferentially in the inner Helmholtz plane and further promoting the formation of the stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with a single [100] orientation (s&#8208;Cu(100)) achieve the dendrite&#8208;free Li deposition with enhanced Li plating/stripping reversibility. Moreover, the Li anode deposited on s&#8208;Cu(100) can stabilize the operation of an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (350&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with a low negative/positive capacity ratio (~2) and lean electrolyte (2.4&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&#8722;1) for 150&#8197;cycles. Impressively, this strategy demonstrates universality in a series of electrolytes employed different anions. This work provides new insights into the correlation between the SEI and current collector, opening a universal avenue towards high&#8208;performance Li metal batteries.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. We describe the development of a diagnostic assay based on the detection of tumor&#8208;associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) in the sera using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. The best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers.







Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide, mainly due to late diagnosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic approaches to identify the disease as early as possible. We have developed a diagnostic assay for pancreatic cancer based on the detection of naturally occurring tumor associated autoantibodies against Mucin&#8208;1 (MUC1) using engineered glycopeptides on nanoparticle probes. We used a structure&#8208;guided approach to develop unnatural glycopeptides as model antigens for tumor&#8208;associated MUC1. We designed a collection of 13 glycopeptides to bind either SM3 or 5E5, two monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitopes known to recognize tumor associated MUC1. Glycopeptide binding to SM3 or 5E5 was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These model antigens were conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in a dot&#8208;blot assay to detect autoantibodies in serum samples from pancreatic cancer patients and healthy volunteers. Nanoparticle probes with glycopeptides displaying the SM3 epitope did not have diagnostic potential. Instead, nanoparticle probes displaying glycopeptides with high affinity for 5E5 could discriminate between cancer patients and healthy controls. Remarkably, the best&#8208;discriminating probes show significantly better true and false positive rates than the current clinical biomarkers CA19&#8208;9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

         <title>Electron Transfer Enhanced by a Minimal Energetic Driving Force at the Organic&#8208;Semiconductor Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transfer from the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state to the first triplet excited state (T1) are investigated in upconversion organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with 45 different material combinations. According to our analysis based on the semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory, CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV) and is expressed by a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
The energetic driving force for electron transfer must be minimized to realize efficient optoelectronic devices including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Exploring the dynamics of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state at an interface leads to a comprehension of the relationship between energetics, electron&#8208;transfer efficiency, and device performance. Here, we investigate the electron transfer from the CT state to the triplet excited state (T1) in upconversion OLEDs with 45 material combinations. By analyzing the CT emission and the singlet excited&#8208;state emission from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation via the dark T1, their energetics and electron&#8208;transfer efficiencies are extracted. We demonstrate that the CT&#8594;T1 electron transfer is enhanced by the stronger CT interaction and a minimal energetic driving force (&lt;0.1&#8197;eV), which is explained using the Marcus theory with a small reorganization energy of &lt;0.1&#8197;eV. Through our analysis, a novel donor&#8211;acceptor combination for the OLED is developed and shows an efficient blue emission with an extremely low turn&#8208;on voltage of 1.57&#8197;V. This work provides a solution to control interfacial CT states for efficient optoelectronic devices without energy loss.

         <title>Highly Fluorinated Nanospace in Porous Organic Salts with High Water Stability/Capability and Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully constructed uniform highly fluorinated nanospaces without impurities such as metals. This highly hydrophobic nanospace exhibits high water stability, and is the first all&#8208;organic hydrophobic nanospace where water molecules can enter. Furthermore, this nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity of 1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH.







Abstract
Water in hydrophobic nanospaces shows specific dynamic properties different from bulk water. The investigation of these properties is important in various research fields, including materials science, chemistry, and biology. The elucidation of the correlation between properties of water and hydrophobic nanospaces requires nanospaces covered only with simple hydrophobic group (e.g., fluorine) without impurities such as metals. This work successfully fabricated all&#8208;organic diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs) with highly fluorinated nanospaces, wherein hydrophobic fluorine atoms are densely exposed on the void surfaces, by combining fluorine substituted triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) derivatives with tetrahedral tetrasulfonic acid. This d&#8208;POSs with a highly fluorinated nanospace significantly improved their water stability, retaining their crystal structure even when immersed in water over one week. Moreover, this highly hydrophobic and fluorinated nanospace adsorbs 160&#8197;mL(STP)/g of water vapor at Pe/P0=0.90; this is the first hydrophobic nanospace, which water molecules can enter, in an all&#8208;organic porous material. Furthermore, this highly fluorinated nanospace exhibits very high proton conductivity (1.34&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S/cm) at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 95&#8201;%&#8201;RH. POSs with tailorable nanospaces may significantly advance the elucidation of the properties of specific &#8220;water&#8221; in pure hydrophobic environments.

         <title>Fabrication of Azacrown Ether&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Cathode Performance in Aqueous Ni&#8722;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical linker derived from azacrown ether, utilized in COF synthesis via reticular synthesis. The embedded crown ether moieties and imine linkages faciltate Ni2+ ions immobilization via post&#8208;modification. The resulting composite COF materials exhibit high nickel loading capacity, maintaining porosity and crystallinity, demonstrate promise as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries, offering high discharge capacity and exceptional cycling stability.







Abstract
Crown ethers (CEs), known for their exceptional host&#8211;guest complexation, offer potential as linkers in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for enhanced performance in catalysis and host&#8211;guest binding. However, their highly flexible conformation and low symmetry limit the diversity of CE&#8208;derived COFs. Here, we introduce a novel C3&#8208;symmetrical azacrown ether (ACE) building block, tris(pyrido)[18]crown&#8208;6 (TPy18C6), for COF fabrication (ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) via reticular synthesis. This approach enables precise integration of CEs into COFs, enhancing Ni2+ ion immobilization while maintaining crystallinity. The resulting Ni2+&#8208;doped COFs (Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and Ni@ACE&#8208;COF&#8208;2) exhibit high discharge capacity (up to 1.27&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 8&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and exceptional cycling stability (&gt;1000&#8197;cycles) as cathode materials in aqueous alkaline nickel&#8208;zinc batteries. This study serves as an exemplar of the seamless integration of macrocyclic chemistry and reticular chemistry, laying the groundwork for extending the macrocyclic&#8208;synthon driven strategy to a diverse array of COF building blocks, ultimately yielding advanced materials tailored for specific applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Local Electric Field Induced by Dual Heteroatoms on Copper Boosts Efficient CO2 Reduction Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver and tin heteroatoms are injected into the nano&#8208;porous copper to construct an asymmetric local electric field, thereby realizing excellent selectivity up to a nearly 100&#8201;% Faraday efficiency for CO over ultrawide potential window, a superior CO local current density of 340&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and high energy efficiency of 90&#8201;% for CO production.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np&#8208;Ag/Sn&#8722;Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90&#8201;% energy efficiency and a 100&#8201;% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (&#916;E=1.4&#8197;V), outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Au and Ag&#8208;based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

         <title>Pendant Proton&#8208;Relays Systematically Tune the Rate and Selectivity of Electrocatalytic Ammonia Generation in a Fe&#8208;Porphyrin Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>

Installation of secondary sphere proton relaying functionalities within an iron&#8208;porphyrin based MOF, enables systematic adjustment of heterogeneous electrocatalytic nitrite reduction performance in aqueous solution. Thus, high rates of NH3 production at more than 90&#8201;% faradaic efficiency were obtained.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrite reduction (eNO2RR) is a promising alternative route to produce ammonia (NH3). Until now, several molecular catalysts have shown capability to homogeneously reduce nitrite to NH3, while taking advantage of added secondary&#8208;sphere functionalities to direct catalytic performance. Yet, realizing such control over heterogeneous electrocatalytic surfaces remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate that heterogenization of a Fe&#8208;porphyrin molecular catalyst within a 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF), allows efficient eNO2RR to NH3. On top of that, installation of pendant proton relaying moieties proximal to the catalytic site, resulted in significant improvement in catalytic activity and selectivity. Notably, systematic manipulation of NH3 faradaic efficiency (up to 90&#8201;%) and partial current (5&#8208;fold increase) was achieved by varying the proton relay&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst molar ratio. Electrochemical and spectroscopic analysis show that the proton relays simultaneously aid in generating and stabilizing of reactive Fe&#8208;bound NO intermediate. Thus, this concept offers new molecular tools to tune heterogeneous electrocatalytic systems.

         <title>Selective Cleavage of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 Bond for Lignin Depolymerization via Paired&#8208;Electrolysis in an Undivided Cell</title>

For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the lignin (models) depolymerization and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in a selective and energy&#8208;effective manner.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds is one of the most promising strategies for lignin&#8208;to&#8208;chemicals conversion, which has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, current catalytic system capable of selectively breaking C&#8722;O bonds in lignin often requires a precious metal catalyst and/or harsh conditions such as high&#8208;pressure H2 and elevated temperatures. Herein, we report a novel protocol of paired electrolysis to effectively cleave the C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 bond of lignin model compounds and real lignin at room temperature and ambient pressure. For the first time, &#8220;cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage&#8221; and &#8220;anodic C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling reaction&#8221; are paired in an undivided cell, thus the cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds and the synthesis of valuable triarylamine derivatives could be simultaneously achieved in an energy&#8208;effective manner. This protocol features mild reaction conditions, high atom economy, remarkable yield with excellent chemoselectivity, and feasibility for large&#8208;scale synthesis. Mechanistic studies indicate that indirect H* (chemical absorbed hydrogen) reduction instead of direct electron transfer might be the pathway for the cathodic hydrogenolysis of C&#946;&#8722;O&#8722;4 linkage.

         <title>Enhancing Reversibility and Stability of Mg Metal Anodes: High&#8208;Exposure (002) Facets and Nanosheet Arrays for Superior Mg Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mg foil, featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and nanosheet arrays architecture, is fabricated via a selective etching strategy. The facet property encourages smooth nucleation and dense deposition, while the distinctive morphology ensures uniform electric field and Mg ion flux distributions. As a result, an improved Mg plating/stripping reversibility and extended cycle stability is achieved.







Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs), recognized as promising contenders for post&#8208;lithium battery technologies, face challenges such as uneven magnesium (Mg) plating and stripping behaviors, leading to uncontrollable dendrite growth and irreversible structural damage. Herein, we have developed a Mg foil featuring prominently exposed (002) facets and an architecture of nanosheet arrays (termed (002)&#8208;Mg), created through a one&#8208;step acid etching method. Specifically, the prominent exposure of Mg (002) facets, known for their inherently low surface and adsorption energies with Mg atoms, not only facilitates smooth nucleation and dense deposition but also significantly mitigates side reactions on the Mg anode. Moreover, the nanosheet arrays on the surface evenly distribute the electric field and Mg ion flux, enhancing Mg ion transfer kinetics. As a result, the fabricated (002)&#8208;Mg electrodes exhibit unprecedented long&#8208;cycle performance, lasting over 6000&#8197;h (&gt;8 months) at a current density of 3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for a capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the corresponding pouch cells equipped with various electrolytes and cathodes demonstrate remarkable capacity and cycling stability, highlighting the superior electrochemical compatibility of the (002)&#8208;Mg electrode. This study provides new insights into the advancement of durable MMBs by modifying the crystal structure and morphology of Mg.

         <title>Modularization of Immobilized Multienzyme Cascades for Continuous&#8208;Flow Enantioselective C&#8722;H Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;enzyme cascade has been developed for continuous&#8208;flow enantioselective C&#8722;H amination of aromatic alkanes by constructing two immobilized bienzymatic modules and integrating them in tandem packed&#8208;bed reactors. The resulting flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Multienzyme cascades (MECs) have gained much attention in synthetic chemistry but remain far from being a reliable synthetic tool. Here we report a four&#8208;enzyme cascade comprising a cofactor&#8208;independent and a cofactor self&#8208;sustaining bienzymatic modules for the enantioselective benzylic C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes, a challenging transformation from bulk chemicals to high value&#8208;added chiral amines. The two modules were subsequently optimized by enzyme co&#8208;immobilization with microenvironmental tuning, and finally integrated in a gas&#8208;liquid segmented flow system, resulting in simultaneous improvements in enzyme performance, mass transfer, system compatibility, and productivity. The flow system enabled continuous C&#8722;H amination of arylalkanes (up to 100&#8197;mM) utilizing the sole cofactor NADH (0.5&#8197;mM) in &gt;90&#8201;% conversion, achieving a high space&#8208;time yield (STY) of 3.6&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is a 90&#8208;fold increase over the highest value previously reported.

         <title>Development of Iron&#8208;Based Single Atom Materials for General and Efficient Synthesis of Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;based single atoms (Fe&#8208;SACs) as reductive amination catalysts have been prepared by the pyrolysis of Fe&#8208;nitrogen complexes on SiO2 and subsequent removal of silica. Applying these Fe&#8208;SACs, all kinds of amines including N&#8208;methylated products, amino acid esters, amino acid amides and selected drug molecules are synthesized starting from inexpensive and easily accessible carbonyl compounds and ammonia or amines in presence of molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Earth abundant metal&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with highly active and at the same time stable isolated metal sites constitute a key factor for the advancement of sustainable and cost&#8208;effective chemical synthesis. In particular, the development of more practical, and durable iron&#8208;based materials is of central interest for organic synthesis, especially for the preparation of chemical products related to life science applications. Here, we report the preparation of Fe&#8208;single atom catalysts (Fe&#8208;SACs) entrapped in N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon support with unprecedented potential in the preparation of different kinds of amines, which represent privileged class of organic compounds and find increasing application in daily life. The optimal Fe&#8208;SACs allow for the reductive amination of a broad range of aldehydes and ketones with ammonia and amines to produce diverse primary, secondary, and tertiary amines including N&#8208;methylated products as well as drugs, agrochemicals, and other biomolecules (amino acid esters and amides) utilizing green hydrogen.

         <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Li7P3S7.5O3.5 with Low Density and Excellent Anode Compatibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid electrolyte showing the combination of strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density, and anode compatibility is indispensable for the commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries, but none of the previously reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets this requirement. Here, a solid electrolyte, Li7P3S7.5O3.5, is discovered, and it displays all these three characteristics simultaneously.







Abstract
The commercialization of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs) demands solid electrolytes with strong cost&#8208;competitiveness, low density (for enabling satisfactory energy densities), and decent anode compatibility (the need for cathode compatibility can be circumvented by the cathode coating techniques that are widely applied in sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs). However, none of the reported oxide, sulfide, or chloride solid electrolytes meets these requirements simultaneously. Here, we design a Li7P3S7.5O3.5 (LPSO) solid electrolyte, which shows a combination of all the aforementioned characteristics. The synthesis of this material does not need the expensive Li2S, so the raw materials cost is only $14.42/kg, which, unlike most solid electrolytes, lies below the $50/kg threshold for commercialization. The density of LPSO is 1.70&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3, considerably lower than those of the oxide (typically above 5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) and chloride (around 2.5&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3) solid electrolytes. Besides, LPSO also shows excellent anode compatibility. The Li|LPSO|Li cell cycles stably with a potential of ~50&#8197;mV under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for over 4200&#8197;h at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cell with the Si anode shows a capacity retention of 89.29&#8201;% after 200 cycles under 88.6&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Catholyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Nonaqueous Redox Flow Battery</title>

A tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as high voltage, high energy density, and stable catholyte for nonaqueous redox flow battery.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with high energy densities are essential for efficient and sustainable long&#8208;term energy storage on a grid scale. To advance the development of nonaqueous RFBs with high energy densities, a new organic RFB system employing a molecularly engineered tetrathiafulvalene derivative ((PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF) as a high energy density catholyte was developed. A synergistic approach to the molecular design of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was applied, with the incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, which enhance its solubility in organic carbonate electrolytes, and a perfluoro (PerF) group to increase its redox potential. When paired with a lithium metal anode, the two&#8208;electron&#8208;active (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF catholyte produced a cell voltage of 3.56&#8197;V for the first redox process and 3.92&#8197;V for the second redox process. In cyclic voltammetry and flow cell tests, the redox chemistry exhibited excellent cycling stability. The Li|(PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF batteries, with concentrations of 0.1&#8197;M and 0.5&#8197;M, demonstrated capacity retention rates of ~94&#8201;% (99.87&#8201;% per cycle, 97.52&#8201;% per day) and 90&#8201;% (99.93&#8201;% per cycle, 99.16&#8201;% per day), and the average Coulombic efficiencies of 99.38&#8201;% and 98.35&#8201;%, respectively. The flow cell achieved a high power density of 129&#8197;mW/cm2. Furthermore, owing to the high redox potential and solubility of (PEG3/PerF)&#8208;TTF, the flow cell attained a high operational energy density of 72&#8197;Wh/L (100&#8197;Wh/L theoretical). A 0.75&#8197;M flow cell exhibited an even higher operational energy density of 96&#8197;Wh/L (150&#8197;Wh/L theoretical).

         <title>Photocatalytic Asymmetric Acyl Radical Truce&#8211;Smiles Rearrangement for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;Aryl Amides</title>

         <dc:description>
Using a &#8220;Radical Amino Ester&#8221; chiral auxiliary, we achieve asymmetric acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangements. This approach efficiently constructs &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides via a HAT strategy.







Abstract
The radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a straightforward strategy for incorporating aryl groups into organic molecules for which asymmetric processes remains rare. By employing a readily available and non&#8208;expensive chiral auxiliary, we developed a highly efficient asymmetric photocatalytic acyl and alkyl radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylamides using tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as a hydrogen atom&#8211;transfer photocatalyst, along with aldehydes or C&#8722;H containing precursors. The rearranged products exhibited excellent diastereoselectivities (7&#8201;:&#8201;1 to &gt;98&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;d.r.) and chiral auxiliary was easily removed. Mechanistic studies allowed understanding the transformation in which density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided insights into the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Chromium&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Reductant&#8208;Free Asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) Reaction Enabled by Metallaphotoredox Catalysis</title>

A variety of chiral allylic alcohols can be synthesized through a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction between alkenyl (pseudo)halides and aldehydes. This innovative technique facilitates both oxidative addition and insertion solely using nickel, representing a significant departure from the traditional NHK reaction pathway that requires both nickel and chromium salts.







Abstract
Chiral allylic alcohols are highly prized in synthetic chemistry due to their versatile reactivity stemming from both alkenyl and hydroxyl functionalities. While the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of allylic alcohols, it suffers from drawbacks such as the use of toxic chromium salts, high amounts of metal reductants, and poor enantiocontrol. To address these limitations, we present a novel approach involving a metallaphotoredox&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric NHK reaction for the production of chiral allylic alcohols. This method marries alkenyl (pseudo)halides with aldehydes, leveraging a synergistic blend of a chiral nickel catalyst and a photocatalyst. This innovative technique enables both oxidative addition and insertion just using nickel, diverging significantly from the conventional NHK reaction pathway mediated by nickel and chromium salts. The adoption of this methodology holds immense promise for crafting a spectrum of intricate compounds, particularly those of significance in pharmaceuticals. Detailed experimental investigations have shed light on the metallaphotoredox process, further enhancing our understanding and enabling further advancements.

         <title>Chemically&#8208;Driven Autonomous Janus Electromagnets as Magnetotactic Swimmers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization of solenoidal Janus devices into magnetic dipoles is made possible by the efficient coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous and kinetically favored redox reactions taking place at each extremity of the object. This is a straightforward strategy for the design of non&#8208;ferromagnetic, chemically&#8208;driven electromagnets.







Abstract
An electromagnet is a particular device that takes advantage of electrical currents to produce concentrated magnetic fields. The most well&#8208;known example is a conventional solenoid, having the form of an elongated coil and creating a strong magnetic field through its center when it is connected to a current source. Spontaneous redox reactions located at opposite ends of an anisotropic Janus swimmer can effectively mimic a standard power source, due to their ability to wirelessly generate a local electric current. Herein, we propose the coupling of thermodynamically spontaneous redox reactions occurring at the extremities of a hybrid Mg/Pt Janus swimmer with a solenoidal geometry to generate significant magnetic fields. These chemically driven electromagnets spontaneously transform the redox&#8208;induced electric current into a magnetic field with a strength in the range of &#956;T upon contact with an acidic medium. Such on&#8208;board magnetization allows them to perform compass&#8208;like rotational motion and magnetotactic displacement in the presence of external magnetic field gradients, without the need of using ferromagnetic materials for the swimmer design. The torque force experienced by the swimmer is proportional to the internal redox current, and by varying the composition of the solution, it is possible to fine&#8208;tune its angular velocity.

         <title>Inducing and Switching the Handedness of Polyacetylenes with Topologically Chiral [2]Catenane Pendants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing stimuli&#8208;responsive topologically chiral [2]catenanes as pendants, the precise regulations of chirality induction from the pendants to poly(phenylacetylenes) main chains lead to the successful construction of novel poly[2]catenanes with multistate switchable handedness, providing not only a new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.







Abstract
To explore the chirality induction and switching of topological chirality, poly[2]catenanes composed of helical poly(phenylacetylenes) (PPAs) main chain and topologically chiral [2]catenane pendants are described for the first time. These poly[2]catenanes with optically active [2]catenanes on side chains were synthesized by polymerization of enantiomerically pure topologically chiral [2]catenanes with ethynyl polymerization site and/or point chiral moiety. The chirality information of [2]catenane pendants was successfully transferred to the main chain of polyene backbones, leading to preferred&#8208;handed helical conformations, while the introduction of point chiral units has negligible effect on the overall helices. More interestingly, attributed to unique dynamic feature of the [2]catenane pendants, these polymers revealed dynamic response behaviors to solvents, temperature, and sodium ions, resulting in the fully reversible switching on/off of the chirality induction. This work provides not only new design strategy for novel chiroptical switches with topologically chiral molecules but also novel platforms for the development of smart chiral materials.

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Anion Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Protected PtAu12 Superatoms: Charging Energy in Vacuum vs Solution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charging energy of PtAu24(SCnH2n+1)18 in vacuum was evaluated by gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy. Permittivity of the ligand layer, estimated based on the concentric&#8208;capacitor model, decreased with n. The n&#8208;dependent charging behavior is explained by inhomogeneous monolayers due to the formation of bundles of the longer alkyl chains.







Abstract
The charging behavior of molecular Au clusters protected by alkanethiolate (SCnH2n+1=SCn) is, under electrochemical conditions, significantly affected by the penetration of solvents and electrolytes into the SCn layer. In this study, we estimated the charging energy EC(n) associated with [PtAu24(SCn)18]&#8722;+e&#8722;&#8594;[PtAu24(SCn)18]2&#8722; (n=4, 8, 12, and 16) in vacuum using mass&#8208;selected gas&#8208;phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy of [PtAu24(SCn)18]z (z=&#8722;1 and &#8722;2). The EC(n) values of PtAu24(SCn)18 in vacuum are significantly larger than those in solution and decrease with n in contrast to the behavior reported for Au25(SCn)18 in solution. The effective relative permittivity (&#1013;m*) of the SCn layer in vacuum is estimated to be 2.3&#8211;2.0 based on the double&#8208;concentric&#8208;capacitor model. Much smaller &#1013;m* values in vacuum than those in solution are explained by the absence of solvent/electrolyte penetration into the monolayer. The gradual decrease of &#1013;m* with n is ascribed to the appearance of an exposed surface region due to the bundle formation of long alkyl chains.

         <title>Understanding Ligand Effects on Bielectronic Transitions: Chemo&#8208; and Electroreduction of Rhodium Bis(Diphosphine) Complexes to Low Oxidation States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduction to low&#8208;valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.







Abstract
Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood.

&lt;p&gt;The two-electron reduction to low-valent rhodium &#8722;I is underpinned by structural rearrangements that defines whether the redox transitions are stepwise or in a bielectronic fashion. Study of a parametrized series of Rh bis(diphosphine) complexes identifies how ligand parameters influence this behaviour, whereas an expedient computed electronic parameter allows correlating electronics and geometrics with redox potentials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rhodium complexes in the &#8722;I and 0 oxidation states are of great potential interest in catalytic applications. In contrast to their rhodium +I congeners, however, the structural and electronic parameters governing their access and stability are far less understood. Herein, we investigate the two-electron reduction of a parameterized series of bis(diphosphine) Rh complexes [Rh(d&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;p&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]NTf&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=P-substituent, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;=alkanediyl bridging P atoms). Through (electro)reductions from the Rh&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; parents, Rh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;I&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;-complexes were obtained and characterized spectroscopically, including &lt;sup&gt;103&lt;/sup&gt;Rh NMR data. The reductive steps convolute with structural rearrangements from square planar to tetrahedral coordination. We found that the extent of these reorganisations defines whether the first &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;0&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;(Rh&lt;sup&gt;I/0&lt;/sup&gt;) and second &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;0&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;(Rh&lt;sup&gt;0/&#8722;I&lt;/sup&gt;) reduction potentials are normally ordered, leading to monoelectronic stepwise transitions, or inverted, giving bielectronic events. Reductionist approaches based on Hammett parameters or the P&#8722;Rh-P bite angles provide only partial correlations with the redox potentials. However, we identified the C&#8722;O stretch of analogue diphosphine complexes as an expedient computational parameter that enables these correlations through both electronic and geometric features, even in a predictive manner. Gaining control over two-electron reduction behaviors through rationalized ligand effects has potential impact beyond Rh complexes, for molecular and enzymatic metal sites commonly exhibiting bielectronic transitions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Value&#8208;Added Upcycling of PET to 1,4&#8208;Cyclohexanedimethanol by a Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multistage relay process has been developed that directly transforms PET into high&#8208;value&#8208;added 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimetha&#8208;nol (CHDM). The process utilizes polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD) as a crucial intermediate, enabling the efficient and trans&#8208;selective production of CHDM. By implementing a temperature&#8208;programmed, three&#8208;stage relay approach, we successfully achieved an isolated CHDM yield of up to 87&#8201;%, with a significantly enhanced trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1.







Abstract
We present an innovative process for directly transforming poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a polymer extensively used in food and beverage packaging, into trans&#8208;isomer&#8208;enriched 1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM), a key ingredient in advanced specialty polymers. Our approach leverages a dual&#8208;catalyst system featuring palladium on reduced graphene oxide (Pd/r&#8208;GO) and oxalate&#8208;gel&#8208;derived copper&#8208;zinc oxide (og&#8208;CuZn), utilizing hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis relay catalysis. This method efficiently transforms PET into polyethylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylate (PECHD), which is then converted into CHDM with an impressive overall yield of 95&#8201;% in a two&#8208;stage process. Our process effectively handles various post&#8208;consumer PET plastics, converting them into CHDM with yields between 78&#8201;% and 89&#8201;% across different substrates. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability and scalability of this approach through a temperature&#8208;programmed three&#8208;stage relay process on a 10&#8208;gram scale, which results in purified CHDM with an isolated yield of 87&#8201;% and a notably higher trans/cis ratio of up to 4.09/1, far exceeding that of commercially available CHDM. This research not only provides a viable route for repurposing PET waste but also enhances the control of selectivity patterns in multistage relay catalysis.

         <title>Direct Microenvironment Modulation of CO2 Electroreduction: Negatively Charged Ag Sites Going beyond Catalytic Surface Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported &#8220;nc&#8208;Ag&#8221; active sites featuring both the high intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. The sites could exert long&#8208;range electrostatic forces to regulate interfacial H2O and CO2 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This work opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating the intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active sites may also boost catalytic performance. Here we designed &#8220;negatively charged Ag (nc&#8208;Ag)&#8221; active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only mediate the surface processes by bonding with the intermediates), the nc&#8208;Ag sites could also manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with a CO faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

         <title>Controlled Radical Copolymerization toward Tailored F/N Hybrid Polymers by Using Light&#8208;Driven Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoredox&#8208;controlled radical copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and N&#8208;vinylamides has been developed with fluorinated thiocarbamate and organocatalyst under mild conditions. This work enables on&#8208;demand synthesis of F/N hybrid polymers as versatile and functional structures that could be readily transformed via chain&#8208;extensions and post&#8208;modifications, facilitating the in situ formation of polymeric interphase layers on Li metal anodes.







Abstract
Controlled radical copolymerizations present attractive avenues to obtain polymers with complicated compositions and sequences. In this work, we report the development of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven organocatalyzed controlled copolymerization of fluoroalkenes and acyclic N&#8208;vinylamides for the first time. The approach enables the on&#8208;demand synthesis of a broad scope of amide&#8208;functionalized main&#8208;chain fluoropolymers via novel fluorinated thiocarbamates, facilitating regulations over chemical compositions and alternating fractions by rationally selecting comonomer pairs and ratios. This method allows temporally controlled chain&#8208;growth by external light, and maintains high chain&#8208;end fidelity that promotes facile preparation of block sequences. Notably, the obtained F/N hybrid polymers, upon hydrolysis, afford free amino&#8208;substituted fluoropolymers versatile for post modifications toward various functionalities (e.g., amide, sulfonamide, carbamide, thiocarbamide). We further demonstrate the in situ formation of polymer networks with desirable properties as protective layers on lithium metal anodes, presenting a promising avenue for advancing lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Methylated Sulfone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Back&#8208;Reaction Inhibited Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise methylation of O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen&#8208;intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O2 reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O2 reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O2 adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H2 evolution. The resultant DS&#8208;COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three&#8208;fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H2 evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, ranking among the highest reported for organic&#8208;based photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The precise methylation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen-intermediate desorption, which obstructs the proton-coupled electron transfer kinetics and inhibits the backward reaction of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction in photocatalytic overall water splitting. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution, which cooperatively contributes to efficient solar-to-fuel conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar-to-hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) conversion via photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) holds great promise for a sustainable fuel economy, but has been challenged by the backward O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (ORR) with favored proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) dynamics. Here, we report that molecular engineering by methylation inhibits the backward ORR of molecular photocatalysts and enables efficient OWS process. As demonstrated by a benchmark sulfone-based covalent organic framework (COF) photocatalyst, the precise methylation of its O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption sites effectively blocks electron transfer and increases the barrier for hydrogen intermediate desorption that cooperatively obstructs the PCET process of ORR. Methylation also repels electrons to the neighboring photocatalytic sulfone group that promotes the forward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. The resultant DS-COF achieves an impressive inhibition of about 70&#8201;% of the backward reaction and a three-fold enhancement of the OWS performance with a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 124.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ranking among the highest reported for organic-based photocatalysts. This work provides insights for engineering photocatalysts at the molecular level for efficient solar-to-fuel conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Common Biosynthesis of Non&#8208;Canonical C16 Terpenes through a Fragmentation&#8208;Recombination Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of six bacterial non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers was investigated through a combination of isotopic labeling experiments and DFT calculations. The results showed that five of these compounds are formed by an unusual fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism. In addition, for anaximandrene a dancing mechanism was discovered, explaining the distribution of labeling over several carbon positions.







Abstract
The biosynthesis of six recently reported non&#8208;canonical C16 sesquiterpenoids named after ancient Greek philosophers, archimedene, aristotelene, eratosthenene, pythagorene, &#945;&#8208;democritene and anaximandrene, was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and isotopic labeling experiments. The results revealed for all compounds except archimedene a unique fragmentation&#8208;recombination mechanism as previously demonstrated for sodorifen biosynthesis, in addition to a remarkable &#8220;dancing&#8221; mechanism for anaximandrene biosynthesis.

         <title>Molecule Design for Non&#8208;Aqueous Wide&#8208;Temperature Electrolytes via the Intelligentized Screening Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte design is presented. Based on an explainable method, the halogenoid property of the cyanide group is demonstrated similar to fluorine in molecular properties. 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the LiCoO2/Li cell operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Operating a lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) in a wide temperature range is essential for ensuring a stable electricity supply amidst fluctuating temperatures caused by climate or terrain changes. Electrolyte plays a pivotal role in determining the temperature durability of batteries. However, specialized electrolytes designed for either low or high temperatures typically possess distinct features. Therefore, wide&#8208;temperature electrolytes (WTEs) are necessary as they encompass a combination of diverse properties, which complicates the clear instruction of WTE design. Here we represent an artificial intelligence (Al)&#8208;assisted workflow of WTE design through stepwise parameterizations and calculations. Linear mono&#8208;nitriles are identified as ideal wide&#8208;liquidus&#8208;range solvents that can &#8220;softly&#8221; solvate lithium ions by weak interactions. In addition, the explainable modules revealed the halogenoid similarity of cyanide as fluorine on the electrolyte properties (e.g. boiling point and dielectric constant). With the further introduction of an ether bond, 3&#8208;methoxypropionitrile (MPN) has been eventually determined as a main electrolyte solvent, enabling the battery operation from &#8722;60 to 120&#8201;&#176;C. Particularly, a LiCoO2/Li cell using the proposed WTE can realize stable cycling with capacity retention reaching 72.3&#8201;% after 50 cycles under a high temperature of 100&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Membrane Enthalpy and Entropy Barriers towards Superior Ion Separations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous TpPa COF interlayer is introduced to regulate the architecture and charge properties of the CAPEI selective layer, culminating in a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. Consequently, M&#8208;TpPaCAPEI exhibits superior separation performance to that of M&#8208;CAPEI and other advanced monovalent ion selective membranes for Li+/Mg2+ separation.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoporous membranes with ion selective transport functions are important for energy utilization, environmental remediation, and fundamental bioinspired engineering. Although mono/multivalent ions can be separated by monovalent ion selective membranes (MISMs), the current theory fails to inspire rapid advances in MISMs. Here, we apply transition state theory (TST) by regulating the enthalpy barrier (&#916;H) and entropy barrier (&#916;S) for designing next&#8208;generation monovalent cation exchange membranes (MCEMs) with great improvement in ion selective separation. Using a molecule&#8208;absorbed porous material as an interlayer to construct a denser selective layer can achieve a greater absolute value of &#916;S for Li+ and Mg2+ transport, greater &#916;H for Mg2+ transport and lower &#916;H for Li+ transport. This recorded performance with a Li+/Mg2+ perm&#8208;selectivity of 25.50 and a Li+ flux of 1.86&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 surpasses the contemporary &#8220;upper bound&#8221; plot for Li+/Mg2+ separations. Most importantly, our synthesized MCEM also demonstrates excellent operational stability during the selective electrodialysis (S&#8208;ED) processes for realizing scalability in practical applications.

         <title>Two RNA Folds from One Sequence: A Ribozyme with Versatile Substrate Processing Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme can adopt a hammerhead fold, allowing them to process various substrates by utilizing their inherent activity and comprehensive conformational flexibility to support RNA cleavage and ligation.







Abstract
We report the design of a single RNA sequence capable of adopting one of two ribozyme folds and catalyzing the cleavage and/or ligation of the respective substrates. The RNA is able to change its conformation in response to its environment, hence it is called chameleon ribozyme (CHR). Efficient RNA cleavage of two different substrates as well as RNA ligation by CHR is demonstrated in separate experiments and in a one pot reaction. Our study shows that sequence variants of the hairpin ribozyme intersect with the hammerhead ribozyme and that rather short RNA molecules can have comprehensive conformational flexibility, which is an important feature for the emergence of new functional folds in early evolution.

         <title>Unraveling the Intertwining Factors Underlying the Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two closely related yet distinctly different heterometallic 3d&#8211;4f clusters, featuring respectively a 96&#8208;metal (Dy52Ni44) and a 188&#8208;metal (Dy112Ni76) core built of multi&#8208;shells of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained by the controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+. Comparative experiments under systematically altered conditions were performed to unravel the intertwining factors, including the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base, the reaction temperature, and the reaction duration.







Abstract
Two closely related yet distinctly different cationic clusters, [Dy52Ni44(HEIDA)36(OH)138(OAc)24(H2O)30]10+ (1) and [Dy112Ni76(HEIDA)44(EIDA)24(IDA)4(OH)268(OAc)48(H2O)44]4+ (2) (HEIDA=N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetate), each featuring a multi&#8208;shell core of Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra, were obtained. Depending on the specific conditions used for the co&#8208;hydrolysis of Dy3+ and Ni2+, the product can be crystallized out as one particular type of cluster or as a mixture of 1 and 2. How the reaction process was affected by the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;facilitating base and/or by the reaction temperature and duration was investigated. It has been found that a reaction at a high temperature and/or for an extended period favors the formation of the compact and thermodynamically more stable 1, while a brief reaction with a large amount of the base is good for the kinetic product 2. By tuning these intertwining conditions, the reaction can be regulated toward a particular product.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Tetra&#8208;substituted Morpholinone and Benzoxazinone Lactols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. DFT studies identify an N&#8208;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction as key to producing products in highly enantioenriched form.







Abstract
The development of methods to allow the selective acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of tetra&#8208;substituted lactols is a recognised synthetic challenge. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative DKR of tetra&#8208;substituted morpholinone and benzoxazinone&#8208;derived lactols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields (up to 89&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er) observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating substitution at N(4) and C(2), di&#8208; and spirocyclic substitution at C(5) and C(6), as well as benzannulation (&gt;35&#8197;examples in total). The DKR process is amenable to scale&#8208;up on a 1&#8197;g laboratory scale. The factors leading to high selectivity in this DKR process have been probed through computation, with an N&#8722;C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction identified as key to producing ester products in highly enantioenriched form.

Abstract
A general and highly enantioselective method for the preparation of tetra&#8208;substituted 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide esters via isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) is reported. Using (2S,3R)&#8208;HyperBTM (5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) as the catalyst, the scope and limitations of this methodology have been extensively probed, with high enantioselectivity and good to excellent yields observed (&gt;40&#8197;examples, up to 99&#8201;%, 99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er). Substitution of the aromatic core within the 3&#8208;hydroxyphthalide skeleton, as well as aliphatic and aromatic substitution at C(3), is readily tolerated. A diverse range of anhydrides, including those from bioactive and pharmaceutically relevant acids, can also be used. The high enantioselectivity observed in this DKR process has been probed computationally, with a key substrate heteroatom donor O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;acyl&#8208;isothiouronium interaction identified through DFT analysis as necessary for enantiodiscrimination.

         <title>Trilayer Polymer Electrolytes Enable Carbon&#8208;Efficient CO2 to Multicarbon Product Conversion in Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trilayer polymer electrolyte was devised to enable the coexistence of high local pH at the cathode surface and acidic interfaces within the membrane, thus concurrently favoring C2H4 formation and addressing the CO2 loss issue. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of ~46&#8201;% and a single&#8208;pass conversion of ~32&#8201;% were achieved for C2H4 at industrially relevant current densities.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an appealing method for carbon utilization. Alkaline CO2 electrolyzers exhibit high CO2RR activity, low full&#8208;cell voltages, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the issue of CO2 loss caused by (bi)carbonate formation leads to excessive energy consumption, rendering the process economically impractical. In this study, we propose a trilayer polymer electrolyte (TPE) comprising a perforated anion exchange membrane (PAEM) and a bipolar membrane (BPM) to facilitate alkaline CO2RR. This TPE enables the coexistence of high alkalinity near the catalyst surface and the H+ flux at the interface between the PAEM and the cation exchange layer (CEL) of the BPM, conditions favoring both CO2 reduction to multicarbon products and (bi)carbonate removal in KOH&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors. As a result, we achieve a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 46&#8201;% for C2H4, corresponding to a C2+ FE of 64&#8201;% at 260&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 single&#8208;pass conversion (SPC) of approximately 32&#8201;% at 140&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8212;nearly 1.3&#8197;times the limiting SPC in conventional AEM&#8208;MEA electrolyzers. Furthermore, coupling CO2 reduction with formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) in the TPE&#8208;MEA electrolyzer reduces the full&#8208;cell voltage to 2.3&#8197;V at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without compromising the C2H4 FE.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated and Lysosomal&#8208;Targeted Pt(II) Metallacycle for Highly Potent Evoking of Immunogenic Cell Death that Potentiates Cancer Immunotherapy of Deep&#8208;Seated Tumors</title>

         <dc:description>
A platinum (Pt) metallacycle (1) is designed as the first example of a supramolecular near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer. 1 generates boosted reactive oxygen species excited by NIR light and induces lysosomal dysfunction thus synergistically augments immunomodulatory response with the effective dose of about a sixtieth compared with oxaliplatin and efficiently reduces adverse effects.







Abstract
Though platinum (Pt)&#8208;based complexes have been recently exploited as immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducers for activating immunotherapy, the effective activation of sufficient immune responses with minimal side effects in deep&#8208;seated tumors remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose the first example of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activated and lysosomal targeted Pt(II) metallacycle (1) as a supramolecular ICD inducer. 1 synergistically potentiates immunomodulatory response in deep&#8208;seated tumors via multiple&#8208;regulated approaches, involving NIR light excitation, boosted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good selectivity between normal and tumor cells, and enhanced tumor penetration/retention capabilities. Specifically, 1 has excellent depth&#8208;activated ROS production (~7&#8197;mm), accompanied by strong anti&#8208;diffusion and anti&#8208;ROS quenching ability. In vitro experiments demonstrate that 1 exhibits significant cellular uptake and ROS generation in tumor cells as well as respective multicellular tumor spheroids. Based on these advantages, 1 induces a more efficient ICD in an ultralow dose (i.e., 5&#8197;&#956;M) compared with the clinical ICD inducer&#8208;oxaliplatin (300&#8197;&#956;M). In vivo, vaccination experiments further demonstrate that 1 serves as a potent ICD inducer through eliciting CD8+/CD4+ T&#8197;cell response and Foxp3+ T&#8197;cell depletion with negligible adverse effects. This study pioneers a promising avenue for safe and effective metal&#8208;based ICD agents in immunotherapy.

Droplets dancing to non&#8208;classical tunes. Nishant Singh and co&#8208;workers (e202406220) show in their Communication how phase&#8208;separated amino acid droplets can non&#8208;classically evolve into poly&#8208;crystals and fibrous hydrogels. Several complex and direct pathways are explored to achieve transient or stable soft materials, single&#8208; or poly&#8208;crystals by provoking disordered droplets.

Radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. In their Research Article (e202406551) Eduard Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. show the utility of an active&#8208;feedback wireless NMR masing detector with the quality factor enhancement up to 1,000,000 to create a RASER at 300 MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional passive NMR detectors. This active&#8208;feedback&#8208;circuit approach potentially enables RASER sensing in a wide range of in vivo applications.

Two structurally intricate heterometallic clusters with cores featuring multiple Platonic and Archimedean polyhedra were synthesized by ligand&#8208;controlled co&#8208;hydrolysis of Ni2+ and Dy3+ ions, as reported by Zhiping Zheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409109). Adjusting the amount of hydrolysis&#8208;promoting base and the reaction temperature and duration afforded selectively the kinetic and thermodynamic species, respectively with a Dy112Ni76 and a Dy52Ni44 core.

         <title>Photorefinery of Biomass and Plastics to Renewable Chemicals using Heterogeneous Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalysts harness sunlight to convert biomass and plastic waste into value&#8208;added chemicals. These feedstocks utilize photogenerated electrons and/or holes to undergo reduction and/or oxidation transformations, enabling catalytic upgrading in a low&#8208;carbon, renewable energy&#8208;driven, and environmentally friendly manner.







Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of biomass and plastic waste provides opportunities for sustainable fuel and chemical production. Heterogeneous photocatalysts, typically composed of semiconductors with distinctive redox properties in their conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB), facilitate both the oxidative and reductive valorization of organic feedstocks. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the photorefinery of biomass and plastics from the perspective of the redox properties of photocatalysts. We explore the roles of the VB and CB in enhancing the value&#8208;added conversion of biomass and plastics via various pathways. Our aim is to bridge the gap between photocatalytic mechanisms and renewable carbon feedstock valorization, inspiring further development in photocatalytic refinery of biomass and plastics.

         <title>Evolution of Surface Chemistry in Two&#8208;Dimensional MXenes: From Mixed to Tunable Uniform Terminations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently modifiable surface terminations distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials and define their intrinsic properties. This minireview highlights recent advances in MXenes with uniform inorganic or organic surface terminations and provides perspectives on future opportunities and challenges in this field.







Abstract
Surface chemistry of MXenes is of great interest as the terminations can define the intrinsic properties of this family of materials. The diverse and tunable terminations also distinguish MXenes from many other 2D materials. Conventional fluoride&#8208;containing reagents etching approaches resulted in MXenes with mixed fluoro&#8208;, oxo&#8208;, and hydroxyl surface groups. The relatively strong chemical bonding of MXenes&#8217; surface metal atoms with oxygen and fluorine makes post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications of such MXenes unfavorable. In this minireview, we focus on the recent advances in MXenes with uniform surface terminations. Unconventional methods, including Lewis acidic molten salt etching (LAMS) and bottom&#8208;up direct synthesis, have been proven successful in producing halide&#8208;terminated MXenes. These synthetic strategies have opened new possibilities for MXenes because weaker surface chemical bonds in halide&#8208;terminated MXenes facilitate post&#8208;synthetic covalent surface modifications. Both computational and experimental results on surface termination&#8208;dependent properties are summarized and discussed. Finally, we offer our perspective on the opportunities and challenges in this exciting research field.

         <title>Platelet&#8208;Drug Conjugates Engineered via One&#8208;step Fusion Approach for Metastatic and Postoperative Cancer Treatment</title>

Platelet&#8208;drug conjugates could be prepared via one&#8208;step fusion with multiple&#8208;drug loaded liposomes. Platelets loaded with chemotherapy agent doxorubicin and cytokine IL&#8208;15 triggered anti&#8208;tumor immune response and inhibited melanoma recurrence in metastatic and postoperative tumor models.







Abstract
The exploration of cell&#8208;based drug delivery systems for cancer therapy has gained growing attention. Approaches to engineering therapeutic cells with multidrug loading in an effective, safe, and precise manner while preserving their inherent biological properties remain of great interest. Here, we report a strategy to simultaneously load multiple drugs in platelets in a one&#8208;step fusion process. We demonstrate doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated liposomes conjugated with interleukin&#8208;15 (IL&#8208;15) could fuse with platelets to achieve both cytoplasmic drug loading and surface cytokine modification with a loading efficiency of over 70&#8201;% within minutes. Due to their inherent targeting ability to metastatic cancers and postoperative bleeding sites, the engineered platelets demonstrated a synergistic therapeutic effect to suppress lung metastasis and postoperative recurrence in mouse B16F10 melanoma tumor models.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Network of Multicatalytic Reactions using a Single Palladium/Platinum Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a metabolism&#8208;inspired artificial system designed to respond to multiple stimuli, operating within an integrated network of mechanistically distinct reactions. Our approach enables the efficient performance of multi&#8208;stage processes using three simple starting materials, controlled by specific triggers, and catalysed by a multifunctional PdII/PtII complex, leading to the preferential synthesis of ten products.







Abstract
Given her unrivalled proficiency in the synthesis of all molecules of life, nature has been an endless source of inspiration for developing new strategies in organic chemistry and catalysis. However, one feature that remains thus far beyond chemists&#8217; grasp is her unique ability to adapt the productivity of metabolic processes in response to triggers that indicate the temporary need for specific metabolites. To demonstrate the remarkable potential of such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, we present a metabolism&#8208;inspired network of multicatalytic processes capable of selectively synthesising a range of products from simple starting materials. Specifically, the network is built of four classes of distinct catalytic reactions&#8212;cross&#8208;couplings, substitutions, additions, and reductions, involving three organic starting materials&#8212;terminal alkyne, aryl iodide, and hydrosilane. All starting materials are either introduced sequentially or added to the system at the same time, with no continuous influx of reagents or efflux of products. All processes in the system are catalysed by a multifunctional heteronuclear PdII/PtII complex, whose performance can be controlled by specific additives and external stimuli. The reaction network exhibits a substantial degree of orthogonality between different pathways, enabling the controllable synthesis of ten distinct products with high efficiency and selectivity through simultaneous triggering and suppression mechanisms.

         <title>Hirocidins, Cytotoxic Metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis, Induce Mitochondrion&#8208;Mediated Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report hirocidins A&#8722;C, secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with novel architectures and promising inhibitory activity against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. The total synthesis of hirocidin A and mechanistic investigations, which reveal mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis via caspase&#8208;9, provide opportunities to better understand and chemically enhance hirocidin's antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have revealed an immense microbial potential for the production of therapeutic small molecules, even from well&#8208;known producers. To access this potential, we subjected prominent antimicrobial producers to alternative antiproliferative assays using persistent cancer cell lines. Described herein is our discovery of hirocidins, novel secondary metabolites from Streptomyces hiroshimensis with antiproliferative activities against colon and persistent breast cancer cells. Hirocidin A is an unusual nine&#8208;membered carbocyclic maleimide and hirocidins B and C are relatives with an unprecedented, bridged azamacrocyclic backbone. Mode of action studies show that hirocidins trigger mitochondrion&#8208;dependent apoptosis by inducing expression of the key apoptotic effector caspase&#8208;9. The discovery of new cytotoxins contributes to scaffold diversification in anticancer drug discovery and the reported modes of action and concise total synthetic route for variant A set the stage for unraveling specific targets and biochemical interactions of the hirocidins.

         <title>Stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stellated cuboctahedron of FeIII ions can be constructed using p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene (H4TBC[4]) under solvothermal reaction conditions. The topological arrangement of the metal ions leads to significant spin frustration arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at 10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3 T.







Abstract
The solvothermal reaction of FeCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O and H4TBC[4] in a basic dmf/EtOH solution affords an [FeIII18] Keplerate conforming to a stellated cuboctahedron. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements reveal spin frustration effects arising from the high symmetry. A crossover between inverse and direct magnetocaloric effects is observed at ~10&#8197;K for applied&#8208;field changes lower than 3&#8197;T.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Weakly Coordinating Anions: Molecular Design, Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a systematic, computational evaluation of the potential of differently substituted methanide and propenide anions to serve as as weakly coordinating anion, the mixed 3,5&#8208;bistrifluoromethylphenyl (ArF) and triflyl (Tf) substituted propenide was prepared in gram&#8208;scale and shown to balance proton affinity and coordination ability. The applicability of this weakly coordinating carbanion was demonstrated by the stabilization of p&#8208;block cations.







Abstract
Although carbanions, which are usually regarded as reactive species and powerful metalation reagents, can be stabilized through choice of the substitution pattern, they have rarely been considered for the design of weakly coordinating anions (WCA). Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water&#8208; and air&#8208;stable allyl anion 1 with triflyl and 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (ArF) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram&#8208;scale. Single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of 1 in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all&#8208;carbon salt with a non&#8208;aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.

Here, we report on an evaluation of the potential of a series of differently substituted carbanions to serve as WCA by computational methods. This led us to the synthesis of the water- and air-stable allyl anion &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with triflyl and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl (Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;) moieties, which can be isolated in high yields even on a gram-scale. Single crystal X-ray crystallography and NMR studies confirmed the weak coordination ability of the anion by showing negligible or only weak interactions with different cations. This property enabled the application of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; in the stabilization of reactive group&#8197;14 and 15 cations. In addition to the crystallization of a phosphenium cation, the first all-carbon salt with a non-aromatic carbanion is reported, which revealed to be a convenient reagent for hydride abstraction such as from silanes. Overall, this work demonstrates the so far untapped potential of carbanions as WCA, that are accessible with a variety of different cations for various applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Complex Pathways Drive Pluripotent Fmoc&#8208;Leucine Self&#8208;Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of hierarchical assemblies of Fmoc&#8208;Leu are accessed using non&#8208;classical and classical nucleation following complex pathways. Chemical and thermal inputs lead to phase separated sub&#8208;micron liquid and solid droplets which can transform to fibrous stable hydrogel, transient metastable hydrogels, and milli&#8208;metric polycrystal spherulites or single crystals.







Abstract
Nature uses complex self&#8208;assembly pathways to access distinct functional non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assemblies. This remarkable ability to steer same set of biomolecules into different self&#8208;assembly states is done by avoiding thermodynamic pit. In synthetic systems, on demand control over &#8216;Pathway Complexity&#8217; to access self&#8208;assemblies different from equilibrium structures remains challenging. Here we show versatile non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies of the same monomer via alternate assembly pathways. The assemblies nucleate using non&#8208;classical or classical nucleation routes into distinct metastable (transient hydrogels), kinetic (stable hydrogels) and thermodynamic structures [(poly)&#8208;crystals and 2D sheets]. Initial chemical and thermal inputs force the monomers to follow different assembly pathways and form soft&#8208;materials with distinct molecular arrangements than at equilibrium. In many cases, equilibrium structures act as thermodynamic sink which consume monomers from metastable structures giving transiently formed materials. This dynamics can be tuned chemically or thermally to slow down the dissolution of transient hydrogel, or skip the intermediate hydrogel altogether to reach final equilibrium assemblies. If required this metastable state can be kinetically trapped to give strong hydrogel stable over days. This method to control different self&#8208;assembly states can find potential use in similar biomimetic systems to access new materials for various applications.

         <title>Function Switch of a Fungal Sesterterpene Synthase through Molecular Dynamics Simulation Assisted Alteration of an Aromatic Residue Cluster in the Active Pocket of PfNS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined strategy involving molecular dynamics simulations and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis to manipulate the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of PfNS protein resulted in the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions, such as the conversion between bicyclic and tricyclic structures and the transition from Type&#8197;B to Type&#8197;A function, thus resulting in the production of new sesterterpenes.







Abstract
Terpene synthases (TPSs) play pivotal roles in generating diverse terpenoids through complex cyclization pathways. Protein engineering of TPSs offers a crucial approach to expanding terpene diversity. However, significant potential remains untapped due to limited understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationships of TPSs. In this investigation, using a joint approach of molecular dynamics simulations&#8208;assisted engineering and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we manipulated the aromatic residue cluster (ARC) of a bifunctional terpene synthase (BFTPS), Pestalotiopsis fici nigtetraene synthase (PfNS). This led to the discovery of previously unreported catalytic functions yielding different cyclization patterns of sesterterpenes. Specifically, a quadruple variant (F89A/Y113F/W193L/T194W) completely altered PfNS&#8242;s function, converting it from producing the bicyclic sesterterpene nigtetraene to the tricyclic ophiobolin F. Additionally, analysis of catalytic profiles by double, triple, and quadruple variants demonstrated that the ARC functions as a switch, unprecedently redirecting the production of 5/11 bicyclic (Type&#8197;B) sesterterpenes to 5/15 bicyclic (Type&#8197;A) ones. Molecular dynamics simulations and theozyme calculations further elucidated that, in addition to cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions also play a key role in the cyclization patterns. This study offers a feasible strategy in protein engineering of TPSs for various industrial applications.

         <title>Photochargeable Mn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework and Decoupled Photocatalysis</title>

MnBr&#8208;253 particles were synthesized as three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on MOF&#8208;253 and MnBr(CO)3(bpy) complexes, designed as off&#8208;grid colloidal systems aimed at decoupling light harvesting and high&#8208;energy electron storage. Achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion/storage quantum yield and charging rate, the framework was applied for temporally decoupled dark H2 evolution.







Abstract
Designing multifunctional materials that mimic the light&#8208;dark decoupling of natural photosynthesis is a key challenge in the field of energy conversion. Herein, we introduce MnBr&#8208;253, a precious metal&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) built on Al nodes, bipyridine linkers and MnBr(CO)3(bipyridine) complexes. Upon irradiation, MnBr&#8208;253 colloids demonstrate an electron photocharging capacity of ~42&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF, with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocharging rate (1.28&#8197;C&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1MOF) and incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion efficiency of ~9.4&#8201;% at 450&#8197;nm. Spectroscopic and computational studies support effective electron accumulation at the Mn complex while high porosity and Mn loading account for the notable electron storage performance. The charged MnBr&#8208;253 powders were successfully applied for hydrogen evolution under dark conditions thus emulating the light&#8208;decoupled reactivity of photosynthesis.

         <title>Toward Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Quality&#8208;Factor Wireless Masing Magnetic Resonance Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (RASER) creates masing of nuclear spin Zeeman energy level transitions. RASER is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive NMR detectors. We show wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced from 75 up to 1,000,000 via parametric pumping via active&#8208;feedback technique for RASER applications at 300&#8197;MHz that was otherwise not possible with conventional MR detector.







Abstract
It has recently been shown that a bolus of hyperpolarized nuclear spins can yield stimulated emission signals similar in nature to maser signals, potentially enabling new ways of sensing hyperpolarized contrast media, including most notably [1&#8208;13C]pyruvate that is under evaluation in over 50&#8197;clinical trials for metabolic imaging of cancer. The stimulated NMR signal emissions lasting for minutes do not require radio&#8208;frequency excitation, offering unprecedented advantages compared to conventional MR sensing. However, creating nuclear spin maser emission is challenging in practice due to stringent fundamental requirements, making practical in vivo applications hardly possible using conventional passive MR detectors. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a wireless NMR maser detector, the quality factor of which was enhanced 22&#8208;fold (to 1,670) via parametric pumping. This active&#8208;feedback technique breaks the intrinsic fundamental limit of NMR detector circuit quality factor. We show the use of parametric pumping to reduce the threshold requirement for inducing nuclear spin masing at 300&#8197;MHz resonance frequency in a preclinical MRI scanner. Indeed, stimulated emission from hyperpolarized protons was obtained under highly unfavorable conditions of low magnetic field homogeneity (T2* of 3&#8197;ms). Greater gains of the quality factor of the MR detector (up to 1&#8197;million) were also demonstrated.

         <title>Accelerating the Discovery of Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts: High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Element Combinations in Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an innovative method for accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in Pt&#8208;based quinary high&#8208;entropy alloys, utilizing large&#8208;scale language model, microscale printing, pulsed high&#8208;temperature synthesis, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy, and density functional theory calculations. This offers a new avenue for the discovery of multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.







Abstract
The vast number of element combinations and the explosive growth of composition space pose significant challenges to the development of high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). Here, we propose a procedural research method aimed at accelerating the discovery of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) based on Pt&#8208;based quinary HEAs. The method begins with an element library provided by a large language model (LLM), combined with microscale precursor printing and pulse high&#8208;temperature synthesis techniques to prepare multi&#8208;element combination HEA array in one step. Through high&#8208;throughput measurement using scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), precise identification of highly active HEA element combinations and exploration of composition space for a specific combination are achieved. Advantageous element combinations are further validated in practical electrocatalytic evaluations. The contributions of individual element sites and the synergistic effects among elements of such HEAs in enhancing reaction activity are elucidated via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This method integrates high&#8208;throughput experiments, practical catalyst validation, and DFT calculations, providing a new pathway for accelerating the discovery of efficient multi&#8208;element materials in the field of energy catalysis.

         <title>Constructing Microporous Ion Exchange Membranes via Simple Hypercrosslinking for pH&#8208;Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economically feasible strategy, simple hypercrosslinking, is proposed to construct ion exchange membranes with microporosity. The presented membranes balance well with high ion conductivity and high ion selectivity and show superiority in process simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and anti&#8208;swelling, thus enabling high&#8208;efficiency and stable cycling of pH&#8208;neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries.







Abstract
Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) play a critical role in aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). Traditional IEMs that feature microphase&#8208;separated microstructures are well&#8208;developed and easily available but suffer from the conductivity/selectivity tradeoff. The emerging charged microporous polymer membranes show the potential to overcome this tradeoff, yet their commercialization is still hindered by tedious syntheses and demanding conditions. We herein combine the advantages of these two types of membrane materials via simple in situ hypercrosslinking of conventional IEMs into microporous ones. Such a concept is exemplified by the very cheap commercial quaternized polyphenylene oxide membrane. The hypercrosslinking treatment turns poor&#8208;performance membranes into high&#8208;performance ones, as demonstrated by the above 10&#8208;fold selectivity enhancement and much&#8208;improved conductivities that more than doubled. This turn is also confirmed by the effective and stable pH&#8208;neutral AORFB with decreased membrane resistance and at least an order of magnitude lower capacity loss rate. This battery shows advantages over other reported AORFBs in terms of a low capacity loss rate (0.0017&#8201;% per cycle) at high current density. This work provides an economically feasible method for designing AORFB&#8208;oriented membranes with microporosity.

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Glutathione Assembly Supported on ZIF&#8208;8 as Robust and Efficient Catalyst for Mild CO2 Conversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu(I)&#8208;glutathione polymer supported on ZIF&#8208;8 is a robust catalyst for the efficient carboxylation of terminal alkynes and the cyclization of propargylamine with CO2 under atmospheric pressure and mild conditions with a wide range of substrates, converting them into high value&#8208;added chemicals, with strong positive synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst is reused at least 10&#8197;times without significant reduction in catalytic efficiency.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;glutathione (GSH) redox system, essential in biology, is designed here as a supramacromolecular assembly in which the tetrahedral 18e Cu(I) center loses a thiol ligand upon adsorption onto ZIF&#8208;8, as shown by EXAFS and DFT calculation, to generate a very robust 16e planar trigonal single&#8208;atom Cu(I) catalyst. Synergy between Cu(I) and ZIF&#8208;8, revealed by catalytic experiments and DFT calculation, affords CO2 conversion into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals with a wide scope of substrates by reaction with terminal alkynes or propargyl amines in excellent yields under mild conditions and reuse at least 10&#8197;times without significant decrease in catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Photochemical Synthesis of Thioesters from Aryl Halides and Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochemical method for synthesizing thioesters from readily available aryl halides and carboxylic acids is here disclosed. This thiol&#8208;free protocol hinges on the direct excitation of 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylthiourea and its multifaceted ability to act as the sulfur source, generate aryl radicals upon SET activation of halides, and trap them to in situ produce reactive isothiouronium ions.







Abstract
Thioesters are important in synthesis, materials science, and biology, and their preparation traditionally relies on the use of disagreeable thiols. Here, we report a thiol&#8208;free protocol that stitches together widespread carboxylic acids and aryl halides, producing a diverse array of thioesters. Crucial to this strategy is the discovery that tetramethylthiourea can serve as both a sulfur source and, upon direct excitation by purple light, as a strong reductant, suitable for activating aryl halides via single&#8208;electron transfer. Coupling of the resulting aryl radicals provides an isothiouronium ion intermediate, which can be attacked by carboxylic acids via a polar pathway, affording the thioester products under mild conditions.

         <title>Utilizing &#8220;Latent&#8221; Carbon: Repositioning Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Synthons and Assemblies via Halogen Bonding to &#960;&#8208;Systems</title>

         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding to &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon sites&#8212;unsubstituted carbon sites that are traditionally seen as dead&#8208;ends in hydrogen&#8208;bonded crystal engineering&#8212;has been used to direct the solid&#8208;state arrangement of discrete and extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded substructures based on acid&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and phenol&#8208;based homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;synthons, thereby generating higher&#8208;order molecular solids.







Abstract
Molecules bearing carboxylic acid, amide, and hydroxyl groups are ubiquitous in crystal engineering, where robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded synthons centred on these functionalities enable reliable crystal structure design. We now show that halogen bonding to the carbon &#960;&#8208;system of such molecules, traditionally ignored in crystal engineering, permits the recognition and directional assembly of the resulting hydrogen&#8208;bonded structural subunits, leaving the archetypal hydrogen&#8208;bonded ring, ladder, and chain homosynthons intact, but repositioned in space. When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen&#8208;bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon&#8208;based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher&#8208;order solid&#8208;state supramolecular assemblies.

When applied to heteromolecular synthons, this enables rearranging more complex hydrogen-bonded motifs and the evolution of binary cocrystals into ternary ones through &#8220;latent&#8221; carbon-based recognition sites, demonstrating a rational approach to build higher-order solid-state supramolecular assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Arene&#8208;Forming Wittig Reaction by Phosphorus PIII/PV=O Redox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the atroposelective Wittig reaction enabled by PIII/PV=O redox catalysis. An endogenous base release compatible with Lewis acid co&#8208;catalysis thereby generates the ylide intermediates. The mild, chiral phosphine&#8208;catalyzed arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction allows the synthesis of a broad range of atropisomers with enantioselectivities of up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 e.r.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is renowned as exceptionally versatile method for converting a diversity of aldehydes and ketones into alkenes. Recently, strategies for chiral phosphine catalysis under PIII/PV=O redox cycling emerged to render this venerable transformation stereoselective. Herein, we describe that phosphine redox catalysis enables the enantioselective synthesis of pertinent biaryl atropisomers by means of a stereocontrolled arene&#8208;forming Wittig reaction. Key to the process is the release of an endogenous base from readily accessible tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonylated Morita&#8211;Baylis&#8211;Hillman adducts triggered by catalyst intramolecularization, permitting mild phosphine redox catalysis for atroposelective Wittig reactions. By this strategy, a broad diversity of biaryl atropisomers is obtained with up to 94&#8201;:&#8201;6 enantioselectivity.

         <title>exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;Substituted Pentabenzocorannulene: Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene, a new buckybowl bearing an internal sp3 carbon atom in the backbone, unexpectedly exhibits wide absorption and emission bands. The methyl group is exclusively located at the convex surface, bolstering the bowl geometry. All molecules form unidirectional bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking to generate polar crystals.







Abstract
exo&#8208;6b2&#8208;Methyl&#8208;substituted pentabenzocorannulene (exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me) was synthesized by the palladium&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triaryl&#8208;1H&#8208;cyclopenta[l]phenanthrene. Its bowl&#8208;shaped geometry with an sp3 carbon atom in the backbone and a methyl group located at the convex (exo) face was verified by X&#8208;ray crystallography. According to DFT calculations, the observed conformer is energetically more favorable than the endo one by 39.9&#8197;kcal/mol. Compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped analogs with intact &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones (see the main text), exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me displayed a deeper bowl depth (avg. 1.93&#8197;&#197;), redshifted and broader absorption (250&#8211;620&#8197;nm) and emission (from 585 to more than 850&#8197;nm) bands and a smaller optical HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (2.01&#8197;eV). exo&#8208;PBC&#8208;Me formed polar crystals where all bowl&#8208;in&#8208;bowl stacking with close &#960;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#960; contacts is arranged unidirectionally, providing the potential for applications as organic semiconductors and pyroelectric materials. This unusual structural feature, molecular packing, and properties are most likely associated with the assistance of the methyl group and the sp3 carbon atom in the backbone.

         <title>Synthesis of Secondary Boronates via Deaminative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Nitroso Carbamates and Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the coupling of N&#8208;nitroso carbamates with organo boronic acids is presented. The method allows for the formal deaminative coupling of widely available amines. In particular, the coupling of lysine is presented, which allows for the synthesis of non&#8208;canonical amino acids.







Abstract
A strategy for transition metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of alkyl nitroso&#8208;carbamates and boronic acids is reported. The N&#8208;nitroso carbamates are easily prepared from the corresponding amine in two simple steps. This method allows for the synthesis of a wide variety of secondary boronates, benzylic boronates and formal Csp3&#8722;Csp2 cross&#8208;coupling products under operationally simple conditions. Functional group tolerance is also demonstrated and applied in the modification of lysine to make non&#8208;canonical amino acids.

In this communication, we report two novel intrinsically liquid crystalline metal halide perovskite&#8208;like materials by utilizing fluorinated ionic liquid crystalline (FILC) mesogens based on polyfluorinated alkylimidazolium cations. Manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions were found to be essential for the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of the perovskite&#8208;like structures. This study may pave the way towards a new class of perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.







Abstract
Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskites (HOIHPs) represent an emerging class of semiconducting materials, widely employed in a variety of optoelectronic applications. Despite their skyrocket growth in the last decade, a detailed understanding on their structure&#8211;property relationships is still missing. In this communication, we report two unprecedented perovskite&#8208;like materials based on polyfluorinated imidazolium cations. The two materials show thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior resulting in the emergence of stable mesophases. The manifold intermolecular F&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;F interactions are shown to be meaningful for the stabilization of both the solid&#8208; and liquid&#8208;crystalline orders of these perovskite&#8208;like materials. Moreover, the structure of the incorporated imidazolium cation was found to tune the properties of the liquid crystalline phase. Collectively, these results may pave the way for the design of a new class of halide perovskite&#8208;based soft materials.

A chiral supramolecular interaction strategy is proposed to synthesize organic microcrystals with adaptive helical chirality for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules offer a promising platform for exploring circularly polarized lasing, which, however, faces a great challenge that the spatial separation of molecular chiral and luminescent centers limits chiroptical activity. Here we develop a helically chiral supramolecular system with completely overlapped chiral and luminescent units for realizing high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing. Adaptive helical chirality is obtained by incorporating chiral agents into organic microcrystals. Benefiting from the efficient coupling of stimulated emission with the adaptive helical chirality, the supramolecular microcrystals enable high&#8208;performance circularly polarized lasing emission with dissymmetry factors up to ~0.7. This work opens up the way to rational design of chiral organic materials for circularly polarized lasing.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Approach to Promoting Photocatalysis Based on Consecutive Photo&#8208;Induced Electron&#8208;Transfer Processes via Efficient F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
Reported herein is the host&#8211;guest approach to promoting photoactivation of aryl halides based on the conPET process via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from host to encapsulated rhodamine 6G (Rh&#8208;6G). Highly efficient FRET makes the supramolecular system an efficient catalyst for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides under mild conditions within a short time (1&#8211;4&#8197;h), even in an air atmosphere.







Abstract
Supramolecular artificial light&#8208;harvesting system with highly efficient host&#8211;guest energy transfer pathway provides an ideal platform for optimizing the photochemistry process. The consecutive photo&#8208;induced electron transfer (conPET) process overcomes the energy limitation of visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, but is often compromised by mismatching between the absorption of ground state dye and its radical, weakening the efficiency of photoredox reaction. By encapsulating a conPET photocatalyst rhodamine 6G into metal&#8208;organic cage, the supramolecular approach was undertaken to tackle the intrinsic difficulty of matching the light absorption of photoexcitation between rhodamine 6G and its radical. The highly efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the photoexcited cage to rhodamine 6G forced by host&#8211;guest encapsulation facilitates the conPET process for the single&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;driven activation of aryl halides by stabilizing and accelerating the production and accumulation of the rhodamine 6G radical intermediate. The tunable and flexible nature of the supramolecular host&#8211;guest complex renders the cage&#8208;based encapsulation strategy promising for the development of ideal photocatalysts toward the better utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Enhancement of Low Temperature Superionic Conductivity by Suppression of Li Site Ordering in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isovalent substitution of Ge4+ for Si4+ in Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I is observed for x&#8804;1.2. Control of unit cell volume via this substitution enhances Li+ site disorder beyond Li7Si2S7I. This extensive disorder is stabilised to 30&#8197;K with very low activation energies observed by 7Li NMR, yielding low temperature Li+ transport in highly substituted (x=1 &amp; 1.2) materials that is comparable to best&#8208;in&#8208;class solid&#8208;state electrolytes.







Abstract
Ge4+ substitution into the recently discovered superionic conductor Li7Si2S7I is demonstrated by synthesis of Li7Si2&#8211;xGexS7I, where x&#8804;1.2. The anion packing and tetrahedral silicon location of Li7Si2S7I are retained upon substitution. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction shows that substitution of larger Ge4+ for Si4+ expands the unit cell volume and further increases Li+ site disorder, such that Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I has one Li+ site more (sixteen in total) than Li7Si2S7I. The ionic conductivity of Li7Si0.8Ge1.2S7I (x=1.2) at 303&#8197;K is 1.02(3)&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 with low activation energies for Li+ transport demonstrated over a wide temperature range by AC impedance and 7Li NMR spectroscopy. All sixteen Li+ sites remain occupied to temperatures as low as 30&#8197;K in Li7Si0.88Ge1.12S7I as a result of the structural expansion. This differs from Li7Si2S7I, where the partial Li+ site ordering observed below room temperature reduces the ionic conductivity. The suppression of Li+ site depopulation by Ge4+ substitution retains the high mobility to temperatures as low as 200&#8197;K, yielding low temperature performance comparable with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li+ ion conducting materials.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of C&#8722;N Axially Chiral Aminophosphines via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral P,N ligands were synthesized through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ATH of in situ generated iminophosphines. The transient interaction between iminium and phosphine groups as a Lewis acid&#8208;base pair causes the labilization of the stereogenic axis, enabling the scenario for a DKR. The reaction proceeds with good to high yields and reaching up to 99&#8201;% ee across a range of substrates, including both dicyclohexyl&#8208; and diphenylphosphino derivatives.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed reductive amination via asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) has been used to perform an efficient dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of N&#8208;aryl 2&#8208;formyl pyrroles decorated with a phosphine moiety positioned at the ortho&#8217; position. The strategy relies on the labilization of the stereogenic axis in the substrate facilitated by a transient Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction (LABI) between the carbonyl carbon and the phosphorus center. The reaction features broad substrate scope of aliphatic amines and N&#8208;aryl pyrrole scaffolds, and proceeds under very mild conditions to afford P,N atropisomers in good to high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) for both diphenyl and dicyclohexylphosphino derivatives.

         <title>Enantioselective Arylation of Sulfenamides to Access Sulfilimines Enabled by Palladium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters was developed. This strategy offers a general, modular and divergent platform for rapid synthesis of chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;containing functional groups have garnered considerable attention due to their common occurrence in ligands, pharmaceuticals, and insecticides. Nevertheless, enantioselective synthesis of sulfilimines, particularly diaryl sulfilimines remains a challenging and persistent goal. Herein we report a highly enantio&#8208; and chemoselective cross&#8211;coupling of sulfenamides with aryl diazonium salt to construct diverse S(IV) stereocenters by Pd catalysis. Bisphosphine ligands bearing sulfinamide groups play a crucial role in achieving high reactivity and selectivity. This approach provides a general, modular and divergent framework for quickly synthesizing chiral sulfilimines and sulfoximines that are otherwise challenging to access. In addition, the origins of the high chemoselectivity and enantioselectivity were extensively investigated using density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen in Photocatalytic Gas&#8211;Solid Reactions: Participator vs. Dominator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via a dual&#8208;pathway reaction mechanism of lattice oxygen (OL) participation and molecular oxygen oxidation, Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst exhibits efficient complete oxidation of ppm&#8208;level methane and OL plays a dominant role in this reaction. Single&#8208;atom Ru accelerates the O2 activation to &#8901;O2&#8722; and the regeneration of consumed OL during reaction.







Abstract
Lattice&#8208;oxygen activation has emerged as a popular strategy for optimizing the performance and selectivity of oxide&#8208;based thermocatalysis and electrolysis. However, the significance of lattice oxygen in oxide photocatalysts has been ignored, particularly in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Here, using methane oxidation over a Ru1@ZnO single&#8208;atom photocatalyst as the prototypical reaction and via 18O isotope labelling techniques, we found that lattice oxygen can directly participate in gas&#8211;solid reactions. Lattice oxygen played a dominant role in the photocatalytic reaction, as determined by estimating the kinetic constants in the initial stage. Furthermore, we discovered that dynamic diffusion between O2 and lattice oxygen proceeded even in the absence of targeted reactants. Finally, single&#8208;atom Ru can facilitate the activation of adsorbed O2 and the subsequent regeneration of consumed lattice oxygen, thus ensuring high catalyst activity and stability. The results provide guidance for next&#8208;generation oxide photocatalysts with improved activities and selectivities.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Reprograms Cellular Metabolism to Enhance Photodynamic Therapy and Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer was anchored with the metabolic reprogramming agent 3&#8208;bromopyruvate to enhance photodynamic therapy and antitumor immunity by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to elicit antitumor immunity, reject tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevent lung metastasis.







Abstract
Abnormal cancer metabolism causes hypoxic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which limits the antitumor efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, we report a photosensitizing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) with anchored 3&#8208;bromopyruvate (BrP), BrP@MOL, as a metabolic reprogramming agent to enhance PDT and antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL inhibited mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis to oxygenate tumors and reduce lactate production. This metabolic reprogramming enhanced reactive oxygen species generation during PDT and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME to enhance antitumor immunity. BrP@MOL&#8208;mediated PDT inhibited tumor growth by &gt;90&#8201;% with 40&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free, rejected tumor re&#8208;challenge, and prevented lung metastasis. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade potently regressed the tumors with &gt;98&#8201;% tumor inhibition and 80&#8201;% of mice being tumor&#8208;free.

         <title>Depolymerization of Native Lignin over Thiol Capped Ultrathin ZnIn2S4 Microbelts Mediated by Photogenerated Thiyl Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depolymerization of native lignin for the production of functionalized aromatics was realized over irradiated colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 microbelts. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible colloidization&#8208;aggregation for both efficient reaction and facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for the generation of RS&#8901; for selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin.







Abstract
The valorization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic compounds under visible light is appealing yet challenging. In this communication, colloidal mercaptoalkanoic acid capped ultrathin ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microbelts was successfully fabricated, which was used as a superior catalyst for depolymerization of native lignin in birch woodmeal under visible light, with an optimum yield of 28.8&#8197;wt&#8201;% to functionalized aromatic monomers achieved in 8&#8197;h. The capped mercaptoalkanoic acid not only enables a solvent modulated reversible interchange of ZIS between the colloidal state for efficient reaction and the aggregated state for facile separation, but also serves as a precursor for light initiated generation of reactive thiyl radical for highly selective cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bond in native lignin. This work provides a green and efficient strategy for the depolymerization of native lignin to functionalized aromatic monomers under mild conditions, which involves a new mechanism for the cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin. The capability of cleavage of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 bonds in native lignin by photogenerated thiyl radicals also demonstrates the great potential of using photogenerated thiyl radicals in organics transformations.

         <title>Structural Modulation of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have adeptly optimized the ORR process through strategic engineering of COFs, effectively transitioning the reaction from a four&#8208;electron pathway to a two&#8208;electron pathway. Significantly, when implemented within a flow cell apparatus, the COF augmented with ionic salt (JUC&#8208;660) demonstrated consistent productivity, maintaining a H2O2 yield rate in excess of 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an extended operational period more than 85&#8197;hours. This performance solidifies its status as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed catalysts reported to date.







Abstract
The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using metal&#8208;free catalysts has emerged as a viable and sustainable alternative to the conventional anthraquinone process. However, the precise architectural design of these electrocatalysts poses a significant challenge, requiring intricate structural engineering to optimize electron transfer during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, we introduce a novel design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that effectively shift the ORR from a four&#8208;electron to a more advantageous two&#8208;electron pathway. Notably, the JUC&#8208;660 COF, with strategically charge&#8208;modified benzyl moieties, achieved a continuous high H2O2 yield of over 1200&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for an impressive duration of over 85&#8197;hours in a flow cell setting, marking it as one of the most efficient metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed H2O2 electrocatalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations alongside in situ infrared spectroscopy indicate that JUC&#8208;660 markedly diminishes the adsorption of the OOH* intermediate, thereby steering the ORR towards the desired pathway. Furthermore, the versatility of JUC&#8208;660 was demonstrated through its application in the electro&#8208;Fenton reaction, where it efficiently and rapidly removed aqueous contaminants. This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal&#8208;free H2O2 electrocatalysts.

This work delineates a pioneering approach to altering the ORR pathway, ultimately paving the way for the development of highly effective metal-free H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Like Catalysis of Vinyl Copolymer Carrying Boron Directly Connected to Backbone: Catalytic Esterification through Cooperation of Boron with Neighboring Carboxylic Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester and maleic anhydride was found to work as a catalyst for direct esterification of alcohol and carboxylic acid. The key to the unprecedented catalytic activity was the activation of carboxylic anhydride by adjacent boron, and the catalytic function through the cooperation of side chains would collect attention as the simple mimic of enzyme.







Abstract
Alternating&#8208;rich copolymer of vinylboronic acid pinacol ester (VBpin) and maleic anhydride (MAH) was found to catalyze direct dehydrative esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol. The key to the catalytic function is the activation of the MAH unit by the neighboring Lewis acidic boron directly connected to the backbone through the formation of five&#8208;membered ring. The effects of the side&#8208;chain cooperation were clarified through comparisons with the polymers having similar structures and a conventional titanium catalyst as well as the analyses of reactions with carboxylic acid or alcohol. The catalytic activity was enhanced as the molecular weight was higher, which is owing to the structural feature that boron is directly attached to the backbone. The cooperative catalysis is of interest because of its conceptual similarity with enzyme.

         <title>Chirality Interplay between the Interior and Exterior of Metal&#8211;Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple stereogenic elements have been embedded into M2L4 metal&#8211;organic cages to control the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages, i.e. within and beyond the first coordination sphere.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic cages featuring two stereogenic elements, in terms of the twisting of amide moieties within the ligand backbones and the rotation of diazaanthracene segments along the ligand ridges, were exploited. These two chiral components are correlative and serve as relays for transmitting chirality information between the internal and external cages. The chirality information induced by a chiral guest inside the cage cavity can pass through the cage framework and influence the orientation of the diazaanthracene segments on the periphery of the cage. In turn, the chirality of a stereogenic center within the diazaanthracene segments can transfer back into the cavity, enabling discrimination of enantiomeric guests.

         <title>Bilateral Unsymmetrical Disulfurating Reagent Design for Polysulfide Construction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 37, September 9, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of stable and odorless bilateral disulfurating reagents with two divergent mask groups has been established. Diverse arylboronic acids and carbon/nitrogen/sulfur nucleophiles can be sequentially assembled on both sides of a S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Polysulfides are significant compounds in life science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. Therefore, polysulfide construction is in great demand. The controllable sequential installation of groups on both ends of a S&#8722;S motif faces an enormous challenge owing to the reversible nature of the covalent S&#8722;S bond. A library was established with two divergent mask groups for bilateral unsymmetrical disulfurating reagents (R1O&#8722;SS&#8722;SO2R2). Sequential coupling with preferential activation of the S&#8722;SO2 bond (37.6&#8197;kcal/mol) and controllable activation of the S&#8722;O bond (54.8&#8197;kcal/mol) in the presence of the S&#8722;S bond (62.0&#8197;kcal/mol) enabled successive reactions at each end of the S&#8722;S motif to afford unsymmetrical disulfides and trisulfides, even for the cross&#8208;linkage of natural products, pharmaceuticals, peptides, and a protein (bovine serum albumin).

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Additive&#8208;Modulated Interfacial Microenvironment Boosting CO2 Electrolysis in Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. High concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, but they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate&#8208;based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8211;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8211;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm&#8211;2, simultaneous with a high single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.</dc:description>

In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8211;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8211;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm&#8211;2, simultaneous with a high single-pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode-electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Controllable Hetero&#8208;Pauson&#8208;Khand Polymerization to Functional&#160;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymers containing lactam structures play a crucial role in both natural biological systems and human life, and their synthesis, functions and applications are of utmost importance for biomimetics and the creation of new materials. In this study, we developed an efficient heterogeneous Pauson&#8208;Khand polymerization (h&#8208;PKP) method for the controlled synthesis of main&#8208;chain poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s containing &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactam functionalities using readily available internal alkynes and imines. The molecular weights of the resulting poly(N&#8208;Ts/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s can be precisely controlled by adjusting the ratio of phenyl formate and nickel. These polymers exhibit high solid&#8208;state luminescence and demonstrate rapid and sensitive dual responsiveness to light and acid stimuli. They further demonstrate strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capability. The unique dual&#8208;emission peaks observed in poly(N&#8208;H/&#947;&#8208;lactam)s obtained through post&#8208;treatment under acidic conditions demonstrate a mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced intermolecular excited&#8208;state proton transfer specific to lactam structures. The efficient one&#8208;pot synthetic method for poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam) provides a novel strategy for constructing polymers with &#947;&#8208;lactam structures in the main chain and the simple and efficient post&#8208;modification method offer a versatile toolbox for functionalizing poly(&#947;&#8208;lactam)s to expand their potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Triggered Spin&#8208;Magnetic Effect in Rare Earth Intra&#8208;particle Heterostructured Nanoalloys for Boosting Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare earth (RE) elements are attractive for spin&#8208;magnetic modulation due to their unique 4f electron configuration and strong orbital couplings. Alloying RE with conventional 3d transition&#8208;metal (TM) is promising for the fabrication of advanced spin catalysts yet remains much difficulties in preparation, which leads to the mysteries of spin&#8208;magnetic effect between RE and 3d TM on catalysis. Here we define a solid&#8208;phase synthetic protocol for creating RE&#8208;3d TM&#8208;noble metal integrated intraparticle heterostructured nanoalloys (IHAs) with distinct Gd and Co interface within the entire Rh framework, denoted as RhCo&#8208;RhGd IHAs. They exhibit interface&#8208;triggered antiferromagnetic interaction, which can induce electron redistribution and regulate spin polarization. Theoretical calculations further reveal that active sites around the heterointerface with weakened spin polarization optimize the adsorption and dissociation of H2O, thus promoting alkaline hydrogen evolution catalysis. The RhCo&#8208;RhGd IHAs show a small overpotential of 11.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, as well as remarkable long&#8208;term stability, far superior to previously reported Rh&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Curvature&#8208;Induced Electron Spin Catalysis with Carbon Spheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis by using solid carbon spheres as catalysts, which were synthesized using positive curvature molecular hexabromocyclopentadiene as a precursor molecule, following a radical coupling mechanism. The curvature spin of carbon is regarded as an overlapping state of &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;radical, which is identified by the inverse Laplace transform of pulse&#8208;electron paramagnetic resonance. The growth mechanism of carbon spheres abiding by Kroto&#8217;s model, is supported by the density functional theory study of thermodynamics and kinetics calculations. The solid carbon spheres present excellent catalytic behaviour of oxidation coupling of amines to form corresponding imines with the conversion of &gt;99%, selectivity of 98.7%, and yield of 97.7%, which is attributed to the predominantly curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis of carbon, supported by the calculation of oxygen adsorption energy. This work proposes a view of curvature&#8208;induced spin catalysis of carbon, which opens up a research direction for curvature&#8208;induced electron spin catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Radicals with Emission Peaks over 750 nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Purely organic molecules exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission possess considerable potential for applications in both biological and optoelectronic technological domains, owing to their inherent advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and facile chemical modifiability. However, the repertoire of such molecules with emission peaks exceeding 750 nm and concurrently demonstrating high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) remains relatively scarce due to the energy gap law. Herein, we report two open&#8208;shell NIR radical emitters, denoted as DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM and DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM, achieved through the strategic integration of a donor group (DMNA) onto the Cz&#8208;BTM and PyID&#8208;BTM frameworks, respectively. We found that the donor&#8208;acceptor molecular structure allows the two designed radical emitters to exhibit a charge&#8208;transfer excited state and spatially separated electron and hole levels with non&#8208;bonding characteristics. Thus, the high&#8208;frequency vibrations are effectively suppressed. Besides, the reduction of low&#8208;frequency vibrations is observed. Collectively, the non&#8208;radiative decay channel is significantly suppressed, leading to exceptional NIR PLQE values. Specifically, DMNA&#8208;Cz&#8208;BTM manifests an emission peak at 758 nm alongside a PLQE of 55%, whereas DMNA&#8208;PyID&#8208;BTM exhibits an emission peak at 778 nm with a PLQE of 66%. Notably, these represent the pinnacle of PLQE among metal&#8208;free organic NIR emitters with emission peaks surpassing 750 nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Multifunctional Interface Layer Constructed by Trace Zwitterions for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhomogeneous plating/stripping of Zn anode, attributed to dendrite growth and parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, severely restricts its cycling life&#8208;span. Here, trace zwitterions (trifluoroacetate pyridine, TFAPD) are introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to construct a multifunctional interface that enhances the reversibility of Zn anode. The TFA&#8722; anions with strong specific adsorption adhere onto the Zn surface to reconstruct the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), preventing the hydrogen evolution and corrosion side reactions caused by free H2O. The Py+ cations accumulate on the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of Zn anode with the force of electric field during Zn2+ plating, forming a shielding layer to uniformize the deposition of Zn2+. Besides, the adsorbed TFA&#8722; and Py+ promote the desolvation process of Zn2+ resulting in fast reaction kinetics. Thus, the Zn||Zn cells present an outstanding cycling performance of more than 10000 hours. And even at 85% utilization rate of Zn, it can stably cycle for over 200 hours at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn||I2 full cell exhibits a capacity retention of over 95% even after 30000 cycles. Remarkably, the Zn||I2 pouch cells (95 mAh) deliver a high&#8208;capacity retention of 99% after 750 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Modification by Ordered Discotic Liquid Crystals for Thermotolerance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditionally used phenylethylamine iodide (PEAI) and its derivatives, such as ortho&#8208;fluorine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, in interfacial modification, are beneficial for perovskite solar cell (PSC) efficiency but vulnerable to heat stability above 85 &#176;C due to ion migration. To address this issue, we propose a composite interface modification layer incorporating the discotic liquid crystal 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(pentoxy)triphenylene (HAT5) into o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI. The triphenyl core in HAT5 promotes &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly and enhances its interaction with o&#8208;F&#8208;PEAI, forming an oriented columnar phase that improves hole extraction along the one&#8208;dimensional direction. HAT5 repairs structural defects in the interfacial layer and retains the layered structure to inhibit ion migration after annealing. Ultimately, our approach increases the efficiency of solar cells from 23.36% to 25.02%. The thermal stability of the devices retains 80.1% of their initial efficiency after aging at 85 &#176;C for 1008 hours without encapsulation. Moreover, the optimized PSCs maintained their initial efficiency of 82.4% after aging under one sunlight exposure for 1008 hours. This study provides a novel strategy using composite materials for interface modification to enhance the thermal and light stability of semiconductor devices.</dc:description>

To address this issue, we propose a composite interface modification layer incorporating the discotic liquid crystal 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexa(pentoxy)triphenylene (HAT5) into o-F-PEAI. The triphenyl core in HAT5 promotes &#960;-&#960; stacking self-assembly and enhances its interaction with o-F-PEAI, forming an oriented columnar phase that improves hole extraction along the one-dimensional direction. HAT5 repairs structural defects in the interfacial layer and retains the layered structure to inhibit ion migration after annealing. Ultimately, our approach increases the efficiency of solar cells from 23.36% to 25.02%. The thermal stability of the devices retains 80.1% of their initial efficiency after aging at 85 &#176;C for 1008 hours without encapsulation. Moreover, the optimized PSCs maintained their initial efficiency of 82.4% after aging under one sunlight exposure for 1008 hours. This study provides a novel strategy using composite materials for interface modification to enhance the thermal and light stability of semiconductor devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloadditions of Bicyclobutanes with Imines: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition reaction involving bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) offers a versatile and efficient synthetic platform for producing C(sp3)&#8208;rich rigid bridged ring scaffolds, which act as phenyl bioisosteres. However, there is a scarcity of catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of BCBs to fulfill the need for enantioenriched saturated bicycles in drug design and development. In this study, an efficient synthesis of valuable azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza&#8208;BCHs) by an enantioselective zinc&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines is reported. The reaction proceeds effectively with a novel type of BCB that incorporates a 2&#8208;acyl imidazole group and a diverse array of alkynyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted imines. The target aza&#8208;BCHs, which consist of &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers, are efficiently synthesized with up to 94% yield and 96.5:3.5 er under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction follows a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism of BCBs with imines. This mechanism is distinct from previous studies on Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of BCBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic&#8208;Promoted Interatomic Hot Carriers Regulation Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmonic&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field. Herein, the mechanism by which plasmonic&#8208;promoted interatomic hot electron redistribution on the surface of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles promotes the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is successfully clarified. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect can boost the transfer of plasmonic hot electrons from Au atoms to Cu atoms, trigger the interatomic electron regulation of Au3Cu alloy nanoparticles, enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, and increase the ammonia yield by approximately 93.9%. This work provides an important reference for rationally designing and utilizing the LSPR effect to efficiently regulate the distribution and mechanism of plasmonic hot carriers on the surface of heterogeneous alloy nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Calibrating the Oxidative Capacity of Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, redox reactions have been reported to occur spontaneously in microdroplets. The origins of such reactivity are still debated, and any systematic correlation of the yield with the reactivity of the reactant is yet to be established. We report the simple, outer&#8208;sphere, one&#8208;electron oxidation of a series of ferrocene derivatives spanning oxidation potentials from &#8722;0.1 V to +0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl generated via nebulization and measured by mass spectrometry of the ferrocenium ions. The reaction environments and dynamics in the droplets are complex, and it is still unclear whether such reactivity correlates with bulk thermodynamic values. Our key finding is that the ion yields decrease monotonically with the oxidation potential of the ferrocenes, which is a thermodynamic quantity. The ion yields emphatically do not obey the Nernstian ratio, revealing the redox processes in the droplets do not follow the assumptions of bulk steady&#8208;state electrochemistry. Furthermore, oxidative competition in the mixture of several ferrocenes suggest a finite oxidative capacity or oxidant concentration. These results demonstrate that even though ion generation could be an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium and kinetically limited process, the oxidative yield in microdroplets does correlate with thermodynamics, suggesting a possible free energy relationship between the kinetics and thermodynamics of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Cyctetryptomycin A and B Enabled by Zr&#8208;Catalyzed Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise synthetic strategy utilizing a Zr&#8208;catalyst for the construction of cyctetryptomycin A and B is herein reported. Cyctetryptomycin A and B are recently isolated, complex tetrameric natural products for which total synthesis has not been previously reported. This study presents a practical approach for the construction of two consecutive quaternary carbon centers via a Zr&#8208;catalyst. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of cyctetryptomycin A and B was achieved by this Zr&#8208;catalyzed radical coupling. The radical dimerization reaction mediated by the Zr&#8208;catalyst required dppe as an indispensable additive. Through both experimental and theoretical investigations into the mechanism of this Zr&#8208;catalyzed reaction, the specific role of dppe was elucidated. In addition, the synthetic approach was extended to enable the practical synthesis of other dimeric natural products, including tetratryptomycin A, dibrevianamide F, and ditryptophenaline. Finally, the synthetic mechanism of cyctetryptomycin A and B, through the oxidative macrocyclization of tetratryptomycin A by CttpC, was newly elucidated by both experimental and docking simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Sodium Ion Batteries Enabled by Switching Sodiophobic Graphite into Sodiophilic and High&#8208;Capacity Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium&#8208;ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost&#8208;effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (&lt;130 mAh g&#8208;1) and high redox potential (&gt;0.6 V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high&#8208;capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs) via co&#8208;intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t&#8208;GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18 V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7 % over 550 cycles and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 588.4 mAh g&#8208;1 at 6 C (10 min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259 Wh kg&#8208;1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in&#8208;situ generated space among t&#8208;GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Construction of Polycyclic Heterocycles Containing a [6&#8208;6&#8208;5] or [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] Tricyclic Core Skeleton from a 2&#8208;Isocyanophenyl Propargylic Ester</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalized isocyanide chemistry represents an important research area in organic synthesis. A structurally unique 2&#8208;isocyanophenl propargylic ester has been designed to incorporate the reactivity of isocyanide and propargylic ester. Thus, the reaction of 2&#8208;isocyanophenyl propargylic ester and 2&#8208;aminoaromatic aldimine facilitates the synthesis of a wide range of polycyclic benzo[b]indolo[3,2&#8208;h][1,6]naphthyridine derivatives. Furthermore, reacting with 2&#8208;hydroxyaromatic aldimine enables the divergent synthesis of both the aforementioned scaffolds and another structurally distinctive diazabenzo[f]naphtho[2,3,4&#8208;ij]azulenes featuring a [7&#8208;6&#8208;5] core skeleton. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest that these transformations likely proceed via the in situ generation of a strained cyclopropen&#8208;imine species followed by [3+2] cycloaddition. Next, switchable nucleophilic attack/ring&#8208;expansion/aromatization and nucleophilic addition/ring&#8208;expansion/elimination account for the observed selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Mirror&#8208;Image Random Nonstandard Peptide Integrated Discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) Technology Yields Highly Stable and Selective Macrocyclic Peptide Inhibitors for Matrix Metallopeptidase 7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Matrix metallopeptidase 7 (MMP7) plays a crucial role in cancer metastasis and progression, making it an attractive target for therapeutic development. However, the development of selective MMP7 inhibitors is challenging due to the conservation of active sites across various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Here, we have developed mirror&#8208;image random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (MI&#8208;RaPID) technology to discover innate protease&#8208;resistant macrocyclic peptides that specifically bind to and inhibit human MMP7. One identified macrocyclic peptide against&#160;D&#8208;MMP7, termed&#160;D20, was synthesized in its mirror&#8208;image form,&#160;D&#8217;20, consisting of 12&#160;D&#8208;amino acids, one cyclic&#160;b&#8208;amino acid, and a thioether bond. Notably, it potently inhibited MMP7 with an IC50&#160;value of 90 nM, and showed excellent selectivity over other MMPs&#160;with similar substrate specificity. Moreover,&#160;D&#8217;20&#160;inhibited the migration of pancreatic cell line CFPAC&#8208;1, but had no effect on the cell proliferation and viability.&#160;D&#8217;20&#160;exhibited excellent stability in human serum, as well as in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids.&#160;This study highlights that MI&#8208;RaPID technology can serve as a powerful tool to develop&#160;in vivo&#160;stable macrocyclic peptides for therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to high&#8208;value carbon&#8208;based chemicals provides a sustainable approach to achieving an artificial carbon cycle. In the decade, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), a kind of porous crystalline porous materials featuring well&#8208;defined structures, large surface area, high porosity, diverse components, easy tailorability, and controllable morphology, have attracted considerable research attention, serving as electrocatalysts to drive CO2 reduction. In this review, the reaction mechanisms of electrochemical CO2 reduction and the structure/component advantages of MOFs meeting the requirements of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction are analyzed. After that, the representative progress for the precise fabrication of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, focusing on catalytic site design and microenvironment modulation, are systemically summarized. Furthermore, the emerging applications and promising research for more practical scenarios related to electrochemical CO2 conversion are specifically proposed. Finally, the remaining challenges and future outlook of MOFs for electrochemical CO2 reduction are further discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Annealing Effects on Long&#8208;lived Fluorenol Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Styrene Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorene derivatives have been widely developed in OLEDs because of its efficient fluorescence quantum efficiency, but for which unique rigid biphenyl planar structure and large conjugated system, we hypothesize that they have a great potential for room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) applications, and confirmed this conjecture by subjecting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and phosphors to thermal annealing. The cross&#8208;linked structure formed during thermal annealing judiciously modulates the phosphorescence emission characteristics of the fluorenol with the synergistic interaction between PVA and fluorenol. Specifically, the lifetime exhibited a substantial increase from 1352.2 ms to 2874.1 ms, accompanied by a quantum yield augmentation from 4.8% to 11.3%, which substantiate that cross&#8208;linked induced by thermal annealing effectively amplifies the phosphorescent intensity and stability of the phosphors, facilitating ultralong phosphorescent emission at ambient conditions. Furthermore, an effective probe based on this film is developed for its highly sensitive, quantitative and immediate detection of volatile organic compounds. This investigation not only proffers a novel paradigm for the development of advanced RTP materials but also imparts insightful considerations for optimizing the performance of polymers in conjunction with functional materials, encompassing bioimaging, sensing, and optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Stable Chiral Aminosulfonium Ylides and Their Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation and catalytic enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable S&#8208;stereogenic sulfonium ylides has been a significant challenge in the field of asymmetric synthesis. These reactive intermediates are crucial for a variety of synthetic transformations, yet their inherent tendency towards rapid inversion at the sulfur stereocenter has hindered their practical utilization. Conventional approaches have focused on strategies that incorporate a C=S bond&#8208;containing cyclic framework to help mitigate this stereochemical lability. In this work, we present an alternative tactic that leverages the stabilizing influence of an adjacent N&#8208;atom and cyclic sulfide moiety. Exploiting a copper catalyzed enantioselective intermolecular carbene transfer reaction, structurally diverse S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylides have been achieved in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. Experimental results indicate that the careful selection of 2&#8208;diazo&#8208;1,3&#8208;diketone precursors is crucial for achieving optimal stereoinduction in this transformation. The resulting highly enantioenriched aminosulfonium ylides allow for further stereospecific elaborations to furnish aminosulfonium ylide oxides and sulfinamide. This work expands the boundaries of chiral sulfonium ylide chemistry, providing access to a broad range of previously elusive S&#8208;stereogenic aminosulfonium ylide scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Coordination Solvation Structure for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries via Electric Dipole&#8208;Dipole Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unveiling inherent interactions among solvents, Li+ ions, and anions are crucial in dictating solvation&#8208;desolvation kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Developing an electrolyte with a low ion&#8208;transport barrier and minimal solvent coordination in its interfacial solvation structure is essential for forming an anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interface, a key component for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, we harness electric dipole&#8208;dipole synergistic interactions to formulate an electrolyte with significantly reduced interfacial solvent coordination. Operando characterization and theoretical analysis reveal that 2&#8208;fluoropyridine (FPy) with high dipole preferentially adsorbs onto the Li metal surface. The adsorbed FPy molecule squeezes succinonitrile in the primary solvation sheath through steric hindrance, leading to the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich interphase. Consequently, the introduction of FPy enhances the reversible capacity of the LiCoO2||Li cell, which maintains a capacity of 143 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles at a 1C rate. Moreover, the cycle life of LiCoO2 batteries with a limited supply of lithium extends from 120 cycles to over 200 cycles. These findings offer a strategy that can be applied broadly to design interfacial solvation structures for various metal&#8208;ion/metal&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Shotgun Sequencing of 512&#8208;mer Copolyester Allows Random Access to Stored Information</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Digital information encoded in polymers has been exclusively decoded by mass spectrometry. However, the size limit of analytes in mass spectrometry restricts the storage capacity per chain. In addition, sequential decoding hinders random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing. Here we report the shotgun sequencing of a 512&#8208;mer sequence&#8208;defined polymer whose molecular weight (57.3 kDa) far exceeds the analytical limit of mass spectrometry. A 4&#8208;bit fragmentation code was implemented at aperiodic positions during the synthetic encoding of 512&#8208;bit information without affecting storage capacity per chain. Upon activating the fragmentation code, the polymer chain splits into 18 oligomers, which could be individually decoded by tandem&#8208;mass sequencing. These sequences were computationally reconstructed into a full sequence using an error&#8208;detection method. The proposed sequencing method eliminates the storage limit of a single polymer chain and allows random access to the bits of interest without full&#8208;chain sequencing.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbenoids with Sulfinate as Nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;Type Homologation: Direct Insertion of Oxygen&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Substituted Units into Carbon&#8210;Boron Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenoid insertion into boronate carbon&#8722;boron bonds, namely the Matteson&#8208;type homologation, has been recognized as a powerful tool for constructing carbon&#8722;carbon bonds. However, some limitations and inconvenience still exist with the carbenoids currently employed, such as the use of highly cryogenic and basic conditions. Herein, we report a new class of stable carbenoids with sulfinate as nucleofuge for Matteson&#8208;type homologations, which directly introduce O&#8208; and N&#8208;substituted methylenes into carbon&#8722;boron bonds. Enabled by oxazaborolidines as the boronic substrates, the reaction is operatable at 0 oC or room temperature with weaker bases. Broad functional groups, including acidic C&#8722;H bonds, can be tolerated. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated in the gram&#8208;scale synthesis and iterative insertion of various carbenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>Eliminating Hydrogen Fluoride through Piperidine&#8208;Doped Separators for Stable Li Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrofluoric acid (HF)&#8208;induced electrode and interfacial structure degeneration poses a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). To address this issue, we propose a separator strategy that involves decorating a regular polyethylene (PE) separator with molecular sieves (TW) impregnated with piperidine (PI). The porous structure of the TW serves as a reaction chamber for PI and HF. As a result, the HF content in the controlled electrolyte with 500 ppm H2O (ELE&#8208;500) is notably reduced when using TW@PI&#8208;PE separators, thereby shielding nickel&#8208;rich cathodes from HF etching. Simultaneously, due to the hydrolysis of Li salts, and the inertness of PI towards H2O, a uniform lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can form on the Li metal anode, further mitigating dendrite formation. The lifespan of the symmetric Li cell using the TW@PI&#8208;PE separator is doubled in ELE&#8208;500, exhibiting stable 500&#8208;hour cycles at 3 mA cm&#8722;2 and 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Additionally, with the effective limitation of transition metal (TM) dissolution, the 4.6&#8208;V LMBs employing a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode maintain an 81% capacity retention over 100 cycles, even in ELE&#8208;1000. The innovative TW@PI system presented here offers a fresh perspective for future research aimed at eliminating HF in LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Solvent Free DLP 3D Printing of Degradable Poly(Allyl Glycidyl Ether Succinate)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Digital light processing (DLP) printing forms solid constructs from fluidic resins by photochemically crosslinking polymeric resins with reactive functional groups. DLP is used widely due to its efficient, high&#8208;resolution printing, but its use and translational potential has been limited in some applications as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resins experience unpredictable and anisotropic part shrinkage due to the use of solvent needed to reduce resin viscosity and layer dependent crosslinking. Herein, poly(allyl glycidyl ether succinate) (PAGES), a low viscosity, degradable polyester, was synthesized by ring opening copolymerization and used in combination with degradable thiol crosslinkers to afford a solvent free resin that can be utilized in DLP printing. Varying resin formulations of PAGES polymer are shown to decrease part shrinkage from 14% to 0.3%. Photochemically printed parts fabricated from PAGES possess tensile moduli between 0.43 and 6.18 MPa and degradation profiles are shown to vary between 12 and 40 days under accelerated conditions based on degree of polymerization and crosslink ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Energy Transfer in the Sensitization of Americium Enables Observation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first example of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a molecular americium (Am) complex is reported. Coordination of Am(III) by a combination of thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and chiral diphosphine oxide ligands yielded a complex with strong sensitized metal&#8208;centered luminescence. The energy transfer process for sensitization appears to occur via a unique resonant pathway, which results in the removal of the overlap between ligand phosphorescence and sensitized Am luminescence that has always been observed. Owing to this feature, and despite the limited amount of material that could be used due to the radioactivity of 241Am, CPL could be measured. The collected luminescence and CPL spectra provide insight into the crystal field splitting of the 5D1 &#8594; 7F1 transition. These results pave the way for future studies of Am(III) luminescence to investigate electronic structure effects in this and other 5f elements.</dc:description>

         <title>Configurational Isomerization&#8208;Induced Orientation Switching: Non&#8208;Fused Ring Dipodal Phosphonic Acids as Hole&#8208;Extraction Layers for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphonic acid (PA) self&#8208;assembled molecules have recently emerged as efficient hole&#8208;extraction layers (HELs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the structural effects of PAs on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on indium tin oxide (ITO) and thus photovoltaic performance remain obscure. Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR&#8208;DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR&#8208;DPA with linear (C2h symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face&#8208;on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C2v symmetry) and non&#8208;brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier&#8208;free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11% with a low voltage loss of 0.52 V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA&#8208;based HELs for high&#8208;performance OSCs.</dc:description>

This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier-free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11% with a low voltage loss of 0.52 V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA-based HELs for high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Reaction Induced Compressive Strain for Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cesium&#8208;based inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising light&#8208;harvesting materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their promising thermal&#8208; and photo&#8208;stability. However, obstacles to commercialization remain regarding their phase instability. In this work, we report a facile and effective strategy to regulate the surface compressive strain via in&#8208;situ surface reaction to stabilize CsPbI3 perovskite. The use of a chelating ligand with a molecular configuration closely matching the integer multiples of the unit cell lattice parameters of CsPbI3 induces compressive strain at the surface of CsPbI3. The chemical bonding and strain modulation synergistically not only passivate film defects, but also inhibit perovskite phase degradation, thus significantly improving the intrinsic stability of inorganic perovskite. Consequently, enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.0% and 18.6% were respectively achieved in 0.16&#8208;cm2 lab&#8208;scale devices and 25.3&#8208;cm2 solar modules. Further, surface reaction enables PSCs with enhanced thermal and operational stability; these devices retain over 95% of their initial PCE after damp&#8208;heat tests (i.e., in 85 &#8451; and 85% R.H. air) for 2000 h, and remain 99% of their initial PCE after operating for 2000 h, representing one of the most stable inorganic PSCs reported so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Coordination&#8208;Accelerated Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emission for Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible Ultrapure Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) type emitters have emerged as highly promising candidates for high&#8208;resolution organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emissions with simultaneous short excited state lifetimes and ultrapure blue color (a CIEy close to 0.046 and an emission peak &gt; 440 nm) have rarely been obtained for MR emitters. Herein, we report a design of dual gold&#8208;coordinated MR molecules to achieve efficient and short&#8208;lived ultrapure blue TADF emission. The dinuclear Au(I) complex, namely iPrAuBN, shows a narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission with a peak maximum of 448 nm and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29 nm in doped film. The coordination with two Au atoms significantly shortens the delayed fluorescence lifetime to 7.8 &#956;s in comparing with 60.6 &#956;s for the organic analogue. Solution&#8208;processed OLED doped with iPrAuBN demonstrates an ultrapure blue electroluminescence with a peak maximum of 442 nm, a FWHM of 19 nm, Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.154, 0.036), and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 14.8%.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic Ion Barrier&#8208;Enabled Ultradurable Zn (002) Plane Orientation towards Long&#8208;Life Anode&#8208;Less Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating in original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes. As&#8208;assembled anode&#8208;less Zn&#8214;VOPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O full cells (N/P ratio: 2&#8201;:&#8201;1) show a high energy density of 75.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 full electrode after 842&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far surpassing conventional counterpart with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass.







Abstract
Gradual disability of Zn anode and high negative/positive electrode (N/P) ratio usually depreciate calendar life and energy density of aqueous Zn batteries (AZBs). Herein, within original Zn2+&#8208;free hydrated electrolytes, a steric hindrance/electric field shielding&#8208;driven &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; is engineered towards ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed Zn stripping/plating to solve this issue. Guided by theoretical simulations, hydrophobic adiponitrile (ADN) is employed as a steric hindrance agent to ally with inert electric field shielding additive (Mn2+) for plane adsorption priority manipulation, thereby constructing the &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221;. This design robustly suppresses the (002) plane/dendrite growth, enabling ultradurable (002) plane&#8208;exposed dendrite&#8208;free Zn stripping/plating. Even being cycled in Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cell over 2150&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the efficacy remains well&#8208;kept. Additionally, Zn&#8214;Zn symmetric cells can be also stably cycled over 918&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, verifying uncompromised Zn stripping/plating kinetics. As&#8208;assembled anode&#8208;less Zn&#8214;VOPO4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O full cells with a low N/P ratio (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) show a high energy density of 75.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1full electrode after 842&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, far surpassing counterparts with thick Zn anode and low cathode loading mass, featuring excellent practicality. This study opens a new avenue by robust &#8220;hydrophobic ion barrier&#8221; design to develop long&#8208;life anode&#8208;less Zn batteries.

         <title>In Vivo Synthetic Anticancer Approach by Resourcing Mouse Blood Albumin as a Biocompatible Artificial Metalloenzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), capable of in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions, were prepared using circulating albumin in the bloodstream, through the reaction with a ruthenium catalyst. The in situ prepared ArM was transported to the cancer and catalyzed a reaction with proapoptotic peptides, effectively suppressing cancer proliferation.







Abstract
Methods for producing drugs directly at the cancer site, particularly using bioorthogonal metal catalysts, are being explored to mitigate the side effects of therapy. Albumin&#8208;based artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) catalyze reactions in living mice while protecting the catalyst in the hydrophobic pocket. Here, we describe the in situ preparation and application of biocompatible tumor&#8208;targeting ArMs using circulating albumin, which is abundant in the bloodstream. The ArM was formed using blood albumin through the intravenous injection of ruthenium conjugated with an albumin&#8208;binding ligand; the tumor&#8208;targeting unit was conjugated to the ArM using its catalytic activity, and the ArM was transported to the cancer site. The delivered ArM catalyzed a second tagging reaction of the proapoptotic peptide on the cancer surface, successfully suppressing cancer proliferation. This approach, which efficiently leveraged the persisting reactivity twice in vivo, holds promise for future in vivo metal&#8208;catalyzed drug synthesis utilizing endogenous albumin.

         <title>Electrochemical Skeletal Indole Editing via Nitrogen Atom Insertion by Sustainable Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct editing of the core heterocyclic skeleton of pharmaceutical lead compounds typically relies on superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. Herein, we report the electrochemical nitrogen atom insertion reaction into indoles enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, leading to the formation of biologically active quinazoline scaffolds.







Abstract
Skeletal molecular editing gained considerable recent momentum and emerged as a uniquely powerful tool for late&#8208;stage diversifications. Thus far, superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents were largely required for skeletal indole editing. In contrast, we herein show that electricity enables sustainable nitrogen atom insertion reactions to give bio&#8208;relevant quinazoline scaffolds without stoichiometric chemical redox&#8208;waste product. The transition metal&#8208;free electro&#8208;editing was enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and proved robust on scale, while tolerating a variety of valuable functional groups.

&lt;p&gt;Direct editing of the core heterocyclic skeleton of pharmaceutical lead compounds typically relies on superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. Herein, we report the electrochemical nitrogen atom insertion reaction into indoles enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, leading to the formation of biologically active quinazoline scaffolds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeletal molecular editing gained considerable recent momentum and emerged as a uniquely powerful tool for late-stage diversifications. Thus far, superstoichiometric amounts of costly hypervalent iodine(III) reagents were largely required for skeletal indole editing. In contrast, we herein show that electricity enables sustainable nitrogen atom insertion reactions to give bio-relevant quinazoline scaffolds without stoichiometric chemical redox-waste product. The transition metal-free electro-editing was enabled by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and proved robust on scale, while tolerating a variety of valuable functional groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Anion&#8208;Conductive Viologen&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes as Nanopower Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;based 2DP (V2DP) membrane that can simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, possessing great positive charge density and abundant ion transport nanochannels. Benefitting from the tailored pore size of 4.5&#8197;nm, it demonstrates an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;103&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 and maintains a substantial anion selectivity of 0.70, as a result, it realizes a remarkable power density of 55&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) and their layer&#8208;stacked 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) membranes hold great potential for harvesting sustainable osmotic energy. The nascent research has yet to simultaneously achieve high ionic flux and selectivity, primarily due to inefficient ion transport dynamics. This is directly related to ultrasmall pore size (&lt;3&#8197;nm), much smaller than the duple Debye length in the diluted electrolyte (6&#8211;20&#8197;nm), as well as low charge density (&lt;4.5&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2). Here, we introduce a &#960;&#8208;conjugated viologen&#8208;based 2DP (V2DP) membrane possessing a large pore size of 4.5&#8197;nm, strategically enhancing the overlapping of the electric double layer, coupled with an exceptional positive surface charge density (~6&#8197;mC&#8201;m&#8722;2). These characteristics enable the membrane to facilitate high anion flux while maintaining ideal selectivity. Notably, V2DP membranes realize an impressive current density of 5.5&#215;103&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2, surpassing benchmarks set by previously reported nanofluidic membranes. In the practical application scenario involving the mixing of artificial seawater and river water, the V2DP membranes exhibit a considerable ion transference number of 0.70 towards Cl&#8722;, contributing to an outstanding power density of ~55&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations reveal the important role of the large quantity of anion transport sites, which act as binding sites evenly located in the positively charged N&#8208;containing pyridine rings. These binding sites enable kinematic coupling and decoupling between anions and the V2DP skeleton, establishing a continuous Cl&#8722; ion transport pathway. This work demonstrates the great promise of large&#8208;area ultrathin 2DP membranes featuring highly organized charged ion transport networks when applied for osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>Se&#8208;Elemental Concentration Gradient Regulation for Efficient Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells With High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited for the first time through TA&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source to prepare high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films. This strategy regulates the energy level structures to produce a favourable energy band structure, suppressing hole&#8208;transport energy level barrier and amplifying electron&#8208;transport driving force. The champion Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ solar cell displays an considerable efficiency of 9.28&#8201;% with the highest Voc of 0.70&#8197;V (&#951;&gt;9.0&#8201;%).







Abstract
Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3), featuring large absorption coefficient, excellent crystal structure stability, benign non&#8208;toxic characteristic, outstanding humidity and ultraviolet tolerability, has recently attracted enormous attention and research interest regarding its photoelectric conversion properties. However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) for Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based photovoltaic devices is relatively low, especially for the device with a high power conversion efficiency (&#951;). Herein, an innovative Se&#8208;elemental concentration gradient regulation strategy has been exploited to produce high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 films on TiO2/CdS substrates through a thioacetamide(TA)&#8208;synergistic dual&#8208;sulfur source hydrothermal&#8208;processed method. The Se&#8208;elemental gradient distribution produces a favorable energy band structure, which suppresses the energy level barriers for hole transport and enhances the driving force for electron transport in Sb2(S,Se)3 film. This facilitates efficient charge transport/separation of photogenerated carriers and boosts significantly the Voc of Sb2(S,Se)3 photovoltaic devices. The champion TA&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 planar heterojunction (PHJ) solar cell displays an considerable &#951; of 9.28&#8201;% accompanied by an exciting Voc rising to 0.70&#8197;V that is currently the highest among Sb2(S,Se)3&#8208;based solar cells with efficiencies exceeding 9.0&#8201;%. This research is anticipated to contribute to the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 thin film and the achievement of efficient inorganic Sb2(S,Se)3 PHJ photovoltaic device.

         <title>Carbonic Anhydrase Variants Catalyze the Reduction of Dialkyl Ketones with High Enantioselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones containing two similar alkyl groups is challenging. Although human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction of achiral water and CO2 to form achiral carbonic acid, the active zinc site in hCAII catalyzes, through a zinc&#8208;hydride, highly enantioselective reductions of a wide range of dialkyl ketones. Variants of hCAII react with distinct selectivites.







Abstract
Human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction between two achiral molecules&#8212;water and carbon dioxide&#8212;to yield the achiral product carbonic acid through a zinc hydroxide intermediate. We have previously shown that a zinc hydride, instead of a hydroxide, can be generated in this enzyme to create a catalyst for the reduction of aryl ketones. Dialkyl ketones are more challenging to reduce, and the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with two alkyl groups that are similar in size and electronic properties, is a particularly challenging transformation to achieve with high activity and selectivity. Here, we show that hCAII, as well as a double mutant of it, catalyzes the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with high yields and enantioselectivities, even when the two alkyl groups are similar in size. We also show that variants of hCAII catalyze the site&#8208;selective reduction of one ketone over the other in an unsymmetrical aliphatic diketone. Computational docking of a dialkyl ketone to variants of hCAII containing the zinc hydride provides insights into the origins of the reactivity of various substrates and the high enantioselectivity of the transformations and show how a confined environment can control the enantioselectivity of an abiological intermediate.

         <dc:description>A large&#8208;sized single crystalline 2D COFs with excellent crystallinity and stability was prepared through the traditional thermal solvent method. The electrochemical performance can be significantly enhanced using a straightforward hybrid approach that involves in&#8208;situ growth of the 2D COFs on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).

         <title>Coupling Manipulation of Interfacial Chemistry and Coordination Structure in Vanadium Oxides Enables Rapid Magnesium Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) are a highly promising energy storage system due to their high volumetric capacity and intrinsic safety. However, the practical development of RMBs is hindered by the sluggish Mg2+ diffusion kinetics, including at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) and within the cathode bulk. Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L&#8208;V2O5) for achieving rapid Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. In terms of the interfacial chemistry, the specific exposed crystal planes in L&#8208;V2O5 possess strong electron donating ability, which helps to promote the degradation dynamics of C&#8211;F/C&#8211;S bonds in the electrolyte, thereby establishing the inorganic&#8208;organic interlocking CEI layer for rapid Mg2+ diffusion. In terms of the coordination structure, the straightened V&#8208;O structure in L&#8208;V2O5 provides efficient ions diffusion path for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion in the cathode. As a result, the L&#8208;V2O5 delivers a high reversible capacity (355.3 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and an excellent rate capability (161 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). Impressively, the interdigital micro&#8208;RMBs is firstly assembled, exhibiting excellent flexibility and practicability. This work gives deeper insights into the interface and interior ions diffusion for developing high&#8208;kinetics RMBs.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose an efficient strategy to manipulate the interfacial chemistry and coordination structure in oligolayered V2O5 (L-V2O5) for achieving rapid Mg2+ diffusion kinetics. In terms of the interfacial chemistry, the specific exposed crystal planes in L-V2O5 possess strong electron donating ability, which helps to promote the degradation dynamics of C&#8211;F/C&#8211;S bonds in the electrolyte, thereby establishing the inorganic-organic interlocking CEI layer for rapid Mg2+ diffusion. In terms of the coordination structure, the straightened V-O structure in L-V2O5 provides efficient ions diffusion path for accelerating Mg2+ diffusion in the cathode. As a result, the L-V2O5 delivers a high reversible capacity (355.3 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and an excellent rate capability (161 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Asymmetric Counteranion&#8208;Directed Electrocatalysis for Enantioselective Control of Radical Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of enantioselectivity in radical cation reactions presents long&#8208;standing challenges, despite a few successful examples. We introduce a novel strategy of asymmetric counteranion&#8208;directed electrocatalysis to address enantioselectivity in radical cation chemistry. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in two reactions: an asymmetric dehydrogenative indole&#8208;phenol [3 + 2] coupling and an atroposelective C&#8208;H/N&#8208;H dehydrogenative coupling. These reactions have enabled the synthesis of benzofuroindolines and C&#8208;N axially chiral indoles with high yields and excellent enantiomeric excesses. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed a radical&#8208;radical coupling mechanism. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the indole radical cation as the pivotal intermediate, rather than a neutral indolyl radical, shedding new light on the underlying processes driving these reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Nonflammable Fluorinated Electrolyte Realizing High Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Zn Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the low decomposition potential of H2O and its corrosive effect to Zn foil, the Zn metal battery with aqueous electrolytes operates within a narrow electrochemical window and exhibits low anode utilization ratio. Fluorinated carbonate ester, exhibiting low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, is suitable for constructing high&#8208;voltage batteries, yet its application in Zn metal battery has been scarcely explored. Herein, we propose an electrolyte based on fluorinated solvents and ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) additive, which exhibits a high decomposition voltage of 2.75 V in Zn batteries. The fluorinated carbonate esters possess non&#8208;flammability and exhibit reduced solvation capacity which in turn promotes the incorporation of anions into Zn2+ solvation shell. Consequently, an anion&#8208;derived interface layer is formed on Zn anode, aiding the compact and planar growth of deposited Zn. Therefore, the Zn//Zn cell exhibits an impressive Zn utilization of 91% for 140 h, a level seldom reported previously. Benefitting from the oxidation resistant solvents and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface layer formed by PFPN additive, the Zn//graphite dual&#8208;ions battery shows an extended cycling life of 1000 cycles. Furthermore, an anode&#8208;free cell was constructed and stably operated for 100 cycles, with a notably high average discharge midpoint voltage of 1.84 V.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically Precise Ternary Cluster: Polyoxometalate Cluster Sandwiched by Gold Clusters Protected by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal (Au, Ag, Cu) cluster and polyoxometalate (POM) cluster represent two types of subnanometer &#8220;artificial atoms&#8221; with significant potential in catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine. While composite clusters combining Ag/Cu clusters with POM have achieved considerable success, the assembly of gold clusters with POM is still lagging. Herein, we first designedly synthesized two cluster structural units: an Au3O cluster stabilized by diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands and an amine&#8208;terminated POM linker. The subsequent reaction involved amine substitution in the POM linker for the central O atom in the Au3O cluster, resulting in the first ternary composite cluster &#8213; a POM cluster sandwiched by two Au clusters protected by NHCs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and other characteristic methods characterized their atomically precise structures. Furthermore, altering the NHC ligands decreased the number of gold atoms in the sandwich structures, accompanying the different protonated degrees of amine ligand in the terminal end of the POM linker. These composite clusters showed excellent performances in catalytic H2O2 conversion through the synergistic effect between gold clusters and POM clusters. This work opens a new avenue to functional composite metal clusters and would promote their enhanced catalysis applications through intercluster synergistic interactions within composite systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Production of Thin and Durable Practical Li Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of thin Li metal is the ultimate pathway to achieving practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries (LMBs), but its practical implementation has been significantly impeded by formidable challenges of poor thinning processability, severe interphase instability and notorious dendritic Li growth. Here we report a practical thin (10&#8208;40 &#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties, achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The in&#8208;situ generated Li2Se and Mo not only enhance the mechanical strength enabling the scalable fabrication of thin Li metal, but also promote homogenous Li electrodeposition. Significantly, the Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance (15 mA cm&#8208;2) and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability (2700 cycles) with exceptional anti&#8208;pulverization capability. The Li|LiFePO4 cells show substantially prolonged cyclability over 1200 cycles with an ultralow decay rate of ~0.01% per cycle. Moreover, the Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability even under the extremely harsh conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive&#8208;capacity (N/P) ratio of ~1.2 and lean electrolyte of ~0.95 g Ah&#8208;1, showing an exceptional energy density of 329.2 Wh kg&#8208;1. This work sheds light on facile pathway for scalable production of durable thin Li metal anode toward reliable practicability.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling by Solid Additive for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling&#160;can hinder exciton&#160;transport and&#160;induce undesirable non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in a shortened exciton diffusion distance and constrained&#160;exciton dissociation in organic solar cells (OSCs). Therefore, suppressing&#160;electron&#8208;phonon coupling is crucially important for achieve high&#8208;performance&#160;OSCs. Here, we employ the solid additive to regulating electron&#8208;phonon coupling in OSCs. The planar configuration of SA1 confers a significant advantage in suppressing lattice vibrations in the active layers, reducing&#160;the scattering of excitons by phonons caused by lattice vibrations. Consequently, a slow but sustained hole transfer process is identified in the SA1&#8208;assisted film, indicating an enhancement in hole transfer efficiency.&#160;Prolonged&#160;exciton diffusion length and exciton lifetime are achieved in the&#160;blend film processed with SA1, attributed to a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate&#160;and low energetic disorder&#160;for charge carrier transport. As a result,&#160;a high&#160;efficiency&#160;of&#160;20% was achieved for ternary device with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current. This work highlights the important role of suppressing electron&#8208;phonon coupling in improving the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Multifunctional Organic Molecules via Michael Addition Reaction to Manage Perovskite Crystallization and Defect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Additive engineering plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;quality light&#8208;absorbing layers for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Various functional groups within the additives exert distinct regulatory effects on the perovskite layer. However, few additive molecules can synergistically fulfill the dual functions of regulating crystallization and passivating defects. Here, we custom&#8208;synthesized 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4&#8208;pyrimidone (UPy) organic small molecules with diverse functional groups as additives to modulate crystallization and defects in perovskite films via the Michael addition reaction. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the &#8208;OH groups in UPy exhibit significant effects in fixing uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, passivation of lead&#8208;iodide antisite defects, alleviating hysteresis, and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Furthermore, the enhanced C=O and &#8208;NH2 motifs interact with the A&#8208;site cation via hydrogen bonding, which relieves residual strain and adjusts crystal orientation. This strategy effectively controls perovskite crystallization and passivates defects, ultimately enhancing the quality of perovskite films. Consequently, the open&#8208;circuit voltage of the UPy&#8208;based p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs reaches 1.20 V, and the fill factor surpasses 84%. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 25.75%. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device maintained 96.9% and 94.5% of its initial efficiency following 3,360 hours of dark storage and 1,866 hours of 1&#8208;sun illumination, respectively.</dc:description>

Various functional groups within the additives exert distinct regulatory effects on the perovskite layer. However, few additive molecules can synergistically fulfill the dual functions of regulating crystallization and passivating defects. Here, we custom-synthesized 2-ureido-4-pyrimidone (UPy) organic small molecules with diverse functional groups as additives to modulate crystallization and defects in perovskite films via the Michael addition reaction. Theoretical and experimental investigations demonstrate that the -OH groups in UPy exhibit significant effects in fixing uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, passivation of lead-iodide antisite defects, alleviating hysteresis, and reducing non-radiative recombination. Furthermore, the enhanced C=O and -NH2 motifs interact with the A-site cation via hydrogen bonding, which relieves residual strain and adjusts crystal orientation. This strategy effectively controls perovskite crystallization and passivates defects, ultimately enhancing the quality of perovskite films. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage of the UPy-based p-i-n PSCs reaches 1.20 V, and the fill factor surpasses 84%. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 25.75%. Remarkably, the unencapsulated device maintained 96.9% and 94.5% of its initial efficiency following 3,360 hours of dark storage and 1,866 hours of 1-sun illumination, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stochastic Sensing of Chloride Anions Using an &#945;&#8208;Hemolysin Pore with a semiaza&#8208;Bambusuril Adapter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic sensing of chloride anions has been developed by employing a semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter inside the &#946; barrel of the &#945;&#8208;hemolysin pore. When the chloride receptor blocks the protein pore, it inhibits the ionic current through the pore, providing a single&#8208;molecule sensing technology and concomitantly allowing detection of its chloride guest. The kinetic parameters are deduced from the single&#8208;channel recordings in the absence and presence of chloride anions.







Abstract
Pores containing molecular adapters provide internal selective binding sites, thereby allowing the stochastic sensing of analytes. Herein, we demonstrate that semiaza&#8208;bambusuril (BU) acts as a non&#8208;covalent molecular adapter when lodged within the lumen of the wild&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;hemolysin (WT&#8208;&#945;HL) protein pore. Because the bambusurils are recognized as anion receptors, the anion binding site within the adapter&#8208;nanopore complex allows the detection of chloride anions, thus converting a non&#8208;selective pore into an anion sensor.

         <title>Discovery, Characterization and Synthetic Application of a Promiscuous Nonheme Iron Biocatalyst with Dual Hydroxylase/Desaturase Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8211;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis. Insights gathered from the biochemical characterization and substrate&#8208;activity profiling of AneA enabled the development of a chemoenzymatic strategy toward several complex sesquiterpenoids.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bandgap&#8208;Tuned Tetragonal Perovskite as Zero&#8208;Strain Anode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PIBs are emerging as a promising energy storage system due to high abundance of potassium resources and theoretical energy density, however, progress of PIBs is severely hindered by structural instability and poor cycling of anode material during continual insertion and extraction of larger&#8208;sized K+. Hence, developing anode material with structural stability and stable cycling remains a great challenge. Herein, bandgap&#8208;tuned Mo&#8208;doped and carbon&#8208;coated lead titanate (CMPTO) with zero&#8208;strain K+ storage is presented as ultra&#8208;stable PIBs anode. Mo doping introduces narrowed bandgap and optimized crystal lattice for enhanced intrinsic electron and ion transfer. Demonstrated by in situ XRD characterizations, the crystal structure stays stable with unchanged peak positions, fully revealing zero&#8208;strain characteristic of CMPTO anode during potassium storage for stable cyclic capability. Ultimately, CMPTO anode achieved ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of 7000 cycles at 500 mA g&#8208;1 with high capacity retention of 90% and considerable specific capacity of 130.9 mAh g&#8208;1 after 600 cycles at 100 mA g&#8208;1; with relatively large density, CMPTO realized eminent volumetric capacity of 1111.09 mAh cm&#8208;3 and ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 10000 cycles at 7041 mA cm&#8208;3. This work introduces a promisingly new route into developing anode materials with ultra&#8208;stable performance for PIBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) pseudohalide rare&#8208;earth double perovskites (PREDPs) have garnered significant attention for their versatile physical properties, including ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, large piezoelectric responses, and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Asymmetric Coupled Binuclear&#8208;Site Catalysts for Low&#8208;Temperature Selective Acetylene Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterogeneous metal catalysts with bifunctional active sites are widely used in chemical industries. Although their improvement process is typically based on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, it is hindered by the lack of model catalysts. Herein, we report an effective vacancy&#8208;pair capturing strategy to fabricate 12 heterogeneous binuclear&#8208;site catalysts (HBSCs) comprising combinations of transition metals on titania. During the synthesis of these HBSCs, proton&#8208;passivation treatment and step&#8208;by&#8208;step electrostatic anchorage enabled the suppression of single&#8208;atom formation and the successive capture of two target metal cations on the titanium&#8211;oxygen vacancy&#8208;pair site. Additionally, during acetylene hydrogenation at 20 &#176;C, the HBSCs (e.g., Pt1Pd1&#8211;TiO2) consistently generated more than two times the ethylene produced by their single&#8208;atom counterparts (e.g., Pd1&#8211;TiO2). Furthermore, the Pt1Pd1 binuclear sites in Pt1Pd1&#8211;TiO2 were demonstrated to catalyze C2H2 hydrogenation via a bifunctional active&#8208;site mechanism: initially C2H2 chemisorb on the Pt1 site, then H2 dissociates and migrates from Pd1 to Pt1, and finally hydrogenation occurs at the Pt1&#8211;Pd1 interface.</dc:description>

Additionally, during acetylene hydrogenation at 20 &#176;C, the HBSCs (e.g., Pt1Pd1&#8211;TiO2) consistently generated more than two times the ethylene produced by their single-atom counterparts (e.g., Pd1&#8211;TiO2). Furthermore, the Pt1Pd1 binuclear sites in Pt1Pd1&#8211;TiO2 were demonstrated to catalyze C2H2 hydrogenation via a bifunctional active-site mechanism: initially C2H2 chemisorb on the Pt1 site, then H2 dissociates and migrates from Pd1 to Pt1, and finally hydrogenation occurs at the Pt1&#8211;Pd1 interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designing Cooperative Ion Transport Pathway in Ultra&#8208;Thin Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes toward Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their decent flexibility, safety, and interfacial stability. However, their development was seriously hindered by the interfacial instability and limited conductivity, leading to inferior electrochemical performance.&#160; Herein, we proposed to design ultra&#8208;thin solid&#8208;state electrolyte with long&#8208;range cooperative ion transport pathway to effectively increase the ionic conductivity and stability. The impregnation of PVDF&#8208;HFP inside pores of &#160;fluorinated covalent organic framework (CF3&#8208;COF) can disrupt its symmetry, rendering rapid ion transportation and inhibited anion imigration. The functional groups of CF3&#8208;COF can interact with PVDF&#8208;HFP to form fast Li+ transport channels, which enables the uniform and confined Li+ conduction within the electrolyte. The introduction of CF3&#8208;COF also enhances the mechanical strength and flexibility of SPEs, as well as ensures homogeneous Li deposition and inhibited dendrite growth. &#160;Hence, a remarkably high conductivity of 1.21&#215;10&#8208;3 S cm&#8208;1 can be achieved. Finally, the ultra&#8208;thin SPEs with an extremely long cycle life exceed 9000 h can be obtained (the longest cycle life reported until now) while the NCM523/Li pouch cell demonstrates a high capacity of 760 mAh and 96% capacity retention after cycling, holding great promises to be utilized for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>30 Seconds to success! &#8211; The Wittig reaction, a fundamental and extensively utilized reaction in organic chemistry, enables the efficient conversion of carbonyl compounds to olefins using phosphonium salts. Traditionally, meticulous reaction setup, including the pre&#8208;formation of a reactive ylide species via deprotonation of a phosphonium salt, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;yielding reactions under classical solution&#8208;based conditions. In this report, we present an unprecedented protocol for an ultra&#8208;fast mechanically induced Wittig reaction under solvent&#8208;free and ambient conditions, often eliminating the need for tedious ylide pre&#8208;formation under strict air and moisture exclusion.&#160;A range of aldehydes and ketones were reacted with diverse phosphonium salts under high&#8208;energy ball milling conditions, frequently giving access to the respective olefins in only 30 seconds.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamically Ion&#8208;Sieved Electrolyte towards Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical deployment of Zn&#8208;ion batteries faces challenges such as dendrite growth, side reactions and cathode dissolution in traditional electrolytes. Here, we develop a highly conductive and dynamically ion&#8208;sieved electrolyte to simultaneously enhance the Zn metal reversibility and suppress the cathode dissolution. The dynamic ion screen at the electrode/electrolyte interface is achieved by numerous pyrane rings with a radius of 3.69 &#197;, which can selectively facilitate the plating/stripping and insertion/extraction process of [Zn(H2O)6]2+ and Zn2+ on the anode and cathode surfaces. As a proof of concept, Zn//Zn symmetric cells deliver exceptional cyclic stability for over 6,800 h and ultrahigh cumulative plated capacity of 3.9 Ah cm&#8722;2. Zn//Na2Mn3O7 cells exhibit satisfactory cycling performance with capacity retention of 82.7% after 4,000 cycles, and the assembled pouch cells achieve excellent stability and durability. This work provides valuable insights into the development of electrolytes aimed at enhancing the interface stability of aqueous batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Metformin Conjugates Acting as Promising PD&#8208;L1 Inhibitors through the AMP&#8208;Activated Protein Kinase Mediated Lysosomal Degradation Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of metalloimmunology, the potential of platinum drugs in cancer immunotherapy has attracted extensive attention. Although immunochemotherapy combining PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 antibodies with platinum drugs has achieved great success in the clinic, combination therapy commonly brings new problems. Herein, we have developed a platinum&#8208;metformin conjugate as a promising alternative to antibody&#8208;based PD&#8208;L1 inhibitors, not only disrupting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 axis on cell surface but also down&#8208;regulating the total PD&#8208;L1 levels in non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells comprehensively, thus achieving highly efficient immunochemotherapy by a single small molecule. Mechanism studies demonstrate that Pt&#8208;metformin conjugate can selectively accumulate in lysosomes, promote lysosomal&#8208;dependent PD&#8208;L1 degradation via the AMPK&#8208;TFEB pathway, and modulate the upstream regulatory proteins related to PD&#8208;L1 expression (e.g. HIF&#8208;1&#945; and NF&#8208;&#954;B), eventually decreasing the total abundance of PD&#8208;L1 in NSCLC, overcoming tumor hypoxia, and activating anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work suggests an AMPK&#8208;mediated lysosomal degradation pathway of PD&#8208;L1 for the first time and provides a unique design perspective for the development of novel platinum drugs for immunochemotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Dendrite&#8208;Free Room Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by a Novel Sodium Thiotellurate Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical application of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries was severely hindered by inhomogeneous sodium deposition and notorious sodium polysulfides (NaPSs) shuttling. Herein, novel sodium thiotellurate (Na2TeS3) interfaces are constructed both on the cathode and anode for Na&#8208;S batteries to simultaneously address the Na dendritic growth and polysulfide shuttling. On the cathode side, a heterostructural sodium sulfide/sodium telluride embedded in a carbon matrix (Na2S/Na2Te@C) was rationally designed through a facile carbothermal reaction, where the Na2TeS3interface will be in&#8208;situ chemically obtained. Such an interface provides abundant electron/ion diffusion channels and ensures rich catalytic surfaces toward Na&#8208;S redox, which could significantly improve the utilization of active material and alleviate polysulfide shuttling in the cathode. On the anode side, the inevitable formation of soluble polytellurosulfides species will migrate on Na anode surface, finally constructing a compact and smooth solid&#8208;electrolyte Na2TeS3 interphase (SEI) layer. Such electrochemical formed Na2TeS3 interface can significantly enhance ionic transport and stabilize Na deposition, thus realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na&#8208;metal plating/stripping. Benefitting from these advantages, an anode&#8208;free cell fabricated with the Na2S/Na2Te@C cathode exhibits an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 634 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C, which could pave a new path to design high&#8208;performance cathodes for anode&#8208;free RT Na&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Spiral&#8208;concave Prussian Blue Crystals with Rich Steps: Growth Mechanism and Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the formation and transformation mechanisms of spiral&#8208;concave crystals holds significant potential for advancing innovative material design and comprehension. We examined the kinetics&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth mechanisms of Prussian Blue crystals with spiral concave structures, and constructed a detailed crystal growth phase diagram. The spiral&#8208;concave hexacyanoferrate (SC&#8208;HCF) crystals, characterized by high&#8208;density surface steps and a low stress&#8208;strain architecture, exhibit enhanced activity due to their facile interaction with reactants. Notably, the coordination environment of SC&#8208;HCF can be precisely modulated by the introduction of diverse metals. Utilizing X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, we elucidated the formation mechanism of SC&#8208;HCF to Co&#8208;HCF facilitated by oriented adsorption&#8208;ion exchange (OA&#8208;IE) process. Both experimental data, and density functional theory confirm that Co&#8208;HCF possesses an optimized energy band structure, capable of adjusting the local electronic environment and enhancing the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction. This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral&#8208;concave structures.</dc:description>

This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral-concave structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regiodivergent Functionalization of Protected and Unprotected Carbohydrates using Photoactive 4&#8208;Tetrafluoropyridinylthio Fragment as an Adaptive Activating Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective functionalization of carbohydrates holds a central position in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry, driving the ongoing quest for ideal approaches to manipulate these compounds. In this study, we introduce a general strategy that enables the regiodivergent functionalization of saccharides. The use of electron&#8208;deficient photoactive 4&#8208;tetrafluoropyridinylthio (SPyf) fragment as an adaptable activating group, facilitated efficient functionalization across all saccharide sites. More importantly, this activating group can be directly installed at the C1, C5 and C6 positions of biomass&#8208;derived carbohydrates in a single step and in a site&#8208;selective manner, allowing for the efficient and precision&#8208;oriented modification of unprotected saccharides and glycans.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Fluorinated Cyclic Ether&#8208;Based Electrolyte with Quasi&#8208;Conjugate Effect for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated ether&#8208;based electrolytes are commonly employed in lithium metal batteries (LMBs) to attenuate the coordination ability of ether solvents with Li+ and induce inorganic&#8208;rich interphase, whereas fluorination inevitably introduces exorbitant production expenses and environmental anxieties. Herein, a non&#8208;fluorinated molecular design strategy has been conceptualized by incorporating methoxy as an electron&#8208;donating group to generate a quasi&#8208;conjugate effect for tuning the affinity of Li+&#8208;solvent, thereby enabling the cyclic ether solvent 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane with weak solvation ability and exceptional Li metal&#8208;compatibility. Accordingly, the optimized electrolyte exhibits anion&#8208;dominant solvation structure for inorganic&#8208;rich interphase and fulfills an impressive Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. As&#8208;fabricated Li||LiFePO4 full cells with limited Li (N/P = 2.5) showcase a high capacity retention of 83% after 150 cycles, indicating excellent cycling stability. Moreover, the full LMBs demonstrate exceptional tolerance towards a wide temperature range from &#8211;20 oC to 60 oC, displaying a remarkable capacity retention of 90% after 110 cycles at &#8211;20 oC. Such a molecular design strategy offers a promising avenue for electrolyte engineering beyond fluorination in order to cultivate high&#8208;performance LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;term Durability of Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen: From Catalysts to Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct electrochemical seawater splitting is a renewable, scalable, and potentially economic approach for green hydrogen production. However, issues related to low durability caused by complex ions in seawater pose great challenges for its industrialization.&#160;In this review, a mechanistic analysis of durability issues of electrolytic seawater splitting is discussed.&#160;We critically analyze the development of seawater electrolysis and identify the durability challenges at both the anode and cathode. Particular emphasis is given to elucidating rational strategies for designing electrocatalysts/electrodes/interfaces with long lifetimes in realistic seawater including inducing passivating anion layers, preferential OH&#8211;&#160;adsorption, employing anti&#8208;corrosion materials, fabricating protective layers, immobilizing Cl&#8211; on the surface of electrocatalysts, tailoring Cl&#8211; adsorption sites, inhibiting binding of OH&#8211; to Mg2+ and Ca2+, inhibiting adherence of Mg and Ca hydroxide precipitation, and co&#8208;electrosynthesis of nano&#8208;sized Mg hydroxides. Synthesis methods of electrocatalysts/electrodes and innovations in electrolyzer are also discussed. Furthermore, the prospects for developing seawater splitting technologies for clean hydrogen generation are summarized. We found that researchers have changed the attitude towards Cl&#8211; ions from &#8220;hate&#8221; to accept to utilize, as well as more attention to cathodic reaction and electrolyzers, which is conducive to accelerate the commercialization of seawater electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Targeted Strong Nb4d&#8208;O2p&#8208;Li2s Configurations to Obtain Excellent Energy Density and Long Life for Li&#8208;rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LMRs) deliver excellent energy density and exhibit low cost, which are considered as the most promising cathode materials for the next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the irreversible redox reaction of the oxygen atoms directly leads to release oxygen and intensifies phase transformation. Besides, the local stress and strain will be generated due to the unit&#8208;cell volume difference between R&#8208;3m and C2/m phases, which continuously aggravates the collapse of secondary particles. Herein, the strong Nb4d&#8208;O2p&#8208;Li2s configurations at the Li1 sites of the TM&#8208;layer in the C2/m phase and secondary particles with the radial arrangement of refined primary particles are designed to inhibit oxygen release and relieve lattice stress by Nb2O5 treatment. Meanwhile, the preferential growth of the active {010} planes is presented to obtain an excellent transmission rate of Li+. As a result, the designed LMR delivers remarkable electrochemical properties with high discharge capacity and initial coulomb efficiency of 276 mA h g&#8208;1 and 85% at 0.1 C, outstanding cycling retention rate of 81% after 300 cycles. This novel crystal structure combining oxygen coordination regulation and micro&#8208;nano scale design provides inspiration for the design of high&#8208;performance LMRs.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;stable all&#8208;iron redox flow battery with innovative anolyte based on steric hindrance regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;soluble all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries (AIRFBs) are an innovative energy storage technology that offer significant financial benefits. Stable and affordable redox&#8208;active materials are essential for the commercialization of AIRFBs, yet the battery stability must be significantly improved to achieve practical value. Herein, ferrous complexes combined with the triisopropanolamine (TIPA) ligand are identified as promising anolytes to extend battery life by reducing cross&#8208;contamination due to a pronounced steric hindrance effect. The coordination structure and failure mechanism of our Fe&#8208;TIPA complexes were determined by molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopic experiments. By coupling with [Fe(CN)6]4 &#8722;/3&#8722; , Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFBs retained excellent stability exceeding 1831 cycles at 80 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 , yielding an energy efficiency of ~80% and maintaining a steady discharge capacity. Moreover, the all&#8208;soluble electrolyte was tested in an industrial&#8208;scale Fe&#8208;TIPA/Fe&#8208;CN AIRFB prototype energy storage system, where an energy efficiency of 81.3% was attained. Given the abundance of iron resources, we model the TIPA AIRFB electrolyte cost to be as low as 32.37 $/kWh, which is significantly cheaper than the current commercial level. This work demonstrates that steric hindrance is an effective measure to extended battery life, facilitating the commercial development of affordable flow batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Intercalation into an Open&#8208;Tunnel Bronze Phase with Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Managing safety and supply&#8208;chain risks associated with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is an urgent task for sustainable development. Aqueous proton batteries are attractive alternatives to LIBs because using water and protons addresses these two risks. However, most host materials undergo large volume changes upon H+ intercalation, which induces intraparticle cracking to accelerates parasitic reactions. Herein, we report that Mo3Nb2O14 bronze exhibits reversible H+ intercalation (200 mAh g&#8722;1) with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% owing to near&#8208;zero volume change and solid&#8208;solution&#8208;type phase transition. Combination of experimental and theoretical analyses clarifies that rotation and shrinkage of open tunnels, which consist of flexible corner&#8208;sharing Mo/NbOn polyhedra, relieve local structural distortions upon H+ intercalation to suppress intraparticle cracking. The prototype full cell of an aqueous proton battery with a Mo3Nb2O14 anode operates stably over 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This study reveals the importance of implementing distortion&#8208;relieving voids in host materials to reduce volume change upon charge/discharge.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Quasi&#8208;single Ion Conductors by a &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Polymer to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the Zn anode remains facing challenges. Here, we report a cyclodextrin polymer (P&#8208;CD) to construct quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for coating and protecting Zn anodes. The P&#8208;CD coating layer inhibited the corrosion of Zn anode and prevented the side reaction of metal anodes. More important is that the cyclodextrin units enabled the trapping of anions through host&#8208;guest interactions and hydrogen bonds, forming a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor that elevated the Zn ion transference number (from 0.31 to 0.68), suppressed the formation of space charge regions and hence stabilized the plating/striping of Zn ions. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cells coated with P&#8208;CD achieved a 70.6 times improvement in cycle life at high current densities of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with 10 mAh cm&#8208;2. Importantly, the Zn//K1.1V3O8 (KVO) full&#8208;cells with high mass loading of cathode materials and low N/P ratio of 1.46 reached the capacity retention of 94.5% after 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8208;1; while the cell without coating failed only after 230 cycles. These results provide novel perspective into the control of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces for stabilizing Zn anode and offer a practical strategy to improve AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure&#8208;property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self&#8208;assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface&#8208;dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;term Autotrophic Growth and Solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical Conversion in Shewanella Oneidensis MR&#8208;1 through Light&#8208;driven Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic&#8208;biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR&#8208;1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral&#8208;assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non&#8208;photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient&#8208;lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Sandwich&#8208;Structured Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Molecules Utilizing 11,12&#8208;Dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing folded molecular structures is emerging as a promising strategy to develop efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. Most folded TADF materials have V&#8208;shaped configurations formed by donors and acceptors linked on carbazole or fluorene bridges. In this work, a facile molecular design strategy is proposed for exploring sandwich&#8208;structured molecules, and a series of novel and robust TADF materials with regular U&#8208;shaped sandwich conformations are constructed by using 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge, xanthone as acceptor, and dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, 9&#8208;phenylcarbazole and indolo[3,2,1&#8208;JK]carbazole as donors. They hold outstanding thermal stability with ultrahigh decomposition temperatures (556&#8211;563 oC), and exhibit fast delayed fluorescence and excellent photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (86%&#8211;97%). The regular and close stacking of acceptor and donors results in rigidified molecular structures with efficient through&#8208;space interaction, which are conducive to suppressing intramolecular motion and reducing reorganized excited&#8208;state energy. The organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using them as emitters exhibit excellent electroluminescence performances, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of up to 30.6%, which is a leading value for the OLEDs based on folded TADF emitters. These results demonstrate the proposed strategy of employing 11,12&#8208;dihydroindolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole as bridge for planar donors and acceptors to construct efficient folded TADF materials is applicable.</dc:description>

         <title>Customized Heteronuclear Dual Single&#8208;Atom and Cluster Assemblies via D&#8208;band Orchestration for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, integrating with well&#8208;dispersed single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) sites, showcase potential in bolstering catalytic activity. However, the precise structural modulation and in&#8208;depth investigation of their catalytic mechanisms pose ongoing challenges. Herein, a proactive cluster lockdown strategy is introduced, relying on the confinement of trinuclear clusters with metal atom exchange in the covalent organic polymers, enabling the targeted synthesis of a series of multicomponent ensembles featuring FeCo (Fe or Co) dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom (DSA) and atomic cluster (AC) configurations (FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC) via thermal pyrolysis. The designed FeCo&#8208;DSA/AC surpasses Fe&#8208; and Co&#8208;derived counterparts by 18 mV and 49 mV in ORR half&#8208;wave potential, whilst exhibiting exemplary performance in Zn&#8208;air batteries. Comprehensive analysis and theoretical simulation elucidate the enhanced activity stems from adeptly orchestrating dz2&#8208;dxz and O 2p orbital hybridization proximate to the Fermi level, fine&#8208;tuning the antibonding states to expedite OH* desorption and OOH* formation, thereby augmenting catalytic activity. This work elucidates the synergistic potentiation of active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts, pioneering innovative targeted design strategies for single&#8208;atom&#8208;cluster electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;One&#8208;stone, Two&#8208;Birds&#8221;: Zinc&#8208;Rich Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Precursors for High&#8208;Entropy Zn&#8208;Air Battery Electrocatalysts with Hierarchical Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active sites of inexpensive transition metal electrocatalysts are sparse and singular, thus high&#8208;entropy alloys composed of non&#8208;precious metals have attracted considerable attention due to their multi&#8208;component synergistic effects. However, the facile synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy composites remains a challenge. Herein, we report a &#8220;one&#8208;stone, two&#8208;birds&#8221; method utilizing zinc (Zn)&#8208;rich metal&#8208;organic frameworks as precursors, by virtue of the low boiling point of Zn (907 &#176;C) and its high volatility in alloys, high&#8208;entropy alloy carbon nanocomposite with a layered pore structure was ultimately synthesized. The experimental results demonstrate that the volatilization of zinc can prevent metal agglomeration and contribute to the formation of uniformly dispersed high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles at slower pyrolysis and cooling rates. Simultaneously, the volatilization of Zn plays a crucial role in creating the hierarchical porous structure. Compared to the zinc&#8208;free HEA/NC&#8208;1, the HEA/NC&#8208;5 derived from the precursor containing 0.8 Zn exhibit massive micropores and mesopores. The resulting nanocomposites represent a synergistic effect between highly dispersed metal catalytic centers and hierarchical adsorption sites, thus achieving excellent electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance with low catalyst loading compared to commercial Pt/C. This convenient zinc&#8208;rich precursor method can be extended to the production of more high&#8208;entropy alloys and various application fields.</dc:description>

However, the facile synthesis of high-entropy alloy composites remains a challenge. Herein, we report a &#8220;one-stone, two-birds&#8221; method utilizing zinc (Zn)-rich metal-organic frameworks as precursors, by virtue of the low boiling point of Zn (907 &#176;C) and its high volatility in alloys, high-entropy alloy carbon nanocomposite with a layered pore structure was ultimately synthesized. The experimental results demonstrate that the volatilization of zinc can prevent metal agglomeration and contribute to the formation of uniformly dispersed high-entropy alloy nanoparticles at slower pyrolysis and cooling rates. Simultaneously, the volatilization of Zn plays a crucial role in creating the hierarchical porous structure. Compared to the zinc-free HEA/NC-1, the HEA/NC-5 derived from the precursor containing 0.8 Zn exhibit massive micropores and mesopores. The resulting nanocomposites represent a synergistic effect between highly dispersed metal catalytic centers and hierarchical adsorption sites, thus achieving excellent electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance with low catalyst loading compared to commercial Pt/C. This convenient zinc-rich precursor method can be extended to the production of more high-entropy alloys and various application fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Triggered by Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a vital role in tuning the geometric and electronic structures of metal species. Generally, a high&#8208;temperature treatment (&gt;500 &#176;C) in reducing atmosphere is required for constructing SMSI, which may induce the sintering of metal species. Herein, we use molten salts as the reaction media to trigger the formation of high&#8208;intensity SMSI at reduced temperatures. The strong ionic polarization of the molten salt promotes the breakage of Ti&#8208;O bonds in the TiO2 support, and hence decreases the energy barrier for the formation of interfacial bonds. Consequently, a high&#8208;intensity SMSI state is achieved in TiO2 supported Ir nanoclusters, evidenced by a large number of Ir&#8208;Ti bonds at the interface, at a low temperature of 350 &#176;C. Moreover, this method is applicable for triggering SMSI in various supported metal catalysts with different oxide supports including CeO2 and SnO2. This newly developed SMSI construction methodology opens a new avenue and holds significant potential for engineering advanced supported metal catalysts toward a broad range of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>S&#8208;S Bond Strategy at Sulfide Heterointerface: Reversing Charge Transfer and Constructing Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient electrocatalyst in sulfides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still poses challenges due to the lack of understanding the role of sulfide heterointerface. Here, we report a sulfide heterostructure RuSx/NbS2, which is composed of 3R&#8208;type NbS2 loaded by amorphous RuSx nanoparticles with S&#8208;S bonds formed at the interface. As HER electrocatalyst, the RuSx/NbS2 shows remarkable low overpotential of 38 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05 mV dec&#8208;1. The intrinsic activity of RuSx/NbS2 is much higher than that of Ru/NbS2 reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS2 to RuSx that driven by the formation of S&#8208;S bonds, resulting in electron&#8208;rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS2. This study provides an effective S&#8208;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Superior Oxygen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a cascade synthetic strategy for preparing well&#8208;defined dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DAC). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we constructed a Fe dual&#8208;atom catalyst bridged by two nitrogen atoms, which exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance. Theoretically, our strategy can be further extended to synthesizing DACs with various metal categories and coordination environments, facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different reaction applications.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been proposed to break the limitation of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in the synergistic activation of multiple molecules and intermediates, offering an additional degree of freedom for catalytic regulation. However, it remains a challenge to synthesize DACs with high uniformity, atomic accuracy, and satisfactory loadings. Herein, we report a facile cascade synthetic strategy for DAC via precise electrostatic interaction control and neighboring vacancy construction. We synthesized well&#8208;defined, uniformly dispersed dual Fe sites which were connected by two nitrogen bonds (denoted as Fe&#8208;N2&#8208;Fe). The as&#8208;synthesized DAC exhibited superior catalytic performances towards oxygen reduction reaction, including good half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#8197;V), high kinetic current density (21.66&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and perfect durability. Theoretical calculation revealed that the DAC structure effectively tunes the oxygen adsorption configuration and decreases the cleavage barrier, thereby improving the catalytic kinetics. The DAC&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air batteries exhibited impressive power densities of 169.8 and 52.18&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which is 1.7 and 2.0 times higher than those based on Pt/C+Ir/C, respectively. We also demonstrated the universality of our strategy in synthesizing other M&#8208;N2&#8208;M DACs (M=Co, Cu, Ru, Pd, Pt, and Au), facilitating the construction of a DAC library for different catalytic applications.

         <title>A Simple and Sequential Strategy for the Introduction of Complexity and Hierarchy in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework (HOF) Crystals for Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures is proposed here. As proof of concept, we have obtained examples of HOF crystals with hierarchical superstructures and the first reported HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF crystals.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a new class of crystalline porous organic molecular materials (POMMs) with great potential for a diverse range of applications. HOFs face common challenges to POMMs, and in general to purely organic crystals, that is, the difficulty of integrating complexity in crystals. Herein, we propose a simple and sequential strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures. The strategy is based on controlling the assembly conditions, avoiding the use of any surface functionalization or template, which allows to obtain hierarchical crystalline porous superstructures in an easy manner. As proof of concept, we obtained the first example of core&#8211;shell (HOF&#8208;on&#8208;HOF) crystals and HOFs with hierarchical superstructures having superhydrophobicity and trapping abilities for the capture of persistent water contaminants such as oils and microplastics. We expect that this strategy could serve as inspiration for the construction of more intricate multiscale structures that could greatly expand the library of HOF materials.

Herein, we propose a simple and sequential strategy for the formation of HOFs with hierarchical superstructures. The strategy is based on controlling the assembly conditions, avoiding the use of any surface functionalization or template, which allows to obtain hierarchical crystalline porous superstructures in an easy manner. As proof of concept, we obtained the first example of core&#8211;shell (HOF-on-HOF) crystals and HOFs with hierarchical superstructures having superhydrophobicity and trapping abilities for the capture of persistent water contaminants such as oils and microplastics. We expect that this strategy could serve as inspiration for the construction of more intricate multiscale structures that could greatly expand the library of HOF materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Taming Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymerization by a Machine&#8208;Learning Discovered Crystallization Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning approach is used to derive a non&#8208;classical model that describes the crystallization of two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators.







Abstract
Rapidly synthesizing high&#8208;quality two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial for their practical applications. While strategies such as slow monomer addition have been developed based on an empirical understanding of their formation process, quantitative guidance remains absent, which prohibits precise optimizations of the experimental conditions. Here, we use a machine&#8208;learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom&#8208;up model derivation for the non&#8208;classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond&#8208;forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation&#8208;elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF&#8208;5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide&#8208;reaching relevance for many of the applications where 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.

         <title>Switching Reaction Pathways of CO2 Electroreduction by Modulating Cations in the Electrochemical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved tunable reaction pathways for CO2 electroreduction by adjusting the cations in the electrochemical double layer. The main product could be switched from CO (Faradaic efficiency of 97.3&#8201;%) to formate (Faradaic efficiency of 93.5&#8201;%) by simply changing the alkali metal cations in the ternary ionic liquid&#8208;based aqueous electrolyte.







Abstract
Tuning the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) solely by changing electrolyte is a very attractive topic. In this study, we conducted CO2RR in different aqueous electrolytes over bulk metal electrodes. It was discovered that controlled CO2RR could be achieved by modulating cations in the electrochemical double layer. Specifically, ionic liquid cations in the electrolyte significantly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), while yielding high Faraday efficiencies toward CO (FECO) or formate (FEformate) depending on the alkali metal cations. For example, the product could be switched from CO (FECO=97.3&#8201;%) to formate (FEformate=93.5&#8201;%) by changing the electrolyte from 0.1&#8197;M KBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;octyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bromide (OmimBr) to 0.1&#8197;M CsBr&#8208;0.5&#8197;M OmimBr aqueous solutions over pristine Cu foil electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the ordered structure generated by the assembly of Omim+ under an applied negative potential alters the hydrogen bonding structure of the interfacial water, thereby inhibiting the HER. The difference in selectivity in the presence of different cations is attributed to the hydrogen bonding effect caused by Omim+, which alters the solvated structure of the alkali metal cations and thus affects the stabilization of intermediates of different pathways.

         <title>Bidentate Coordination Structure Facilitates High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Utilization Aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH) stabilizes the Zn anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling stable cycling of the Zn anode with a maximum area capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a ZUR of 97&#8201;%. At the same time, a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in the four&#8208;electron transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reaction is achieved through a bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. The four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine battery is a promising energy storage device, but the conventional two&#8208;electron reaction potential and energy density of the iodine cathode are far from meeting practical application requirements. Given that iodine is rich in redox reactions, activating the high&#8208;valence iodine cathode reaction has become a promising research direction for developing high&#8208;voltage zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. In this work, by designing a multifunctional electrolyte additive trimethylamine hydrochloride (TAH), a stable high&#8208;valence iodine cathode in four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer I&#8722;/I2/I+ reactions with a high theoretical specific capacity is achieved through a unique amine group, Cl bidentate coordination structure of (TA)ICl. Characterization techniques such as synchrotron radiation, in situ Raman spectra, and DFT calculations are used to verify the mechanism of the stable bidentate structure. This electrolyte additive stabilizes the zinc anode by promoting the desolvation process and shielding mechanism, enabling the zinc anode to cycle steadily at a maximum areal capacity of 57&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 97&#8201;% zinc utilization rate. Finally, the four&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer aqueous Zn&#8722;I2 full cell achieves 5000 stable cycles at an N/P ratio of 2.5. The unique bidentate coordination structure contributes to the further development of high&#8208;valence and high capacity aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Unconventional hcp/fcc Nickel Heteronanocrystal with Asymmetric Convex Sites Boosts Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular precursor&#8208;directed strategy is developed to construct unconventional Ni heteronanocrystals with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating asymmetric surfaces with plenty of convex sites. Such unique convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy while stabilizing interfacial *H2O, synergistically facilitating alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction.







Abstract
Developing non&#8208;platinum group metal catalysts for the sluggish hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is critical for alkaline fuel cells. To date, Ni&#8208;based materials are the most promising candidates but still suffer from insufficient performance. Herein, we report an unconventional hcp/fcc Ni (u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni) heteronanocrystal with multiple epitaxial hcp/fcc heterointerfaces and coherent twin boundaries, generating rugged surfaces with plenty of asymmetric convex sites. Systematic analyses discover that such convex sites enable the adsorption of *H in unusual bridge positions with weakened binding energy, circumventing the over&#8208;strong *H adsorption on traditional hollow positions, and simultaneously stabilizing interfacial *H2O. It thus synergistically optimizes the HOR thermodynamic process as well as reduces the kinetic barrier of the rate&#8208;determining Volmer step. Consequently, the developed u&#8208;hcp/fcc Ni exhibits the top&#8208;rank alkaline HOR activity with a mass activity of 40.6&#8197;mA&#8201;mgNi&#8722;1 (6.3&#8197;times higher than fcc Ni control) together with superior stability and high CO&#8208;tolerance. These results provide a paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts by shifting the adsorption state of intermediates through configuring surface sites.

         <title>p&#8211;d Orbital Hybridization in Ag&#8208;based Electrocatalysts for Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) with strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) NH3 yield rate in electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction at ampere&#8208;level, which can be further extended to Struvite production and Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Mechanistic studies reveal that such p&#8211;d orbital hybridization in SnAg benefits nitrite deoxygenation, the rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis.







Abstract
Considering the substantial role of ammonia, developing highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion has attracted increasing interest. Herein, we proposed a feasible strategy of p&#8211;d orbital hybridization via doping p&#8208;block metals in an Ag host, which drastically promotes the performance of nitrate adsorption and disassociation. Typically, a Sn&#8208;doped Ag catalyst (SnAg) delivers a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.5&#177;1.85&#8201;% for NH3 at &#8722;0.4&#8197;V vs. RHE and reaches the highest NH3 yield rate to 482.3&#177;14.1&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1. In a flow cell, the SnAg catalyst achieves a FE of 90.2&#8201;% at an ampere&#8208;level current density of 1.1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 yield of 78.6&#8197;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, during which NH3 can be further extracted to prepare struvite as high&#8208;quality fertilizer. A mechanistic study reveals that a strong p&#8211;d orbital hybridization effect in SnAg is beneficial for nitrite deoxygenation, a rate&#8208;determining step for NH3 synthesis, which as a general principle, can be further extended to Bi&#8208; and In&#8208;doped Ag catalysts. Moreover, when integrated into a Zn&#8208;nitrate battery, such a SnAg cathode contributes to a superior energy density of 639&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1, high power density of 18.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and continuous NH3 production.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Bonds Enabled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers Recyclability and Material Circularity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) offers a new avenue for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs. This review highlights the recent developments, focusing on crosslinking polymers made from CANs, emphasizing applications in carbon fiber recycling and resin sustainability.







Abstract
Due to their remarkable features of lightweight, high strength, stiffness, high&#8208;temperature resistance, and corrosion resistance, carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are extensively used in sports equipment, vehicles, aircraft, windmill blades, and other sectors. The urging need to develop a resource&#8208;saving and environmentally responsible society requires the recycling of CFRPs. Traditional CFRPs, on the other hand, are difficult to recycle due to the permanent covalent crosslinking of polymer matrices. The combination of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) with carbon fibers (CFs) marks a new development path for closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs and polymer resins. In this review, we summarize the most recent developments of closed&#8208;loop recyclable CFRPs from the unique paradigm of dynamic crosslinking polymers, CANs. These sophisticated materials with diverse functions, oriented towards CFs recycling and resin sustainability, are further categorized into several active domains of dynamic covalent bonds, including ester bonds, imine bonds, disulfide bonds, boronic ester bonds, and acetal linkages, etc. Finally, the possible strategies for the future design of recyclable CFPRs by combining dynamic covalent chemistry innovation with materials interface science are proposed.

         <title>Confined Element Distribution with Structure&#8208;Driven Energy Coupling for Enhanced Prussian Blue Analogue Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Irving&#8208;William order, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements at the M1 site of Prussian blue analogues, is proposed to restrain localized enrichment and release of stresses and induce structure&#8208;driven energy coupling phenomenon.







Abstract
The structural failure of Na2Mn[Fe(CN)6] could not be alleviated with traditional modification strategies through the adjustable composition property of Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), considering that the accumulation and release of stress derived from the MnN6 octahedrons are unilaterally restrained. Herein, a novel application of adjustable composition property, through constructing a coordination competition relationship between chelators and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722; to directionally tune the enrichment of elements, is proposed to restrain structural degradation and induce unconventional energy coupling phenomenon. The non&#8208;uniform distribution of elements at the M1 site of PBAs (NFM&#8208;PB) is manipulated by the sequentially precipitated Ni, Fe, and Mn according to the Irving&#8208;William order. Electrochemically active Fe is operated to accompany Mn, and zero&#8208;strain Ni is modulated to enrich at the surface, synergistically mitigating with the enrichment and release of stress and then significantly improving the structural stability. Furthermore, unconventional energy coupling effect, a fusion of the electrochemical behavior between FeLS and MnHS, is triggered by the confined element distribution, leading to the enhanced electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;polarization ability. Consequently, the NFM&#8208;PB demonstrates superior rate performance and cycling stability. These findings further exploit potentialities of the adjustable composition property and provide new insights into the component design engineering for advanced PBAs.

         <dc:description>
A seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium has been developed as the key core skeleton for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. The low&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring lead to a stabilization of the LUMO via a &#8220;px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation&#8221;. The observed intense emission with a large Stokes shift was attributed to a large structural relaxation with a contribution from a quinoidal resonance structure in the excited state.







Abstract
Positively charged phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles are characteristic core skeletons for functional molecules. While various phosphonium&#8208;containing five&#8208; or six&#8208;membered&#8208;ring compounds have been reported, the seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring phosphepinium have not been fully studied yet. In this study, dithieno[3,2&#8208;b;&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]phosphepinium ions containing electron&#8208;donating aminophenyl groups were synthesized. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the resulting donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor dyes revealed a bent conformation of the central seven&#8208;membered ring. These compounds exhibit fluorescence in the near&#8208;infrared region with a bathochromic shift of ca. 70&#8197;nm compared to a phosphepine oxide congener and a large Stokes shift. High fluorescence quantum yields were obtained even in polar solvents due to the suppression of the nonradiative decay process. A theoretical study revealed that the phosphepinium skeleton is highly electron&#8208;accepting owing to the orbital interaction between a px orbital of the phosphonium moiety and a &#960;* orbital of the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene moiety. Due to the lower&#8208;lying px orbital in the phosphonium moiety compared to that of the phosphine oxide and the bent conformation of the seven&#8208;membered ring, the phosphepinium ring permits effective px&#8211;&#960;* conjugation. A large structural relaxation with a contribution of a quinoidal resonance structure is suggested in the excited state, which should be responsible for the bright emission with a large Stokes shift.

         <title>Spontaneous Transition between Multiple Conductance States and Rectifying Behaviors in an Artificial Single&#8208;Molecule Funnel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel was constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. This molecular funnel exhibited multiple conducting states and spontaneous transitions between them, as well chloride&#8208;selective transport ability and voltage&#8208;dependent gating property (rectification) due to the asymmetrical channel structure.







Abstract
It has long been an aspirational goal to create artificial channel structures that replicate the feat achieved by ion channel proteins. Biological ion channels occasionally demonstrate multiple conductance states (known as subconductance), remaining a challenging property to achieve in artificial channel molecules. We report a funnel&#8208;shaped single&#8208;molecule channel constructed by an electron&#8208;deficient macrocycle and two electron&#8208;deficient aromatic imide arms. Planar lipid bilayer measurements reveal distinct current recordings, including a closed state, two conducting states, and spontaneous transitions between the three states, resembling the events seen in biological ion channels. The transitions result from conformational changes induced by chloride transport in the channel molecule. Both opening states show a non&#8208;linear and rectifying I&#8211;V relationship, indicating voltage&#8208;dependent transport due to the asymmetrical channel structure. This work could enhance our understanding of ion permeation and channel opening mechanism.

         <title>Multiple Functional Bonds Integrated Interphases for Long Cycle Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional bonds integrated strategy is proposed to regulate cathode electrolyte interphase by the trip&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). It endows the 3&#8197;Ah hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 pouch full cell with a capacity retention up to 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have garnered significant interest as one of the most promising energy suppliers for power grid energy storage. However, the poor electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability leads to continual electrolyte decomposition and transition metal dissolution, resulting in rapid performance degradation of SIBs. In this work, we propose a strategy integrating multiple functional bonds to regulate electrode/electrolyte interphase by triple&#8208;coupling of succinonitrile (SN), sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC). Theoretical calculation and experiment results show that the solvation structure of Na+ and ClO4&#8722; is effectively reconfigured by the solvated FEC, SN and PF6&#8722; in PC&#8208;based carbonate electrolyte. The newly developed electrolyte demonstrates increased Na+&#8208;FEC coordination, weakened interaction of Na+&#8208;PC and participation of SN and PF6&#8722; anions in solvation, resulting in the formation of a conformal interfacial layer comprising of sodium oxynitrides (NaNxOy), sodium fluoride (NaF) and phosphorus oxide compounds (NaPxOy). Consequently, a 3&#8197;Ah pouch full cell of hard carbon//NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles. Detailed postmortem analysis of interface chemistry is further illustrated by multiple characterization methods. This study provides a new avenue for developing electrolyte formulations with multiple functional bonds integrated interphases to significantly improve the long&#8208;term cycling stability of SIBs.

         <title>Functionalized Thienopyrazines on NiOx Film as Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Efficient Tin&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells Using a Two&#8208;Step Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three thienopyrazine&#8208;based organic molecules as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) were developed and deposited on NiOx films for tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Using NiOx as interlayer can modify the hydrophilicity and surface roughness of the ITO substrate. The two&#8208;step method was applied to enable better quality of the tin perovskite layer grown on the NiOx/SAM substrates, ultimately achieving a power conversion efficiency of 7.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three functionalized thienopyrazines (TPs), TP&#8208;MN (1), TP&#8208;CA (2), and TPT&#8208;MN (3) were designed and synthesized as self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) deposited on the NiOx film for tin&#8208;perovskite solar cells (TPSCs). Thermal, optical, electrochemical, morphological, crystallinity, hole mobility, and charge recombination properties, as well as DFT&#8208;derived energy levels with electrostatic surface potential mapping of these SAMs, have been thoroughly investigated and discussed. The structure of the TP&#8208;MN (1) single crystal was successfully grown and analyzed to support the uniform SAM produced on the ITO/NiOx substrate. When we used NiOx as HTM in TPSC, the device showed poor performance. To improve the efficiency of TPSC, we utilized a combination of new organic SAMs with NiOx as HTM, the TPSC device exhibited the highest PCE of 7.7&#8201;% for TP&#8208;MN (1). Hence, the designed NiOx/TP&#8208;MN (1) acts as a new model system for the development of efficient SAM&#8208;based TPSC. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of organic SAMs with anchoring CN/CN or CN/COOH groups and NiOx as HTM for TPSC has never been reported elsewhere. The TPSC device based on the NiOx/TP&#8208;MN bilayer exhibits great enduring stability for performance, retaining ~80&#8201;% of its original value for shelf storage over 4000&#8197;h.

         <title>Chemical Reaction Modulated Low&#8208;Dimensional Phase Toward Highly Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional azure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), with a peak external quantum efficiency of more than 16&#8201;%, are developed by optimizing the energy cascade process between low&#8208;dimensional phases, regarding defect passivation and phase distribution regulation, through the inclusion of multifunctional molecular additives.







Abstract
Blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are crucial avenues for achieving full&#8208;color displays and lighting based on perovskite materials. However, the relatively low external quantum efficiency (EQE) has hindered their progression towards commercial applications. Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites stand out as promising candidates for blue PeLEDs, with optimized control over low&#8208;dimensional phases contributing to enhanced radiative properties of excitons. Herein, the impact of organic molecular dopants on the crystallization of various n&#8208;phase structures in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. The results reveal that the highly reactive bis(4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)phosphine oxide (BTF&#8208;PPO) molecule could effectively restrain the formation of organic spacer cation&#8208;ordered layered perovskite phases through chemical reactions, simultaneously passivate those uncoordinated Pb2+ defects. Consequently, the prepared PeLEDs exhibited a maximum EQE of 16.6&#8201;% (@ 490&#8197;nm). The finding provides a new route to design dopant molecules for phase modulation in quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs.

         <title>Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8722;S Bond Length Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching product selectivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is achieved by precisely controlling the Cu&#8722;S bond length. By introducing a S&#8722;Sb covalent bond adjacent to the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond with S atom as a bridge, the Cu&#8722;S bond length is elongated, which affects the adsorption strength and characteristics of key intermediates, and further regulates the reaction pathway, thus driving the CO2RR primary product to switch from HCOOH to CO.







Abstract
Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8722;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8722;S bond from 2.24&#8197;&#197; to 2.30&#8197;&#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72&#8201;%. Conversely, Cu3SbS4 characterized by an elongated Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8722;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu3SbS4 compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano&#8208;shaped correlation between the Cu&#8722;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates that Cu&#8722;S in Cu3SbS4 as double&#8208;active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu3SbS4 toward CO.

     alt="Switching Product Selectivity in CO2 Electroreduction via Cu&#8722;S Bond Length Variation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching product selectivity in electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) is achieved by precisely controlling the Cu&#8722;S bond length. By introducing a S&#8722;Sb covalent bond adjacent to the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond with S atom as a bridge, the Cu&#8722;S bond length is elongated, which affects the adsorption strength and characteristics of key intermediates, and further regulates the reaction pathway, thus driving the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR primary product to switch from HCOOH to CO.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating competitive reaction pathways to direct the selectivity of electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction toward a desired product is crucial but remains challenging. Herein, switching product from HCOOH to CO is achieved by incorporating Sb element into the CuS, in which the Cu&#8722;S ionic bond is coupled with S&#8722;Sb covalent bond through bridging S atoms that elongates the Cu&#8722;S bond from 2.24&#8197;&#197; to 2.30&#8197;&#197;. Consequently, CuS with a shorter Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited a high selectivity for producing HCOOH, with a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72&#8201;%. Conversely, Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; characterized by an elongated Cu&#8722;S bond exhibited the most pronounced production of CO with a maximum FE of 60&#8201;%. In situ spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations revealed that the altered Cu&#8722;S bond length and local coordination environment make the *HCOO binding energy weaker on Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; compared to that on CuS. Notably, a volcano-shaped correlation between the Cu&#8722;S bond length and adsorption strength of *COOH indicates that Cu&#8722;S in Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as double-active sites facilitates the adsorption of *COOH, and thus results in the high selectivity of Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; toward CO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Piezoelectric Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), designated as CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14, were incorporated with 3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;tridecafluorooctyl chains to induce intrinsic polarizability and piezoelectric properties. Utilizing these two COFs to assemble piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs), remarkable output open circuit voltage, short circuit current and stability were produced under the applied force without poling conditions.







Abstract
Organic piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) are attractive in harvesting mechanical energy for various self&#8208;powering systems. However, their practical applications are severely restricted by their low output open circuit voltage. To address this issue, herein, we prepared two two&#8208;dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs, CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14), functionalized with fluorinated alkyl chains for PENGs. The piezoelectricity of both COFs was evidenced by switchable polarization, characteristic butterfly amplitude loops, phase hysteresis loops, conspicuous surface potentials and high piezoelectric coefficient value (d33). The PENGs fabricated with COFs displayed highest output open circuit voltages (60&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;13 and 50&#8197;V for CityU&#8208;14) and delivered satisfactory short circuit current with an excellent stability of over 600 seconds. The superior open circuit voltages of CityU&#8208;13 and CityU&#8208;14 rank in top 1 and 2 among all reported organic materials&#8208;based PENGs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Multicomponent Reactions for the Versatile Synthesis of Thioamides by Radical Thiocarbamoylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams are presented. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners.







Abstract
Thioamides are widely used structures in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, as well as important synthons for the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles. This report presents a series of visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven multicomponent reactions of amines, carbon disulfide, and olefins for the mild and versatile synthesis of linear thioamides and cyclic thiolactams. The use of inexpensive and readily available carbon disulfide as the thiocarbonyl source in a radical pathway enables the facile assembly of structurally diverse amine moieties with non&#8208;nucleophilic carbon&#8208;based reaction partners. Radical thiocarbamoylative cyclization provides a practical protocol that complements traditional approaches to thiolactams relying on deoxythionation. Mechanistic studies reveal that direct photoexcitation of in situ formed dithiocarbamate anions as well as versatile photoinduced electron transfer with diverse electron acceptors are key to the reactions.

         <title>[4]Rhombene: Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Application in Distributed Feedback Lasers With Emission Beyond 830&#8197;nm</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphene, [4]rhombene, was synthesized by solution&#8208;phase chemistry and isolated in single&#8208;crystal form. It was successfully applied in solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers, showing emission beyond 830&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Graphene&#8208;like molecules with multiple zigzag edges are emerging as promising gain materials for organic lasers. Their emission wavelengths can vary widely, ranging from visible to near&#8208;infrared (NIR), as the molecular size increases. Specifically, rhombus&#8208;shaped molecular graphenes with two pairs of parallel zigzag edges, known as [n]rhombenes, are excellent candidates for NIR lasers due to their small energy gaps. However, synthesizing large&#8208;size rhombenes with emission beyond 800&#8197;nm in solution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward synthesis of an aryl&#8208;substituted [4]rhombene derivative, [4]RB&#8208;Ar, using a method that combines intramolecular radical&#8208;radical coupling with Bi(OTf)3&#8208;mediated cyclization of vinyl ethers. The structure of [4]RB&#8208;Ar was confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Bond length analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that aromatic sextets are predominantly localized along the molecule's long axis. Significantly, [4]RB&#8208;Ar demonstrates narrow amplified spontaneous emission at around 834&#8197;nm when dispersed in polystyrene thin films. Moreover, solution&#8208;processed distributed feedback lasers employing [4]RB&#8208;Ar as the active gain material display tunable narrow emissions in the range of 830 to 844&#8197;nm.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Polyurea Ionogel with Mechanical Robustness, Self&#8208;Healing, and Fluorescence Enabled by Hyperbranched Cluster Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the jellyfish, this study introduces a novel hierarchical crosslinking network architectural design strategy. It entails the in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA). Compared to the conventional dynamic crosslinked network structure of ionogel, this well&#8208;designed network imparts remarkable characteristics to the ionogel, including mechanical robustness (high strength, exceptional toughness, puncture resistance), low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence. This network design is promising for developing advanced soft iontronics.







Abstract
Ionogels are promising for soft iontronics, with their network structure playing a pivotal role in determining their performance and potential applications. However, simultaneously achieving mechanical toughness, low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, and fluorescence using existing network structures is challenging. Drawing inspiration from jellyfish, we propose a novel hierarchical crosslinking network structure design for in situ formation of hyperbranched cluster aggregates (HCA) to fabricate polyurea ionogels to overcome these challenges. Leveraging the disparate reactivity of isocyanate groups, we induce the in situ formation of HCA through competing reactions, enhancing toughness and imparting the clustering&#8208;triggered emission of ionogel. This synergy between supramolecular interactions in the network and plasticizing effect in ionic liquid leads to reduced hysteresis of the ionogel. Furthermore, the incorporation of NCO&#8208;terminated prepolymer with dynamic oxime&#8211;urethane bonds (NPU) enables self&#8208;healing and enhances stretchability. Our investigations highlight the significant influence of HCA on ionogel performance, showcasing mechanical robustness including high strength (3.5&#8197;MPa), exceptional toughness (5.5&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), resistance to puncture, and low hysteresis, self&#8208;healing, as well as fluorescence, surpassing conventional dynamic crosslinking approaches. This network design strategy is versatile and can meet the various demands of flexible electronics applications.

         <title>In Situ Production of Hydroxyl Radicals via Three&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction: Opportunities for Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the in situ production of the hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) via the novel three&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (3e&#8722; ORR) to provide insights for overcoming the bottlenecks of the traditional electro&#8208;Fenton process. The features and mechanisms of the 3e&#8722; ORR, including its basic principles and latest progress, are explored. Additionally, practical water&#8208;treatment applications, future developments, and challenges are discussed.







Abstract
The electro&#8208;Fenton (EF) process is an advanced oxidation technology with significant potential; however, it is limited by two steps: generation and activation of H2O2. In contrast to the production of H2O2 via the electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the electrochemical three&#8208;electron (3e&#8722;) ORR can directly activate molecular oxygen to yield the hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH), thus breaking through the conceptual and operational limitations of the traditional EF reaction. Therefore, the 3e&#8722; ORR is a vital process for efficiently producing &#8901;OH in situ, thus charting a new path toward the development of green water&#8208;treatment technologies. This review summarizes the characteristics and mechanisms of the 3e&#8722; ORR, focusing on the basic principles and latest progress in the in situ generation and efficient utilization of &#8901;OH through the modulation of the reaction pathway, shedding light on the rational design of 3e&#8722; ORR catalysts, mechanistic exploration, and practical applications for water treatment. Finally, the future developments and challenges of efficient, stable, and large&#8208;scale utilization of &#8901;OH are discussed based on achieving optimal 3e&#8722; ORR regulation and the potential to combine it with other technologies.

         <title>Formation of a Decanuclear Organometallic Dysprosium Complex via a Radical&#8211;Radical Cross&#8211;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction of pyrazine and allyl radicals led to the formation of a nanoscale decanuclear organometallic {Dy10} complex. This ring&#8208;like {Dy10} complex displays slow magnetic relaxation under a small applied field.







Abstract
Over the years, polynuclear cyclic or torus complexes have attracted increasing interest due to their unique metal topologies and properties. However, the isolation of polynuclear cyclic organometallic complexes is extremely challenging due to their inherent reactivity, which stems from the labile and reactive metal&#8208;carbon bonds. In this study, the pyrazine ligand undergoes a radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling reaction leading to the formation of a decanuclear [(Cp*)20Dy10(L1)10]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12(C7H8) (1; where L1 = anion of 2&#8208;prop&#8208;2&#8208;enyl&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrazine; Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) complex, where all DyIII metal centres are bridged by the anionic L1 ligand. Amongst the family of polynuclear Ln organometallic complexes bearing CpR2Lnx units (CpR = substituted cyclopentadienyl), 1 features the highest nuclearity obtained to date. In&#8208;depth computational studies were conducted to elucidate the proposed reaction mechanism and formation of L1, while probing of the magnetic properties of 1, revealed slow magnetic relaxation upon application of a static dc field.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes Through Hydroalkylation of Alkynyl Boronamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explored the use of a boryl group as a traceless directing group in the nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynes. The approach allows highly selective synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes.







Abstract
Hydroalkylation of alkynes is a powerful method for alkene synthesis. However, regioselectivity has been difficult to achieve in transformations of internal alkynes hindering applications in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes. To overcome these limitations, we explored using boryl groups as versatile directing groups that can control the regioselectivity of the hydroalkylation and subsequently be replaced in a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The result of our exploration is a nickel&#8208;catalyzed hydroalkylation of alkynyl boronamides that provides access to a wide range of trisubstituted alkenes with high regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The reaction can be accomplished with a variety of coupling partners, including primary and secondary alkyl iodides, &#945;&#8208;bromo esters, &#945;&#8208;chloro phthalimides, and &#945;&#8208;chloro boronic esters. Preliminary studies of the reaction mechanism provide evidence for the hydrometalation mechanism and the formation of alkyl radical intermediates.

         <title>Spontaneous Molecular Bromine Production in Sea&#8208;Salt Aerosols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O without additional potent oxidants is proposed. Under acidic conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ can spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Light can promote this process significantly and promote the release of molecular bromine into the gas phase.







Abstract
Bromine chemistry is responsible for the catalytic ozone destruction in the atmosphere. The heterogeneous reactions of sea&#8208;salt aerosols are the main abiotic sources of reactive bromine in the atmosphere. Here, we present a novel mechanism for the activation of bromide ions (Br&#8722;) by O2 and H2O in the absence of additional oxidants. The laboratory and theoretical calculation results demonstrated that under dark conditions, Br&#8722;, O2 and H3O+ could spontaneously generate Br and HO2 radicals through a proton&#8211;electron transfer process at the air&#8211;water interface and in the liquid phase. Our results also showed that light and acidity could significantly promote the activation of Br&#8722; and the production of Br2. The estimated gaseous Br2 production rate was up to 1.55&#215;1010&#8201;molecules&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;s&#8722;1 under light and acidic conditions; these results showed a significant contribution to the atmospheric reactive bromine budget. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during Br&#8722; activation could promote the multiphase oxidation of SO2 to produce sulfuric acid, while the increase in acidity had a positive feedback effect on Br&#8722; activation. Our findings highlight the crucial role of the proton&#8208;electron transfer process in Br2 production; here, H3O+ facilitates the activation of Br&#8722; by O2, serves as a significant source of atmospheric reactive bromine and exerts a profound impact on the atmospheric oxidation capacity.

         <title>Cone Angles Quantify and Predict the Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cone angles of anions correlate with the affinity and reactivity of their complexes akin to Tolman cone angles seen in cation coordination. This behavior is exemplified with binding rigid organo&#8208;trifluoroborate (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) anions to rigid cyanostar macrocycles and expected to be general for other rigid pairs. Use of cone angles allow predictions, with affinities agreeing to within 5&#8201;%.







Abstract
Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor&#8208;anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo&#8208;trifluoroborates (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar&#8208;anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of the anion's reactivity and how it changes upon binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &#952;. A series of 10&#8197;anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridized &#945;&#8208;carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2&#8197;hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8722;BF3&#8722; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5&#8201;%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8722;BF3&#8722; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.

     alt="Cone Angles Quantify and Predict the Affinity and Reactivity of Anion Complexes between Trifluoroborates and Rigid Macrocycles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cone angles of anions correlate with the affinity and reactivity of their complexes akin to Tolman cone angles seen in cation coordination&lt;/b&gt;. This behavior is exemplified with binding rigid organo-trifluoroborate (R&#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) anions to rigid cyanostar macrocycles and expected to be general for other rigid pairs. Use of cone angles allow predictions, with affinities agreeing to within 5&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steric manipulation is a known concept in molecular recognition but there is currently no linear free energy relationship correlating sterics to the stability of receptor-anion complexes nor to the reactivity of the bound anion. By analogy to Tolman cone angles in cation coordination chemistry, we explore how to define and correlate cone angles of organo-trifluoroborates (R&#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to the affinities observed for cyanostar-anion binding. We extend the analogy to a rare investigation of the anion's reactivity and how it changes upon binding. The substituent on the anion is used to define the cone angle, &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;. A series of 10&#8197;anions were studied including versions with ethynyl, ethylene, and ethyl substituents to tune steric bulk across the sp, sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized &#945;-carbons bearing 0, 1 and 2&#8197;hydrogen atoms. A linear relationship between affinity and cone angle is observed for anions bearing substituents larger than the &#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; headgroup. This correlation predicted affinities of two new anions to within &#177;5&#8201;%. We explored how complexation affects the reactivity of fluoride exchange. The yield of fluoride transfer from R&#8722;BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to Lewis acid triphenylborane is correlated with cone angle. We predict that other rigid macrocycles, like commercially available bambusuril, could follow these trends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ring Contraction of Saturated Cyclic Amines and Rearrangement of Acyclic Amines Through Their Corresponding Hydroxylamines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel rearrangement promoted by a B(C6F5)3&#8208;hydrosilane pair enables the regioselective ring contraction of saturated cyclic hydroxylamines as well as the skeletal reorganization of acyclic derivatives. The method overcomes the limitations of traditional uncatalyzed Stieglitz rearrangements, allowing for swift structural transformations between different types of amines. The mechanism of this rearrangement is investigated by control experiments and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Compared to modifications at the molecular periphery, skeletal adjustments present greater challenges. Within this context, skeletal rearrangement technology stands out for its significant advantages in rapidly achieving structural diversity. Yet, the development of this technology for ring contraction of saturated cyclic amines remains exceedingly rare. While most existing methods rely on specific substitution patterns to achieve ring contraction, there is a persistent demand for a more general strategy for substitution&#8208;free cyclic amines. To address this issue, we report a B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement of hydroxylamines with hydrosilanes. This methodology, when combined with the N&#8208;hydroxylation of amines, enables the regioselective ring contraction of cyclic amines and proves equally effective for rapid reorganization of acyclic amine skeletons. By this, the direct scaffold hopping of drug molecules and the strategic deletion of carbon atoms are achieved in a mild manner. Based on mechanistic experiments and density functional theory calculations, a possible mechanism for this process is proposed.

Two polymorphic copper&#8208;based hybrid halides &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy visible light emission were obtained. The centrosymmetric to noncentroysmmetic structural transformation between them is induced by the distortion of [CuI3] triangular anions and packing mode of organic cations. Especially, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits multi&#8208;properties including bright cyan emission with 100&#8201;% PLQY, phase&#8208;matchable SHG effect and outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties.







Abstract
Designing and synthesizing multifunctional hybrid copper halides with near ultraviolet (NUV) light&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emission (&lt;500&#8197;nm) remains challenging. Here, a pair of broadband&#8208;excited high&#8208;energy emitting isomers, namely, &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 (MePh3P=methyltriphenylphosphonium), were synthesized. &#945;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 with blue emission peaking at 475&#8197;nm is firstly discovered wherein its structure contains regular [CuI3]2&#8722; triangles and crystallizes in centrosymmetric space group P21/c. While &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 featuring distorted [CuI3]2&#8722; planar triangles shows inversion symmetry breaking and crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21, which exhibits cyan emission peaking at 495&#8197;nm with prominent near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and the excitation band ranging from 200 to 450&#8197;nm. Intriguingly, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable second&#8208;harmonic generation response of 0.54&#215;KDP and a suitable birefringence of 0.06@1064&#8197;nm. Furthermore, &#946;&#8208;(MePh3P)2CuI3 also can be excited by X&#8208;ray radioluminescence with a high scintillation light yield of 16193 photon/MeV and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 47.97 nGy/s, which is only 0.87&#8201;% of the standard medical diagnosis (5.5&#8197;&#956;Gy/s). This work not only promotes the development of solid&#8208;state lighting, laser frequency conversion and X&#8208;ray imaging, but also provides a reference for constructing multifunctional hybrid metal halides.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Supercapacitive Swing Adsorption of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) with 15&#8201;% CO2/5&#8201;% O2/80&#8201;% N2 gas mixture and achieve 11&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgBr2 and 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher sorption capacities with MgCl2 compared to 15&#8201;% CO2/85&#8201;% N2 gas mixture. A tradeoff between sorption capacity and energy efficiency was observed.







Abstract
We report on the supercapacitive swing adsorption (SSA) of carbon dioxide at different voltage windows in the presence of oxygen using activated carbon electrodes, and deliquescent, aqueous electrolytes. The presence of O2 in the CO2/N2 gas mixture results in an up to 11&#8197;times higher CO2 adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgBr2 (at 0.6&#8197;V) and up to 4&#8211;5&#8197;times higher adsorption capacity with 3&#8197;M MgCl2 (at 1&#8197;V). A tradeoff between high CO2 adsorption capacities and lower coulombic efficiencies was observed at voltages above 0.6&#8197;V. The energetic and adsorptive performance of the electrodes in the presence of oxygen below 0.5&#8197;V was similar to the performance with a CO2/N2 mixture without oxygen at 1&#8197;V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrodes demonstrate that the specific capacitance increases while the diffusion resistance decreases in the presence of oxygen. Oxygen concentrations ranging between 5&#8211;20&#8201;% give similar energetic and adsorptive performance. The electrodes exhibit stable performance for up to 100&#8197;cycles of operation.

         <title>Surface Carbon Formation and its Impact on Methane Dry Reforming Kinetics on Rhodium&#8208;Based Catalysts by Operando Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic measurements, combined with operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ microscopy characterization provided new insights on the carbon formation pathway over Rhodium&#8208;based catalyst materials during methane dry reforming, which allowed to relate the reaction kinetics with changes in catalyst structure under true reaction conditions.







Abstract
A mechanism for carbon deposition and its impact on the reaction kinetics of Methane Dry Reforming (MDR) using Rhodium&#8208;based catalysts is presented. By integrating Raman spectroscopy with kinetic analysis in an operando&#8208;annular chemical reactor under strict chemical conditions, we discovered that carbon deposition on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst follows a nucleation&#8208;growth mechanism. The dynamics of carbon aggregates at the surface is found to be ruled by the CO2/CH4 ratio and the inlet CH4 concentration. The findings elucidate the spatiotemporal development of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their effects on catalytic performance. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism for carbon formation shows that the influence of CO2 on MDR kinetics is an indirect result of carbon accumulation over time frames exceeding the turnover frequency, thus reconciling conflicting reports in the literature regarding CO2&#8242;s kinetic role in MDR.

&lt;p&gt;Kinetic measurements, combined with operando Raman spectroscopy and ex situ microscopy characterization provided new insights on the carbon formation pathway over Rhodium-based catalyst materials during methane dry reforming, which allowed to relate the reaction kinetics with changes in catalyst structure under true reaction conditions.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
17&#8208;nor&#8208;Cephalotane diterpenoids include two categories, Cephalotaxus troponoids and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, which possess polycyclic frameworks with seven&#8208;membered A ring bearing different oxidation states. We report herein a novel ynol&#8208;diene cyclization as a rapid access to tropone unit. Combining with a bioinspired stereoselective dual hydrogenation, the first divergent strategy to both categories of 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids has been successfully established, which enabled the total synthesis of Cephalotaxus troponoids, (+)&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyfortalpinoid F and (+)&#8208;harringtonolide, and tropone&#8208;free 17&#8208;nor&#8208;cephalotane diterpenoids, (&#8722;)&#8208;fortalpinoids M/N/P and analog (&#8722;)&#8208;20&#8208;deoxocephinoid P, in 14&#8211;17 linear longest steps starting from commercially available materials.

         <title>Photochemically Driven Peptide Formation in Supersaturated Aerosol Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of amide bonds between amino acids in supersaturated aerosol droplets is shown to be possible in the presence of dicyandiamide, a potential prebiotic compound, and intense visible light. The rate of this photochemical reaction is strongly dependent on the microdroplet radius.







Abstract
The condensation of amino acids into peptides plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and is thus essential for understanding the origins of life. However, the spontaneous formation of peptides from amino acids in bulk aqueous media is energetically unfavorable, posing a challenge for elucidating plausible abiotic mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the formation of amide bonds between amino acids within highly supersaturated aerosol droplets containing dicyandiamide (DCD), a cyanide derivative potentially present on primordial Earth. Metastable states, i.e. supersaturation, within individual micron&#8208;sized droplets are studied using both an optical trap and a linear quadrupole electrodynamic balance. When irradiated with intense visible light, amide bond formation is observed to occur and can be monitored using vibrational bands in Raman spectra. The reaction rate is found to be strongly influenced by droplet size and kinetic modelling suggests that it is driven by the photochemical product of a DCD self&#8208;reaction. Our results highlight the potential of atmospheric aerosol particles as reaction environments for peptide synthesis and have potential implications for the prebiotic chemistry of early Earth.

         <title>Spatially Confined Engineering Toward Deep Eutectic Electrolyte in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling Solid&#8208;State Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to prepare a novel solid&#8208;state Zn2+ conductor by confining deep eutectic electrolytes into the nanochannels of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is proposed. The obtained DEE@PCN&#8208;222 solid state electrolyte exhibits appreciable Zn2+ conductivity and highly reversible Zn plating/stripping ability with long&#8208;term stability. DEE@PCN&#8208;222&#8208;based solid&#8208;state ZIBs achieved favorable reversibility and effective protection of electrodes.







Abstract
Uncontrollable interfacial side reactions generated from common aqueous electrolytes, just like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and dendrite growth, have severely prevented the practical application of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Solid&#8208;state ZIBs are considered to be an efficient strategy by adopting high&#8208;quality solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Here, by confining deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) into the nanochannels of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;PCN&#8208;222, a stable DEE@PCN&#8208;222 SSE with internal Zn2+ transport channels was obtained. A distinctive ion&#8208;transport network composed of DEE and PCN&#8208;222 in the interior of DEE@PCN&#8208;222 realizes the efficient Zn2+ conduction, contributing to high ionic conductivity of 3.13&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, low activation energy of 0.12&#8197;eV, and a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.74. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that DEE@PCN&#8208;222 with its unique channel structure could homogeneously regulate the Zn2+ distribution and effectively alleviate the side reactions. Highly reversible Zn plating/stripping performance of 2476&#8197;h can be realized by the SSE. The solid&#8208;state ZIBs show a specific capacity of 306&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and display cycling stability of 517&#8197;cycles. This unique design concept provides a new perspective in realizing the high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;performance ZIBs.

         <title>Electrophilic C(sp2)&#8722;H Cyanation with Inorganic Cyanate (OCN&#8722;) by PIII/PV=O&#8208;Catalyzed Phase Transfer Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
An organophosphorus&#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles using inorganic sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.







Abstract
An organophosphorus &#8208;catalyzed method for the direct electrophilic cyanation of C(sp2)&#8722;H nucleophiles with sodium cyanate (NaOCN) is reported. The catalytic deoxyfunctionalization of the OCN&#8722; anion is enabled by the use of a small&#8208;ring phosphacyclic (phosphetane) catalyst in combination with a terminal hydrosilane O&#8208;atom acceptor and a malonate&#8208;derived bromenium donor. In situ spectroscopy under single&#8208;turnover conditions demonstrate that insoluble inorganic cyanate anion is activated by bromide displacement on a bromophosphonium catalytic intermediate to give a reactive N&#8208;bound isocyanatophosphonium ion, which delivers electrophilic &#8220;CN+&#8221; equivalents to nucleophilic (hetero)arenes and alkenes with loss of a phosphine oxide. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deoxyfunctionalization of insoluble inorganic salts by PIII/PV=O catalyzed phase transfer activation.

         <title>Highly Efficient Low&#8208;loaded PdOx/AlSiOx Catalyst for Ethylene Dimerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Pd(II) sites anchored by vicinal hydroxyls of Al2O3&#8722;SiO2 support possess unexpectedly high activity for ethylene dimerization. The fundamentals of catalyst performance were elucidated by combining catalytic experiments, in situ catalyst characterization, and DFT calculations. The developed catalyst was successfully applied for direct synthesis of propylene from ethylene by rational integration of dimerization and metathesis reactions.







Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is an industrial process that is currently carried out using homogeneous catalysts. Here we present a highly active heterogeneous catalyst containing minute amounts of atomically dispersed Pd. It requires no co&#8208;catalyst(s) or activator(s) and significantly outperforms previously reported catalysts tested under similar reaction conditions. The selectivity to C4&#8208; and C6&#8208;hydrocarbons was about 80&#8201;% and 10&#8201;% at 42&#8201;% ethylene conversion at 200&#8201;&#176;C using an industrially relevant feed containing 50&#8197;vol&#8201;% ethylene, respectively. Our kinetic and catalyst characterization experiments complemented by density functional theory calculations provide molecular insights into the local environment of isolated Pd(II)Ox species and their role in achieving high activity in the target reaction. When the developed catalyst was rationally integrated with a Mo&#8208;containing olefin metathesis catalyst in the same reactor, the formed butenes reacted with ethylene to propylene with a selectivity of 98&#8201;% at about 24&#8201;% ethylene conversion.

         <title>A Tetracarbene Iron(II) Complex with a Long&#8208;lived Triplet Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer State due to a Triplet&#8208;Triplet Barrier</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3MLCT&#8594;3MC barrier determines the excited state lifetime of iron(II) photosensitizers. In the specifically designed tetracarbene iron(II) complex with cis&#8208;coordinated pyridines, a single Fe&#8722;N bond elongates in the excited triplet states. Variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy delivered the barrier and the electronic coupling between 3MLCT and 3MC states providing novel design criteria for iron(II) sensitizers.







Abstract
Mixed N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) / pyridyl iron(II) complexes have attracted a great deal of attention recently because of their potential as photocatalysts and light sensitizers made from Earth&#8208;abundant elements. The most decisive challenge for their successful implementation is the lifetime of the lowest triplet metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer state (3MLCT), which typically decays via a triplet metal&#8208;centered (3MC) state back to the ground state. We reveal by variable&#8208;temperature ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy that the tripodal iron(II) bis(pyridine) complex isomers trans&#8208; and cis&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ with four NHC donors show 3MLCT&#8594;3MC population transfers with very different barriers and rationalize this by computational means. While trans&#8208;[Fe(pdmi)2]2+ possesses an unobservable activation barrier, the cis isomer exhibits a barrier of 492&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which leads to a nanosecond 3MLCT lifetime at 77&#8197;K. The kinetic and quantum chemical data were analyzed in the context of semi&#8208;classical Marcus theory revealing a high reorganization energy and small electronic coupling between the two triplet states. This highlights the importance of detailed structural control and kinetic knowledge for the rational design of photosensitizers from first row transition metals such as iron.

         <title>A Planar&#8208;Structured Dinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex with Indirect Synergy for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar&#8208;structured dinuclear cobalt(II) complex exhibits an indirect synergistic catalysis effect between two Co(II) sites for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, with TON and TOF values of 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, which is 8.6&#8208;fold improvement than that of the corresponding mononuclear counterpart.







Abstract
Dinuclear metal synergistic catalysis (DMSC) has been proved an effective approach to enhance catalytic efficiency in photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, while it remains challenge to design dinuclear metal complexes that can show DMSC effect. The main reason is that the influence of the microenvironment around dinuclear metal centres on catalytic activity has not been well recognized and revealed. Herein, we report a dinuclear cobalt complex featuring a planar structure, which displays outstanding catalytic efficiency for photochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values reach as high as 14457 and 0.40&#8197;s&#8722;1 respectively, 8.6&#8197;times higher than those of the corresponding mononuclear cobalt complex. Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of the dinuclear cobalt complex is due to the indirect DMSC effect between two CoII ions, energetically feasible one step two&#8208;electron transfer process by Co2I,I intermediate to afford Co2II,II(CO22&#8722;) intermediate and fast mass transfer closely related with the planar structure.

         <title>Highly Stable Carboranyl Ligated Gold Nano&#8208;Catalysts for Regioselective Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboranes are disclosed to generate highly stable CB@AuNPs of core&#8208;satellite structures. They are capable of suppressing active species dissolution under harsh conditions and have realized regioselective bromination of unbiased arenes with p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities comparable if not superior to those in the best selective non&#8208;enzyme catalytic systems.







Abstract
Achieving electronic/steric control and realizing selectivity regulation in nanocatalysis remains a formidable challenge, as the dynamic nature of metal&#8208;ligand interfaces, including dissolution (metal leaching) and structural reconstruction, poses significant obstacles. Herein, we disclose carboranyls (CBs) as unprecedented carbon&#8208;bonded functional ligands (Eads.CB&#8208;Au(111)=&#8722;2.90&#8197;eV) for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), showcasing their exceptional stabilization capability that is attributed by strong Au&#8722;C bonds combined with B&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The synthesized CB@AuNPs exhibit core(Aun)&#8208;satellite(CB2Au&#8722;) structure, showing high stability towards multiple stimuli (110&#8201;&#176;C, pH=1&#8211;12, thiol etchants). In addition, different from conventional AuNP catalysts such as triphenylphosphine (PPh3) stabilized AuNPs, dissolution of catalytically active gold species was suppressed in CB@AuNPs under the reaction conditions. Leveraging these distinct features, CB@AuNPs realized outstanding p&#8201;:&#8201;o selectivities in aromatic bromination. Unbiased arenes including chlorobenzene (up to &gt;30&#8201;:&#8201;1), bromobenzene (15&#8201;:&#8201;1) and phenyl acrylate were examined using CB@AuNPs as catalysts to afford highly&#8208;selective p&#8208;products. Both carboranyl ligands and carboranyl derived counterions are crucial for such regioselective transformation. This work has provided valuable insights for AuNPs in realizing diverse regioselective transformations.

         <title>Overcoming Challenges in O&#8208;Nitration: Selective Alcohol Nitration Deploying N,6&#8208;Dinitrosaccharin and Lewis Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel catalytic approach for the mild and selective synthesis of nitrate esters by direct O&#8208;nitration of alcohols and diols. Using stable N,6&#8208;dinitrosaccharin and magnesium triflate, this method tolerates a broad diversity of functional groups and is amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization. DFT studies reveal a dual role of magnesium catalyst. This innovative method advances the synthesis of versatile nitrates for drug discovery.







Abstract
Nitrate esters hold pivotal roles in pharmaceuticals, energetic materials, and atmospheric processes, motivating the development of efficient synthesis routes. Here, we present a novel catalytic method for the synthesis of nitrates via the direct O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, addressing limitations of current traditional methods. Leveraging bench&#8208;stable and recoverable N,6&#8208;dinitrosaccharin reagent, our catalytic strategy employs magnesium triflate to achieve mild and selective O&#8208;nitration of alcohols, offering broad substrate scope and unprecedentedly large functional group tolerance (e.g. alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls). DFT mechanistic studies reveal a dual role of the magnesium catalyst in the activation of both the nitrating reagent and the alcohol substrate. They also unveil a barrierless proton transfer upon formation of a widely&#8208;accepted &#8211; yet elusive in solution &#8211; nitrooxonium ion intermediate. Overall, our work contributes to the development of mild, selective, and sustainable approaches to nitrates synthesis, with potential applications in drug discovery, materials science, and environmental chemistry.

         <dc:description>
The novel designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst has been presented for the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. The new bifunctional catalyst, which combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator, significantly enhances efficiencies and stereoselectivities compared to conventional catalysts. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes.







Abstract
Herein, we describe an innovative approach to the asymmetric electrochemical &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes facilitated by a newly designed bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst. The highly efficient bifunctional chiral electrocatalyst combines a chiral aminocatalyst with a redox mediator. It plays a dual role as a redox mediator for electrooxidation, while simultaneously providing remarkable asymmetric induction for the stereoselective &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes. Additionally, this novel catalyst exhibits enhanced catalytic activity and excellent stereoselective control comparable to conventional catalytic systems. As a result, this strategy provides a new avenue for versatile asymmetric electrochemistry. The electrooxidation of diverse phenols enables the C&#8722;H/C&#8722;H oxidative &#945;&#8208;alkylation of aldehydes in a highly chemo&#8208; and stereoselective fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies by control experiments and cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrate possible reaction pathways and the origin of enantio&#8208;induction.

         <title>Deciphering the Factors Controlling Hydrogen and Methyl Spillover upon Methane Dissociation on Rh/Cu(111) Single&#8208;Atom Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under real&#8208;world conditions, the frequent collisions of gaseous CH4 molecules on Rh/Cu(111) single&#8208;atom alloy are a key to promote adsorbate spillover, especially for bulky polyatomic CH3* species, providing insights into the effective use of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Spillover of adsorbed species from one active site to another is a key step in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the factors controlling this step, particularly the spillover of polyatomic species, have rarely been studied. Herein, we investigate the spillover dynamics of H* and CH3* species on a single&#8208;atom alloy surface (Rh/Cu(111)) upon the dissociative chemisorption of methane (CH4), using molecular dynamics that considers both surface phonons and electron&#8208;hole pairs. These dynamical calculations are made possible by a high&#8208;dimensional potential energy surface machine learned from density functional theory data. Our results provide compelling evidence that the H* and CH3* can spill over on the metal surface at experimental temperatures and reveal novel dynamical features involving an internal motion during diffusion for CH3*. Increasing surface temperature has a minor effect on promoting spillover, as geminate recombinative desorption becomes more prevalent. However, the poisoning of the active site can be mitigated by the frequent gaseous molecular collisions that occur under ambient pressure in real&#8208;world catalysis, which transfer energy to the trapped adsorbates. Interestingly, the bulky CH3* exhibits a significant spillover advantage over the light H* due to its larger size, which facilitates energy acquisition. These insights help to advance our understanding of spillover in heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Gaseous Ammonia: Stepping Over the Nitrogen Energy Canyon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia is a promising hydrogen carrier compound. The ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR) was investigated by direct utilization of gaseous NH3 at gas diffusion electrodes. The most selective catalyst composition of the different multi&#8208;metal catalysts was able to oxidize NH3 mainly to NO2&#8722; avoiding to a large extent the formation of energetically favorable N2 as well as O2, while H2 was exclusively formed at the cathode.







Abstract
As ammonia continues to gain more and more interest as a promising hydrogen carrier compound, so does the electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AmOR). To avoid the liberation of H2 in a reverse Haber&#8211;Bosch reaction under release of the energetically more favorable N2, we propose the oxidation of ammonia to value&#8208;added nitrite (NO2&#8722;), which is usually obtained during the Ostwald process. We investigated the anodic oxidation of gaseous ammonia directly supplied to a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) using a variety of compositionally different multi&#8208;metal catalysts coated on Ni foam under the simultaneous formation of H2 at the cathode. This will double the amount of H2 per ammonia molecule while applying a lower overpotential than that required for water electrolysis (1.4&#8211;1.8&#8197;V vs. RHE at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2). A selectivity study demonstrated that some of the catalyst compositions were able to produce significant amounts of NO2&#8722;, and further investigations using the most promising catalyst composition Nif_AlCoCrCuFe integrated within a GDE demonstrated up to 88&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for NO2&#8722; at the anode coupled to close to 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency for the cathodic H2 production.

         <title>Exploiting trans&#8208;Sulfinylation for the Synthesis of Diverse N&#8208;Alkyl Sulfinamides via Decarboxylative Sulfinamidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trans&#8208;sulfinylation enables the generation of hydrolytically&#8208;sensitive alkyl sulfinylamines in situ from Tr&#8208;NSO and primary amines. We exploit this process alongside alkyl radical generation from carboxylic acids using acridine photocatalysis to prepare a broad selection of N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides from structurally diverse and readily available feedstocks.







Abstract
Combining simple amines with the bench&#8208;stable sulfinylamine Tr&#8208;NSO allows in situ preparation of reactive alkyl sulfinylamines, which when combined with alkyl radicals generated by photocatalytic decarboxylation, provides N&#8208;alkyl sulfinamides. The reactions are broad in scope and tolerate a wide variety of functional groups on both the acid and amine components. The sulfinamide products are used to prepare a selection of challenging S(VI) products. The method provides a convenient way to use reactive and unstable alkyl sulfinylamines.

Ultrafast coherent multidimensional spectroscopy probes photoinduced dynamics in a covalent perylene diimide (PDI) dimer exhibiting solvent&#8208;controlled on/off excitonic coupling. Excitonic coupling leads to ultrafast excimer formation. The coupling dependent population and vibrationally coherent dynamics in the two cases are measured and discussed in the context of controlling PDI dimer photophysics.







Abstract
Perylene diimide (PDI) dimers and higher aggregates are key components in organic molecular photonics and photovoltaic devices, supporting singlet fission and symmetry breaking charge separation. Detailed understanding of their excited states is thus important. This has proven challenging because interchromophoric coupling is a strong function of dimer architecture. Recently, a macrocyclic PDI dimer was reported in which excitonic coupling could be turned on and off simply by changing the solvent. This presents a useful case where coupling is modified without synthetic changes to tune supramolecular structure. Here we present a detailed study of solvent dependent excited state dynamics in this dimer by means of coherent multidimensional spectroscopy. Spectral analysis resolves the different coupling strengths, which are consistent with solvent dependent changes in dimer conformation. The strongly coupled conformer forms an excimer within 300&#8197;fs. The low&#8208;frequency Raman active modes recovered from two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectra reveal frequencies characteristic of exciton coupling. These are assigned to modes modulating the coupling from the corresponding DFT calculations. Further analysis reveals a time dependent frequency during excimer formation. Analysis of two&#8208;dimensional &#8220;beatmaps&#8221; reveals features in the coupled dimer which are not predicted by the displaced harmonic oscillator model and are assigned to vibronic coupling.

         <title>Allenamides as a Powerful Tool to Incorporate Diversity: Thia&#8208;Michael Lipidation of Semisynthetic Peptides and Access to &#946;&#8208;Keto Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenamides are demonstrated as a peptide modification tool that enables late&#8208;stage access to chemically diverse bioactive lipopeptides prepared by semisynthesis and to &#946;&#8208;keto amide&#8208;functionalised peptides, which serve as versatile building blocks for further derivatisation.







Abstract
Lipopeptides are an important class of biomolecules for drug development. Compared with conventional acylation, a chemoselective lipidation strategy offers a more efficient strategy for late&#8208;stage structural derivatisation of a peptide scaffold. It provides access to chemically diverse compounds possessing intriguing and non&#8208;native moieties. Utilising an allenamide, we report the first semisynthesis of antimicrobial lipopeptides leveraging a highly efficient thia&#8208;Michael addition of chemically diverse lipophilic thiols. Using chemoenzymatically prepared polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) as a model scaffold, an optimised allenamide&#8208;mediated thia&#8208;Michael addition effected rapid and near quantitative lipidation, affording vinyl sulfide&#8208;linked lipopeptide derivatives. Harnessing the utility of this new methodology, 22&#8197;lipophilic thiols of unprecedented chemical diversity were introduced to the PMBN framework. These included alkyl thiols, substituted aromatic thiols, heterocyclic thiols and those bearing additional functional groups (e.g., amines), ultimately yielding analogues with potent Gram&#8208;negative antimicrobial activity and substantially attenuated nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, we report facile routes to transform the allenamide into a &#946;&#8208;keto amide on unprotected peptides, offering a powerful &#8220;jack&#8208;of&#8208;all&#8208;trades&#8221; synthetic intermediate to enable further peptide modification.

         <title>Intramolecular Electrostatic Interactions Regulate Reactivity of Zwitterionic Functionalities in Amphiphilic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular electrostatic stabilization in zwitterionic moieties plays a critical role in their reactive stability. The stabilization potential is demonstrated to have a unique spatial orientation dependence in zwitterionic head groups of surfactants and lipids. This feature has been used to generate triggerable supramolecular assembly formation and their disassembly.







Abstract
The consequences of intramolecular ionic interactions in determining the reactivity of functional groups are of interest because they provide insights into how nature deploys seemingly reactive functionalities to be rather ubiquitous. Of specific interest are the quaternary ammonium ions in lipids. In this work, we investigate the effect of intramolecular electrostatic interactions in zwitterionic functionalities by judiciously incorporating them as leaving groups at the &#945;&#8208;position of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ester&#8208;based lipid head groups. We find that electrostatic stabilization indeed plays a critical role in both the reaction kinetics with nucleophiles and the thermodynamics of lipid formation. We further leverage these findings to fabricate both triggerable assembly and disassembly of liposomal supramolecular assemblies in the presence of nucleophiles.

         <title>Photocatalytic Formamide Synthesis via Coupling of Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Radicals over Atomically Dispersed Bi Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient formamide synthesis from ammonia and methanol was achieved through photocatalysis on Bi single atoms (BiSAs) loaded TiO2. The key C&#8722;N coupling interactions were demonstrated to be the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between the electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH radical and nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical by combining in situ characterizations, isotopic labeling and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Formamide (HCONH2) plays a pivotal role in the manufacture of a diverse array of chemicals, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Photocatalysis holds great promise for green fabrication of carbon&#8208;nitrogen (C&#8722;N) compounds owing to its environmental friendliness and mild redox capability. However, the selective formation of the C&#8722;N bond presents a significant challenge in the photocatalytic synthesis of C&#8722;N compounds. This work developed a photocatalytic radical coupling method for the formamide synthesis from co&#8208;oxidation of ammonia (NH3) and methanol (CH3OH). An exceptional formamide yield rate of 5.47&#177;0.03&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 (911.87&#177;5&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gBi&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1) was achieved over atomically dispersed Bi sites (BiSAs) on TiO2. An accumulation of 45.68&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 (2.0&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;gcat&#8722;1) of formamide was achieved after long&#8208;term illumination, representing the highest level of photocatalytic C&#8722;N compounds synthesis. The critical C&#8722;N coupling for formamide formation originated from the &#8220;&#963;&#8211;&#963;&#8221; interaction between electrophilic &#8901;CH2OH with nucleophilic &#8901;NH2 radical. The BiSAs sites facilitated the electron transfer between reactants and photocatalysts and enhanced the nucleophilic attack of &#8901;NH2 radical on the &#8901;CH2OH radical, thereby advancing the selective C&#8722;N bond formation. This work deepens the understanding of the C&#8722;N coupling mechanism and offers an intriguing photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of C&#8722;N compounds.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Dissociation&#8208;Reconstruction Synthesis of Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Continuity for Efficient CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstruction of COFs into separation membranes: A 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is designed and dissociated into high&#8208;yield and high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Reconstruction of COF nanosheets gives an ordered and defect&#8208;free membrane. The synthesized membrane exhibits superior CO2/N2 separation performance of high selectivity and large permeance owing to optimized microstructures.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), at the forefront of porous materials, hold tremendous potential in membrane separation; however, achieving high continuity in COF membranes remains crucial for efficient gas separation. Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly&#8208;dissociation&#8208;reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO2/N2 separation. A parent COF is designed from two&#8208;node aldehyde and three&#8208;node amine monomers and dissociated to high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack&#8208;free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO2 adsorption over N2, resulting in CO2 permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO2/N2 selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas&#8208;separation membranes.

Here, we present a unique approach termed assembly-dissociation-reconstruction for fabricating COF membranes tailored for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. A parent COF is designed from two-node aldehyde and three-node amine monomers and dissociated to high-aspect-ratio nanosheets. Subsequently, COF nanosheets are orderly reconstructed into a crack-free membrane by surface reaction under water evaporation. The membrane exhibits high crystallinity, open pores and a strong affinity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption over N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance exceeding 1060 GPU and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity surpassing 30.6. The efficacy of this strategy offers valuable guidance for the precise fabrication of gas-separation membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Transition Metal Coordinated Polymers for Active and Stable Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy is developed for firmly growing a variety of transition metal&#8208;coordinated polymer catalysts on diverse substrates. An exemplified NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) with Ni/Fe&#8722;N4 coordination structure transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution, which exhibits remarkable activity and stability in alkaline seawater due to the electronic structure modulation, metal anchoring effect and strong substrate adhesion.







Abstract
Transition metal coordination polymers (TM&#8208;CP) are promising inexpensive and flexible electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction in water electrolysis, while their facile synthesis and controllable regulation remain challenging. Here we report an anodic oxidation&#8208;electrodeposition strategy for the growth of TM&#8208;CP (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, Mn; CP=polyaniline, polypyrrole) films on a variety of metal substrates that act as both catalyst supports and metal ion sources. An exemplified bimetallic NiFe&#8208;polypyrrole (NiFe&#8208;PPy) features superior mechanical stability in friction and exhibits high activity with long&#8208;term durability in alkaline seawater (over 2000&#8197;h) and anion exchange membrane electrolyzer devices at current density of 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Spectroscopic and microscopic analysis unravels the configurations with atomically distributed metal sites induced by d&#8208;&#960; conjugation, which transforms into a mosaic structure with NiFe (oxy)hydroxides embedded in PPy matrix during oxygen evolution. The superior catalytic performance is ascribed to the anchoring effect of PPy that inhibits metal dissolution, the strong substrate&#8208;to&#8208;catalyst interaction that ensures good adhesion, and the Fe/Ni&#8722;N coordination that modulates the electronic structures to facilitate the deprotonation of *OOH intermediate. This work provides a general strategy and mechanistic insight into building robust inorganic/polymer composite electrodes for oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Transformation of Sugars via a Heterogenous Gallium(III) Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous gallium(III) catalyst drives the sugar transformation reaction by visible light with turnover numbers (TONs) as high as 1500, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) catalyst.







Abstract
Extremely limited research exploring the photocatalytic potential of main group metals, such as aluminum, gallium, and tin, has been undertaken due to their weak light harvesting properties. This study reports the efficient transformation of sugars to 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) with high yield employing an original heterogeneous photocatalyst comprising a gallium(III) complex immobilized on an alumina support. Under visible light irradiation, the reaction rate of HMF formation is ~143&#8197;times higher than the equivalent thermal reaction performed in the absence of light. The turnover number (TON) of the heterogeneous gallium(III) photocatalyst was as high as 1500, which was ca. two orders of magnitude higher than the TON of the homogeneous gallium(III) system. It is proposed that photoirradiation significantly enhances the Lewis acidity of the catalyst by forming a semi&#8208;coordination state between gallium(III) and N&#8208;donor ligands, enabling the increased interaction of reactant sugar molecules with gallium(III) active sites. Consistent with this, the photoresponsive coordination of the gallium(III) complex and the abstraction of the hydroxy group by the metal under irradiation with visible light is observed by NMR spectroscopy for the first time. These findings demonstrate that efficient photocatalysts derived from the main group elements can facilitate biomass conversion using visible light.

         <title>Hexa&#8208;atom Pt Catalyst Fabricated by a Ligand Engineering Strategy for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an atomically precise supported Pt6 nanocluster catalyst (Pt6/OCNT) was designed by the ligand engineering strategy. The well&#8208;defined Pt6/OCNT, with fully exposed Pt sites and unique electronic structures, showed superior acidic hydrogen oxidation performance with the highest mass activity compared to those of the corresponding Pt SAC (Pt1/OCNT) and Pt/C.







Abstract
Atomically precise supported nanocluster catalysts (APSNCs), which feature exact atomic composition, well&#8208;defined structures, and unique catalytic properties, offer an exceptional platform for understanding the structure&#8208;performance relationship at the atomic level. However, fabricating APSNCs with precisely controlled and uniform metal atom numbers, as well as maintaining a stable structure, remains a significant challenge due to uncontrollable dispersion and easy aggregation during synthetic and catalytic processes. Herein, we developed an effective ligand engineering strategy to construct a Pt6 nanocluster catalyst stabilized on oxidized carbon nanotubes (Pt6/OCNT). The structural analysis revealed that Pt6 nanoclusters in Pt6/OCNT were fully exposed and exhibited a planar structure. Furthermore, the obtained Pt6/OCNT exhibited outstanding acidic HOR performances with a high mass activity of 18.37&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mgpt&#8722;1 along with excellent stability during a 24&#8197;h constant operation and good CO tolerance, surpassing those of the commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the unique geometric and electronic structures of Pt6 nanoclusters on OCNT altered the hydrogen adsorption energies on catalytic sites and thus lowered the HOR theoretical overpotential. This work presents a new prospect for designing and synthesizing advanced APSNCs for efficient energy electrocatalysis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular chemistry of metalate anions is relatively unexplored and far less understood compared with simple anions. This review discusses the latest advances in supramolecular metalate chemistry, highlighting its important role across a diverse range of applications including medical imaging, environmental remediation, perovskite materials, magnetism, catalysis, and metal separations.







Abstract
While the supramolecular chemistry of simple anions is ubiquitous, the targeting and exploitation of their metal&#8208;containing relatives, the metalates, is less well understood. This mini review highlights the latest advances in this emergent area by discussing the supramolecular chemistry of metalates thematically, with a focus on the exploitation of metalates in a diversity of applications, including medical imaging and therapy, environmental remediation, molecular magnetism, catalysis, perovskite materials, and metal separations. The unifying features of these systems are identified with a view to allow the supramolecular chemist to target the unique material properties of the metalates, even in areas that are currently relatively immature.

         <title>Large Scale Synthesis of a Stable Prefunctionalized Silver Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable silver nanocluster [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOC6H4C&#8801;C)6]SbF6 can be facilely synthesized in gram scale in ~90&#8201;% yield. The aldehyde groups preorganized in this cluster are available for further functionalization. Chiral modification through aldimine condensation gives homochiral clusters. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
Due to the stability issue, It is difficult to prepare a silver nanocluster bearing functional sites, especially at a large scale. We report the synthesis and structure of a stable silver nanocluster bearing multiple surface aldehyde groups [Ag21(Ph2PO2)10(p&#8208;CHOPhC&#8801;C)6]SbF6, which allows for postsynthesis modification such as surface functionalization through aldimine condensation to give homochiral clusters. Remarkably, the preparation of this cluster can be done in ~90&#8201;% high yield at gram scale, which facilitates further studies and potential applications. Through DFT calculations and geometric structure analysis, the high stability of this cluster is attributed to the geometric closure and electronic structure. This is the first time that an effective one&#8208;pot method has been developed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters in high yield. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster&#8208;based materials.

The aldehyde groups preorganized in this cluster are available for further functionalization. Chiral modification through aldimine condensation gives homochiral clusters. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster-based materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the stability issue, It is difficult to prepare a silver nanocluster bearing functional sites, especially at a large scale. We report the synthesis and structure of a stable silver nanocluster bearing multiple surface aldehyde groups [Ag&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;(Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CHOPhC&#8801;C)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which allows for postsynthesis modification such as surface functionalization through aldimine condensation to give homochiral clusters. Remarkably, the preparation of this cluster can be done in ~90&#8201;% high yield at gram scale, which facilitates further studies and potential applications. Through DFT calculations and geometric structure analysis, the high stability of this cluster is attributed to the geometric closure and electronic structure. This is the first time that an effective one-pot method has been developed to synthesize functional silver nanoclusters in high yield. The title cluster will be useful in the development of a variety of cluster-based materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
