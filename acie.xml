         <title>Atomic cation&#8208;vacancy engineering of NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides for improved activity and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) are among the most active catalysts developed to date for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, though their long&#8208;term OER stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we reveal that the stability degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER results from a decreased number of active sites and undesirable phase segregation to form NiOOH and FeOOH, with metal dissolution underpinning both of these deactivation mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of cation&#8208;vacancies in the basal plane of NiFe LDH is an effective approach for achieving both high catalyst activity and stability during OER. The strengthened binding energy between the metals and oxygen in the LDH sheets, together with reduced lattice distortions, both realized by the rational introduction of cation vacancies, drastically mitigate metal dissolution from NiFe&#8208;LDH under high oxidation potentials, resulting in the improved long&#8208;term OER stability. In addition, the cation vacancies (especially M  3+  vacancies) accelerate the evolution of surface  &#947;  &#8208;(NiFe)OOH phases, thereby boosting the OER activity. The present study highlights that tailoring atomic cation&#8208;vacancies is an important strategy for the development of active and stable NiFe&#8208;LDH OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Dissociation of a Dialumene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dialumenes are neutral Al(I) compounds with Al=Al multiple bonds. We report the isolation of an amidophosphine&#8208;supported dialumene. Our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, spectroscopic, and DFT computational analyses reveal a long and extreme trans&#8208;bent Al=Al bond with low dissociation energy and bond&#8208;order. In solution, the dialumene can dissociate into monomeric Al(I) species. Reactivity studies reveal two modes of reaction: as dialumene or as aluminyl monomers.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;bridged Methylnaphthyl Palladium Dimers as Versatile&#160;Catalyst Precursors in Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen&#8208;bridged methylnaphthyl (MeNAP) palladium dimers are presented as multipurpose Pd&#8208;precursors, ideally suited for catalytic method development and preparative organic synthesis. By simply mixing with phosphine or carbene ligands, they are  in situ  converted into well&#8208;defined monoligated complexes. Their catalytic performance was benchmarked against state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems in challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig, Heck, Suzuki and Negishi couplings, and ketone arylations. Their use enabled record&#8208;setting activities, beyond those achievable by optimization of the ligand alone. The MeNAP catalysts permit syntheses of tetra&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;substituted arenes and bulky anilines in near&#8208;quantitative yields at room temperature, allow mono&#8208;arylations of small ketones, and enable so far elusive cross&#8208;couplings of secondary alkyl boronic acids with aryl chlorides.</dc:description>

         <title>New Route to Battery Grade NaPF6 for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries: Expanding the Accessible Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems. However, the rapid growth of sodium&#8208;ion battery technology requires a sustainable and scalable synthetic route to high&#8208;grade sodium hexafluorophosphate. This work demonstrates a new multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of NaPF  6  in which the reaction of ammonium hexafluorophosphate with sodium metal in THF solvent generates the electrolyte salt with the absence of the impurities that are common in commercial material. The high purity of the electrolyte (absence of insoluble NaF) allows for concentrations up to 3 M to be obtained accurately in binary carbonate battery solvent. Electrochemical characterization shows that the degradation dynamics of sodium metal&#8211;electrolyte interface are different for more concentrated (&gt;2 M) electrolytes, suggesting that the higher concentration regime (above the conventional 1 M concentration) may be beneficial to battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Sialyl N&#8208;Glycans and Analysis of Their Recognition by Neuraminidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of four fully sialylated tetraantennary  N  &#8208;glycans has been achieved for the first time by using the diacetyl strategy, in which NHAc is tentatively protected as NAc2  to improve the reactivity by preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Another key was the glycosylations to the branched mannose in ether, which promoted the desired glycosylation by stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Furthermore, high &#945;&#8208;selectivity of these glycosylations was realized by utilizing remote participation. Two asymmetrically deuterium&#8208;labeled sialyl  N  &#8208;glycans was also synthesized by the same strategy. The synthesized  N  &#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition. The asymmetrically deuterated  N&#8208;  glycan revealed the difference in recognition of sialic acid on each branch. Meanwhile, the tetraantennary  N  &#8208;glycan was used to evaluate the effect of multivalency and steric hinderance by forming branching structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemistry&#8208;Guided Prediction of the Absolute Configuration of Fungal Reduced Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We performed a focused analysis of functionally related polyketide synthases (PKSs) which produce linear polyketides (PKs) such as prophialotide and other polyhydroxy PKs. The relative and absolute configurations were determined by degradation studies. Based on the results, we propose a stereochemical rule during the chain&#8208;elongation process of the reduced PKs.







Abstract
Highly reducing polyketide synthases (HR&#8208;PKSs) produce structurally diverse polyketides (PKs). The PK diversity is constructed by a variety of factors, including the &#946;&#8208;keto processing, chain length, methylation pattern, and relative and absolute configurations of the substituents. We examined the stereochemical course of the PK processing for the synthesis of polyhydroxy PKs such as phialotides, phomenoic acid, and ACR&#8208;toxin. Heterologous expression of a HR&#8208;PKS gene, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase gene, and a truncated non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase gene resulted in the formation of a linear PK with multiple stereogenic centers. The absolute configurations of the stereogenic centers were determined by chemical degradation followed by comparison of the degradation products with synthetic standards. A stereochemical rule was proposed to explain the absolute configurations of other reduced PKs and highlights an error in the absolute configurations of a reported structure. The present work demonstrates that focused functional analysis of functionally related HR&#8208;PKSs leads to a better understanding of the stereochemical course.

         <title>Effect of Surfactants on the Molecular Structure of the Buried Oil/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The increased ordering of oil molecules' aliphatic chains and the enhanced alignment of water molecules at the oil/water interface was revealed upon increasing adsorption of anionic surfactant using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. The surfactant coverage inducing the highest&#8208;ordered oil molecule configuration at the interface matches a significant reduction of interfacial tension and high emulsion stability.







Abstract
The oil/water interface, for instance in emulsions, is often stabilized by surfactants. Hence, the co&#8208;existence of oil, water, and surfactant molecules at the buried oil/water interface determines macroscopic properties such as surface tension or emulsion stability. Utilizing an inherently surface sensitive spectroscopic method, sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we show that adsorption of an anionic surfactant to the buried oil/water interface increases the magnitude of the interfacial electric field. Meanwhile, the degree of ordering of the interfacial oil molecules increases with the surfactant concentration owing to the intercalation of aliphatic chains of interfacial oil and surfactant molecules. At sufficiently high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial charge reaches a maximum value and the interfacial oil molecules arrange in a fully ordered conformation, a state which coincides with the significant decrease in interfacial tension and increased emulsion stability.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Nitrene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Oxaziridination/1,2&#8208;Alkyl Rearrangement of 1,3&#8208;Diketones toward Bicyclic Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations have been limited to the aziridination of C=C double bonds. In this study, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed oxaziridination of C=O double bonds and achieved a tandem asymmetric oxaziridination/rearrangement reaction of cyclic diketones, affording a series of bicyclic lactams bearing a quaternary carbon center.







Abstract
Although copper&#8208;nitrene has been extensively studied as a versatile active species in various transformations, asymmetric reactions involving copper&#8208;nitrene have been limited to the aziridination of olefins. Herein, we report the novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric oxaziridination reaction of cyclic diketones with alkyl azides and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting highly active intermediate, which produces a synthetically challenging chiral bicyclic lactam containing a quaternary carbon center. This procedure not only enriches the copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions, but also provides an alternative strategy to address the inherent challenges of catalytic asymmetric Schmidt reactions. This unique reaction could inspire the investigation of novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations and their reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Small Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of a bioconjugate is reported. The formation of ring&#8208;like structures was independent of different silica particle types and the amount of peptide conjugated to the material. This novel approach paves the way for further production of functional materials for separation, catalysis, and medical applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly processes guide disordered molecules or particles into long&#8208;range organized structures due to specific supramolecular interactions among the building entities. Herein, we report a unique evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) strategy for four different silica nanoparticle systems obtained through peptide functionalization of the particle surface. First, covalent peptide&#8208;silica coupling was investigated in detail, starting with the grafting of a single amino acid (L&#8208;serine) and expanded to specific small peptides (up to four amino acids) and transferred to different particle types (MCM&#8208;48&#8208;type MSNs, solid nanoparticles, and newly developed virus&#8208;like nanoparticles). These materials were investigated regarding their ability to undergo EISA, which was shown to be independent of particle type and amount of peptide anchored to their surface. This EISA&#8208;based approach provides new possibilities for the design of future advanced drug delivery systems, engineered hierarchical sorbents, and nanocatalyst assemblies.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Nonenzymatic Template&#8208;Directed RNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine X&#8208;ray crystallography and kinetic measurements of modified nucleic acid constructs to determine the requirements for efficient template copying. The 3E conformation of the furanose rings is preferred in the formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Our findings may explain why RNA is a privileged substrate amongst other plausible candidates.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a 3E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.

         <title>Platinum Modulates Redox Properties and 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Adsorption Kinetics of Ni(OH)2 for Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt is proven to be an effective accelerator to Ni(OH)2 for catalyzing HMF oxidation reaction. Pt optimizes the surface electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 and accelerates the formation of the active Ni(OH)O species. Besides, it optimizes the adsorption mode of HMF and reduces the adsorption energy.







Abstract
Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)2 is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)2 electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)2 electrode. Operando methods reveal that the introduction of Pt optimized the redox property of Ni(OH)2 and accelerate the formation of Ni(OH)O during the catalytic process. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the enhanced Ni(OH)O formation kinetics originates from the reduced dehydrogenation energy of Ni(OH)2. The product analysis and transition state simulation prove that the Pt also reduces adsorption energy of HMF with optimized adsorption behavior as Pt can act as the adsorption site of HMF. Overall, this work here provides a strategy to design an efficient and universal nickel&#8208;based catalyst for HMF electro&#8208;oxidation, which can also be extended to other Ni&#8208;based catalysts such as Ni(HCO3)2 and NiO.

         <title>Luminescent Behavior Elucidation of a Disilane&#8208;Bridged D&#8211;A&#8211;D Triad Composed of Phenothiazine and Thienopyrazine</title>

A &#963;&#8211;&#960; extended aryldisilane comprising a thienopyrazine group as acceptor fragment and a phenothiazine groups as donor moiety was prepared. The compound exhibits fluorescence in the solid state upon UV excitation and mechanochromic luminescent properties.







Abstract
A &#963;&#8211;&#960; extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8722;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8722;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together. A built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is thus formed, which triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved.







Abstract
A built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO3&#8722; ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO3RR). A model electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed . This built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also raises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower the energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved, which are all the best among studies reported at 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of nitrate concentration to date.

         <title>2D Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Multidimensional Photocatalysts for Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porphyrinic nanosheets were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts to mediate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization of different monomers under a broad range of light wavelengths. This system exhibits oxygen tolerance and temporal control resulting in the preparation of well&#8208;defined polymers. Nanosheets were utilized to catalyze stereolithographic 3D printing, providing reinforced mechanical properties and effective antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
Ultrathin porphyrinic 2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets (TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetra&#8208;4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light. High polymerization rates, oxygen tolerance, and precise temporal control were achieved. The polymers showed narrow molecular weight distributions and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were applied as photocatalysts in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open&#8208;air environment under blue light to yield well&#8208;defined 3D printed objects. Apart from providing an efficient catalytic system, 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets reinforced the mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials. The presence of ZnTCPP embedded in the materials conferred effective antimicrobial activity under visible light by production of singlet oxygen, affording 98&#8201;% and 93&#8201;% anti&#8208;bacterial efficiency against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, respectively.

         <title>Compressive Strain Modulation of Single Iron Sites on Helical Carbon Support Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Compressive strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites could boost the catalytic activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high&#8208;curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self&#8208;assembled chiral surfactants. The high&#8208;curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites with 1.5&#8201;% compressed Fe&#8722;N bonds exhibit downshifted d&#8208;band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three&#8208;dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.

A multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations is used to obtain new insights into the ionic conduction mechanism, the nature of the solvent molecules, and the interactions among different components in quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) composed of Li salts, polymer matrix, and solvent, are beneficial for improving the security and energy density of batteries. However, the ionic conduction mechanism, existential form of solvent molecules, and interactions between different components of QPE remain unclear. Here we develop a multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations to unravel aforesaid mysteries. The results indicate that the existential state of solvent in QPE is quite different from that in liquid electrolyte. The Li cations in gel polymer electrolyte are fully solvated by partial solvent molecules to form a local high concentration of Li+, while the other solvent molecules are fastened by polymer matrix in QPE. As a result, the solvation structure and conduction mechanism of Li+ are similar to those in high&#8208;concentrated liquid electrolyte. This work provides a new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of QPE and will promote its application for safe and high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond mediated supramolecular assembly with chiral fractal structure is demonstrated in axially chiral pyridine&#8208;based molecules and 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene. The assembly shows asymmetry amplification both in ground state and excited state, and the enhancement of the chirality can be assigned to the hierarchical chirality transfer from molecule to chiral fractal structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to their great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self&#8208;assembly, it remains unknown how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self&#8208;assembly via halogen bonds, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co&#8208;assemble with an achiral 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (F4DIB) and well&#8208;ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometer scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.

         <title>Interpenetration Symmetry Control Within Ultramicroporous Robust Boron Cluster Hybrid MOFs for Benchmark Purification of Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented symmetrically interpenetrated boron cluster pillared MOF was prepared to address the industrially important but challenging C2H2/CO2 separation with large C2H2 capacity (76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 selectivity (56.6), modestly high adsorption heat (54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and high practical C2H2 (&gt;99.5&#8201;% purity) productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) owing to the precise control of interpenetration symmetry.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is an important process in industry but challenged by the trade&#8208;off of capacity and selectivity owning to their similar physical properties and identical kinetic molecular size. We report the first example of symmetrically interpenetrated dodecaborate pillared MOF, ZNU&#8208;1, for benchmark selective separation of C2H2 from CO2 with a high C2H2 capacity of 76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and record C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 56.6 (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar) among all the robust porous materials without open metal sites. Single crystal structure analysis and modeling indicated that the interpenetration shifting from asymmetric to symmetric mode provided optimal pore chemistry with ideal synergistic &#8220;2+2&#8221; dihydrogen bonding sites for tight C2H2 trapping. The exceptional separation performance was further evidenced by simulated and experimental breakthroughs with excellent recyclability and high productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of 99.5&#8201;% purity C2H2 during stepped desorption process.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Material Based on Catechol&#8208;Modified Self&#8208;Immolative Poly(Disulfide) Backbones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21543-21549, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol&#8208;functionalized self&#8208;immolative poly(disulfides) are synthesized and fashioned into dual&#8208;responsive gels through formation of catecholato&#8211;Al3+ cross&#8208;links. Two distinct pathways to cargo release are engineered, namely the depolymerization in a self&#8208;immolative fashion, or breaking catecholato&#8211;Al3+ cross&#8208;links at low pH. Both gel degradation pathways lead to release of bound dye molecules on demand.







Abstract
Functional materials engineered to degrade upon triggering are in high demand due their potentially lower impact on the environment as well as their use in sensing and in medical applications. Here, stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers are prepared by decorating a self&#8208;immolative poly(dithiothreitol) backbone with pendant catechol units. The highly functional polymer is fashioned into stimuli&#8208;responsive gels, formed through pH&#8208;dependent catecholato&#8211;metal ion cross&#8208;links. The gels degrade in response to specific environmental changes, either by addressing the pH responsive, non&#8208;covalent, catecholato&#8211;metal complexes, or by addition of a thiol. The latter stimulus triggers end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization of the entire self&#8208;immolative backbone through end&#8208;cap replacement via thiol&#8211;disufide exchanges. Gel degradation is visualized by release of a dye from the supramolecular gel as it itself is converted into smaller molecules.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Spin Interactions in One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of a Cumulene&#8208;Based Singlet Biradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21319-21326, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet biradical based on [5]cumulene end&#8208;capped with phenalenyl moieties was synthesized. The strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking tendency of phenalenyl units led to controlled self&#8208;assembly, with the formation of one&#8208;dimensional chain assemblies. Variable&#8208;temperature structural and Raman spectroscopic studies demonstrated that intramolecular spin pairs forming cumulene bonds coupled intermolecularly to form a continuum spin system at low temperatures (see picture).







Abstract
The synthesis of phenalenyl&#8208;endcapped [5]cumulene as a cumulene&#8208;based singlet biradical and the spin correlation changes of one&#8208;dimensional aggregates are described. The high propensity for self&#8208;aggregation of phenalenyl rings and the introduction of bulky substituents into the appropriate positions led to the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional chain assembly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis indicated that the bond length alternation of the cumulene chain increased with decreasing temperature, along with improved overlapping of the phenalenyl rings. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that a localized spin pair within the molecule decouples at low temperatures, and a continuum spin system involving intra&#8208; and intermolecular spin&#8211;spin interactions emerges in the one&#8208;dimensional chain.

         <title>Effective and Rapid Removal of Polar Organic Micropollutants from Water by Amide Naphthotube&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21404-21411, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing the biomimetic macrocyclic hosts, amide naphthotubes, are able to effectively and rapidly adsorb polar organic micropollutants from water by employing host&#8211;guest binding. The polymers can be readily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH at room temperature.







Abstract
It is challenging to remove polar organic micropollutants from water through adsorption&#8208;mediated processes. Macrocycle&#8208;crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8211;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts. In this research, we report two amide naphthotube&#8208;crosslinked polymers which can effectively and rapidly adsorb a wide scope of polar organic micropollutants from water through biomimetic molecular recognition. Amide naphthotubes possess hydrogen bonding sites in their deep hydrophobic cavities and can effectively bind polar organic micropollutants in water through the hydrophobic effects and shielded hydrogen bonds. The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing amide naphthotubes are even able to remove a complex mixture of organic micropollutants from water and the used materials can be easily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH. This research provides a solution for the treatment of polar organic micropollutants by using biomimetic molecular recognition in water.

         <title>Nanomediator&#8211;Effector Cascade Systems for Amplified Protein Kinase Activity Imaging and Phosphorylation&#8208;Induced Drug Release In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21565-21574, September 20, 2021. </description>

We propose a nanomediator&#8211;effector cascade system that can convert the subtle events of kinase&#8208;regulated phosphorylation to augmented fluorescence recovery and cargo release via the DNA amplification machinery. This kinase&#8208;specific sensing and treating modality allows kinase activity imaging and cellular signaling&#8208;responsive drug release in vivo.







Abstract
Protein kinases constitute a rich pool of biomarkers and therapeutic targets of tremendous diseases including cancer. However, sensing kinase activity in vivo while implementing treatments according to kinase hyperactivation remains challenging. Herein, we present a nanomediator&#8211;effector cascade system that can in situ magnify the subtle events of kinase&#8208;catalyzed phosphorylation via DNA amplification machinery to achieve kinase activity imaging and kinase&#8208;responsive drug release in vivo. In this cascade, the phosphorylation&#8208;mediated disassembly of DNA/peptide complex on the nanomediators initiated the detachment of fluorescent hairpin DNAs from the nanoeffectors via hybridization chain reaction (HCR), leading to fluorescence recovery and therapeutic cargo release. We demonstrated that this nanosystem simultaneously enabled trace protein kinase A (PKA) activity imaging and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for inhibition of tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, affording a kinase&#8208;specific sense&#8208;and&#8208;treat paradigm for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Tracking and Sensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ with a Single SERS Probe in the Live Brain: Toward Understanding Why Copper Ions Were Increased upon Ischemia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21351-21359, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SERS sensor was created for biosensing extracellular concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ simultaneously in the live brain. Using our powerful tool, three routes were discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ during ischemia: Cu+ and Cu2+ were transported from neurons; Cu+ and Cu2+ were released from the destroyed copper&#8208;containing proteins; and Cu+ was converted into Cu2+.







Abstract
The imbalance of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the brain is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases. However, it still lacks of effective analytical methods for simultaneously determining the concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+. Herein, we created a novel SERS probe (CuSP) to real&#8208;time track and accurately quantify extracellular concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the live brain. The present CuSP probe demonstrated specific ability for recognition of Cu+ and Cu2+ in a dual&#8208;recognition mode. Then, a microarray consisting of 8 CuSP probes with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution and good accuracy was constructed for tracking and simultaneously biosensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the cerebral cortex of living brain. Using our powerful tool, it was found that that the concentrations of Cu2+ and Cu+ were increased by &#8776;4.26 and &#8776;1.80 times upon ischemia, respectively. Three routes were first discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ during ischemia.

         <title>A Nonheme Mononuclear {FeNO}7 Complex that Produces N2O in the Absence of an Exogenous Reductant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21558-21564, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first example of a nonheme, mononuclear {FeNO}7 complex that mediates the conversion of NO to N2O in the absence of an external reductant. A new mononuclear, 5&#8208;coordinate FeII complex is synthesized, which binds nitric oxide to form the {FeNO}7 complex. This complex exhibits a highly activated NO ligand as seen by RR spectroscopy, and generates N2O in THF upon addition of H2O.







Abstract
A new nonheme iron(II) complex, FeII(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (1), is reported. Reaction of 1 with NO(g) gives a stable mononitrosyl complex Fe(NO)(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (2), which was characterized by M&#246;ssbauer (&#948;=0.52&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1, |&#916;EQ|=0.80&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1), EPR (S=3/2), resonance Raman (RR) and Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The data show that 2 is an {FeNO}7 complex with an S=3/2 spin ground state. The RR spectrum (&#955;exc=458&#8197;nm) of 2 combined with isotopic labeling (15N, 18O) reveals &#957;(N&#8208;O)=1680&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is highly activated, and is a nearly identical match to that seen for the reactive mononitrosyl intermediate in the nonheme iron enzyme FDPnor (&#957;(NO)=1681&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Complex 2 reacts rapidly with H2O in THF to produce the N&#8208;N coupled product N2O, providing the first example of a mononuclear nonheme iron complex that is capable of converting NO to N2O in the absence of an exogenous reductant.

         <title>Asymmetric Enamide&#8211;Imine Tautomerism in the Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21334-21339, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;amido tertiary allyl alcohols through chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;imine tautomerism is reported. Both dialkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;disubstituted allyl alcohols were compatible with this protocol, generating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imines and enamides with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient protocol for kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols has been developed through an unprecedented asymmetric enamide&#8208;imine tautomerism process enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A broad range of racemic 2&#8208;arylsulfonamido tertiary allyl alcohols could be kinetically resolved with excellent kinetic resolution performances (with s&#8208;factor up to &gt;200). This method is particularly effective for a series of 1,1&#8208;dialkyl substituted allyl alcohols, which produced chiral tertiary alcohols that would be difficult to access via other asymmetric methods. Facile and versatile transformations of the chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imine and enamide products, especially the efficient stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino tertiary alcohols using one enantiomer of the catalyst, demonstrated the value of this kinetic resolution method.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Size&#8208;Induced Band Gap Tuning in Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21368-21376, September 20, 2021. </description>

Energy levels of perovskite nanocrystallites depend on their size owing to quantum confinement and the concurrent yet distinct phenomenon of size&#8208;dependent structural changes where surface perturbations template the core. This effect can aid in the design of perovskite opto&#8208;electronic devices utilizing mesoporous layers to tailor the size of infiltrated nanocrystallites.







Abstract
A comprehensive picture explaining the effect of the crystal size in metal halide perovskite films on their opto&#8208;electronic characteristics is currently lacking. We report that perovskite nanocrystallites exhibit a wider band gap due to concurrent quantum confinement and size dependent structural effects, with the latter being remarkably distinct and attributed to the perturbation from the surface of the nanocrystallites affecting the structure of their core. This phenomenon might assist in the photo&#8208;induced charge separation within the perovskite in devices employing mesoporous layers as they restrict the size of nanocrystallites present in them. We demonstrate that the crystal size effect is widely applicable as it is ubiquitous in different compositions and deposition methods employed in the fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells. This effect is a convenient and effective way to tune the band gap of perovskites.

         <title>Direct Detection of Surface Species Formed on Iridium Electrocatalysts during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21396-21403, September 20, 2021. </description>

An approach to directly examine the oxidation state and surface composition of nanosized Ir electrodes after oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was developed. Atom probe tomography reveals compositional changes in the topmost surface and subsurface on various Ir planes during OER. This approach provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into surface changes during electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. Herein, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm of (024), (026), (113), and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8722;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick subsurface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8722;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8722;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.

A nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay strategy combines radical rearrangement and cross&#8208;coupling via a C(sp3)&#8208;centred radical, to produce valuable phenylalanine derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access. An N&#8208;benzyl amino acid ester functions as a molecular scaffold for the aryl migration reaction. The synthetic method offers mild reaction conditions, high diastereoselectivity, and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented, efficient nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay for the remote cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of &#946;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;benzylamino acid esters with aryl bromides via 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/arylation cascades. &#946;&#8208;Bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;benzylamino acid esters are considered as unique molecular scaffolds allowing for aryl migration reactions, which are conceptually novel variants for the radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement. This reaction enables the formation of two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds using a bench&#8208;stable Ni/bipyridine/Zn system featuring a broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity, which provides an effective platform for the remote aryl group migration and arylation of amino acid esters via redox&#8208;neutral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond cleavage. Mechanistically, this cascade reaction is accomplished by combining two powerful catalytic cycles consisting of a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and radical 1,4&#8208;aryl migration through the generation of C(sp3)&#8208;centred radical intermediates from the homolysis of C(sp3)&#8722;Br bonds and the switching of the transient alkyl radical into a robust &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

         <title>Catalytic System&#8208;Controlled Divergent Reaction Strategies for the Construction of Diversified Spiropyrazolone Skeletons from Pyrazolidinones and Diazopyrazolones</title>

Four types of novel and complicated spiropyrazolones from pyrazolidinones and diazopyrazolones were constructed via a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation route, especially a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade and a novel tandem C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, and diazopyrazolones acted as unexpected 1C synthons.







Abstract
A catalytic system&#8208;controlled divergent reaction strategy was here reported to construct four types of intriguing spiroheterocyclic skeletons from simple and readily available starting materials via a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade. The tetraazaspiroheterocyclic and trizazspiroheterocyclic scaffolds could be independently constructed by a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade, a C(sp2)&#8208;H activation/[4+1] annulation and a novel tandem C(sp2)&#8208;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, along with a broad scope of substrates, moderate to excellent yields and valuable transformations. More importantly, in these transformations, we are the first time to capture a N&#8722;N bond activation and a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation of pyrazolidinones under different catalytic system.

&lt;p&gt;Four types of novel and complicated spiropyrazolones from pyrazolidinones and diazopyrazolones were constructed via a precise chemical bond activation/[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+1] annulation route, especially a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+1] annulation cascade and a novel tandem C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, and diazopyrazolones acted as unexpected 1C synthons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A catalytic system-controlled divergent reaction strategy was here reported to construct four types of intriguing spiroheterocyclic skeletons from simple and readily available starting materials via a precise chemical bond activation/[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+1] annulation cascade. The tetraazaspiroheterocyclic and trizazspiroheterocyclic scaffolds could be independently constructed by a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;+1] annulation cascade, a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H activation/[4+1] annulation and a novel tandem C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-H/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, along with a broad scope of substrates, moderate to excellent yields and valuable transformations. More importantly, in these transformations, we are the first time to capture a N&#8722;N bond activation and a C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H bond activation of pyrazolidinones under different catalytic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluoride Chemistry in Tin Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21583-21591, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites improves the crystallization process. Fluoride anions selectively coordinate and remove SnIV and affect the colloidal properties in solution. This study describes the working mechanism of SnF2 and highlights the importance of solution chemistry for controlling crystallization and SnII oxidation in tin halide perovskites.







Abstract
Tin is the frontrunner for substituting toxic lead in perovskite solar cells. However, tin suffers the detrimental oxidation of SnII to SnIV. Most of reported strategies employ SnF2 in the perovskite precursor solution to prevent SnIV formation. Nevertheless, the working mechanism of this additive remains debated. To further elucidate it, we investigate the fluoride chemistry in tin halide perovskites by complementary analytical tools. NMR analysis of the precursor solution discloses a strong preferential affinity of fluoride anions for SnIV over SnII, selectively complexing it as SnF4. Hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy on films shows the lower tendency of SnF4 than SnI4 to get included in the perovskite structure, hence preventing the inclusion of SnIV in the film. Finally, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the strong influence of fluoride on the colloidal chemistry of precursor dispersions, directly affecting perovskite crystallization.

         <title>MnO2 Electrocatalysts Coordinating Alcohol Oxidation for Ultra&#8208;Durable Hydrogen and Chemical Productions in Acidic Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21464-21472, September 20, 2021. </description>

This work reports a strategy of using a low&#8208;cost acidic aqueous solution of alcohols for efficient hydrogen/chemical co&#8208;production. The as&#8208;prepared non&#8208;precious metal MnO2/carbon paper electrocatalyst in combination with alcohol oxidation demonstrates a significantly decreased total energy input for hydrogen production and ultra&#8208;high durability in acidic electrolytes.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen production under acidic conditions is of great importance for industrialization in comparison to that in alkaline media, which, unfortunately, still remains challenging due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant, cost&#8208;effective and highly active anodic electrocatalysts that can be used durably under strongly acidic conditions. Here we report an unexpected finding that manganese oxide, a kind of common non&#8208;noble catalysts easily soluble in acidic solutions, can be applied as a highly efficient and extremely durable anodic electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from an acidic aqueous solution of alcohols. Particularly in a glycerol solution, a potential of as low as 1.36&#8197;V (vs. RHE) is needed at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 270&#8197;mV lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to oxidize glycerol into value&#8208;added chemicals such as formic acid, without oxygen production. To our surprise, the manganese oxide exhibits extremely high stability for electrocatalytic hydrogen production in coupling with glycerol oxidation for longer than 865 hours compared to shorter than 10&#8197;h for OER. Moreover, the effect of the addition of glycerol on the electrochemical durability has been probed via in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work demonstrates that acid&#8208;unstable metal oxide electrocatalysts can be used robustly in acidic media under the presence of certain substances for electrochemical purposes, such as hydrogen production.

Well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance, and diffusive capacity are achieved from the CV curves of typical electrode materials for metal&#8208;ion batteries after three successive treatments including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background as well as non&#8208;linear fitting calculation, offering a more rational and reliable method to calculate the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution.







Abstract
Noticeable pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior out of charge storage mechanism (CSM) has attracted intensive studies because it can provide both high energy density and large output power. Although cyclic voltammetry is recognized as the feasible electrochemical technique to determine it quantitatively in the previous works, the results are inferior due to uncertainty in the definitions and application conditions. Herein, three successive treatments, including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background, as well as a non&#8208;linear fitting algorithm are employed for the first time to calibrate the different CSM contribution of three typical cathode materials, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, and achieve well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance and diffusive contributions to the total capacity. This work can eliminate misunderstanding concepts and correct ambiguous results of the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and recognize the essence of CSM in electrode materials.

         <title>Biomimetic Iron Complex Achieves TET Enzyme Reactivity**

The synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ serves as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and short oligonucleotide strands serve as substrates. The 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably and highly selectively by the complex.







Abstract
The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine (5mdC) is the most prevalent modification to DNA. It is removed inter alia via an active demethylation pathway: oxidation by Ten&#8208;Eleven Translocation 5&#8208;methyl cytosine dioxygenase (TET) and subsequent removal via base excision repair or direct demodification. Recently, we have shown that the synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can serve as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and even short oligonucleotide strands can also serve as substrates, using a range of HPLC and MS techniques. We found that the 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably by 1, with side reactions occurring only at the strand ends of the used oligonucleotides. A detailed study of the reactivity of 1 towards nucleosides confirms our results; that oxidation of the anomeric center (1&#8242;) is the most common side reaction.

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21502-21511, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the current study, with the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic techniques, transient kinetic analysis, and implementation of robust experimental methodologies, we resolve the nature of catalytic active sites and reaction mechanism for oxidative coupling of methane over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.







Abstract
The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of in situ Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe (H2&#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na2WO4 active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable surface Na&#8208;WOx sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (i) surface Na&#8208;WOx sites are responsible for selectively activating CH4 to C2Hx and over&#8208;oxidizing CHy to CO and (ii) molten Na2WO4 phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.

         <title>Tuning the Circular Dichroism and Circular Polarized Luminescence Intensities of Chiral 2D Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites through Halogenation of the Organic Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21434-21440, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the incorporation of Cl&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the chiroptical properties of 2D chiral perovskites can be significantly enhanced. The observed circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence intensities are found to be associated with the d&#8208;spacing of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites and the strength of the halogen&#8211;halogen interaction within the system.







Abstract
Through the incorporation of various halogen&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the effects of chiral molecules on the chiroptical properties of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are investigated. Among them, the HOIP having a Cl&#8208;substituted chiral cation exhibits the highest circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) intensities, indicating the existence of the largest rotatory strength, whereas the F&#8208;substituted HIOP shows the weakest intensities. The observed modulation can be correlated to the varied magnetic transition dipole of HOIPs, which is sensitive to the d&#8208;spacing between inorganic layers and the halogen&#8211;halogen interaction between organic cations and the inorganic sheets. These counteracting effects meet the optimal CD and CPL intensity with chlorine substitution, rendering the rotatory strength of HOIPs arranged in the order of (ClMBA)2PbI4&gt;(BrMBA)2PbI4&gt;(IMBA)2PbI4&gt;(MBA)2PbI4&gt;(FMBA)2PbI4.

         <title>Highly Efficient Oxidative Cyanation of Aldehydes to Nitriles over Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21479-21485, September 20, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8208;free Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000) show high activity and selectivity for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes to synthesize organic nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource. Other oxidizable groups were tolerated, and no further reaction of the product was observed over Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000.







Abstract
Oxidative cyanation of aldehydes provides a promising strategy for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of organic nitriles. Design of robust and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is the key for this route. Herein, we designed a series of Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with a hierarchical porous structure (denoted as Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;x, x represents the pyrolysis temperature). It was found that the obtained Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 was very selective and efficient for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes including those containing other oxidizable groups into the corresponding nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource below 100&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed investigations revealed that the excellent performance of Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 originated mainly from the graphitic&#8208;N species with lower electron density and synergistic effect between the Se, S, N, and C in the catalyst. Besides, the hierarchically porous structure could also promote the reaction. Notably, the unique feature of this metal&#8208;free catalyst is that it tolerated other oxidizable groups, and showed no activity on further reaction of the products, thereby resulting in high selectivity. As far as we know, this is the first work for the synthesis of nitriles via oxidative cyanation of aldehydes over heterogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Construction of Chiral Azepine Skeleton Bearing Multiple&#8208;Stereogenic Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21486-21493, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution was developed. With this methodology, four types of stereogenic elements including chiral nitrogen center, C&#8722;N axial chirality, C&#8722;C axial chirality and conformational behavior of the seven&#8208;membered ring were stereoselectively constructed.







Abstract
Enantioselective construction of molecules bearing multiple stereogenic elements is increasingly related to the synthesis of enantiopure natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. However, atom&#8208;economical and enantioselective approaches to install multiple stereogenic elements in a small molecular template by limited chemical transformation remain challenging. We describe an organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules bearing four types of stereogenic elements in fused azepines via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution. This method was proved robust with a wide range of substrate scope (46&#8211;92&#8201;% yield), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) and enantioselectivity achieved (up to 97&#8201;% ee). Optical properties and Ru3+&#8208;induced fluorescence responses of these compounds suggest their potential applications in optoelectronic materials and heavy metal ion detection.

The ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was elucidated for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported thiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal nanoculusters (NCs) using five experimental techniques. Furthermore, based on obtained knowledge, a method was established to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation, thereby succeeding in creating a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability.







Abstract
Recently, the creation of new heterogeneous catalysts using the unique electronic/geometric structures of small metal nanoclusters (NCs) has received considerable attention. However, to achieve this, it is extremely important to establish methods to remove the ligands from ligand&#8208;protected metal NCs while preventing the aggregation of metal NCs. In this study, the ligand&#8208;desorption process during calcination was followed for metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported 2&#8208;phenylethanethiolate&#8208;protected gold (Au) 25&#8208;atom metal NCs using five experimental techniques. The results clearly demonstrate that the ligand&#8208;desorption process consists of ligand dissociation on the surface of the metal NCs, adsorption of the generated compounds on the support and desorption of the compounds from the support, and the temperatures at which these processes occurred were elucidated. Based on the obtained knowledge, we established a method to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation, thereby succeeding in creating a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability.

However, to achieve this, it is extremely important to establish methods to remove the ligands from ligand-protected metal NCs while preventing the aggregation of metal NCs. In this study, the ligand-desorption process during calcination was followed for metal-oxide-supported 2-phenylethanethiolate-protected gold (Au) 25-atom metal NCs using five experimental techniques. The results clearly demonstrate that the ligand-desorption process consists of ligand dissociation on the surface of the metal NCs, adsorption of the generated compounds on the support and desorption of the compounds from the support, and the temperatures at which these processes occurred were elucidated.

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Ketones Catalyzed by Engineered TrpB</title>

Ketone&#8208;derived enolates can serve as nucleophiles for tryptophan synthase &#946;&#8208;subunit (TrpB) catalysed reactions. The transient nucleophilic enolate species is intercepted by TrpB, which facilitates selective C&#8722;C bond formation, resulting in the asymmetric alkylation of ketones such as propiophenone and 2&#8208;fluoroacetophenone. The products spontaneously cyclize to form highly substituted nitrogen heterocycles that can be reduced to form proline analogs.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase (TrpB) catalyzes a PLP&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;substitution reaction between indole and serine to form L&#8208;Trp. A succession of TrpB protein engineering campaigns to expand the enzyme's nucleophile substrate range has enabled the biocatalytic production of diverse non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs). Here, we show that ketone&#8208;derived enolates can serve as nucleophiles in the TrpB reaction to achieve the asymmetric alkylation of ketones, an outstanding challenge in synthetic chemistry. We engineered TrpB by directed evolution to catalyze the asymmetric alkylation of propiophenone and 2&#8208;fluoroacetophenone with a high degree of selectivity. In reactions with propiophenone, preference for the opposite product diastereomer emerges over the course of evolution, demonstrating that full control over the stereochemistry at the new chiral center can be achieved. The addition of this new reaction to the TrpB platform is a crucial first step toward the development of efficient methods to synthesize non&#8208;canonical prolines and other chirally dense nitrogen heterocycles.

         <title>Designable Assembly of Aluminum Molecular Rings for Sequential Confinement of Iodine Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21426-21433, September 20, 2021. </description>

Heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions, and conjugated carboxylate ligands act as adsorbents for the sequential confinement of iodine molecules. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8211;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.







Abstract
Although numerous adsorbent materials have been reported for the capture of radioactive iodine, there is still demand for new absorbents that are economically viable and can be prepared by reliable synthetic protocols. Herein, we report a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy towards adsorbents for the sequential confinement of iodine molecules. These adsorbents are versatile heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions, and conjugated carboxylate ligands. Additionally, these materials can quickly remove iodine from cyclohexane solutions with a high removal rate (98.8&#8201;%) and considerable loading capacity (555.06&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). These heterometallic frameworks provided distinct pore sizes and binding sites for iodine molecules, and the sequential confinement of iodine molecules was supported by crystallographic data. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8211;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.

The combination of the conceptually complementary formal ring distortion&#8208; and pseudo&#8208;natural product strategies yields novel natural product&#8208;inspired bioactive pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids. 







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new natural product&#8208;inspired compound class obtained by combining the conceptually complementary pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) design strategy and a formal adaptation of the complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity ring distortion approach. Fragment&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;sesquiterpene lactones, whose scaffolds can formally be viewed as related to each other or are obtained by ring distortion, were combined with alkaloid&#8208;derived pyrrolidine fragments by means of highly selective stereocomplementary 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. The resulting pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids were found to be both chemically and biologically diverse, and their biological performance distinctly depends on both the structure of the sesquiterpene lactone&#8208;derived scaffolds and the stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine fragment. Biological investigation of the compound collection led to the discovery of a novel chemotype inhibiting Hedgehog&#8208;dependent osteoblast differentiation

We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. {BiW8} suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MG63 cells. We identified POM&#8208;induced pyroptosis for the first time. Decreased GSH content and increased ROS levels were observed in {BiW8}&#8208;treated cells. {BiW8} executed multiple antitumor mechanisms, such as activation of pyroptosis, regulation of oxidative stress, and inhibition of DNA repair.







Abstract
We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. At 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, the IC50 values of {BiW8} against HUVEC, MG63, RD, Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF7 cells were 895.8, 127.3, 344.3, 455.0, 781.3, and 206.3&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The IC50 value of {BiW8} on the MG63 cells was more than 2&#8208;fold lower than that of the other raw materials. Through morphological and functional features, we demonstrated pyroptosis as a newly identified mechanism of cell death induced by {BiW8}. {BiW8} increased 2&#8208;fold reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MG63 cells at 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation. Compared with 0&#8197;h, the glutathione (GSH) content decreased by 59, 65, 75, 94, and 97&#8201;% at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, respectively. Furthermore, multiple antitumor mechanisms of {BiW8} were identified via transcriptome analysis and chemical simulation, including activation of pyroptosis, suppression of GSH generation, depletion of GSH, and inhibition of DNA repair.

&lt;p&gt;We successfully synthesized &lt;b&gt;{BiW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt;, a 10-nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;}. At 24&#8197;h post-incubation, the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of &lt;b&gt;{BiW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt; against HUVEC, MG63, RD, Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF7 cells were 895.8, 127.3, 344.3, 455.0, 781.3, and 206.3&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of &lt;b&gt;{BiW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt; on the MG63 cells was more than 2-fold lower than that of the other raw materials. Through morphological and functional features, we demonstrated pyroptosis as a newly identified mechanism of cell death induced by &lt;b&gt;{BiW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}. {BiW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt; increased 2-fold reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MG63 cells at 24&#8197;h post-incubation. Compared with 0&#8197;h, the glutathione (GSH) content decreased by 59, 65, 75, 94, and 97&#8201;% at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48&#8197;h post-incubation, respectively. Furthermore, multiple antitumor mechanisms of &lt;b&gt;{BiW&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;/b&gt; were identified via transcriptome analysis and chemical simulation, including activation of pyroptosis, suppression of GSH generation, depletion of GSH, and inhibition of DNA repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Tungsten Disulfide Nanosheets for Alkali&#8208;Acid Electrocatalytic Sulfion Recycling and H2 Generation</title>

A scalable low&#8208;temperature molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted method was developed for synthesis of WS2 nanosheets with high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;yield. The WS2 nanosheets show high electrocatalytic activity towards the alkaline sulfion (S2&#8722;) oxidation reaction and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid alkali&#8208;acid electrochemical device was set up for electrolytic H2 generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion.







Abstract
WS2 nanosheets hold great promise for a variety of applications yet faces a grand challenge in terms of large&#8208;scale synthesis. We report a reliable, scalable, and high&#8208;yield (&gt;93&#8201;%) synthetic strategy to fabricate WS2 nanosheets, which exhibit highly desirable electrocatalytic properties toward both the alkaline sulfion (S2&#8722;) oxidation reaction (SOR) and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings prompted us to develop a hybrid alkali&#8208;acid electrochemical cell with the WS2 nanosheets as bifunctional electrode catalysts of alkaline anodic SOR and acidic cathodic HER. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device holds promise for self&#8208;power or low&#8208;electricity electrolytic H2 generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintained for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21575-21582, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
When an electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on cubic CoSe2 was doped with the light element nitrogen, the electronic structure was modulated while the highly symmetric crystal structure phase was maintained. This nitrogen&#8208;doped CoSe2 shows enhanced alkaline HER electrocatalytic activity, while no structural reconstruction occurs during the HER process.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms is one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS&#8208;TMC), the introduction of heteroatoms, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during the catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between the intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that nitrogen incorporation can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS&#8208;TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution activity (HER). In contrast, the introduction of phosphorus can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus&#8208;doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER.

A stereoretentive C&#8722;N coupling of optically active amines and amino acid esters with aryl bromides is achieved by nickel catalysis under light irradiation, without the use of any external photosensitizers. 







Abstract
The Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8208;N coupling reaction has found widespread applications in organic synthesis. Over the past two decades or so, many improved catalysts have been introduced, allowing various amines and aryl electrophiles to be readily used nowadays. However, there lacks a protocol that could be used to couple a wide range of chiral amines and aryl halides, without erosion of the enantiomeric excess (ee). Reported in this article is a method based on molecular Ni catalysis driven by light, which enables stereoretentive C&#8208;N coupling of optically active amines, amino alcohols, and amino acid esters with aryl bromides, with no need for any external photosensitizer. The method is effective for a wide variety of coupling partners, including those bearing functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles, thus providing a viable alternative to accessing synthetically important chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids esters. Its viability is demonstrated by 92 examples with up to 99&#8201;% ee.

A tetra&#8208;diazirine based cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) is developed for the universal patterning of p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar conjugated polymers by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. The interchain packing orders, the thin film morphologies and the charge carrier mobilities of four conjugated polymers are retained after patterning.







Abstract
A diazirine&#8208;based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) with a tetrahedron geometry is presented for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. After blending of 4CNN with no more than 3&#8201;% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was achieved; regular patterns with size as small as 5&#8197;&#956;m were prepared with appropriate photomasks after 365&#8197;nm irradiation for just 40&#8197;s. The interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking and the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. A complementary&#8208;like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo&#8208;patterning of the p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. The results show that 4CNN is a new generation of cross&#8208;linker for the photo&#8208;patterning of polymeric semiconductors for all&#8208;solution&#8208;processible flexible electronic devices.

A heteroarchitecture of MoS2&#8208;CNTs was developed in which CNTs are vertically anchored within MoS2 by a C&#8722;Mo covalent bond. Due to the high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ion&#8208;diffusion channels, and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs show high energy density and large capacitance, which can power wearable health&#8208;monitoring devices efficiently.







Abstract
Advanced two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets that promote the dynamic transportation and storage capacity of ions are significant for high&#8208;performance electrochemical capacitors (ECs). However, such materials often possess a low energy density. We have developed an ordered heteroarchitecture of molybdenum disulfide&#8208;carbon nanotubes (MoS2&#8208;CNTs) in which CNTs are vertically grafted within a MoS2 framework by C&#8722;Mo covalent bonds. Benefiting from this in&#8197;situ vertical bridge, high&#8208;speed interlaminar conductivity, unimpeded ion&#8208;diffusion channels and sufficient pseudocapacitive reactivity, the MoS2&#8208;CNTs presents ultralarge capacitance (5485&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) and good structural stability in potassium hydroxide electrolyte. Moreover, the all&#8208;unified solid&#8208;state flexible ECs obtained through direct&#8208;write printing construction deliver high energy density (226&#8197;mWh&#8201;g&#8722;1), good capacitance (723&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1) and stable high/low&#8208;temperature operating ability, which can power a wearable health&#8208;monitoring device.

         <title>An Atomic Insight into the Chemical Origin and Variation of the Dielectric Constant in Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21473-21478, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric constants of solutions at different temperatures and compositions are comprehensively probed by considering the significant role in regulating solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation structures of working liquid electrolytes.







Abstract
The dielectric constant is a crucial physicochemical property of liquids in tuning solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation microstructures. Herein the dielectric constant variation of liquid electrolytes regarding to temperatures and electrolyte compositions is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants of solvents reduce as temperatures increase due to accelerated mobility of molecules. For solvent mixtures with different mixing ratios, their dielectric constants either follow a linear superposition rule or satisfy a polynomial function, depending on weak or strong intermolecular interactions. Dielectric constants of electrolytes exhibit a volcano trend with increasing salt concentrations, which can be attributed to dielectric contributions from salts and formation of solvation structures. This work affords an atomic insight into the dielectric constant variation and its chemical origin, which can deepen the fundamental understanding of solution chemistry.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glasses with Lava and Healing Ability for High&#8208;Performance Gas Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21304-21309, September 20, 2021. </description>

Four coordination polymers with good flowability at low vitrification temperature were developed and fabricated into high&#8208;performance gas separation membranes by hot&#8208;casting or hot&#8208;pressing methods. The obtained membranes show excellent H2 sieving ability, rivaling against the best&#8208;reported gas separation membranes. The cracks and functions of the broken membranes can be easily healed upon heating.







Abstract
Coordination polymer (CP) glasses offer a way to tackle the fabrication challenges encountered by inorganic porous membranes and show great potentials for size&#8208;exclusive gas separation. However, their processability and performance still cannot simultaneously meet the requirements for high&#8208;performance membrane separation. Herein, we have developed a series of CP glasses (M&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm, M=Zn, Cd, Cu, and Mn), which possess low vitrification temperature as well as low viscosity (&#951;) and lave capability above the transition temperatures. The derived glass (agM&#8208;P&#8208;dmbIm) membranes show outstanding performances for H2/CO2, H2/N2, and H2/CH4 separation, which all far surpass the Robeson upper bound and even rival against the best of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas separation membranes. The low viscosities not only allow us to hot&#8208;cast or hot&#8208;press the CP glasses into thin membranes within 5&#8197;min without sacrificing their selectivity and permeability, but also endow the resulted glass membranes with healing ability.

         <title>A Color&#8208;Shifting Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Aptamer&#8211;Fluorophore Module for Live&#8208;Cell RNA Imaging</title>

A color&#8208;shifting, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent aptamer&#8211;fluorophore module based on benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin (BC) fluorophores for ratiometric RNA imaging is reported. Free BC is cyan fluorescent, however its fluorescence emission shifts to NIR upon complexation with the BC&#8208;binding aptamer (BeCA). This system enabled the visualization of mRNAs in the NIR region and the ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) have become promising tools for visualizing RNAs in living cells. Specific binding of FLAPs to their non&#8208;fluorescent cognate ligands results in a dramatic fluorescence increase, thereby allowing RNA imaging. Here, we present a color&#8208;shifting aptamer&#8208;fluorophore system, where the free dye is cyan fluorescent and the aptamer&#8208;dye complex is near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent. Unlike other reported FLAPs, this system enables ratiometric RNA imaging. To design the color&#8208;shifting system, we synthesized a series of environmentally sensitive benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin hybrid fluorophores which exist in equilibrium between a cyan fluorescent spirocyclic form and a NIR fluorescent zwitterionic form. As an RNA tag, we evolved a 38&#8208;nucleotide aptamer that selectively binds the zwitterionic forms with nanomolar affinity. We used this system as a light&#8208;up RNA marker to image mRNAs in the NIR region and demonstrated its utility in ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.

         <title>Mo2C/C Hierarchical Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow Spheres as Sulfur Host for Advanced Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21512-21520, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo2C/C hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres with mesoporous thick inner shell and microporous thin outer shell are proposed as an ideal sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The double&#8208;shelled spheres demonstrate superior structural and compositional advantages when employed as cathode material in Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
One of the major challenges regarding the sulfur cathode of Li&#8208;S batteries is to achieve high sulfur loading, fast Li ions transfer, and the suppression of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling. This issue can be solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N&#8208;doped carbon hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres (Mo2C/C HDS&#8208;HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS&#8208;HSs achieve high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double&#8208;shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation. Furthermore, Mo2C/C composition renders the HDS&#8208;HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo2C/C/S HDS&#8208;HSs electrode with high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra&#8208;long cycling stability in the composed Li&#8208;S batteries.

Furthermore, Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C/C composition renders the HDS-HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C/C/S HDS-HSs electrode with high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra-long cycling stability in the composed Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Defect of Lithium Metal in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling studied the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolytes with a wide range of lattice mismatch, and discovered an interfacial disordered Li defect layer at the interfaces and their roles in leading to the interfacial failure during lithium cycling.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery with Li metal anode is a promising rechargeable battery technology with high energy density and improved safety. Currently, the application of Li metal anode is plagued by the failure at the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolyte (SE). However, little is known about the defects at Li&#8211;SE interfaces and their effects on Li cycling, impeding further improvement of Li metal anodes. Herein, by performing large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling of Li metal interfaces with common SEs, we discover that lithium metal forms an interfacial defect layer of nanometer&#8208;thin disordered lithium at the Li&#8211;SE interfaces. This interfacial defect Li layer is highly detrimental, leading to interfacial failure such as pore formation and contact loss during Li stripping. By systematically studying and comparing incoherent, coherent, and semi&#8208;coherent Li&#8211;SE interfaces, we find that the interface with good lattice coherence has reduced Li defects at the interface and has suppressed interfacial failure during Li cycling. Our finding discovered the critical roles of atomistic lithium defects at interfaces for the interfacial failure of Li metal anode, and motivates future atomistic&#8208;level interfacial engineering for Li metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>A General Synthesis Strategy for Hollow Metal Oxide Microspheres Enabled by Gel&#8208;Assisted Precipitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21377-21383, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;assisted precipitation (GAP) avoids synthesis challenges caused by the divergent properties of targeted metal and provides a simple and scalable method to build a large variety of hollow objects as demonstrated by more than 20 different kinds of HMMs as well as hollow structures of metal phosphate. The hollow and mesoporous Nb2O5 microspheres have favorable charge transport kinetics in a Li&#8208;ion intercalation pseudocapacitor.







Abstract
Hollow metal oxide microspheres (HMMs) have drawn enormous attention in different research fields. Reliable and scalable synthetic protocols applicable for a large variety of metal oxides are in emergent demand. Here we demonstrated that polymer hydrogel, such as the resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) one, existed as an efficient synthetic platform to build HMMs. Specifically, the RF gel forms stacked RF microspheres enlaced with its aqueous phase, where the following evaporation of the highly dispersed water leads to a gel&#8208;assisted precipitation (GAP) of the dissolved metal precursor onto the embedded polymeric solids suited for the creation of HMMs. By taking advantage of the structural features of hydrogel, this synthesis design avoids the delicate control on the usually necessitated coating process and provides a simple and effective synthetic process versatile for functional HMMs, particularly Nb2O5 as a high&#8208;performance electrode material in Li&#8208;ion intercalation pseudocapacitor.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol and Phenyl Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21529-21535, September 20, 2021. </description>

Sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry is used to generate polyphenols from small molecules and biological macromolecules containing phenolic groups, enabling the subsequent coordination of the polyphenols with metal ions to engineer coatings on a variety of substrates.







Abstract
We report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412&#8197;kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional .OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives and different metal ions including FeII, FeIII, CuII, and CoII. In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. The properties of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for surface engineering.

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Diverse Conventional Photoredox Catalysts Induces Potent Photoreductant Activity**

Electrochemical activation of conventional photocatalysts induces potent photoreductant activity. These studies resulted in the discovery of an electron&#8208;primed photoredox catalyst capable of cleaving strong aryl C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bonds to aryl radical intermediates. Mechanistic experiments revealed that enhanced activity relative to previously developed electron&#8208;primed photoredox systems was a result of improved catalyst stability.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose that electrochemical stimulation induces new photocatalytic activity from a range of structurally diverse conventional photocatalysts. These studies uncover a new electron&#8208;primed photoredox catalyst capable of promoting the reductive cleavage of strong C(sp2)&#8722;N and C(sp2)&#8722;O bonds. We illustrate several examples of the synthetic utility of these deeply reducing but otherwise safe and mild catalytic conditions. Finally, we employ electrochemical current measurements to perform a reaction progress kinetic analysis. This technique reveals that the improved activity of this new system is a consequence of an enhanced catalyst stability profile.

Self&#8208;healing gas separation membranes based on coordination polymers (CPs) are reported by Xiao Feng, Bo Wang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21304. The low viscosity in the molten state and the low vitrification temperature equip the CPs with good processability and self&#8208;healing properties. Thin glass membranes can be prepared by hot&#8208;pressing or hot&#8208;casting methods, and they exhibit excellent molecular size&#8208;exclusive effects for gas separation.

A one&#8208;dimensional arrangement of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), namely partially oxidized dysprosium(III) phthalocyaninato double&#8208;decker complexes, [DyPc2]Ix, was synthesized in the Communication by Keiichi Katoh, Masahiro Yamashita et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;21179 by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. The results of spectrophotometric analysis on [DyPc2]Ix are consistent with the Drude model, which theoretically explains the optical response of the metal. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the spin blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects observed as magnetic hysteresis were observed for the SMM. This strategy may pave the way for the construction of electro&#8208;conductive SMMs as spin valves.

Based on the obtained knowledge, a method to form a metal&#8208;oxide layer on the surface of Au NCs while preventing their aggregation was established, and thereby a water&#8208;splitting photocatalyst with high activity and stability was created.

The crystallization of tin&#8208;based perovskites is improved thanks to the fluoride in SnF2. The anion of this typical additive is responsible for a more homogeneous nucleation in solution&#8208;processed perovskite thin film formation. In addition, fluoride selectively complexes SnIV and prevents its incorporation into the perovskite structure, as reported by Jorge Pascual, Antonio Abate, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21583.

         <title>Coupling Strategy for CO2 Valorization Integrated with Organic Synthesis by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21150-21172, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox&#8208;catalyzed win&#8211;win coupling strategy, in which CO2 valorization is integrated with organic synthesis in one reaction system, provides a promising approach that enables sufficient utilization of excited electrons and holes to achieve feasible and sustainable light&#8208;mediated artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to solar fuels and/or fine chemicals is a promising way to increase the energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the conventional reaction system for CO2 photoreduction with pure H2O or sacrificial agents usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency, poor stability, or cost&#8208;ineffective atom economy. A recent surge of developments, in which photocatalytic CO2 valorization is integrated with selective organic synthesis into one reaction system, indicates an efficient modus operandi that enables sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to achieve the goals for sustainable economic and social development. In this Review we discuss current advances in cooperative photoredox reaction systems that integrate CO2 valorization with organics upgrading based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The applications and virtues of this strategy and the underlying reaction mechanisms are discussed. The ongoing challenges and prospects in this area are critically discussed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Homolysis of Earth&#8208;Abundant Metal&#8208;Substrate Complexes: A Complementary Activation Strategy in Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21100-21115, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes in photoredox catalysis offers a complementary mode of activation for organic substrates through visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis (VLIH) of metal&#8211;substrate bonds. This Minireview describes different electronic transitions that occur in photoexcited metal&#8211;substrate complexes as well as recent advancements and future prospects in this area.







Abstract
The mainstream applications of visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis predominately involve outer&#8208;sphere single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) or energy transfer (EnT) processes of precious metal RuII or IrIII complexes or of organic dyes with low photostability. Earth&#8208;abundant metal&#8208;based MnLn&#8208;type (M=metal, Ln=polydentate ligands) complexes are rapidly evolving as alternative photocatalysts as they offer not only economic and ecological advantages but also access to the complementary inner&#8208;sphere mechanistic modes, thereby transcending their inherent limitations of ultrashort excited&#8208;state lifetimes for use as effective photocatalysts. The generic process, termed visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced homolysis (VLIH), entails the formation of suitable light&#8208;absorbing ligated metal&#8211;substrate complexes (MnLn&#8208;Z; Z=substrate) that can undergo homolytic cleavage to generate Mn&#8722;1Ln and Z. for further transformations.

This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.







Abstract
Photomediated Giese reactions are at the forefront of radical chemistry, much like the classical tin&#8208;mediated Giese reactions were nearly forty years ago. With the global recognition of organometallic photocatalysts for the mild and tunable generation of carbon&#8208;centered radicals, chemists have developed a torrent of strategies to form previously inaccessible radical intermediates that are capable of engaging in intermolecular conjugate addition reactions. This Review summarizes advances in photoredox&#8208;mediated Giese reactions since 2013, with a focus on the breadth of methods that provide access to crucial carbon&#8208;centered radical intermediates that can engage in radical conjugate addition processes.

         <title>Regulating Local Electron Density of Iron Single Sites by Introducing Nitrogen Vacancies for Efficient Photo&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as electron trap sites, thus directing photoelectrons to accumulate at Fe single sites under light illumination. The formation of a highly concentrated electron density at the Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2 conversion efficiency.







Abstract
The activity of heterogeneous photocatalytic H2O2 activation in Fenton&#8208;like processes is closely related to the local electron density of reaction centre atoms. However, the recombination of electron&#8208;hole pairs arising from random charge transfer greatly restricts the oriented electron delivery to active center. Here we show a defect engineered iron single atom photocatalyst (Fe1&#8208;Nv/CN, single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon nitride with abundant nitrogen vacancies) for the activation of H2O2 under visible light irradiation. Based on DFT calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy results, the engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as the electron trap sites, which can directionally drive the electrons to concentrate on Fe atoms. The formation of highly concentrated electrons density at Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2 conversion efficiency. Therefore, the optimized single atom catalyst exhibiting a higher ciprofloxacin degradation activity, which was up to 18 times that of pristine CN.

&lt;p&gt;The activity of heterogeneous photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation in Fenton-like processes is closely related to the local electron density of reaction centre atoms. However, the recombination of electron-hole pairs arising from random charge transfer greatly restricts the oriented electron delivery to active center. Here we show a defect engineered iron single atom photocatalyst (Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/CN, single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon nitride with abundant nitrogen vacancies) for the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under visible light irradiation. Based on DFT calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy results, the engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as the electron trap sites, which can directionally drive the electrons to concentrate on Fe atoms. The formation of highly concentrated electrons density at Fe sites significantly improves the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion efficiency. Therefore, the optimized single atom catalyst exhibiting a higher ciprofloxacin degradation activity, which was up to 18 times that of pristine CN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;Boron Enolates Enable Palladium Catalyzed Carboboration of Internal 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>

A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, in cooperation with a Pd complex supported by an 1,4&#8208;azaborine&#8208;derived phosphine ligand, transforms enynes into highly substituted dienyl boronates in exquisite site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and cis&#8208;diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
A new family of carbon&#8208;bound boron enolates, generated by a kinetically controlled halogen exchange between chlorocatecholborane and silylketene acetals, is described. These C&#8722;boron enolates are demonstrated to activate 1,3&#8208;enyne substrates in the presence of a Pd0/Senphos ligand complex, resulting in the first examples of a carboboration reaction of an alkyne with enolate&#8208;equivalent nucleophiles. Highly substituted dienyl boron building blocks are produced in excellent site&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and diastereoselectivity by the described catalytic cis&#8208;carboboration reaction.

         <title>Mild Intermolecular Synthesis of a Cyclopropane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic Skeleton: Unusual Reactivity of Isobenzopyryliums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21272-21276, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new intermolecular approach for the expedient access to cyclopropane&#8208;incorporated tricyclic skeleton from the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinyl boronic acids has been achieved. This protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions as compared to traditional approaches.







Abstract
Cyclopropanes embedded in a polycyclic bridged architecture are a versatile structural motif, but such complex frameworks often impose substantial synthetic challenges. Herein we introduce a new approach for the expedient access to such spring&#8208;loaded strained systems via an exceptionally mild intermolecular convergent process between the readily available isobenzopyryliums and vinyl boronic acids. Different from the typical conventional approaches, our protocol does not involve the highly active carbenoid intermediates or strong conditions in order to overcome the disfavored kinetic and thermodynamic problems. Instead, the key cyclopropane ring was formed between the well&#8208;positioned nucleophile and electrophile in the adduct from the regioselective [4+2] cycloaddition. Thus, this unusual process also represents a new reactivity of the versatile isobenzopyryliums. The choice of a Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst with proper acidity is crucial to the high efficiency and selectivity for this multiple bond&#8208;forming process. The strained products are precursors to other useful synthetic building blocks.

Fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSI, FSO2&#8208;NCO) is established as a reliable bis&#8208;electrophilic linker for stepwise attachment of alcohol and amine bearing modules. In step&#8208;1, FSI's isocyanate fuses directly and quickly with alcohols and phenols, and aliphatic amines are attached through the sulfuryl carbamate transfer strategy, both with remarkable selectivity. In step&#8208;2, best yields of S&#8722;N linked products arise with a unique on water process. The scope of SuFEx ligation is greatly expanded in directions which would be especially interesting for drug discovery and chemical biology.







Abstract
Fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSI, FSO2NCO) is established as a reliable bis&#8208;electrophilic linker for stepwise attachment of an alcohol bearing module to an amine bearing module and thence a new module RO&#8208;C(=O)&#8208;NH&#8208;SO2&#8208;NR&#8242;R&#8242;&#8242; is created. FSI's isocyanate motif fuses directly and quickly with alcohols and phenols, affording fluorosulfuryl carbamates in nearly quantitative yield. A new reagent and process to deliver the FSI&#8208;derived fluorosulfuryl carbamate fragment to amines are also developed. The resulting SVI&#8722;F motifs from step&#8208;1 are remarkably stable, given the great structural complexities in diverse products. In the step&#8208;2 reaction with amines, the best yield of the S&#8722;N linked products arise with water alone. This &#8220;on water&#8221; interfacial reactivity phenomenon is crucial, revealing the latent reactivity of SVI&#8722;F probe for potential covalent capture of proteins in vivo which is important in today's drug discovery. The scope of the SuFEx chemistry is largely expanded thereby and the facile entry to these phosphate&#8208;like connections should prove useful to click chemistry across diverse fields.

Organocatalytic Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions that occur through dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations of racemic diastereomers having central and axial chiralities have been developed for the synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused ring systems. The products, with four new chiral carbon centers, were obtained as single diastereomers in high yields with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) reactions of racemic diastereomer mixtures that afford the products as essentially single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities are described. We demonstrated the DYKAT in the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused rings. The starting materials of the DYKAT, dihydrobenzofuranone derivatives, were synthesized in racemic diastereomer mixtures, and these were transformed to the spirooxindole derivatives in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities through Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions with nitrostyrenes under organocatalytic conditions. In the reactions, regardless the stereochemistry of the starting materials, all the four isomers were transformed to single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities, and four new chiral centers were created.

         <title>Recognition of the True and False Resonance Raman Optical Activity</title>

A strong influence of electronic circular dichroism on the measurement of resonance Raman optical activity of colorful chiral compounds is reported for a series of vitamin B12 derivatives. Neglecting this effect can lead to misinterpretation of recorded spectra, and seriously erroneous conclusions about molecular structure and chirality.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) possesses all aspects of a sensitive tool for molecular detection, but its measurement remains challenging. We demonstrate that reliable recording of RROA of chiral colorful compounds is possible, but only after considering the effect of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) on the ROA spectra induced by the dissolved chiral compound. We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B12 derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory.

     alt="Recognition of the True and False Resonance Raman Optical Activity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong influence of electronic circular dichroism on the measurement of resonance Raman optical activity of colorful chiral compounds is reported for a series of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; derivatives. Neglecting this effect can lead to misinterpretation of recorded spectra, and seriously erroneous conclusions about molecular structure and chirality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) possesses all aspects of a sensitive tool for molecular detection, but its measurement remains challenging. We demonstrate that reliable recording of RROA of chiral colorful compounds is possible, but only after considering the effect of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) on the ROA spectra induced by the dissolved chiral compound. We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory. Neglecting the ECD effect during ROA measurement can lead to misinterpretation of the recorded spectra and erroneous conclusions about the molecular structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct NO Reduction by a Biomimetic Iron(II) Pyrazolate MOF</title>

A novel iron(II) metal&#8211;organic framework containing accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers facilitates the direct reduction of NO to N2O.







Abstract
A novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) containing one&#8208;dimensional, Fe2+ chains bridged by dipyrazolate linkers and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands has been synthesized. The unusual chain&#8208;type metal nodes feature accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers, resulting in motifs that are reminiscent of the active sites in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The MOF facilitates direct reduction of nitric oxide (NO), producing nearly quantitative yields of nitrous oxide (N2O) and emulating the reactivity of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs). The ferrous form of the MOF can be regenerated via a synthetic cycle involving reduction with cobaltocene (CoCp2) followed by reaction with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf).

         <title>Deuterated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Significantly Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21250-21255, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to improve luminescence performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated by introducing an isotope effect, which is achieved through substitution of hydrogen in high&#8208;frequency oscillators X&#8208;H (X=O, N, C) by the heavier isotope deuterium. The first deuterated COF exhibits a 19&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield over the non&#8208;deuterated counterpart.







Abstract
Luminescent covalent organic frameworks (COFs) find promising applications in chemical sensing, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices, however, the majority of COFs are non or weakly emissive owing to the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) or the molecular thermal motion&#8208;based energy dissipation. Here, we report a previously unperceived approach to improve luminescence performance of COFs by introducing isotope effect, which is achieved through substitution of hydrogen from high&#8208;frequency oscillators X&#8208;H (X=O, N, C) by heavier isotope deuterium. Combining the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; and in situ deuteration methods generates the first deuterated COF, which exhibits an impressively 19&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield over that of the non&#8208;deuterated counterpart. These results are interpreted by theoretical calculations as the consequence of slower C/N&#8208;D and OD&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O vibrations that impede the nonradiative deactivation process. The proposed strategy is proved applicable to many other types of emissive COFs.

         <title>Microporous Carbon Nitride (C3N5.4) with Tetrazine based Molecular Structure for Efficient Adsorption of CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21242-21249, September 20, 2021. </description>

The new class of microporous carbon nitride with rich nitrogen moieties templated from zeolite shows periodic porosity with a unique CN framework and enhanced active sites that triggered highly selective sensing owing to the high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen species.







Abstract
Mesoporous carbon nitrides with C3N5 and C3N6 stoichiometries created a new momentum in the field of organic metal&#8208;free semiconductors owing to their unique band structures and high basicity. Here, we report on the preparation of a novel graphitic microporous carbon nitride with a tetrazine based chemical structure and the composition of C3N5.4 using ultra&#8208;stable Y zeolite as the template and aminoguanidine hydrochloride, a high nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule, as the CN precursor. Spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the prepared material exhibits a new molecular structure, which comprises two tetrazines and one triazine rings in the unit cell and is thermodynamically stable. The resultant carbon nitride shows an outstanding surface area of 130.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates excellent CO2 adsorption per unit surface area of 47.54&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is due to the existence of abundant free NH2 groups, basic sites and microporosity. The material also exhibits highly selective sensing over water molecules (151.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and aliphatic hydrocarbons due to its unique microporous structure with a high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen moieties and recognizing ability towards small molecules.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Gene Editing to Reduce Tumor Thermal Tolerance for Mild&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>

A hypoxia&#8208;responsive nanocomposite composed of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 attached to gold nanorods delivers Cas9&#8208;sgHSP90&#945; to tumors. Gene editing reduces the thermal tolerance of the tumor cells and then mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is possible with near&#8208;IR light.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is usually associated with undesirable damage to healthy organs nearby due to the high temperatures (&gt;50&#8201;&#176;C) available for tumor ablation. Low&#8208;temperature PTT would therefore have tremendous value for clinical application. Here, we construct a hypoxia&#8208;responsive gold nanorods (AuNRs)&#8208;based nanocomposite of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 for mild&#8208;photothermal therapy via tumor&#8208;targeted gene editing. AuNRs are modified with azobenzene&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (p&#8208;AZO) to achieve on&#8208;demand release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 using hypoxia&#8208;responsive azo bonds. In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the azo groups of the hypoxia&#8208;activated CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 nanosystem based on gold nanorods (APACPs) are selectively reduced by the overexpression of reductases, leading to the release of Cas9 and subsequent gene editing. Owing to the knockout of HSP90&#945; for reducing the thermal resistance of cancer cells, highly effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo was achieved with APACPs under mild PTT.

The first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;mannolide&#8197;C, a highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid is reported. The synthetic strategy features efficient double ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions for the formation of the highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic system.







Abstract
(+)&#8208;Mannolide&#8197;C is a complex hexacyclic C20 cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid featuring a highly strained 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic core containing eight consecutive stereocenters and two bridging lactones. The first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;mannolide&#8197;C has been accomplished by lipase&#8208;mediated resolution, Ru&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed double ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) reactions, NiII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective Michael addition, and MnIII&#8208;catalyzed allylic oxidation as the key transformations.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Hydrogen Bonding of B3N6&#8208;[4]Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21289-21294, September 20, 2021. </description>

B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is isoelectronic to the trianion of [4]triangulene, represents a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride. The tert&#8208;butylated derivative of B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene is synthesized by threefold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation. Its fluorescence in solution is responsive to binding p&#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through H&#8208;bonds, and it forms DD&#8208;AA H&#8208;bond arrays with di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrenetetraone in the co&#8208;crystal.







Abstract
Replacement of the allylic C=C&#8722;C unit with a N&#8722;B&#8722;N unit at each of the three zigzag edges of [4]triangulene gives rise to B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is envisioned to represent a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride (BC4N). A tert&#8208;butylated B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three&#8208;fold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;&#8208;electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8722;B&#8722;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, which forms H&#8208;bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD&#8208;AA hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays with 2,7&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone in the co&#8208;crystal. Moreover, the blue fluorescence of B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene in solution is responsive to binding p&#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through hydrogen bonds.

         <title>P&#8208;Block Atomically Dispersed Antimony Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21237-21241, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;block atomically dispersed antimony with Sb&#8722;N4 configuration has been developed and used as highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The excellent ORR activity is credited to the p orbital interaction between Sb cation and O2, which facilitates the charge transfer and generates appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group (s&#8208; and p&#8208;block) metals are generally regarded as catalytically inactive due to the delocalized s/p&#8208;band. Herein, we successfully synthesized a p&#8208;block antimony single&#8208;atom catalyst (Sb SAC) with the Sb&#8722;N4 configuration for efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The obtained Sb SAC exhibits superior ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V and excellent stability, which outperforms most transition&#8208;metal (TM, d&#8208;block) based SACs and commercial Pt/C. In addition, it presents an excellent power density of 184.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high specific capacity (803.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) in Zn&#8211;air battery. Both experiment and theoretical calculation manifest that the active catalytic sites are positively charged Sb&#8722;N4 single&#8208;metal sites, which have closed d shells. Density of states (DOS) results unveil the p orbital of the atomically dispersed Sb cation in Sb SAC can easily interact with O2&#8208;p orbital to form hybrid states, facilitating the charge transfer and generating appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step. This work sheds light on the atomic&#8208;level preparing p&#8208;block Sb metal catalyst for highly active ORR, and further provides valuable guidelines for the rational design of other main&#8208;group&#8208;metal SACs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;oxiranes: An Asymmetric Addition/Aldol/Spirocyclization Domino Cascade</title>

A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/aldol/spirocyclization domino cascade to generate spiro&#8208;oxiranes is reported. sp2&#8208; and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon nucleophiles are used to initiate the cascade to give arylated and alkynylated products.







Abstract
Enantioenriched spiro&#8208;oxiranes bearing three contiguous stereocenters were synthesized using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/aldol/spirocyclization sequence. Starting from a linear substrate, the cascade enabled the formation of a spirocyclic framework in a single step. sp2&#8208; and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon nucleophiles were found to be competent initiators for this cascade, giving arylated or alkynylated products, respectively. Derivatization studies demonstrated the synthetic versatility of both the epoxide and the alkyne moieties of the products. DFT calculations were used to reconcile spectroscopic discrepancies observed between the solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the products.

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly System for the Construction of a Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Nanodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21226-21230, September 20, 2021. </description>

Cyanine groups introduced into DNA could increase the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and multiple drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanospheres. Therefore, cyanine&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly system provides an adaptable approach to prepare a two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrug.







Abstract
The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy provides a We developed a simple and versatile approach to prepare a series of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrugs through direct self&#8208;assembly of cyanine&#8208;labeled single&#8208;stranded DNA (Cys&#8208;DNA) and different types of drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the Cys introduced into the DNA could enhance the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form hybrid Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanosphere. Such nanospheres serve as both carriers and cargoes, excluding the extra use of nontherapeutic excipients and showing ultrahigh drug loading capacity. Following this approach, an antisense oligonucleotides/doxorubicin nanodrug model was constructed, demonstrating the significant synergistic anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect.

&lt;p&gt;Cyanine groups introduced into DNA could increase the noncovalent interaction between Cys-DNA and multiple drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys-DNA, tending to spontaneously form Cys-DNA/drug nanospheres. Therefore, cyanine-mediated self-assembly system provides an adaptable approach to prepare a two-in-one nanodrug.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy provides a We developed a simple and versatile approach to prepare a series of two-in-one nanodrugs through direct self-assembly of cyanine-labeled single-stranded DNA (Cys-DNA) and different types of drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the Cys introduced into the DNA could enhance the noncovalent interaction between Cys-DNA and drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys-DNA, tending to spontaneously form hybrid Cys-DNA/drug nanosphere. Such nanospheres serve as both carriers and cargoes, excluding the extra use of nontherapeutic excipients and showing ultrahigh drug loading capacity. Following this approach, an antisense oligonucleotides/doxorubicin nanodrug model was constructed, demonstrating the significant synergistic anti-tumor therapeutic effect. As a proof of the concept, our study establishes a simple and reproducible two-in-one nucleic acid-based drug formulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The final puzzle piece fits in! Beryllium is the last of the non&#8208;radioactive s&#8208;block metals to be coordinated to indenyl ligands. Milling K[C9H7] with BeBr2 produces the indenyl complex [Be(C9H7)2]. Its crystal structure reveals mixed &#951;5/&#951;1 ring coordination. The monomeric &#8220;half&#8208;sandwich&#8221; complex [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] is available via the same method.







Abstract
The bonding in beryllocene, [BeCp2], took decades to establish, owing to its unexpected mixed hapticity structure (i.e., [Be(&#951;5&#8208;Cp)(&#951;1&#8208;Cp)]). Beryllium complexes containing the indenyl ligand, which is a close relative of the cyclopentadienyl anion, but which is also known to exhibit its own bonding peculiarities (e.g., facile &#951;5 &#8644; &#951;3 shifts), have remained unknown. Standard metathetical approaches to their synthesis (e.g., with K[Ind&#8242;] + BeX2 in an ether solvent) give rise to intractable oils from which nothing identifiable can be isolated. In contrast, mechanochemical preparation, involving the solvent&#8208;free grinding of BeBr2 and potassium indenides, leads to the production of discrete (indenyl)beryllium complexes, including [Be(C9H7)2] (1) and [Be{1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C9H5}Br] (2). The former displays &#951;5/&#951;1&#8208;coordinated ligands in the solid state, but DFT calculations indicate that an &#951;5/&#951;5&#8208;conformation is less than 5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 higher in energy.

         <title>[Ag(NH3)2]2SO4: A Strategy for the Coordination of Cationic Moieties to Design Nonlinear Optical Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21216-21220, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties offers a new possibility for the rational design and property modification of functional ionic materials, particularly NLO materials. As demonstrated by [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 and Ag2SO4, the exceptional enhancements of the linear birefringence and nonlinear SHG properties are attributed to the unique [Ag(NH3)2]+ cation moiety.







Abstract
Over recent decades, guided by the anionic group theory of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, rational design strategies have been primarily focused on anionic moieties; consequently, structural modification and design of cationic moieties have long been neglected. Herein, we report a strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties that substantially enhances the optical properties of NLO materials. For an example with well&#8208;known crystal structure, [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4, we demonstrate that the coordination of the Ag+ cation by the neutral ligand drives the formation of a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal P
21c structure as a positive uniaxial crystal. The bending of the [Ag(NH3)2]+ cationic moiety parallel to the z&#8208;axis generates an anisotropic arrangement of the dipoles, i.e., a dipole of 0.12&#8197;D along the z&#8208;direction, yet zero dipole in the xy&#8208;plane, which interacts anisotropically with the incident light oscillating electromagnetic wave, leading to optical anisotropy with a large birefringence. The incident beam of 589.3&#8197;nm normal to the (110) crystal plane measures &#916;nobv.=0.08, and [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 also exhibits a phase&#8208;matching NLO response 1.4 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) (obv. 1.4&#215;KDP @1064&#8197;nm; cal. d36=1.50&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1).

NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity through formation of HSNO and HSSNO. Zinc complexes of their conjugate bases Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) result in stabilization of these anions at a biologically relevant metal site yet reveal disparate signaling output upon reaction with thiols.







Abstract
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity. HSNO and HSSNO with their conjugate bases &#8722;SNO and &#8722;SSNO form in the reaction of H2S with NO as well as S&#8208;nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitrite (NO2&#8722;) that serve as NO reservoirs. While HSNO and HSSNO are elusive, their conjugate bases form isolable zinc complexes Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) supported by tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands. Reaction of Na(15&#8208;C&#8208;5)SSNO with Ph,MeTpZn(ClO4) provides Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) that undergoes S&#8208;atom removal by PEt3 to give Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and S=PEt3. Unexpectedly stable at room temperature, these Zn&#8208;SNO and Zn&#8208;SSNO complexes release NO upon heating. Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) quickly react with acidic thiols such as C6F5SH to form N2O and NO, respectively. Increasing the thiol basicity in p&#8208;substituted aromatic thiols 4&#8722;XArSH in the reaction with Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) turns on competing S&#8208;nitrosation to form Ph,MeTpZn&#8208;SH and RSNO, the latter a known precursor for NO.

Rapid diagnostics are essential for early detection of COVID&#8208;19 and reduced disease spread. In this study, we discovered the DNA aptamer SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain binding aptamer 1), which binds with high affinity and specificity to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein as well as UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.







Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (&lt;80&#8197;nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo&#8208;EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N&#8208;terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 at concentrations as low as 5&#215;105&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1. SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 diagnostics.

         <title>Rapid and Direct Photocatalytic C(sp3)&#8722;H Acylation and Arylation in Flow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21277-21282, September 20, 2021. </description>

Need for speed: An efficient and fast photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow has been realized by combining decatungstate photocatalysis and nickel catalysis. The methodology shows great functional group tolerance and high regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various biologically&#8208;relevant molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow. The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8211;48&#8197;hours to only 5&#8211;15&#8197;minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.

         <title>Four&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 39, Page 21283-21288, September 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wittig reaction within a dearomatized pyridine ring system results in 4&#8208;alkylated pyridines, a valuable motif in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sciences. N&#8208;Triazinyl salts are key to this strategy, and a range of substituted pyridines and aldehydes are amenable. Late&#8208;stage methylation is also feasible using a formaldehyde surrogate.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine N&#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and N&#8208;triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2&#8208;sp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.

Conductive Dy3+ phthalocyaninato complex single&#8208;molecule magnets, which exhibit slow magnetic relaxation, can be arranged in a 1D array by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. Hysteresis of the magnetoresistance of the 1D array derived from the &#960;&#8208;f interactions was observed at 2.2&#8197;K.







Abstract
A one&#8208;dimensional (1D) arrangement of an unsubstituted partially oxidized Dy3+ double&#8208;decker complex, [DyPc2]Ix (Pc=phthalocyaninato, I=iodide; 1.93&lt;x&lt;2.26) (1), was obtained by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. In 1, the Pc ligands were partially oxidized, and I3&#8722; ion was present as a counter ion. From the results of spectrophotometric analysis on 1, the &#960; radicals were delocalized in a 1D column and behaved as a conductor even at low&#8208;temperatures. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects corresponding to a magnetic hysteresis of single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) were observed when the galvanomagnetic characteristics were investigated at 2.2&#8197;K.

         <title>After 200 Years: The Structure of Bleach and Characterization of Hypohalite Ions by Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures of sodium hypochlorite and hypobromite hydrates provide the first direct insight into the geometry and hydrogen bonding properties of hypohalites, anions of great importance in general and inorganic chemistry. The crystal structure of sodium hypochlorite, the active component of bleach, fills a long&#8208;standing gap in structural chemistry, dating back to the discovery of chlorine bleaching by Berthollet, and the first development of liquid bleach in Javel, 18th&#160;century France. Details of this research are reported by Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263; et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108843).

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;index NiO faceting during molten salt synthesis is investigated with density functional theory by J.&#8197;D. Rimer, M. Maestri, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202105018). Trapezohedral NiO particles observed in experiments are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to locally&#8208;ordered alkali chloride structures which act as capping agents during crystal growth. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO particles are produced because of their stable hydroxylated surfaces.

         <title>Li4MgGe2S7: The First Alkali and Alkaline&#8208;Earth Diamond&#8208;Like Infrared Nonlinear Optical Material with Exceptional Large Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal tetrahedra units with an excellent diamond&#8208;like structure (DLS) template, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal DLS infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) material Li4MgGe2S7 was rationally designed and fabricated. This work enriches the diversity of DLS compounds, and opens an avenue for the design and exploration of new infrared NLO materials with excellent NLO properties, as outlined by Shilie Pan, Junjie Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107613).

         <title>Radical Bridged Ln4 Metallocene Complexes with Strong Magnetic Coupling and Large Coercive Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing magnetic coupling in 4f&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets is an ongoing challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202110813), Akseli Mansikkam&#228;ki, Muralee Murugesu and co&#8208;workers have incorporated highly delocalized tetrazinyl radicals to bridge 4f metallocenes, forming tetranuclear complexes. A thorough examination of the magnetic properties and computational studies support a radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model with strong exchange interactions, zero&#8208;field SMM behaviour and a giant coercive field of 3&#8197;T.

Topochemical reactions are lattice&#8208;controlled reactions that occur in crystals or other confined media. However, only a handful of topochemical reactions are known so far. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109344), K.&#8197;M. Sureshan and R. Khazeber report a new topochemical reaction: topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction, in which a proximally placed azide and an alkene undergo a cycloaddition reaction to form triazoline in a regiospecific, stereospecific, and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion.

         <title>Desolvation of peptide bond by O to S substitution impacts protein stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid side chains are key to fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment polarity in proteins composed of polar amide bonds. Here, we report that substituting an oxygen atom of the backbone amide bond with sulfur atom desolvates the thioamide bond, thereby increasing its lipophilicity. The impact of such local desolvation by O to S substitution in proteins was tested by synthesizing thioamidated variants of Pin1 WW domain. We observe that a thioamide acts in synergy with nonpolar amino acid side chains to reduce the microenvironment polarity and increase protein stability by more than 14 &#176;C. Through favorable van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions, this single atom substitution significantly stabilizes proteins without altering the amino acid sequence and structure of the native protein.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Dissociation of Carbon&#8208;Oxygen bonds in CO2 and CO on the Surface of LaCoSiHx Intermetallic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In catalysis science, the electronic structure of the active site determines the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the catalyst to a large extent. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal&#8208;based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiH  x  material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co&#8208;based catalysts. Using CO  2  methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO  2  and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiH  x  catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiH  x  has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8208;oxygen bond activation than does the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transferring from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO  2  and CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards dendrite free potassium metal batteries: A rational design of multifunctional 3D polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;borax layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>K metal is optimal anode for K ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issue due to unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium metal batteries, a 3D PVA&#8208;Borax layer is rational designed which enables a dendrite free K plating/stripping process. Such protective layer possesses good wettability, high K ionic diffusivity and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA&#8208;Borax (PVA&#8208;Borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700 h at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 500 h at 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 10% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25% DOD and 50% DOD, the PVA&#8208;Borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180 h and 100 h, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical NO Reduction into NH3 by MoS2 Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of NO not only offers an attractive alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ambient NH  3  production but mitigates the human&#8208;caused unbalance of nitrogen cycle. Herein, we report that MoS  2  nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS  2  /GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH  3  conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS  2  /GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 75.9% and a large NH  3  yield of up to 91 &#181;mol cm  &#8722;2  h  &#8722;1  . Using MoS  2  nanosheet&#8208;loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device of Zn&#8211;NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04 mW cm  &#8722;2  and an NH  3  yield of 452 &#181;g h  &#8722;1  mg  cat.  &#8722;1  . Theoretical calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo&#8208;edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an &#8220;acceptance&#8208;donation&#8221; mechanism and unfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilizing Redox&#8208;Active Tricycloquinazoline into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaromatic&#8208;conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li&#8208;ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes. Herein, we immobilize a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and CuO  4  unit into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) to unlock their potential for Li  +  storage. TQ was identified redox activity with Li  +  for the first time. With a synergistic effect of TQ and CuO  4  unit, the 2D conductive MOF, named Cu&#8208;HHTQ (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), can facilitate the Li  +  /e  &#8208;  transport and ensure a resilient electrode, resulting in a high capacity of 657.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 600 mA g  &#8208;1  with extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. Our findings highlight an efficient strategy of constructing electrode materials for energy storage with combining multiple redox&#8208;active moieties into conductive MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Overlooked Natural Hydrogen Evolution Pathway: Ni2+ Boosting H2O Reduction by Fe(OH)2 Oxidation during Low&#8208;temperature Serpentinization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural hydrogen (H 2  ) has gained considerable attentions as a renewable energy resource to mitigate the globally increasing environmental concerns. Low&#8208;temperature serpentinization (&lt; 200 &#176;  C) as a typical water&#8208;rock reaction is a major source of the natural H 2  . However, the reaction mechanism and the controlling step to product H 2  remained unclear, which hinders the further utilization of natural H 2  . Herein, we demonstrated that the H 2  production rate could be determined by the Fe(OH) 2  oxidation during low&#8208;temperature serpentinization. Moreover, the co&#8208;existence of Ni 2+  could largely enhance the H 2  production kinetics. With the addition of only 1 % Ni 2+  , the H 2  production rate was remarkably enhanced by about two orders of magnitude at 90 &#176;  C. D 2  O isotopic experiment and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced H 2  production kinetics could be attributed to the catalytic role of Ni 2+  to promote the reduction of H 2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable super&#8208;resolution imaging of lipid droplet dynamics through a buffer strategy with a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although super&#8208;resolution imaging offers an opportunity to visualize cellular structures and organelles at the nanoscale level, cellular heterogeneity and unpredictability still pose a significant challenge in the dynamic imaging of live cells. It is thus vital to develop better performing and more photostable probes for long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging. Herein, we report a probe  LD&#8208;FG  for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics using structured illumination microscopy (SIM).  LD&#8208;FG  allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenicity. The replenishment of photobleached  LD&#8208;FG  by intact ones outside LDs further ensure the long&#8208;time stability of the fluorescence imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized. Two LD coalescence modes (as well as heterogeneity in different regions of the cells and even in between different cells) were discovered for the first time. Notably, the dynamic imaging also allowed us to propose a new model of LD maturation during adipocyte differentiation,  i.e.  , a fast LD coalescence followed by a slow ripening step. The excellent performance of  LD&#8208;FG  makes the buffer strategy an effective method for designing fluorescent probes for cell dynamic imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbazole&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatics Enabled by Regioselective Scholl Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores synthesis of new carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatics with interesting geometry and useful properties using Scholl reactions. As found from the Scholl reactions of substrates having two carbazole units linked at different positions through  o  &#8208;phenylene, oxidative coupling of carbazole units occured in a regioselective manner with new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds preferably formed at C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 in N&#8208;alkyl carbazole. A new N&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized with single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070 cm  2  /Vs in solution&#8208;processed thin film transistors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral indoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid has been identified to enable the first highly enantioselective Catellani&#8208;type annulation of (hetero)aryl, alkenyl triflate and conjugated vinyl iodides with 4&#8208;(bromomethyl)cyclohexanone, directly assembling a diverse range of chiral all&#8208;carbon bridged ring systems. Control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the coordinating orientation of the chiral amino acid to the arylpalladium(II) center allows for high levels of stereochemical control.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Total Synthesis of Agarozizanol B via a Strained Photocascade Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prezizane&#8208;type sesquiterpene agarozizanol B was synthesized employing a photochemical cascade reaction as the key step. Starting from a readily available 1&#8208;indanone with a tethered olefin, a strained tetracyclic skeleton was assembled which contained all carbon atoms of the sesquiterpene with the correct relative configuration. The conversion into the tricyclic prezizane skeleton was accomplished by a strategic cyclopropane bond cleavage. Prior to the cyclopropane ring opening an adaption of the oxidation state was required, which could be combined with a reductive resolution step. After removal of two functional groups, the natural product was obtained both in racemic form or &#8211; if resolved &#8211; as the (+)&#8208;enantiomer which was shown to be identical to the natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Metabolic Labeling of Legionaminic acid in Flagellin Glycosylation of Campylobacter jejuni Identifies Maf4 as a Putative Legionaminyl Transferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Campylobacter jejuni  is the major human food&#8208;borne pathogen. Its bipolar flagella are heavily  O  &#8208;glycosylated with microbial sialic acids and essential for its motility and pathogenicity. However, both the glycosylation of flagella and the exact contribution of Legionaminic acid (Leg) to flagellar activity is poorly understood. Here, we report the development of a metabolic labelling method for Leg&#8208;glycosylation on bacterial flagella with probes based on azide&#8208;modified Leg precursors. The hereby azido&#8208;Leg labelled flagellin could be detected by Western blot analysis and imaged on intact bacteria. Using the probes on  C. jejuni  and its isogenic  maf4  mutant we also further substantiate the identification of Maf4 as a putative Leg glycosyltransferase. This is further substantiated with UPLC&#8208;MS detection of labelled CMP&#8208;Leg and an  in silico  model of Maf4. This method and the developed probes will facilitate the study of Leg glycosylation and the functional role of this modification in  C. jejuni  motility and invasiveness.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Encapsulation of Naphthalene Diimide (NDI) Based &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers: A Tool for Understanding Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers are an important class of chromophores for optoelectronic devices. Understanding and controlling their excited state properties, in particular, radiative and non&#8208;radiative recombination processes are among the greatest challenges that must be overcome. We report the synthesis and characterization of a molecularly encapsulated naphthalene diimide&#8208;based polymer, one of the most successfully used motifs, and explore its structural and optical properties. The molecular encapsulation enables a detailed understanding of the effect interpolymer interactions. We reveal that the non&#8208;encapsulated analogue P(NDI&#8208;2OD&#8208;T) undergoes aggregation enhanced emission; an effect that is suppressed upon encapsulation due to an increasing p&#8208;interchain stacking distance. This suggests that decreasing p&#8208;stacking distances may be an attractive method to enhance the radiative properties of conjugated polymers in contrast to the current paradigm where it is viewed as a source of optical quenching.</dc:description>

         <title>NBN&#8208;Doped Bis&#8208;Tetracene and Peri&#8208;Tetracene: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining solution&#8208;based and surface&#8208;assisted synthesis, we demonstrate here the first synthesis of NBN&#8208;doped  bis  &#8208;tetracene (  NBN&#8208;BT  ) and  peri  &#8208;tetracene (  NBN&#8208;PT  ). Unlike unstable all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based  bis  &#8208;tetracene and  peri  &#8208;tetracene, both  NBN&#8208;BT  and  NBN&#8208;PT  exhibit excellent stability under ambient conditions. The chemical structures of  NBN&#8208;BT  and  NBN&#8208;PT  are clearly elucidated by high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in combination with noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) characterizations reveal that  NBN&#8208;BT  (3.08 eV) and  NBN&#8208;PT (  3.28 eV) possess higher energy gaps than their carbon&#8208;based  bis  &#8208;tetracene (1.56 eV) and  peri  &#8208;tetracene (1.11 eV) analogs. Interestingly, based on its  in situ  spectroelectrochemical (SEC) characterization,  NBN&#8208;BT  can undergo stepwise one&#8208;electron oxidation and convert into its corresponding radical cation first and then to its dication rather than its diradical dication. The energy gap of the  NBN&#8208;BT  dication (1.24 eV) is similar to that of  bis  &#8208;tetracene (1.56 eV), indicating their isoelectronic relationship. Moreover, a similar energy gap between the  NBN&#8208;PT  dication (1.21 eV) and its isoelectronic structure  peri  &#8208;tetracene (1.11 eV) can be predicted by DFT calculations. This work provides a novel synthesis along with characterizations of multi&#8208;NBN&#8208;doped zigzag&#8208;edged  peri  &#8208;acenes with tunable electronic properties that are not accessible with classical all&#8208;carbon&#8208;based  peri  &#8208;acenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The stereoselective introduction of the glycosidic bond remains one of the main challenges in carbohydrate synthesis. Characterizing the reactive intermediates of this reaction is key to develop stereoselective glycosylation reactions. Herein we report the characterization of low&#8208;populated, rapidly equilibrating, mannosyl dioxanium ions that arise from participation of a C&#8208;3 acyl group using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy. Dioxanium ion structure and equilibration kinetics were measured under relevant glycosylation conditions and highly  &#945;  &#8208;selective couplings were observed suggesting glycosylation took place  via  this elusive intermediate</dc:description>

Herein we report the characterization of low-populated, rapidly equilibrating, mannosyl dioxanium ions that arise from participation of a C-3 acyl group using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy. Dioxanium ion structure and equilibration kinetics were measured under relevant glycosylation conditions and highly  &#945;  -selective couplings were observed suggesting glycosylation took place  via  this elusive intermediate&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput discovery of a rhombohedral twelve&#8208;connected zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework with ordered terephthalate and fumarate linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a metal&#8208;organic framework where an ordered array of two linkers with differing length and geometry connect [Zr  6  (OH)  4  O  4  ]  12+  clusters into a twelve&#8208;connected  fcu  net that is rhombohedrally distorted from cubic symmetry. The ordered binding of equal numbers of terephthalate and fumarate ditopic carboxylate linkers at the trigonal antiprismatic Zr  6  core creates close&#8208;packed layers of fumarate&#8208;connected clusters that are connected along the single remaining threefold axis by terephthalates. This well&#8208;defined linker arrangement retains the three&#8208;dimensional porosity of the Zr cluster&#8208;based UiO family while creating two distinct windows within the channels that define two distinct guest diffusion paths. The ordered material is accessed by a restricted combination of composition and process parameters that were identified by high&#8208;throughput synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Constructing a Carbon&#8208;Particle&#8208;Modified Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhancing the Efficiency of CO2 Electroreduction into Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the catalytic performance of MOFs in CO2RR, a strategy to introduce suitable precursor to in situ generate carbon nanoparticles was adopted. Introduced carbon nanoparticles serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in the framework, and sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy gives impetus to construct more effective catalysts for electroreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been widely investigated, but insufficient conductivity limits application. Herein, a porous 3D In&#8208;MOF {(Me2NH2)[In(BCP)]&#8901;2&#8201;DMF}n (V11) with good stability was constructed with two types of channels (1.6 and 1.2&#8197;nm diameter). V11 exhibits moderate catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction with 76.0&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEHCOO&#8208;). Methylene blue molecules of suitable size and pyrolysis temperature were introduced and transformed into carbon particles (CPs) after calcination. The performance of the obtained CPs@V11 is significantly improved both in FEHCOO&#8208; (from 76.0&#8201;% to 90.1&#8201;%) and current density (2.2 times). Control experiments show that introduced CPs serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in framework, and benefit to sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy can also work on other In&#8208;MOFs, demonstrating the universality of this method for electroreduction of CO2.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Nickel&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both theoretical simulations and in&#8197;situ experiments demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode and improves the seawater oxidation stability.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and in situ experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion. The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ca. 5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.

         <title>Nucleophilic and Radical Heptafluoroisopropoxylation with Redox&#8208;Active Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active heptafluoroisopropoxylating reagents were conveniently prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines, and then were successfully used for the synthesis of a series of alkyl(aryl) heptafluoroisopropyl ethers.







Abstract
The heptafluoroisopropyl group (CF(CF3)2) is prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. However, heptafluoroisopropoxylated (OCF(CF3)2) compounds remain largely underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient access to these compounds. Herein, we disclose the practical and efficient heptafluoroisopropoxylation reactions through the invention of a series of redox&#8208;active N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. These reagents were readily prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines with AgCF(CF3)2. The substitutions on the nitrogen atom significantly affected the properties and reactivities of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents. Accordingly, two types of N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 reagents including N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 phthalimide A and N&#8208;OCF(CF3)2 benzotriazolium salt O&#8242; were used as OCF(CF3)2 anion and radical precursors, respectively. This protocol enables the direct heptafluoroisopropoxylation of a range of substrates, delivering the corresponding products in moderate to excellent yields.

         <title>Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Ratio&#8208;Dependent Chemodivergent Asymmetric Synthesis</title>

         <dc:description>
A chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis can be achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system.







Abstract
Chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis was achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system. Using N&#8208;(aroyloxy)phthalimide as the precursor of either an oxygen&#8208;centered aroyloxy radical or a nitrogen&#8208;centered phthalimidyl radical, enantioselective oxocyanation or aminocyanation of alkenes was achieved separately through a dual photoredox and copper catalysis. The metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio can exert chemoselective control while retaining the high enantiopurity of divergent products. Both reactions proceed efficiently with catalyst loading as low as 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% and can be performed on a gram scale without loss of chemoselectivity or enantioselectivity. Chemodivergent asymmetric 1,5&#8208;aminocyanation or 1,5&#8208;oxocyanation of vinylcyclopropane can also be realized by this protocol. Mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed to shed light on the stereochemical and chemodivergent results.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Induced Metal and Alloy Dual&#8208;Exsolution in Perovskite Ferrite Oxides Boosting the Performance of Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>

         <dc:description>
CoFe alloy and Co metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide was obtained through a temperature dependent cation exchange reaction and exhibit superior Li&#8208;O2 battery performance, including higher specific capacity, lower overpotential, and obviously better cycling stability.







Abstract
A temperature&#8208;controlled cation&#8208;exchange approach is introduced to achieve a unique dual&#8208;exsolution in perovskite La0.8Fe0.9Co0.1O3&#8722;&#948; where both CoFe alloy and Co metal are simultaneously exsolved from the parent perovskite, forming an alloy and metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide. Mossbauer spectra show that cation exchange of Fe atoms in CoFe alloy and Co cations in the perovskite is the key to the co&#8208;existence of Co metal and CoFe alloy. The obtained composite exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity as Li&#8208;O2 battery cathode catalysts with a specific discharge capacity of 6549.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a cycling performance of 215&#8197;cycles without noticeable degradation. Calculations show that the combination of decorated CoFe alloy and Co metal synergistically modulated the discharge reaction pathway that improves the performance of Li&#8208;O2 battery.

         <title>Catalysis with Supramolecular Carbon&#8208;Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis was established as a new platform for organic synthesis. A class of versatile catalysts was discovered which showed catalytic capability in different benchmark reactions, thus demonstrating the wide potential of this catalysis strategy.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a new catalysis platform, supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis, which exploits the highly directional weak interactions between carbon centers of catalysts and electron donors to drive chemical reactions. To demonstrate this catalysis approach, we discovered a class of cyclopropane derivatives incorporated with carbonyl, ester and cyano groups as catalysts which showed general catalysis capability in different types of benchmark reactions. Among these typical examples, a challenging tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclization can be achieved by supramolecular carbon&#8208;bonding catalysis. The co&#8208;crystal structures of catalyst and electron donors, comparison experiments, and titrations support a catalysis mode of carbon&#8208;bonding activation of Lewis basic reactants.

         <title>Media&#8208;Driven Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Cascades with 1,3&#8208;Diynamides Leading Selectively to Either Indoles or Quinolines</title>

Which coast to take? Divergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades with 1,3&#8208;diynamides and primary or secondary amines result by adding or omitting TBAF. In the absence of TBAF 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles are formed, whereas the addition of TBAF leads selectively to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines. The latter pathway involves the unprecedented formation of [4]cumulenimines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides.







Abstract
Divergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades with various 1,3&#8208;diynamides yielding either 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles or 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines were established. Omitting or adding TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) to the reaction of N,N&#8208;(2&#8208;iodophenyl)(4&#8208;toluenesulfonyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diynamides with secondary or primary amines in the presence of KOH in THF and catalytic amounts of Pd(PPh3)4 completely changed the outcome of the reaction. In the absence of TBAF, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles were the sole products, while the presence of TBAF switched the product formation to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines. Deuterium labeling proceeded selectively at the C3 and C11 positions of the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinoline products and this suggests the unprecedented formation of [4]cumulenimines from 1,3&#8208;diynamides as reactive key intermediates.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling Induced Debonding of Surface Atoms from Metal Bulk for Construing High&#8208;Performance Dual&#8208;Site Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
S,N co&#8208;doped carbon immobilized Co single atoms exhibit superior performance in amine self&#8208;coupling reaction, which can be attributed to the superiorities of such dual&#8208;site catalysts in boosting O2 activation and amine adsorption, simultaneously.







Abstract
One of the most pressing challenges in single&#8208;atom catalysis is the manipulation of the coordination environment of central metals to maximize the catalyst performance. Herein, we fabricated a high&#8208;performance catalyst (Co&#8208;SNC) by introducing S into the neighboring position of the Co&#8208;N4 coordination. The developed ball&#8208;milling method enabled large&#8208;scale synthesis, that over 4.7&#8197;g of Co&#8208;SNC can be produced in one pot. In benzylamine coupling reaction, Co&#8208;SNC exhibited the highest conversion of 97.5&#8201;% with 99&#8201;% selectivity toward N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine in 10&#8197;h among various Co catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed the crucial role of S atoms, which serve as the active sites for O2 activation, leaving the Co atoms free to adsorb benzylamine. Consequently, the adsorption energies of O2 and benzylamine were significantly increased. Our strategy suggests a feasible approach to enhance catalytic performance by delicately integrating dual active sites into a single catalyst unit.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Strain Mapping of High&#8208;Index Facets in Late&#8208;Transition&#8208;Metal Nanoparticles for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mapping of the atomic strain on high&#8208;index facet transition&#8208;metal nanoparticles is conducted to investigate the underlying correlation between the enhanced surface reactivity and the structural properties. Essential parameters are proposed to describe the surface features and predict the surface reactivity, examined by adsorption energy calculations of CO2RR key intermediates.







Abstract
Although high&#8208;index facets (HIF) endows excellent catalytic activity through undercoordinated sites with strain effect, current characterizations techniques still cannot unravel the detailed strain distributions to understand the origins of electroactivity. Nevertheless, theoretical principles to quantify the structural features and their effects on catalytic activity improvements on HIFs are still lacking, which renders the experimental efforts laborious. In this work, we explore the quantification of surface structural features and establish a database of atomic strain distributions for the late&#8208;transition metal HIF nanoparticle models. The surface reactivities of the nanoparticles have been examined by adsorption energy calculations and their correlations with structural features are observed. Our proposed theoretical principles on surface characterizations of high&#8208;index facets nanomaterials will promote the design and synthesis of efficient transition metal based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Zn2+&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven RNA Assembly with Retained Integrity and Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn2+&#8208;driven RNA self&#8208;assembly forming spherical nanoparticles while retaining the integrity and biological functions of RNA was reported. Various functional RNAs of different compositions, shapes, and lengths from 20 to nearly 1000 nucleotides can be used.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;coordination&#8208;directed biomolecule crosslinking in nature has been used for synthesizing various biopolymers, including DNA, peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides. However, the RNA biopolymer has been avoided so far, as due to the poor stability of the RNA molecules, the formation of a biopolymer may alter the biological function of the molecules. Herein, for the first time, we report Zn2+&#8208;driven RNA self&#8208;assembly forming spherical nanoparticles while retaining the integrity and biological function of RNA. Various functional RNAs of different compositions, shapes, and lengths from 20 to nearly 1000 nucleotides were used, highlighting the versatility of this approach. The assembled nanospheres possess a superior RNA&#8208;loading efficiency, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability. In&#8208;vitro and in&#8208;vivo evaluation demonstrated mRNA delivery for expressing GFP proteins, and microRNA delivery to triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. This coordination&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly behavior amplifies the horizons of RNA coordination chemistry and the application scope of RNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Palladium Nanoparticles for the Deuteration and Tritiation of Benzylic Positions on Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium nanoparticles (PdNp) were revealed as an efficient hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) catalyst for the deuterium and tritium labeling of benzylic positions of complex molecules. Several model compounds and popular bioactive molecules were submitted to HIE reactions catalyzed by the PdNp.







Abstract
Palladium nanoparticles (PdNp) were revealed as an efficient hydrogen isotope exchange catalyst for the deuterium and tritium labeling of benzylic positions of complex molecules. A practical way to obtain small palladium nanoparticles and to apply them as a catalyst for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is presented. Several model compounds and popular bioactive molecules were submitted to HIE reactions catalyzed by the PdNp. Benzylic positions situated far away from heteroatoms were labeled with high isotopic enrichments. The observed non&#8208;directed HIE gave rise to regioselectivities complementary to those obtained with other methods, which typically require specific directing groups. For this reason, the successful deuteration of a broad variety of benzylic positions created a helpful tool to produce internal LC&#8208;MS standards of complex drugs. Furthermore, this nanocatalyst paved the way for the radiolabeling of drug molecules with high specific activities by using low pressures of tritium gas.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Bridged Ln4 Metallocene Complexes with Strong Magnetic Coupling and a Large Coercive Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of tetranuclear radical&#8208;bridged lanthanide metallocene complexes through the combination of [Cp*2Ln](BPh4) (Ln=Dy, Gd) and tetrazine&#8208;radical building blocks is reported. A thorough examination of their magnetic properties as well as computational studies support a radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model with strong exchange interactions, zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule&#8208;magnet behaviour and a large coercive field of 3&#8197;T.







Abstract
Inducing magnetic coupling between 4f elements is an ongoing challenge. To overcome this formidable difficulty, we incorporate highly delocalized tetrazinyl radicals, which strongly couple with f&#8208;block metallocenes to form discrete tetranuclear complexes. Synthesis, structure, and magnetic properties of two tetranuclear [(Cp*2Ln)4(tz.)4]&#8901;3(C6H6) (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; tz=1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine; Ln=Dy, Gd) complexes are reported. An in&#8208;depth examination of their magnetic properties through magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as computational studies support a highly sought&#8208;after radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model. Strong exchange interactions between the LnIII ions and tz. radicals lead to a strong magnet&#8208;like behaviour in this molecular magnet with a large coercive field of 30&#8197;kOe.

         <title>Automated Electrical Quantification of Vitamin&#8197;B1 in a Bodily Fluid using an Engineered Nanopore Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantification of small molecules in biological samples is challenging. Using the concentration&#8208;dependent current fluctuations elicited by a thiamine binding protein inside a ClyA nanopore, we show the automated quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute. By swapping the internal biosensor, this principle can be applied for the development of multiple next&#8208;generation home&#8208;diagnostic small&#8208;molecule sensors.







Abstract
The ability to measure the concentration of metabolites in biological samples is important, both in the clinic and for home diagnostics. Here we present a nanopore&#8208;based biosensor and automated data analysis for quantification of thiamine in urine in less than a minute, without the need for recalibration. For this we use the Cytolysin A nanopore and equip it with an engineered periplasmic thiamine binding protein (TbpA). To allow fast measurements we tuned the affinity of TbpA for thiamine by redesigning the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions between the thiazole group of thiamine and TbpA. This substitution resulted furthermore in a marked difference between unbound and bound state, allowing the reliable discrimination of thiamine from its two phosphorylated forms by residual current only. Using an array of nanopores, this will allow the quantification within seconds, paving the way for next&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule metabolite detection systems.

         <title>In Situ Phase Separation into Coupled Interfaces for Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Formate over a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2SnS3 evolved into the strongly coupled heterogeneous interfaces of SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O under reaction conditions. This strongly coupled heterojunction as real active sites driven the electron self&#8208;flow from Sn4+ to Cu+, thus promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Thus, Cu2SnS3 nanosheets achieve over 83.4&#8201;% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V.







Abstract
Bimetallic sulfides are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate over a wide potential window, however, they will undergo in situ structural evolution under the reaction conditions. Therefore, clarifying the structural evolution process, the real active site and the catalytic mechanism is significant. Here, taking Cu2SnS3 as an example, we unveiled that Cu2SnS3 occurred self&#8208;adapted phase separation toward forming the stable SnO2@CuS and SnO2@Cu2O heterojunction during the electrochemical process. Calculations illustrated that the strongly coupled interfaces as real active sites driven the electron self&#8208;flow from Sn4+ to Cu+, thereby promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Cu2SnS3 nanosheets achieve over 83.4&#8201;% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and performance&#8208;enhanced origin of ternary sulfides under the CO2 electroreduction.

Calculations illustrated that the strongly coupled interfaces as real active sites driven the electron self-flow from Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; to Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby promoting the delocalized Sn sites to combine HCOO* with H*. Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets achieve over 83.4&#8201;% formate selectivity in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.1&#8197;V. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and performance-enhanced origin of ternary sulfides under the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Data&#8208;Driven Design of Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Olefins: Database and Hierarchical Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A standardized database including over 12000 literature transformations was created to provide the data basis for the AI design of asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins. The developed hierarchical learning strategy can provide predictive model in the early stage of catalysis screening where limited data is available.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydrogenation of olefins is one of the most powerful asymmetric transformations in molecular synthesis. Although several privileged catalyst scaffolds are available, the catalyst development for asymmetric hydrogenation is still a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;consuming process due to the lack of predictive catalyst design strategy. Targeting the data&#8208;driven design of asymmetric catalysis, we herein report the development of a standardized database that contains the detailed information of over 12000 literature asymmetric hydrogenations of olefins. This database provides a valuable platform for the machine learning applications in asymmetric catalysis. Based on this database, we developed a hierarchical learning approach to achieve predictive machine leaning model using only dozens of enantioselectivity data with the target olefin, which offers a useful solution for the few&#8208;shot learning problem and will facilitate the reaction optimization with new olefin substrate in catalysis screening.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Dithiane/Iodofluorobenzene Mixtures: A New Class of Hydrophobic Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), the first halogen bonding&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent is reported. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic point of 13.7&#8201;&#176;C, over a wide compositional range. The other combinations of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.







Abstract
While research into deep eutectic solvents (DESs) has expanded over the previous two decades, the focus has remained on the utilization of hydrogen bond donors in these systems. Additionally, the majority of the known DESs rely on at least one ionic component. Through the combination of 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), we report the first known DES based on halogen bonding. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic melting temperature of 13.7&#8201;&#176;C over a range of 1,3&#8208;dithiane mole fraction (0.35 to 0.75). Additionally, cocrystals of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These data reveal a wide range of halogen bonding strengths (0.85&lt;RXB&lt;0.99; RXB=normalized halogen bond distance parameter) and geometries about the sulfur atom. By including intermolecular interactions beyond hydrogen bonding, the scope of possible DES systems can be greatly expanded.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Basic EDTA as a Highly Active Molecular Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotubes has been identified as active catalyst for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4. A high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6&#8201;% for CH4 production is observed.







Abstract
The most active catalysts so far successful in hydrogenation reduction of CO2 are mainly heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The complex coordination environments and multiple active sites in heterogeneous catalysts result in low selectivity of target product, while molecular catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites and tailorable structures allow mechanism&#8208;based performance optimization. Herein, we firstly report a single ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) molecular&#8208;level immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotube as a catalyst for transferring CO2 to CH4 with an excellent performance. This catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6&#8201;% toward CH4, a partial current density of &#8722;16.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a potential of &#8722;1.3&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Lewis basic COO&#8722; groups in EDTA molecule are the active sites for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The energy barrier for the generation of CO from *CO intermediate is as high as 0.52&#8197;eV, while the further protonation of *CO to *CHO follows an energetic downhill path (&#8722;1.57&#8197;eV), resulting in the high selectivity of CH4. This work makes it possible to control the product selectivity for CO2RR according to the relationship between the energy barrier of *CO intermediate and molecular structures in the future.

         <title>Conversion of Ammonia to Hydrazine Induced by High&#8208;Frequency Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavitation bubbles act as microreactors to activate NH3, resulting in the formation of NH species that further recombine to hydrazine at the bubble&#8211;liquid interface. One of the advantages of this technology is the compartmentation of the as&#8208;formed hydrazine in the bulk solution, maintained at only 30&#8201;&#176;C, which limits its thermal degradation.







Abstract
Hydrazine is a chemical of utmost importance in our society, either for organic synthesis or energy use. The direct conversion of NH3 to hydrazine is highly appealing, but it remains a very difficult task because the degradation of hydrazine is thermodynamically more feasible than the cleavage of the N&#8722;H bond of NH3. As a result, any catalyst capable of activating NH3 will thus unavoidably decompose N2H4. Here we show that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous NH3 at a high frequency, act as microreactors to activate and convert NH3 to NH species, without assistance of any catalyst, yielding hydrazine at the bubble&#8211;liquid interface. The compartmentation of in&#8208;situ&#8208;produced hydrazine in the bulk solution, which is maintained close to 30&#8201;&#176;C, advantageously prevents its thermal degradation, a recurrent problem faced by previous technologies. This work also points towards a path to scavenge .OH radicals by adjusting the NH3 concentration.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valence Zn&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) Single&#8208;Atom Material as Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction</title>

A nitrogen&#8208;anchored low&#8208;valence Zn single&#8208;atom catalyst, containing coordinately unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 active sites, can boost electrochemical CO2 reduction to industrial application levels.







Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;atom catalyst containing low&#8208;valence zinc atoms (Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC) is reported. It contains saturated four&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N4) and unsaturated three&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N3) sites. The latter makes Zn a low&#8208;valence state, as deduced from X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and density functional theory. Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC catalyzes electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with near&#8208;unity selectivity in water at an overpotential as low as 310&#8197;mV. A current density up to 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved together with high CO selectivity of &gt;95&#8201;% using Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC in a flow cell. Calculations suggest that the unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 could dramatically reduce the energy barrier by stabilizing the COOH* intermediate owing to the electron&#8208;rich environment of Zn. This work sheds light on the relationship among coordination number, valence state, and catalytic performance and achieves high current densities relevant for industrial applications.

         <title>An Improved Turn Structure for Inducing &#946;&#8208;Hairpin Formation in Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#948;&#8208;Linked &#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (&#948;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides.







Abstract
Although &#946;&#8208;hairpins are widespread in proteins, there is no tool to coax any small peptide to adopt a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation, regardless of sequence. Here, we report that &#948;&#8208;linked &#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine (&#948;MeOrn) provides an improved &#946;&#8208;turn template for inducing a &#946;&#8208;hairpin conformation in peptides. We developed a synthesis of protected &#948;MeOrn as a building block suitable for use in Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis begins with l&#8208;leucine and affords gram quantities of the N&#945;&#8208;Boc&#8208;N&#948;&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;&#947;(R)&#8208;methyl&#8208;ornithine building block. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirms that the &#948;MeOrn turn unit adopts a folded structure in a macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;hairpin peptide. CD and NMR spectroscopy allow comparison of the &#948;MeOrn turn template to the &#948;&#8208;linked ornithine (&#948;Orn) turn template that we previously introduced and to the popular d&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly turn template. These studies show that the folding of the &#948;MeOrn turn template is substantially better than that of &#948;Orn and is comparable to d&#8208;Pro&#8208;Gly.

         <title>Versatile 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Reference Electrodes for Aqueous and Non&#8208;Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lack of stable reference electrodes (REs) for electrochemical measurements in small cell arrangements is an often&#8208;neglected problem. Herein we present an easily applicable procedure for the assembly of stable and cheap micro&#8208;REs, which are highly adaptable due to 3D&#8208;printed housings; 3 aqueous and 3 non&#8208;aqueous micro&#8208;REs based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na. After fabrication, their stability and leak&#8208;tightness are shown by electrochemical measurements.







Abstract
While numerous reference electrodes suitable for aqueous electrolytes exist, there is no well&#8208;defined standard for non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, reference electrodes are often large and do not meet the size requirements for small cells. In this work, we present a simple method for fabricating stable 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;reference electrodes. The prints are made from polyvinylidene fluoride, which is chemically inert in strong acids, bases, and commonly used non&#8208;aqueous solvents. We chose six different reference systems based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na, including three aqueous and three non&#8208;aqueous systems to demonstrate the versatility of the approach. Subsequently, we conducted cyclic voltammetry experiments and measured the potential difference between the aqueous homemade reference electrodes and a commercial Ag/AgCl&#8208;electrode. For the non&#8208;aqueous reference electrodes, we chose the ferrocene redox couple as an internal standard. From these measurements, we deduced that this new class of micro&#8208;reference electrodes is leak&#8208;tight and shows a stable electrode potential.

The bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)lithium cation, the lightest main&#8208;group metal analogue of E.&#8197;O. Fischer's bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)Cr, was prepared and characterized in the solid state.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)lithium cation, the benzene metallocene of the lightest metal, is reported. The boron compound FmesBCl2 [Fmes: 2,4,6&#8208;tris(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] reacted with three molar equivalents of the lithio&#8208;acetylene reagent Li&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Fmxyl [Fmxyl: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]. Subsequent crystallization from benzene gave the [bis(&#951;6&#8208;benzene)Li]+ cation with the [{FmesB(&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;Fmxyl)3}2Li]&#8722; anion. This parent [(arene)2Li]+ cation shows an eclipsed arrangement of the pair of benzene ligands at the central lithium cation with uniform carbon&#8208;lithium bond lengths. The corresponding [(&#951;6&#8208;toluene)2Li]+ and [(&#951;6&#8208;durene)2Li]+ containing salts were similarly prepared. The bis(arene)lithium cations were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, by solid&#8208;state 7Li MAS NMR spectroscopy and their bonding features were analyzed by DFT calculations.

         <title>Carbene&#8208;Stabilized Dithiolene (L0) Zwitterions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scissions of sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in an imidazole&#8208;based dithione dimer by stable Lewis bases have been investigated. While NHSi gives a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene complex, both CAAC and NHC provide unusual carbene&#8208;stabilized dithiolene (L0) zwitterions.







Abstract
A series of reactions between Lewis bases and an imidazole&#8208;based dithione dimer (1) has been investigated. Both cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) (2) and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) (4), in addition to N&#8208;heterocyclic silylene (NHSi) (6), demonstrate the capability to cleave the sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in 1, giving carbene&#8208;stabilized dithiolene (L0) zwitterions (3 and 5) and a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene compound (7), respectively.

     alt="Carbene-Stabilized Dithiolene (L0) Zwitterions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scissions of sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in an imidazole-based dithione dimer by stable Lewis bases have been investigated. While NHSi gives a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene complex, both CAAC and NHC provide unusual carbene-stabilized dithiolene (L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) zwitterions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of reactions between Lewis bases and an imidazole-based dithione dimer (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) has been investigated. Both cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), in addition to N-heterocyclic silylene (NHSi) (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;), demonstrate the capability to cleave the sulphur&#8211;sulphur bonds in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, giving carbene-stabilized dithiolene (L&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) zwitterions (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) and a spirocyclic silicon&#8211;dithiolene compound (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), respectively.

         <title>Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA)&#8208;Guided Peptide Engineering of an Aptamer Sensor for Protease&#8208;Triggered Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method is proposed for the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer sensor by using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to bridge the gap between peptide and functional DNA. The protease&#8208;triggered biosensor enables ATP imaging with improved specificity for tumor cells.







Abstract
Protease&#8208;triggered control of functional DNA has remained unachieved, leaving a significant gap in activatable DNA biotechnology. Herein, we report the design of a protease&#8208;activatable aptamer system that can perform molecular sensing and imaging in a tumor&#8208;specific manner. The system is constructed by locking the structure&#8208;switching activity of an aptamer using a rationally designed PNA&#8211;peptide&#8211;PNA triblock copolymer. Highly selective protease&#8208;mediated cleavage of the peptide substrate results in reduced binding affinity of PNA to the aptamer module, with the subsequent recovery of its biosensing function. We demonstrated that the DNA/peptide/PNA hybrid system allows for tumor cell&#8208;selective ATP imaging in&#8197;vitro and also produces a fluorescent signal in&#8197;vivo with improved tumor specificity. This work illustrates the potential of bridging the gap between functional DNA and peptides for precise biomedical applications.

         <title>Stabilizing the Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase with Polyacrylamide for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyacrylamide (PAM) was introduced to &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte (21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI) to realize the formation of an effective solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) in LiMn2O4&#8741;L&#8208;TiO2 full cells by lowering the cathodic limit in the electrochemical stability window (ESW) and suppressing the hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
The introduction of &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; electrolyte (WiSE) concept opens a new horizon to aqueous electrochemistry that is benefited from the formation of a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, such SEI still faces multiple challenges, including dissolution, mechanical damaging, and incessant reforming, which result in poor cycling stability. Here, we report a polymeric additive, polyacrylamide (PAM) that effectively stabilizes the interphase in WiSE. With the addition of 5 molar % PAM to 21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI electrolyte, a LiMn2O4&#8741;L&#8208;TiO2 full cell exhibits enhanced cycling stability with 86&#8201;% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1 C. The formation mechanism and evolution of PAM&#8208;assisted SEI was investigated using operando small angle neutron scattering and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal that PAM minimizes the presence of free water molecules at the anode/electrolyte interface, accelerates the TFSI&#8722; anion decomposition, and densifies the SEI.

         <title>Controlling Photoluminescence and Photocatalysis Activities in Lead&#8208;Free Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 Perovskites via Ion Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 perovskites with high water stability demonstrate switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions on variation of the amount of platinum. With low platinum contents, the photocatalytic function is activated and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is achieved in water, whereas with high platinum contents the photoluminescence function is achieved.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free halide perovskites have triggered interest in the field of optoelectronics and photocatalysis because of their low toxicity, and tunable optical and charge&#8208;carrier properties. From an application point of view, it is desirable to develop stable multifunctional lead&#8208;free halide perovskites. We have developed a series of Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 perovskites (0&#8804;x&#8804;1) with high stability, which show switchable photoluminescence and photocatalytic functions by varying the amount of Pt4+ substitution. A Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 solid solution with a dominant proportion of Pt4+ shows broadband photoluminescence with a lifetime on the microsecond timescale. A Cs2PtxSn1&#8722;xCl6 solid solution with a small amount of Pt4+ substitution exhibits photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. An optical spectroscopy study reveals that the switch between photoluminescence and photocatalysis functions is controlled by sub&#8208;band gap states. Our finding provides a new way to develop lead&#8208;free multifunctional halide perovskites with high stability.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid Chelator that Can Remove Cu2+ from Amyloid&#8208;&#946; and Stop the Formation of Reactive Oxygen Species Associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu bound to Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides can act as a catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to neuropathologic degradation associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). An excellent therapeutic approach is to use a chelator that can selectively remove Cu from Cu&#8208;A&#946;. This chelator should compete with Zn2+ ions (Zn) that are present in the synaptic cleft while forming a nontoxic Cu complex. Herein we describe P3, a water&#8208;soluble peptidomimetic chelator that selectively removes Cu(II) from Cu&#8208;A&#946; in the presence of Zn and prevent the formation of ROS even in a reductive environment. We demonstrate, based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, that although P3 extracts Zn from Cu,Zn&#8208;A&#946; &#160;faster than in removes Cu, the formed Zn complexes are kinetic products that further dissociate, while CuP3 is formed as an exclusive stable thermodynamic product. Our unique findings, combined with the bioavailability of peptoids, make P3 an excellent drug candidate in the context of AD.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed &#8220;remote arylative substitution&#8221; was achieved for the reaction of arylboronic acids with alkenes possessing a distant acetoxy group to provide arylation products having an alkene moiety at the remote position. The use of &#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination as a key step in the catalytic cycle allowed for regioselective formation of unstabilized alkenes after chain walking.

         <title>Lewis&#8208;Pair&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;Alkyl Sorbates for the Synthesis of (AB)n Sequenced Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sequence&#8208;regulated polymers remains a long&#8208;standing challenge in the field of polymer chemistry. In this contribution, Lewis pairs (LPs) composed of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) with different steric hindrance and nucleophilicity as Lewis bases (LBs) and Al&#8208;based compounds with comparable acidity but different steric hindrance as Lewis acids (LAs) were applied for 1,4&#8208;selective polymerization of (E,E)&#8208;methyl sorbate (MS) and (E,E)&#8208;ethyl sorbate (ES). The effects of steric hindrance, electron donating ability and acidity of LPs on MS and ES polymerization were systematically investigated. High catalytic activity and high initiation efficiency can be achieved, leading to the formation of PMS with 100% 1,4&#8208;selectivity, tunable molecular weight (M  w  up to 333 kg/mol) and narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD). Block copolymerization of ES and methyl methacrylate (MMA) was also realized. Meanwhile, this system can be applied to other homologous conjugated diene substrates. Furthermore, simple chemical reactions can efficiently convert PMS to different polymers with strict (AB)  n  sequence structures, such as poly(sorbic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;methyl acrylate), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;acrylic acid), poly(propylene&#8208;alt&#8208;allyl alcohol) and poly(ethylene&#8208;alt&#8208;2&#8208;butylene). Their chemical structures and material properties including thermal properties, surface properties and adhesion properties were investigated in details.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Catalysis in Non&#8208;native Environment with Unnatural Selectivity Using Polymeric Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of enzymes for catalysis in organic solvents, while exhibiting selectivity to different substrates, is a big challenge. Here, we report an amphiphilic random copolymer system that self&#8208;assembles with enzymes in an organic solvent to form nanoreactors. These encapsulated enzymes are not denatured and they do preserve the catalytic activity. The cross&#8208;linkable functional groups in the hydrophobic compartments of the polymers offer to control accessibility to the enzyme. This varied accessibility due to the polymer host, rather than the enzyme itself, endows the nanoreactor with an unnatural selectivity. The findings here highlight the significant potential of simple polymer&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors to execute selective organic reactions under non&#8208;native conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides by Hydrogen with Rh(I)&#8208;Pt(II) Olefin Complexes as Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitrogen oxides NO2, NO, and N2O are among the most potent air pollutants of the 21st century. A bimetallic Rh(I)&#8208;Pt(II) complex containing an especially designed multidentate phosphine olefin ligand is capable of catalytically detoxicate these nitrogen oxides in the presence of hydrogen to water and dinitrogen as benign products. The catalytic reactions were performed at room temperature and low pressures (3 &#8208; 4 bar for combined nitrogen oxides and hydrogen gases). A turnover number (TON) of 587 for the reduction of nitrous oxide (N2O) to water and N2 was recorded, making these Rh(I)&#8208;Pt(II) complexes the best homogeneous catalysts for this reaction to date. Lower TONs were achieved in the conversion of nitric oxide (NO, TON = 38) or nitrogen dioxide (NO2; TON of 8). These unprecedented homogeneously catalyzed hydrogenation reactions of NOx were investigated by a combination of multi&#8208;nuclear NMR techniques and DFT calculations, which provide insight into a possible reaction mechanism. The hydrogenation of NO2 proceeds stepwise, to first give NO and H2O, followed by the generation of N2O and H2O, which is then further converted to N2 and H2O. The nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen bond&#8208;forming step takes place in the conversion from NO to N2O and involves reductive dimerization of NO at a rhodium center to give a hyponitrite (N2O22&#8722;) complex, which was detected as intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of the Photodegradation of A&#8208;D&#8208;A Acceptors for Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we elucidate the photodegradation pathway of A&#8208;D&#8208;A type nonfullerene acceptors for organic photovoltaics. Using IT&#8208;4F as a benchmark example, we isolated the photoproducts and proved them isomers of IT&#8208;4F formed via a 6&#8208;e electrocyclic reaction between the dicyanomethylene unit and the thiophene ring, followed by a 1,5&#8208;sigmatropic hydride shift. Importantly, this photoisomerization is accelerated under inert conditions which is explained by DFT calculations predicting a triplet&#8208;mediated reaction path (quenchable by oxygen). Adding controlled amounts of the photoproduct P1 to PM6:IT&#8208;4F bulk heterojunction cells leads to a progressive decrease of photocurrent and fill factor attributed to its poor absorption and charge transport properties. This cyclization is a general photodegradation pathway for a series of A&#8208;D&#8208;A molecules with 1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone termini. The rate of the reaction varies widely with the nature of the donor and acceptor moiety, and we show an intriguing dramatic stabilization upon replacing the thiophene in the donor core with methylfuran.</dc:description>

Herein, we report a  general palladium&#8208;catalyzed  perfluoroalkylative carbonylation of unactivated alkenes using inexpensive and readily available carbon monoxide as the C1 source and perfluoroalkyl halides as the coupling partner. A wide range of phenols and alcohols were transformed into the corresponding  &#946;  &#8208;perfluoroalkyl esters in high yields with broad functional group tolerance and good chemoselectivity. Additionally, alkyl halides can be utilized as alkoxy source as well to give the desired esters.

         <title>Bayesian Optimization of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Compositions for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active, selective and stable catalysts are imperative for sustainable energy conversion, and engineering materials with such properties are highly desired. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) offer a vast compositional space for tuning such properties. Too vast, however, to traverse without the proper tools. Here, we report the use of Bayesian optimization on a model based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict the most active compositions for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the least possible number of sampled compositions for the two HEAs Ag&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Ru and Ir&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt&#8208;Rh&#8208;Ru. The discovered optima are then scrutinized with DFT and subjected to experimental validation where optimal catalytic activities are verified for Ag&#8208;Pd, Ir&#8208;Pt, and Pd&#8208;Ru binary alloys. This study offers insight into the number of experiments needed for optimizing the vast compositional space of multimetallic alloys which has been determined to be on the order of 50 for ORR on these HEAs.</dc:description>

Here, we report the use of Bayesian optimization on a model based on density functional theory (DFT) to predict the most active compositions for the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the least possible number of sampled compositions for the two HEAs Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru and Ir-Pd-Pt-Rh-Ru. The discovered optima are then scrutinized with DFT and subjected to experimental validation where optimal catalytic activities are verified for Ag-Pd, Ir-Pt, and Pd-Ru binary alloys. This study offers insight into the number of experiments needed for optimizing the vast compositional space of multimetallic alloys which has been determined to be on the order of 50 for ORR on these HEAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Phase Inversion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Fabrication of Helical Microfibers towards Versatile Artificial Abdominal Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microfluidic spinning technology (MST), incorporating microfluidics with chemical reactions, has fastened considerable interests in constructing anisotropic advanced microfibers, especially helical microfibers. However, subsistent efforts suffer from the limited material choices, restricting their applications. Here, a new phase inversion&#8208;based microfluidic spinning (PIMS) method is proposed for producing helical microfibers. This method undergoes a physicochemical phase inversion process, which is capable of efficiently manufacturing strong (tensile stress of more than 25 MPa), stretchable, flexible and biocompatible helical microfibers. The helical microfibers can be used to fabricate bi&#8208;oriented stretchable artificial abdominal skin, preventing incisional hernia formation and promoting the wound healing without conglutination. This research not only offers a universal approach to design helical microfibers, but also provides a new insight into artificial skins.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;throughput Single&#8208;cell Mass Spectrometry Reveals Abnormal Lipid Metabolism in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even populations of clonal cells are heterogeneous, which requires high&#8208;throughput analysis methods with single&#8208;cell sensitivity. Here, we propose a rapid, label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell analytical method based on active capillary dielectric barrier discharge ionization mass spectrometry, which can analyze multiple metabolites in single cells at a rate of 38 cells/minute. Multiple cell types (HEK&#8208;293T, PANC&#8208;1, CFPAC&#8208;1, H6c7, HeLa and iBAs) were discriminated successfully. We found that abnormal lipid metabolism occurs in pancreatic cancer cells. We also analyzed gene expression in a cancer genome atlas dataset and found that the mRNA level of a critical enzyme of lipid synthesis (ATP citrate lyase, ACLY) was upregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Moreover, both an ACLY chemical inhibitor or a siRNA approach targeting ACLY could suppress the viability of PDAC cells. A significant reduction in lipid content in treated cells indicates that ACLY could be a potential target for treating pancreatic cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Multiple Chiroptical Inversion in Biphasic Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While controlling the chirality and modulating the helicity is a challenging task, it attracts great research interest for better understanding the origin of chirality in nature. Herein, structurally similar azobenzene (Azo) vinyl monomers were designed in which the alkyl chains comprised the chiral stereocenter with different achiral tail lengths. Combining the synchronous polymerization, supramolecular stacking and self&#8208;assembly, multiple chiroptical inversion of the Azo&#8208;polymer supramolecular assemblies can be modulated by the tail length and DP of Azo blocks during in&#8208;situ polymerization. The DP&#8208;, UV light&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, aging time&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties and liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) characterization indicated that the amorphous&#8208;to&#8208;LC phase transition and biphasic LC interconversion allows the transcription of intra&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, inter&#8208;chain H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregation, thereby controlling the dynamic multiple reversal of supramolecular chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Garsubellin&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective total synthesis of garsubellin&#8197;A establishes the absolute stereostructure of the plant&#8208;derived meroterpene that enhances the choline acetyltransferase enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The 12&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthesis features use of a dithiolane for efficient construction of the bridged and fused ring system.







Abstract
Garsubellin&#8197;A is a meroterpene capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is believed to play a central role in the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity together with the novel bridged and fused cyclic molecular architecture, garsubellin&#8197;A has garnered substantial synthetic interest, but its absolute stereostructure has been undetermined. We report here the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A. Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (&#8722;)&#8208;garsubellin&#8197;A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode for biological evaluations.

From petroleum refining to thermoplastic elastomers and flame retardants: We report on a new synthetic method to prepare segmented polyurethanes and thermoplastic elastomers from elemental sulfur which have improved thermomechanical properties and flame retardancy.







Abstract
The production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refining has created a technological opportunity to increase the valorization of elemental sulfur by the creation of high&#8208;performance sulfur based plastics with improved thermomechanical properties, elasticity and flame retardancy. We report on a synthetic polymerization methodology to prepare the first example of sulfur based segmented multi&#8208;block polyurethanes (SPUs) and thermoplastic elastomers that incorporate an appreciable amount of sulfur into the final target material. This approach applied both the inverse vulcanization of S8 with olefinic alcohols and dynamic covalent polymerizations with dienes to prepare sulfur polyols and terpolyols that were used in polymerizations with aromatic diisocyanates and short chain diols. Using these methods, a new class of high molecular weight, soluble block copolymer polyurethanes were prepared as confirmed by Size Exclusion Chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and microscopic imaging. These sulfur&#8208;based polyurethanes were readily solution processed into large area free standing films where both the tensile strength and elasticity of these materials were controlled by variation of the sulfur polyol composition. SPUs with both high tensile strength (13&#8211;24&#8197;MPa) and ductility (348&#8201;% strain at break) were prepared, along with SPU thermoplastic elastomers (578&#8201;% strain at break) which are comparable values to classical thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). The incorporation of sulfur into these polyurethanes enhanced flame retardancy in comparison to classical TPUs, which points to the opportunity to impart new properties to polymeric materials as a consequence of using elemental sulfur.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refining has created a technological opportunity to increase the valorization of elemental sulfur by the creation of high-performance sulfur based plastics with improved thermomechanical properties, elasticity and flame retardancy. We report on a synthetic polymerization methodology to prepare the first example of sulfur based segmented multi-block polyurethanes (SPUs) and thermoplastic elastomers that incorporate an appreciable amount of sulfur into the final target material. This approach applied both the inverse vulcanization of S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; with olefinic alcohols and dynamic covalent polymerizations with dienes to prepare sulfur polyols and terpolyols that were used in polymerizations with aromatic diisocyanates and short chain diols. Using these methods, a new class of high molecular weight, soluble block copolymer polyurethanes were prepared as confirmed by Size Exclusion Chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and microscopic imaging. These sulfur-based polyurethanes were readily solution processed into large area free standing films where both the tensile strength and elasticity of these materials were controlled by variation of the sulfur polyol composition. SPUs with both high tensile strength (13&#8211;24&#8197;MPa) and ductility (348&#8201;% strain at break) were prepared, along with SPU thermoplastic elastomers (578&#8201;% strain at break) which are comparable values to classical thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). The incorporation of sulfur into these polyurethanes enhanced flame retardancy in comparison to classical TPUs, which points to the opportunity to impart new properties to polymeric materials as a consequence of using elemental sulfur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Local Environment of Platinum in Single&#8208;Atom Pt1/CeO2 Catalysts for Robust Low&#8208;Temperature CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active and robust single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst was developed for CO oxidation by tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ through thermal&#8208;shock synthesis (see picture). Ultrafast shockwaves in an inert atmosphere generated Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration, resulting in greatly enhanced low&#8208;temperature activity that was retained under oxidizing conditions.







Abstract
A single&#8208;atom Pt1/CeO2 catalyst formed by atom trapping (AT, 800&#8201;&#176;C in air) shows excellent thermal stability but is inactive for CO oxidation at low temperatures owing to over&#8208;stabilization of Pt2+ in a highly symmetric square&#8208;planar Pt1O4 coordination environment. Reductive activation to form Pt nanoparticles (NPs) results in enhanced activity; however, the NPs are easily oxidized, leading to drastic activity loss. Herein we show that tailoring the local environment of isolated Pt2+ by thermal&#8208;shock (TS) synthesis leads to a highly active and thermally stable Pt1/CeO2 catalyst. Ultrafast shockwaves (&gt;1200&#8201;&#176;C) in an inert atmosphere induced surface reconstruction of CeO2 to generate Pt single atoms in an asymmetric Pt1O4 configuration. Owing to this unique coordination, Pt1&#948;+ in a partially reduced state dynamically evolves during CO oxidation, resulting in exceptional low&#8208;temperature performance. CO oxidation reactivity on the Pt1/CeO2_TS catalyst was retained under oxidizing conditions.

         <title>Various Stacking Patterns of Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Cocrystals: Insight into Competitive Intermolecular Interactions and Control of Stacking Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational control of the stacking patterns of molecular two&#8208;dimensional layers in a series of hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystals by a chemical modification is demonstrated. The effect of the chemical modification is discussed in terms of both the enthalpic and entropic contributions based on experimental and computational results.







Abstract
Control over the stacking patterns in 2D molecular assemblies is demonstrated using chemical modification. A target system is a hydrogen&#8208;bonded cocrystal (2:1) composed of 2&#8208;pyrrolidone (Py) and chloranilic acid (CA) (PyCA). X&#8208;ray crystallography showed that weak intersheet interactions give rise to a variety of metastable overlapping patterns comprised of the 2D assemblies mainly formed via hydrogen bonds, affording reversible and irreversible structural phase transitions. We prepared cocrystals of Py and anilic acids bearing different halogens, in which 2D assemblies isostructural with those observed in PyCA exhibit various overlapping patterns. The order of stability for each overlapping pattern estimated using calculations of the intermolecular interactions did not completely coincide with those indicated by our experimental results, which can be explained by considering the entropic effect: the molecular motion of Py as detected using nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy.

         <title>Practical Chemoselective Acylation: Organocatalytic Chemodivergent Esterification and Amidation of Amino Alcohols with N&#8208;Carbonylimidazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly chemoselective esterification or aniline amidation of polyfunctional molecules is possible by a catalytic chemodivergent protocol involving only simple reagents: N&#8208;acylimidazoles and either DBU or pyridinium ion (see scheme). These reactions may be performed in the simultaneous presence of phenols, indoles, amides, some aliphatic amines, and other groups. A mechanism&#8208;based model for predicting the acylation chemoselectivity is provided.







Abstract
Chemoselective transformations are a cornerstone of efficient organic synthesis; however, achieving this goal for even simple transformations, such as acylation reactions, is often a challenge. We report that N&#8208;carbonylimidazoles enable catalytic chemodivergent aniline or alcohol acylation in the presence of pyridinium ions or 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU), respectively. Both acylation reactions display high and broad chemoselectivity for the target group. Unprecedented levels of chemoselectivity were observed in the DBU&#8208;catalyzed esterification: A single esterification product was obtained from a molecule containing primary aniline, alcohol, phenol, secondary amide, and N&#8722;H indole groups. These acylation reactions are highly practical as they involve only readily available, inexpensive, and relatively safe reagents; can be performed on a multigram scale; and can be used on carboxylic acids directly by in situ formation of the acylimidazole electrophile.

         <dc:description>
An alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products.







Abstract
Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction is one of the most powerful methods for allylic oxidation of alkenes. However, the inherent radical mechanism and use of peroxides as both oxidants and oxygen nucleophiles render dearth of universal catalytic systems for highly enantioselective variants and limited scope. Herein, an alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8211;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Detailed mechanistic studies provide evidences for the radical&#8208;based reaction pathway.

Phosphorus&#8208;substituted CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) have been rationally designed and synthesized by a facile hydrothermal sulfidation and subsequent gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. The desired hollow structure and multielement composition with abundant Ni3+ active sites endow P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs with high electrocatalytic activity and robust stability towards electrochemical hydrogen production via water splitting and urea electrolysis.







Abstract
Exploring earth&#8208;abundant electrocatalysts with excellent activity, robust stability, and multiple functions is crucial for electrolytic hydrogen generation. Porous phosphorized CoNi2S4 yolk&#8208;shell spheres (P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs) were rationally designed and synthesized by a combined hydrothermal sulfidation and gas&#8208;phase phosphorization strategy. Benefiting from the strengthened Ni3+/Ni2+ couple, enhanced electronic conductivity, and hollow structure, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 YSSs exhibit excellent activity and durability towards hydrogen/oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions in alkaline solution, affording low potentials of &#8722;0.135&#8197;V, 1.512&#8197;V, and 1.306&#8197;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Remarkably, when used as the anode and cathode simultaneously, the P&#8208;CoNi2S4 catalyst merely requires a cell voltage of 1.544&#8197;V in water splitting and 1.402&#8197;V in urea electrolysis to attain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent durability for 100&#8197;h, outperforming most of the reported nickel&#8208;based sulfides and even noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work promotes the application of sulfides in electrochemical hydrogen production and provides a feasible approach for urea&#8208;rich wastewater treatment.

         <title>Electronic Modulation Caused by Interfacial Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M (M=Ru, Ir, Pd) Bonding for Accelerating Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics</title>

A facile and spontaneous strategy is presented for synthesizing Ru&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;anchored metal&#8211;organic frameworks nanohybrids on Ni foam. The nanohybrids exhibit excellent HER performance at all pH values owing to the optimized adsorption free energies of intermediates by the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.







Abstract
Designing definite metal&#8208;support interfacial bond is an effective strategy for optimizing the intrinsic activity of noble metals, but rather challenging. Herein, a series of quantum&#8208;sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal&#8211;organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni&#8208;MOF, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal&#8208;oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni&#8208;MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics. As a result, the representative Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and recent noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.

         <title>Ordered Conformation&#8208;Regulated Vesicular Membrane Permeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic polypeptide vesicles can regulate their membrane permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations. Particularly, a transformation from extended &#946;&#8208;strands to compact &#945;&#8208;helices in response to reactive oxygen species reduces the vesicular wall thickness and remodels the membrane structure, thereby enhancing the membrane permeability for efficient nanoreaction, glucose&#8208;triggered insulin secretion and effective therapy of diabetes mellitus.







Abstract
In nature, the folding and conformation of proteins can control the cell or organelle membrane permeability and regulate the life activities. Here we report the first example of synthetic polypeptide vesicles that regulate their permeability via ordered transition of secondary conformations, in a manner similar to biological systems. The polymersomes undergo a &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix transition in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to wall thinning without loss of vesicular integrity. The change of membrane structure increases the vesicular permeability and enables specific transport of payloads with different molecular weights. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the polymersomes encapsulating enzymes could serve as nanoreactors and carries for glucose&#8208;stimulated insulin secretion in vivo inspired by human glucokinase, resulting in safe and effective treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in mouse models. This study will help understand the biology of biomembranes and facilitate the engineering of nanoplatforms for biomimicry, biosensing, and controlled delivery applications.

         <title>N&#947;&#8208;Hydroxyasparagine: A Multifunctional Unnatural Amino Acid That is a Good P1 Substrate of Asparaginyl Peptide Ligases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unnatural amino acid, Asn(OH), mimics P1&#8208;Asn in the substrates of asparaginyl ligases, enabling efficient cyclization of P1&#8208;Asn(OH) peptides. The hydroxamic acid functionality in Asn(OH) is a metal&#8208;ion chelator for metalloenzyme inhibition, and Asn(OH) can be converted into native Asp by periodate oxidation (see scheme).







Abstract
Peptidyl asparaginyl ligases (PALs) are powerful tools for peptide macrocyclization. Herein, we report that a derivative of Asn, namely N&#947;&#8208;hydroxyasparagine or Asn(OH), is an unnatural P1 substrate of PALs. By Asn(OH)&#8208;mediated cyclization, we prepared cyclic peptides as new matrix metalloproteinase&#8197;2 (MMP2) inhibitors displaying the hydroxamic acid moiety of Asn(OH) as the key pharmacophore. The most potent cyclic peptide (Ki=2.8&#177;0.5&#8197;nM) was built on the hyperstable tetracyclic scaffold of rhesus theta defensin&#8208;1. The Asn(OH) residue in the cyclized peptides can also be readily oxidized to Asp. By this approach, we synthesized several bioactive Asp&#8208;containing cyclic peptides (MCoTI&#8208;II, kB2, SFTI, and integrin&#8208;targeting RGD peptides) that are otherwise difficult targets for PAL&#8208;catalyzed cyclization owing to unfavorable kinetics of the P1&#8208;Asp substrates. This study demonstrates that substrate engineering is a useful strategy to expand the application of PAL ligation in the synthesis of therapeutic cyclic peptides.

         <title>A Tale of Two Isomers: Enhanced Antiaromaticity/Diradical Character versus Deleterious Ring&#8208;Opening of Benzofuran&#8208;fused s&#8208;Indacenes and Dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fusion of benzofuran to either s&#8208;indacene or dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene results in two dramatically different outcomes depending upon heterocycle orientation. Whereas the &#8220;anti&#8221; isomers are unstable and hydrolyze readily to ring&#8208;opened products, the &#8220;syn&#8221; isomers are quite stable and afford molecules that either possess a high degree of antiaromaticity or exhibit pronounced diradical character.







Abstract
We examine the effects of fusing two benzofurans to s&#8208;indacene (indacenodibenzofurans, IDBFs) and dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene (indenoindenodibenzofurans, IIDBFs) to control the strong antiaromaticity and diradical character of these core units. Synthesis via 3&#8208;functionalized benzofuran yields syn&#8208;IDBF and syn&#8208;IIDBF. syn&#8208;IDBF possesses a high degree of paratropicity, exceeding that of the parent hydrocarbon, which in turn results in strong diradical character for syn&#8208;IIDBF. In the case of the anti&#8208;isomers, synthesized via 2&#8208;substituted benzofurans, these effects are decreased; however, both derivatives undergo an unexpected ring&#8208;opening reaction during the final dearomatization step. All the results are compared to the benzothiophene&#8208;fused analogues and show that the increased electronegativity of oxygen in the syn&#8208;fused derivatives leads to enhancement of the antiaromatic core causing greater paratropicity. For syn&#8208;IIDBF increased diradical character results from rearomati&#8208;zation of the core naphthalene unit in order to relieve this paratropicity.

&lt;p&gt;We examine the effects of fusing two benzofurans to &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene (indacenodibenzofurans, IDBFs) and dicyclopenta[&lt;i&gt;b,g&lt;/i&gt;]naphthalene (indenoindenodibenzofurans, IIDBFs) to control the strong antiaromaticity and diradical character of these core units. Synthesis via 3-functionalized benzofuran yields &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-IDBF and &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-IIDBF. &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-IDBF possesses a high degree of paratropicity, exceeding that of the parent hydrocarbon, which in turn results in strong diradical character for &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-IIDBF. In the case of the &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-isomers, synthesized via 2-substituted benzofurans, these effects are decreased; however, both derivatives undergo an unexpected ring-opening reaction during the final dearomatization step. All the results are compared to the benzothiophene-fused analogues and show that the increased electronegativity of oxygen in the &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-fused derivatives leads to enhancement of the antiaromatic core causing greater paratropicity. For &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt;-IIDBF increased diradical character results from rearomati-zation of the core naphthalene unit in order to relieve this paratropicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium(I) Complexes Bearing an Aryl&#8208;Substituted 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatriene Chain: Catalysts for Living Polymerization of Phenylacetylene and Potential Helical Chirality of 1,3,5&#8208;Hexatrienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolable chiral rhodium(I) complexes bearing a helical aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain were synthesized by one&#8208;pot reactions of [Rh(nbd)Cl]2 with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of 50&#8201;% aqueous KOH (see scheme). The persistent helical chirality of the complexes enabled their separation into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. The complexes served as bench&#8208;stable catalysts for living polymerization of phenylacetylene.







Abstract
Unique bench&#8208;stable rhodium(I) complexes bearing an aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain have been synthesized by reactions of (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta&#8208;2,5&#8208;diene)rhodium(I) chloride dimer ([Rh(nbd)Cl]2) with aryl boronic acids and diphenylacetylenes in the presence of a 50&#8201;% aqueous solution of KOH. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated complexes indicated a square&#8208;planar structure stabilized by a strong interaction with one of the aryl groups on the 1,3,5&#8208;hexatriene chain, which has a helical structure. The helical chirality of the isolated rhodium complexes was confirmed to be sufficiently stable to be resolved into enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase at room temperature. It was confirmed that the isolated rhodium complexes functioned as initiators for living polymerization of phenylacetylene to give cis&#8208;stereoregular poly(phenylacetylene) with a well&#8208;controlled molecular weight.

Reversible hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bond transformation between solvent&#8208;bridged&#183;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30 and carboxyl&#183;&#183;&#183;carboxyl dimers in HOF&#8208;30a has been unveiled by single crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, HOF&#8208;30a enables the selective adsorption of propyne over propylene according to the single component sorption and breakthrough experiments. The preferred propyne location in HOF has also been identified by SCXRD test.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Force&#8208;selective mechanochemical reactions may be important for applications in polymer mechanochemistry, yet it is difficult to achieve such reactions. This paper reports that  cis  &#8208;N&#8208;phthalimidoaziridine incorporated into a macromolecular backbone undergoes migration of N&#8208;phthalimido group to afford imine under mechanochemical condition and not thermal one. The imine is further hydrolyzed by water bifurcating into amine and aldehyde. These structural transformations are confirmed by  1  H NMR and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopic analyses. Computational simulations are conducted for the aziridine mechanophore to propose the mechanism of reaction and define the substrate scope of reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Overcoming the Low Driving Force in Forming Depolymerizable Polymers through Monomer Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While depolymerizable polymers have been intensely pursued as a potential solution to address the challenges in polymer sustainability, most depolymerization systems are characterized by a low driving force in polymerization, which poses difficulties for accessing diverse functionalities and architectures of polymers. Here, we address this challenge by using a cyclooctene&#8208;based depolymerization system, in which the  cis  &#8208;to&#8208;  trans  alkene isomerization significantly increases the ring strain energy to enable living ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization at monomer concentrations &#8805; 0.025 M. An additional  trans  &#8208;cyclobutane fused at the 5,6&#8208;position of the cyclooctene reduces the ring strain energy of cyclooctene, enabling the corresponding polymers to depolymerize into the  cis  &#8208;cyclooctene monomers. The use of excess triphenylphosphine was found to be essential to suppress secondary metathesis and depolymerization. The high&#8208;driving&#8208;force living polymerization of the  trans  &#8208;cyclobutane fused  trans  &#8208;cyclooctene system holds promise for developing chemically recyclable polymers of a wide variety of polymer architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale analysis of historical paintings by means of O&#8208;PTIR spectroscopy: The identification of the organic particles in L&#8242;Arl&#233;sienne (portrait of Madame Ginoux) by Van Gogh</title>

O&#8208;PTIR spectroscopy applied to the analysis of the organic composition of samples from historical paintings is presented for the first time.







Abstract
Optical&#8208;photothermal infrared (O&#8208;PTIR) spectroscopy is a recently developed technique that provides spectra comparable to traditional transmission FTIR spectroscopy with nanometric spatial resolution. Hence, O&#8208;PTIR is a promising candidate for the analysis of historical paintings, as well as other cultural heritage objects, but its potential has not yet been evaluated. This work presents the first application of O&#8208;PTIR to the analysis of cultural heritage, and in particular to an extremely small fragment from Van Gogh's painting L&#8242;Arl&#233;sienne (portrait of Madame Ginoux). The striking results obtained, including the detection of geranium lake pigments as well as the complete analysis of the stratigraphy, failed with other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, highlight the potential of this method. The integration of O&#8208;PTIR to the study of cultural heritage opens to the possibility of decreasing the amount of sample extracted, therefore contributing to the preservation of the integrity of artworks while providing a complete characterization of the materials.

         <title>Inhibition of S.&#8197;aureus Infection of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) by Trehalose&#8208; and Glucose&#8208;Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to increased resistance against antibiotics, the fight against bacteria is becoming increasingly difficult. Here, we used a sugar that is unique to the bacteria metabolism, trehalose, and prepared trehalose&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were shown to inhibit the infection of healthy cells by S.&#8197;aureus and could serve as a non&#8208;toxic alternative to prevent adhesion of certain bacteria.







Abstract
Microbial adhesion to host cells represents the initial step in the infection process. Several methods have been explored to inhibit microbial adhesion including the use of glycopolymers based on mannose, galactose, sialic acid and glucose. These sugar receptors are, however, abundant in the body, and are not unique to bacteria. Trehalose, in contrast, is a unique disaccharide that is widely expressed by microbes. This carbohydrate has not yet been explored as an anti&#8208;adhesive agent. Herein, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) coated with trehalose&#8208;based polymers were prepared and compared to glucose&#8208;functionalized AuNPs and examined for their ability to prevent binding to endothelial cells. Acting as anti&#8208;adhesive agents, trehalose&#8208;functionalized NPs decreased the binding of S.&#8197;aureus to HUVECs, while outperforming the control NPs. Microscopy revealed that trehalose&#8208;coated NPs bound strongly to S.&#8197;aureus compared to the controls. In conclusion, nanoparticles based on trehalose could be a non&#8208;toxic alternative to inhibit S.&#8197;aureus infection.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Excited Multicolor Afterglow in Carbon Dots&#8208;Based Room&#8208;Temperature Afterglow Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method is developed to activate near&#8208;infrared&#8208;excited multicolor afterglow of carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs) through radiative energy transfer from NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion materials (UMs). The resulting UM/CDAMs demonstrate bright and persistent afterglow from blue to orange under NIR CW laser excitation at 980&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature afterglow (RTA) materials with long lifetime have shown tremendous application prospects in many fields. However, there is no general design strategy to construct near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;excited multicolor RTA materials. Herein, we report a universal approach based on the efficient radiative energy transfer that supports the reabsorption from upconversion materials (UMs) to carbon dots&#8208;based RTA materials (CDAMs). Thus, the afterglow emission (blue, cyan, green, and orange) of various CDAMs can be activated by UMs under the NIR continuous&#8208;wave laser excitation. The efficient radiative energy transfer ensured the persistent multicolor afterglow up to 7&#8197;s, 6&#8197;s, 5&#8197;s, and 0.5&#8197;s by naked eyes, respectively. Given the unusual afterglow properties, we demonstrated preliminary applications in fingerprint recognition and information security. This work provides a new avenue for the activation of NIR&#8208;excited afterglow in CDAMs and will greatly expand the applications of RTA materials.

         <title>Stable interface chemistry and multiple ion transport of composite electrolyte contribute to ultra&#8208;long cycling&#160;solid&#8208;state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The severe interfacial side reactions of polymer electrolyte with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode and lithium (Li) metal anode become huge challenge to restrict ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance of solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries. Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm&#8208;1, which enables the solid&#8208;state NCM811/Li batteries to stably cycle for 1500 times. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), which greatly enhances its electrochemical stability and suppresses the side reactions. We clearly identify the ceramic&#8208;polymer&#8208;liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior via solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, which endow homogeneous and efficient ions flux and uniform lithium depositions. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs&#8208;PVDF&#8208;DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid&#8208;state batteries at wide temperature range of &#8208;20~60 &#186;C.</dc:description>

Herein, we propose a chemically stable ceramic-polymer-anchored solvent composite electrolyte with high ionic conductivity of 6.0&#215;10&#8722;4 S cm-1, which enables the solid-state NCM811/Li batteries to stably cycle for 1500 times. The Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 nanowires (LNs) can tightly anchor the essential N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), which greatly enhances its electrochemical stability and suppresses the side reactions. We clearly identify the ceramic-polymer-liquid multiple ion transport mechanism of the LNs-PVDF-DMF composite electrolyte by tracking the 6Li and 7Li substitution behavior via solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, which endow homogeneous and efficient ions flux and uniform lithium depositions. The stable interface chemistry and efficient ion transport of LNs-PVDF-DMF contribute to superior performances of the solid-state batteries at wide temperature range of -20~60 &#186;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biosynthesis of chuangxinmycin featuring a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur is an essential element for all life by forming various sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Compared to the well&#8208;studied biological functions, the knowledge on sulfur incorporation mechanism involved in sulfur&#8208;containing molecule biosynthesis remains limited. Chuangxinmycin is a sulfur&#8208;containing antibiotic with a unique thiopyrano[4,3,2&#8208;  cd  ]indole (TPI) skeleton and selective inhibitory activity against bacterial tryptophanyl&#8208;tRNA synthetase. Despite the previously reported biosynthetic gene clusters and the recent functional characterization of a P450 enzyme responsible for C&#8722;S bond formation, the enzymatic mechanism for sulfur incorporation remains unknown. Here, we resolve this central biosynthetic problem by  in vitro  biochemical characterization of the key enzymes, and reconstitute the TPI skeleton in a one&#8208;pot enzymatic reaction. Particularly, we reveal that the JAMM/MPN  +  protein Cxm3 functions as a deubiquitinase&#8208;like sulfurtransferase to catalyze a non&#8208;classical sulfur&#8208;transfer reaction by interacting with the ubiquitin&#8208;like sulfur carrier protein Cxm4GG. This finding adds a new mechanism for sulfurtransferase in nature.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Darzens&#8208;Type Epoxidation of Diazoesters: Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral trisubstituted epoxides were synthesized by boron&#8211;Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. The developed reaction provides an efficient synthetic route to various chiral compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone, and epoxy diester.







Abstract
Highly enantioselective Darzens&#8208;type epoxidation of diazoesters with glyoxal derivatives was accomplished using a chiral boron&#8211;Lewis acid catalyst, which facilitated asymmetric synthesis of trisubstituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy esters. In the presence of a chiral oxazaborolidinium ion catalyst, the reaction proceeded in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee and &gt;20:1 dr, respectively). The synthetic potential of this method was illustrated by conversion of the products to various compounds such as epoxy &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone, tertiary &#946;&#8208;hydroxy ketone and epoxy diester.

         <title>A Solvent Polarity Induced Interface Self&#8208;assembly Strategy towards Mesoporous Triazine&#8208;based Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triazine&#8208;based materials with porous structure have recently recieved numerous attentions as a fascinating new class because of their superior potential for various applications. However, it is still a formidable challenge to obtain triazine&#8208;based materials with precise adjustable meso&#8208;scaled pore sizes and contrallable pore structures by reported synthesis approaches. Here,  we develop a solvent polarity induced interface self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials. In this method, we employ a mixed solvent system within a suitable range of polarity (0.223 &#8804; Lippert&#8208;Mataga parameter  &#160;&#8804; 0.295) to induce valid self&#8208;assembly of skeleton precursor and surfactant. The as&#8208;prepared mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials possess uniform tunable pore sizes (8.2&#8208;14.0 nm), high surface areas and ultrahigh nitrogen content (up to 18%). Owing to these intriguing advantages, the fabricated mesoporous triazine&#8208;based carbon materials as functionalized porous solid absorbents exhibit predominant CO  2  adsorption performance and exceptional selectivity for the capture of CO  2  over N  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Strategy for Enhancing Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of Single&#8208;Atom Cu&#8208;S1N3 Catalysts via Integration with Cu Nanoclusters</title>

         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO 2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is an advanced technology for converting waste CO 2  and closing carbon cycle. This process was usually obstructed by large energy barriers for *COOH formation. In this study, we developed a novel tandem electrocatalyst for CO 2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion comprising the single Cu site co&#8208;coordinated with N and S anchored carbon matrix (Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  ) and atomically dispersed Cu clusters (Cu x  ), denoted as Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  /Cu x  . The configuration of Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  /Cu x  was clearly confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis. The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  /Cu x  composite presents a 100% Faradaic efficiency towards CO generation (FE CO  ) at &#8722;0.65 V vs. RHE and high FE CO  over 90% from &#8722;0.55 to &#8722;0.75 V, outperforming the analogue with a Cu&#8208;N 4  coordination sphere (FE CO  only 54% at &#8722;0.7 V). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the unsymmetrical Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  atomic interface in the carbon basal plane possesses an optimized binding energy for the key intermediate *COOH compared with Cu&#8208;N 4  site. At the same time, the adjacent Cu x  effectively promotes the protonation of *CO 2  &#8208; by accelerating water dissociation and offering *H to the Cu&#8208;S 1  N 3  active sites. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned single Cu atoms and Cu clusters integrated in carbon matrix play a synergistic role in lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*COOH formation) and cooperatively improving the reductive conversion of CO 2  to CO. This work provides a tandem strategy for facilitating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer over the atomic&#8208;level catalytic sites.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic metal&#8208;organic frameworks have attracted great attention as they can be used as bio&#8208;inspired models, allowing us to gain important insights into how large biological molecules function as catalysts. In this work, we report the synthesis and utilization of such a metal&#8208;metalloporphyrin framework (MMPF) that is constructed from a custom&#8208;designed ligand as an efficient halogen bond donor catalyst for Diels&#8208;Alder reactions under ambient conditions. The implementation of fabricated halogen bonding capsule as binding pocket with high&#8208;density C&#8208;Br bonds enabled the use of halogen bonding to facilitate organic transformations in their three&#8208;dimensional cavities. Through combined experimental and computational studies, we showed that the substrate molecules diffuse through the pores of the MMPF, establishing a host&#8208;guest system  via  the C&#8208;Br&#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960;  interaction. The formation of halogen bonds is a plausible explanation for the observed boosted catalytic efficiency in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. Moreover, the unique capability of MMPF highlights new opportunities in using artificial non&#8208;covalent binding pockets as highly tunable and selective catalytic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Siloxy Esters as Traceless Activators of Carboxylic Acids: Boron&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Asymmetric Aldol Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction is among the most useful reactions in organic synthesis. Despite the existence of many prominent reports, however, the late&#8208;stage, chemoselective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction of multifunctional substrates is still difficult to achieve. Herein, we identified that  in&#8208;situ  pre&#8208;conversion of carboxylic acids to siloxy esters facilitated the boron&#8208;catalyzed direct aldol reaction, leading to the development of carboxylic acid&#8208;selective, catalytic, asymmetric aldol reaction applicable to multifunctional substrates. Combining experimental and computational studies rationalized the reaction mechanism, and led to the proposal of Si/B enediolates as the active species. The silyl ester formation facilitated both enolization and catalyst turnover by acidifying the &#945;&#8208;proton of substrates and attenuating poisonous Lewis bases to the boron catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Location Dependent Lanthanide Selectivity Engineered into Structurally Characterized Designed Coiled Coils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report unprecedented location&#8208;dependent, size&#8208;selective binding to designed lanthanide (Ln  3+  ) sites within miniature protein coiled coil scaffolds. Not only do these engineered sites display unusual Ln  3+  selectivity for moderately large Ln  3+  ions (Nd to Tb), for the first time we demonstrate that selectivity can be location&#8208;dependent and can be programmed into the sequence. A 1 nm linear translation of the binding site towards the N&#8208;terminus can convert a selective site into a highly promiscuous one. An X&#8208;ray crystal structure, the first of a lanthanide binding site within a coiled coil to be reported, coupled with CD studies, reveal the existence of an optimal radius that likely stems from the structural constraints of the coiled coil scaffold. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of location&#8208;dependent metal selectivity within a coiled coil scaffold, as well as the first report of location&#8208;dependent Ln  3+  selectivity within a protein.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosulfide (HS&#8208;) Recognition and Sensing in Water by Halogen Bonding Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H  2  S) plays a crucial signalling role in a variety of physiological systems, existing as the hydrosulfide anion (HS  &#8208;  ) at physiological pH. Combining the potency of halogen bonding (XB) for anion recognition in water with coumarin fluorophore incorporation in acyclic host structural design, the first XB receptors to bind and, more importantly sense the hydrosulfide anion in pure water in a reversible chemosensing fashion, are demonstrated. The XB receptors exhibit characteristic selective quenching of fluorescence upon binding to HS  &#8211;  . Computational DFT and Molecular Dynamics simulations investigation in water corroborate the experimental anion binding observations, revealing the mode and nature of HS  &#8208;  recognition by the XB receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral selectivity of secondary nucleation in amyloid fibril propagation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a fundamental feature of asymmetric molecules and of critical importance for intermolecular interactions. The growth of amyloid fibrils displays a strong enantioselectivity, which is manifested as elongation through the addition of monomers of the same, but not opposite, chirality as the parent aggregate. Here we ask whether also secondary nucleation on the surface of amyloid fibrils, of relevance for toxicity, is governed by the chirality of the nucleating monomers. We use short amyloid peptides (A&#946;20&#8208;34 and IAPP20&#8208;29) with all residues as L&#8208; or all D&#8208;enantiomer in self and cross&#8208;seeding experiments with low enough seed concentration that any acceleration of fibril formation is dominated by secondary nucleation. We find a strong enantio&#8208;specificity of this auto&#8208;catalytic process with secondary nucleation being observed in the self&#8208;seeding experiments only. The results highlight a role of secondary nucleation in strain propagation.</dc:description>

         <title>An innovative approach for the generation of species of the interstellar medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high amount of unstable species in the realm of interstellar chemistry drives an urgent need to develop efficient methods for the in situ generations of molecules that enable their spectroscopic characterizations. Such laboratory experiments are fundamental to decode the molecular universe by matching the interstellar and terrestrial spectra. In the present work, we propose a novel approach based on laser ablation of nonvolatile solid organic precursors. The chemical species generated in the laser ablation process are cooled in a supersonic expansion and probed by eyes of high&#8208;resolution microwave spectroscopy. We present a proof of concept through a simultaneous formation of an impressive inventory of interstellar compounds and the first generation of aminocyanoacetylene using diaminomaleonitrile as a prototypical precursor. With this "micro&#8208;laboratory" in hands, we open the doors toward the generation of unsuspected species using precursors not typically accessible to traditional techniques such as electric discharge and pyrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2,2&#8208;Difluorotetrahydrofurans through Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [3 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The asymmetric synthesis of 2,2&#8208;difluorinated tetrahydrofurans was accomplished via enantioselective formal [3 + 2] cycloaddition catalyzed by palladium. The asymmetric reaction between gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and racemic vinyl epoxides or vinylethylene carbonates resulted in the formation of enantioenriched 2,2&#8208;difluorotetrahydrofurans with an enantioselectivity up to 98%. Notably, the reaction used the readily available (R)&#8208;BINAP as the ligand at a low loading and yielded a wide variety of difluorinated products in moderate to high yields. Both chiral diastereomers could be obtained in a single sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Printed Nanochain&#8208;based Colorimetric Assay for Quantitative Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast and ultrasensitive detection of pathogens is very important for efficient monitoring and prevention of viral infections. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free optical detection approach that uses a printed nanochain assay for colorimetric quantitative testing of viruses. The antibody&#8208;modified nanochains have high activity and specificity which can rapidly identify target viruses directly from biofluids in 15 min, as well as differentiate their subtypes. Arising from the resonance induced near&#8208;field enhancement, the color of nanochains changes with the binding of viruses that are easily observed by a smartphone. We achieve the detection limit of ~ 1 PFU &#956;L  &#8208;1  through optimizing the optical response of nanochains in visible region. Besides, it allows for real&#8208;time response to virus concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0 x 10  5  PFU mL  &#8208;1  . This low&#8208;cost and portable platform is also applicable to rapid detection of other biomarkers, making it attractive for many clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;modulated cationic and anionic transport across protein biopolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light is a convenient source of energy and the heart of light&#8208;harvesting natural systems and devices. Here, we show light&#8208;modulation of both the chemical nature and ionic charge carrier concentration within a protein&#8208;based biopolymer that was covalently functionalized with photoacids or photobases. We explore the capability of the biopolymer&#8208;tethered photoacids and photobases to undergo excited&#8208;state proton transfer and capture, respectively. Electrical measurements show that both the photoacid&#8208; and photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymers exhibit an impressive light&#8208;modulated increase in ionic conductivity. Whereas cationic protons are the charge carriers for the photoacid&#8208;functionalized biopolymer, water&#8208;derived anionic hydroxides are the suggested charge carriers for the photobase&#8208;functionalized biopolymer. Our work introduces a versatile toolbox to light&#8208;modulate charge carriers in polymers of both positive protons and negative hydroxides, which can be of interest for a variety of applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Matrix Assisted Low&#8208;temperature Crystallization of Black Phase Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;inorganic perovskites with comparable optoelectronic properties but improved intrinsic stability to organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted increasing amount of attention over years for applicational advances in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and various optoelectronics including light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs). Cesium lead halide perovskites of tunable I/Br ratio that possess bandgap aligning with the sunlight region are promising candidates for PSC. As impressive progress has been made on fabrication methods with device efficiency improved from the initial 2.9% with low phase stability to over 20% with high stability, there still are many on&#8208;going discussions regarding the perovskite crystal growth mechanism, especially at low temperatures with the assistance of external factors. In this review, we summary recent developments of using organic matrix, including the addition and usage of organic ions, polymers and solvent molecules to achieve the crystallization of black phase inorganic perovskites at temperatures lower than the phase transition point. Secondly, we discuss the possible mechanisms of this low&#8208;temperature crystallization and their effects on the stability of black phase perovskites. In the end, we outlook and perspective a more comprehensive understanding that can help with further development of fabricating large&#8208;scale inorganic perovskite for optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering fluorophore recycling in a fluorogenic RNA aptamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorogenic aptamers can potentially show minimal photobleaching during continuous irradiation since any photobleached fluorophore can exchange with fluorescent dyes in the media. However,&#160;fluorophores have not been designed to maximize &#8220;fluorophore recycling.&#8221;&#160;Here we describe TBI, a novel fluorophore for the Broccoli fluorogenic aptamer. Previous fluorophores either fail to rapidly dissociate when they undergo photobleaching via&#160;cis&#160;&#8208;&#160;trans&#160;isomerization, or bind slowly, resulting in extended periods after dissociation of the photobleached fluorophore when no fluorophore is bound. By contrast, photobleached TBI dissociates rapidly from Broccoli, and TBI from the media rapidly replaces dissociated photobleached fluorophore. Using TBI, Broccoli exhibits markedly enhanced fluorescence in cells during continuous imaging. These data show that designing fluorophores to optimize fluorophore recycling can lead to enhanced fluorescence of fluorogenic aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling Hydrocarbon Pool Boosted Propane Aromatization on Gallium/ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Propane aromatization on metal&#8208;modified zeolites provides a promising route to produce valuable chemicals such as benzene, toluene and xylene via non&#8208;petroleum feedstocks. The mechanistic understanding of propane conversion to aromatics is still challenging due to the complexity of the aromatization process. Herein, by using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS, it is shown that cyclopentenyl cations are formed as active intermediates during propane aromatization on Ga/ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite. Autocatalysis of propane to aromatics is identified in the induction period. The cyclopentenyl cations serve as key hydrocarbon pool species to co&#8208;catalyze propane conversion and promote aromatics formation, revealing a dominant hydrocarbon pool process in propane aromatization.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Molecular Robot Autonomously Walking on the Cell Membrane to Drive the Cell Motility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthetic molecular robot can execute sophisticated molecular tasks at nanometer resolution. However, a molecular robot capable of controlling cellular behavior remains unexplored. Herein, we report a self&#8208;propelled DNA robot operating on the cell membrane to control a cell to migrate. Driven by DNAzyme catalytic activity, the DNA robot could autonomously and stepwise locomote on the membrane&#8208;floating cell&#8208;surface receptors in a stochastic manner, simultaneously trigger the receptor&#8208;dimerization to activate downstream signaling for cell motility. The cell membrane&#8208;associated continuous motion&#8208;and&#8208;operation of a DNA robot allowed for the ultrasensitive regulation of MET/AKT signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling to enhance cell migration. Finally, we designed distinct conditional DNA robots to orthogonally manipulate the cell migration in a coculture of mixed cell populations. Together, we have developed a novel strategy to engineer a cell&#8208;driving molecular robot, representing a promising avenue for precise cell manipulation with nanoscale resolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Recovery of the Irreversible Crystallinity of Nanocellulose by Crystallite Fusion: A Strategy for Achieving Efficient Energy Transfers in Sustainable Biopolymer Skeletons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallites form a grain boundary or the inter&#8208;crystallite interface. A grain boundary is a structural defect that hinders the efficient directional transfer of mechanical stress or thermal phonons in crystal aggregates. We observed that grain boundaries within an aggregate of crystalline cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) were crystallized by enhancing their inter&#8208;crystallite interactions; multiple crystallites were coupled into single fusion crystals, without passing through a melting or dissolving state. Accordingly, the lowered crystallinity of CNFs, which has been considered irreversible, was recovered, and the thermal energy transfer in the aggregate was significantly improved. Other nanofibrous crystallites of chitin also showed a similar fusion phenomenon by enhancing the inter&#8208;crystallite interactions. Such crystallite fusion may naturally occur in biological structures with network skeletons of aggregated fibrillar crystallites having mechanical or thermal functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Asymmetric Cyclopropanations via Enzyme&#8208;bound Iminium Ion Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclopropane rings are an important structural motif frequently found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals. Commonly, biocatalytic methodologies for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropanes rely on repurposed or artificial heme enzymes. Here, we engineered an unusual cofactor&#8208;independent cyclopropanation enzyme based on a promiscuous tautomerase for the enantioselective synthesis of various cyclopropanes via the nucleophilic addition of diethyl 2chloromalonate to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes. The engineered enzyme promotes formation of the two new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds with excellent stereocontrol over both stereocenters, affording the desired cyclopropanes with high diastereo&#8208; and enantiopurity (d.r. up to 25:1; e.r. up to 99:1). Our results highlight the usefulness of promiscuous enzymes for expanding the biocatalytic repertoire for non&#8208;natural reactions.</dc:description>

Our results highlight the usefulness of promiscuous enzymes for expanding the biocatalytic repertoire for non-natural reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow Metal Sulfides via Cation Exchange Reactions for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we explore a general Cu  2&#8208;x  S nanocube template&#8208;assisted and   reverse  cation exchange&#8208;mediated growth strategy for fabricating  hollow multinary metal sulfide  . Impressively, different from the traditional cation exchange method controlled by the metal sulfide constant, the introduction of tri&#8208;n&#8208;butylphosphine (TBP) can reverse cation exchange to obtain a series of hollow metal sulfides. A variety of hollow multinary metal sulfide cubic nanostructure has been demonstrated while preserving anisotropic shapes to the as&#8208;synthesized templates, including binary compounds (CdS, ZnS, Ag  2  S, PbS, SnS), ternary compound (CuInS  2  , Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S), and quaternary compound (  single&#8208;atom platinum anchored  Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S; Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S&#8208;Pt  1  ). Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the hollow metal sulfide semiconductor obtained by stepwise reverse cation exchange can significantly improve the separation and migration of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs. Owing to the efficient charge transfer, the Zn  x  Cd  1&#8208;x  S&#8208;Pt  1  exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance of CO  2  to CO, with the highest CO generation rate of 75.31&#8239;&#956;mol h  &#8722;1. Collectively, these versatile post&#8208;synthetic techniques demonstrate the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of sequential reverse cation exchange reactions to controllably access a vast variety of previously intractable hollow compositions for photocatalysis and another energy catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral TADF&#8208;Active Polymers for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy of chiral donor&#8208;acceptor copolymerization is proposed to develop chiral nonconjugated polymers with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Based on this strategy, two pairs of chiral polymers (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;/(  S  ,  S  )&#8208;  pTpAcDPS  and (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;/(  S  ,  S  )&#8208;  pTpAcBP  were synthesized. The alternating copolymerization of the chiral donors and acceptors could effectively separate the frontier molecular orbitals, which made the polymers show small &#916;  E  ST  of 0.01&#8208;0.03 eV and efficient TADF properties. Moreover, the polymers also showed the quantum yield of up to 92% and the circularly polarized luminescence. The solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes showed circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with high external quantum efficiencies of up to 22.1% and maximum luminance of up to 34350 cd m  &#8208;2  . This is the first report of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral TADF polymer, which provides a useful and valuable guidance for the development of high&#8208;efficiency CPEL polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Selective Photolysis of Phosphonium Iodide Salts for Monofluoromethylations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sigma (&#963;)&#8208;hole effect has emerged as a promising tool to construct novel architectures endowed with new properties. A simple yet effective strategy for the generation of monofluoromethyl radical is a continuing challenge within the synthetic community. Flu&#8208;oromethylphosphonium salts are easily available, air&#8208; and thermally&#8208;stable, as well as simple&#8208;to&#8208;handle. Herein, we report the ability of &#963;&#8208;hole effect to facilitate the visible light&#8208;triggered photolysis of phosphonium iodide salts, a charge transfer complex, selectively giving fluoromethyl radicals. The usefulness and versatility of this new protocol are demonstrated through the mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trifluoro&#8208;methylation of a variety of alkenes.</dc:description>
