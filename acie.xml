         <title>Crystalline 2&#960; Aromatic Azadiboriridinylium: A&#160;BN Analogue of Cyclopropenylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Substitution of a thermally unstable diboratriazole 1 with a trimethylsilyl group affords a remarkably stable diboratriazole derivative 2. Ring contraction of 2 with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene accompanied by the release of N2 as well as 1,4&#8208;hydrogen shift affords a carbene&#8208;stabilized azadiboriridine 3. Abstraction of the H&#8210;B3mem hydride in 3 with methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate leads to the isolation of a hitherto unknown azadiboriridinylium 4, the first BN analogue of cyclopropenylium cation. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies confirmed the delocalization of &#960; electrons over the B2N three&#8208;membered ring, indicating the 2&#960; aromatic feature. Compound 4 undergoes ring expansion reactions with azobenzene and pyridazine to furnish triazadiborolidinylium species 5 and 6, the latter of which possesses a cationic B2N3 ring with a pronounced 6&#960; aromatic property. Moreover, the reaction of 4 with a diazo compound produces a cationic B2N3C pentafulvene derivative 7.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of a Metal&#8208;Organic Polymer for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion and Zinc Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;based materials are promising single&#8208;site catalysts for electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8211;) reduction to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) on account of well&#8208;defined structures and functional tunability but still lack a molecular&#8208;level understanding for designing the high&#8208;efficient catalysts. Here, we proposed a molecular engineering strategy to enhance electrochemical NO3&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion by introducing the carbonyl groups into 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetraaminobenzene (BTA) based metal&#8208;organic polymer to precisely modulate the electronic state of metal centers. Due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing properties of the carbonyl group, metal centers can be converted to an electron&#8208;deficient state, fascinating the NO3&#8211; adsorption and promoting continuous hydrogenation reactions to produce NH3. Compared to CuBTA with a low NO3&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion efficiency of 85.1%, quinone group functionalization endows the resulting copper tetraminobenzoquinone (CuTABQ) distinguished performance with a much higher NH3 FE of 97.7%. This molecular engineering strategy is also universal, as verified by the improved NO3&#8211;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion performance on different metal centers, including Co and Ni. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8211; battery based on CuTABQ cathode can deliver a high power density of 12.3 mW&#8201;cm&#8211;2.This work provides advanced insights into the rational design of metal complex catalysts through the molecular&#8208;level regulation for NO3&#8211; electroreduction to value&#8208;added NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;based Superlattice with Fe(III)&#8208;regulable Bandgap and Performance for Optimal and Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Chemotherapy Guided by Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superlattices have considerable potential as sonosensitisers for cancer therapy because of their flexible and tunable bandgaps, although they have not yet been reported. In this study, a Ti&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic superlattice with good electron&#8211;hole separation was synthesised, which consisted of orderly layered superlattices of 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5'&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDC) and Ti&#8208;O layers. In addition, the superlattice was coordinated with Fe(III) and encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) to prepare Ti&#8208;BPDC@Fe@DOX@PEG (TFDP) after biocompatibility modification. TFDP can realise the simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and release of DOX under ultrasound irradiation. Moreover, adjusting the Fe(III) content can effectively modulate the bandgap of the superlattice and increase the efficiency of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The mechanisms underlying this modulation were explored. TFDP with Fe(III) can also be used as a contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the ability of TFDP to precisely treat cancer using MRI&#8208;guided SDT/chemotherapy. This study expands the applications of superlattices as sonosensitisers with flexible and tailored modifications and indicates that superlattices are promising for precise and customised treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Origami&#8208;based Bactericide for Efficient Healing of Infected Wounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide with precisely organized bacterial membrane breaker (DNAzymes, G4/hemin) and abundantly loaded broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic (levofloxacin) was constructed for the efficient healing of infected wounds under the guidance of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan.







Abstract
Bacteria infection is a significant obstacle in the clinical treatment of exposed wounds facing widespread pathogens. Herein, we report a DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide for efficient anti&#8208;infection therapy of infected wounds in vivo. In our design, abundant DNAzymes (G4/hemin) can be precisely organized on the DNA origami for controllable generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to break bacterial membranes. After the destruction of the membrane, broad&#8208;spectrum antibiotic levofloxacin (LEV, loaded in the DNA origami through interaction with DNA duplex) can be easily delivered into the bacteria for successful sterilization. With the incorporation of DNA aptamer targeting bacterial peptidoglycan, the DNA origami&#8208;based bactericide can achieve targeted and combined antibacterial therapy for efficiently promoting the healing of infected wounds. This tailored DNA origami&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases in vivo.

         <title>Metamorphosis of a Commodity Plastic like PVC to Efficient Catalytic Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complementary concept of polymeric waste valorization (upcycling) through metamorphosis in &#8220;green&#8221; media of an out&#8208;of&#8208;use piece of a daily life commodity plastic like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to &#8220;valorized&#8221; PVC single&#8208;chain nanoparticles&#8212;useful as recyclable / metalloenzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst for Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations&#8212;is reported.







Abstract
We perform the conversion of a commodity plastic of common use in pipes, window frames, medical devices, flexible hoses, etc. like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) to single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs). SCNPs are versatile, protein&#8208;mimetic soft nano&#8208;objects of growing interest for catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine, among other uses. We demonstrate that the metamorphosis process &#8208;as induced through metal&#8208;free click chemistry&#8208; leads to well&#8208;defined, uniform SCNPs that are stable during storage in the solid state for months. All the conversion process (from PVC isolation to PVC&#8208;SCNPs synthesis) can be run in a green, dipolar aprotic solvent and involving, when required, a simple mixture of ethanol and water (1/1&#8197;vol.) as non&#8208;solvent. The resulting PVC&#8208;SCNPs are investigated as recyclable, metalloenzyme&#8208;mimetic catalysts for several representative Cu(II)&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions. The method could be valid for the metamorphosis and valorization of other commodity plastics in which it is feasible to install azide functional groups in their linear polymer chains.

         <title>Mechanical effects of elastic crystals driven by natural sunlight and force</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flexible crystals that can capture solar energy and convert it into mechanical energy are promising for a wide range of applications in areas such as information storage, and actuators, but obtaining them remains a challenge. Herein, the elastic crystal of a barbiturate derivative was found to be an excellent candidate, and showed plastic bending behavior under natural sunlight irradiation. 1H NMR and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrum data of the microcrystals before and after light irradiation demonstrated that the light&#8208;induced [2+2] cycloaddition was the driving force for the photomechanical effects. Interestingly, the crystals remained well elastic properties after light irradiation. This is the first reported crystal that can be driven by natural sunlight, and has both photomechanical properties and elasticity. Furthermore, we could regulate the passive light output direction of the crystals and transport objects by applying mechanical forces and light.</dc:description>

         <title>An Oxysulfide Photocatalyst Evolving Hydrogen with an Apparent Quantum Efficiency of 30&#8201;% under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces loaded with ultrafine composite cocatalyst particles evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is a simple means of converting solar energy into storable hydrogen energy. Narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalysts have attracted much attention in this regard owing to the significant visible&#8208;light absorption and relatively high stability of these compounds. However, existing materials suffer from low efficiencies due to difficulties in synthesizing these oxysulfides with suitable degrees of crystallinity and particle sizes, and in constructing effective reaction sites. The present work demonstrates the production of a Gd2Ti2O5S2 (&#955;&lt;650&#8197;nm) photocatalyst capable of efficiently driving photocatalytic reactions. Single&#8208;crystalline, plate&#8208;like Gd2Ti2O5S2 particles with atomically ordered surfaces were synthesized by flux and chemical etching methods. Ultrafine Pt&#8208;IrO2 cocatalyst particles that promoted hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) evolution reactions were subsequently loaded on the Gd2Ti2O5S2 while ensuring an intimate contact by employing a microwave&#8208;heating technique. The optimized Gd2Ti2O5S2 was found to evolve H2 from an aqueous methanol solution with a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 30&#8201;% at 420&#8197;nm. This material was also stable during O2 evolution in the presence of a sacrificial reagent. The results presented herein demonstrates a highly efficient narrow&#8208;band gap oxysulfide photocatalyst with potential applications in practical solar hydrogen production.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Distribution&#8208;Directed Regioselective Substitution Strategy for Highly Stable Olympicenyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed protection&#8211;oxidation&#8211;protection (P&#8722;O&#8722;P) strategy was developed for olympicenyl radical, which resulted in a series of highly stable &#960;&#8208;radicals. The substitution on the periphery exerted a substantial influence on the crystal packing, leading to the first stable field&#8208;effect transistor based on graphenic radicals.







Abstract
The synthesis of bench&#8208;stable conjugated &#960;&#8208;radicals is challenging owing to the lack of modular approaches, which greatly hampers their practical material screens and applications. Here, we demonstrate a spin&#8208;distribution&#8208;directed regioselective substitution strategy to introduce substituents into the specific positions of an olympicenyl radical in a stepwise manner, resulting in a series of highly stable radical species. The substituents can also adjust the crystal packing by means of steric and electronic factors, enabling the changing from a &#960;&#8208;dimer to a pseudo&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional chain. The first single crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device based on a graphenic radical is fabricated in air, showing a hole mobility of up to 0.021&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and excellent device stability. This approach may be generalized to diverse spin&#8208;delocalized open&#8208;shell organic radicals.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activating Biomimetic Polyoxomolybdate for Boosting Oxygen Evolution in Neutral Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;transfer photochromism is used to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, providing an innovative design concept for the development of non&#8208;precious metal OER catalysts in artificial photosynthesis devices.







Abstract
Inspired by the metal&#8208;oxo cluster structural feature and charge separation behaviour of the oxygen evolving center (OEC) in photosystem II (PS&#8208;II) under photoirradiation, a new crystalline photochromic polyoxomolybdate, MV2[&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26] (1, MV=methyl viologen cation), is designed as a biomimetic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst in neutral electrolytes. After photoinduced electron transfer (PIET) with colour change from colourless to grey, it remains in an ultra&#8208;stable charge&#8208;separated state over a year under ambient conditions. The observed overpotential at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope decrease by 49&#8197;mV and 62.8&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1 after coloration, respectively. The outstanding OER performance of the coloured state in neutral electrolytes even outperforms the commercial RuO2 benchmark. Experimental and theoretical studies show that oxygen holes within polyanions after irradiation serve as sites for enhancing direct O&#8722;O coupling, thus effectively promoting OER. This is the first successful application of electron&#8208;transfer photochromism to realize OER activity gain.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Cylindrocyclophanes A and F and Merocyclophanes A and D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cylindrocyclophanes A and F and merocyclophanes A and D were synthesized by a chemoenzymatic approach. The synthesis features an enzymatic Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, reagent&#8208;controlled lithiation&#8211;borylation chemistry, cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration, and Ni&#8208; or Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkyl&#8211;alkyl cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
Incorporating enzymatic reactions into natural product synthesis can significantly improve synthetic efficiency and selectivity. In contrast to the increasing applications of biocatalytic functional&#8208;group interconversions, the use of enzymatic C&#8722;C bond formation reactions in natural product synthesis is underexplored. Herein, we report a concise and efficient approach for the synthesis of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products, a family of polyketides with diverse biological activities. By using enzymatic Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation, cylindrocyclophanes A and F and merocyclophanes A and D were synthesized in six to eight steps in the longest linear sequence. This study demonstrates the power of combining enzymatic reactions with contemporary synthetic methodologies and provides opportunities for the structure&#8211;activity relationship studies of [7.7]paracyclophane natural products.

We demonstrated a versatile &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier to efficiently expel free water molecules from IHP. Benefiting from the well&#8208;tailored ligand chelation engineering and the non&#8208;consumable nature of TPPS, the as&#8208;developed Zn||MnO2 full battery with TPPS exhibited enhanced reversible capacity and extended cyclability with negligible H2 evolution compared with cells using pristine ZnSO4 electrolyte.







Abstract
The sustained water consumption and uncontrollable dendrite growth strongly hamper the practical applications of rechargeable zinc (Zn) metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate that trace amount of chelate ligand additive can serve as a &#8220;molecular sieve&#8208;like&#8221; interfacial barrier and achieve highly efficient Zn plating/stripping. As verified by theoretical modeling and experimental investigations, the benzenesulfonic acid groups on the additive molecular not only facilitates its water solubility and selective adsorption on the Zn anode, but also effectively accelerates the de&#8208;solvation kinetics of Zn2+. Meanwhile, the central porphyrin ring on the chelate ligand effectively expels free water molecules from Zn2+ via chemical binding against hydrogen evolution, and reversibly releases the captured Zn2+ to endow a dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. By virtue of this non&#8208;consumable additive, high average Zn plating/stripping efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% over 2100&#8197;cycles together with extended lifespan and suppressed water decomposition in the Zn||MnO2 full battery were achieved, thus opening a new avenue for developing highly durable ZMBs.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation Activity&#8208;Stability Maps for Perovskite Oxides Containing 3d, 4d and 5d Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activity&#8208;stability maps toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are experimentally created for a family of 66&#8197;SrTixRuyIrzO3 perovskite oxides. The effects of hybridization of mixed transition metal 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d and oxygen 2p orbitals on catalytic activity, stability and mechanism are discussed.







Abstract
Improving catalytic activity without loss of catalytic stability is one of the core goals in search of low&#8208;iridium&#8208;content oxygen evolution electrocatalysts under acidic conditions. Here, we synthesize a family of 66&#8197;SrBO3 perovskite oxides (B=Ti, Ru, Ir) with different Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Ru&#8201;:&#8201;Ir atomic ratios and construct catalytic activity&#8208;stability maps over composition variation. The maps classify the multicomponent perovskites into chemical groups with distinct catalytic activity and stability for acidic oxygen evolution reaction, and highlights a chemical region where high catalytic activity and stability are achieved simultaneously at a relatively low iridium level. By quantifying the extent of hybridization of mixed transition metal 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d and oxygen 2p orbitals for multicomponent perovskites, we demonstrate this complex interplay between 3d&#8208;4d&#8208;5d metals and oxygen atoms in governing the trends in both activity and stability as well as in determining the catalytic mechanism involving lattice oxygen or not.

         <title>Bioactive Luminescent Silver Clusters Confined in Zeolites Enable Quick and Wash&#8208;Free Biosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibody&#8208;functionalized zeolites embedding photoluminescent silver clusters offer simultaneous capture and detection of biomolecules since immunocomplex formation triggers fluorometric enhancement in the explored biohybrid. This simple biosensing concept will open the way to innovative miniaturized and portable bioanalytical platforms.







Abstract
The simultaneous capture and detection of biomolecules is crucial for revolutionizing bioanalytical platforms in terms of portability, response time and cost&#8208;efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate how the sensitivity to external stimuli and changes in the local electronic environment of silver clusters lead to an advantageous biosensing platform based on the fluorometric response of bioactive luminescent silver clusters (BioLuSiC) confined in faujasite X zeolites functionalized with antibodies. The photoluminescence response of BioLuSiC was enhanced upon immunocomplex formation, empowering a wash&#8208;free and quick biodetection system offering optimal results from 5&#8197;min. Proteins and pathogens (immunoglobulin G and Escherichia coli) were targeted to demonstrate the biosensing performance of BioLuSiC, and a human serum titration assay was also established. BioLuSiC will pave the way for innovative bioanalytical platforms, including real&#8208;time monitoring systems, point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices and bioimaging techniques.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Stereogenic Phosphanyl Hydrazine Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the first asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic phosphanyl hydrazines via nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition of primary phosphines to azo compounds. We anticipate that the remarkable versatility of these P&#8208;stereogenic secondary aminophosphines will facilitate the facile synthesis of both previously known and novel P&#8208;stereogenic compounds.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of synthetically versatile P&#8208;stereogenic building blocks offer an efficient and practical approach for the diversity&#8208;oriented preparation of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds. Herein, we report the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic secondary aminophosphine&#8208;boranes by the asymmetric addition of primary phosphines to azo compounds. We further demonstrate that the P&#8722;H and P&#8722;N bonds on these phosphanyl hydrazine building blocks can be reacted sequentially and stereospecifically to access various P&#8208;stereogenic compounds with structural diversity.

         <title>Correlation of Broad Absorption Band with Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gap in Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors were developed by tailoring the side&#8208;group conjugation length. They show simultaneously broadened short&#8208;wavelength absorption band and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap. The relevant solar cells deliver a high efficiency of 18.5&#8201;% as processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvent, among the highest value for solar cells processed by green solvent and based on new acceptor structures.







Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) are one of the most effective ways to harvest renewable solar energy, with the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices soaring above 19&#8201;% when processed with halogenated solvents. The superior photocurrent of OPV over other emerging photovoltaics offers more opportunities to further improve the efficiency. Tailoring the absorption band of photoactive materials is an effective way to further enhance OPV photocurrent. However, the field has mostly been focusing on improving the near&#8208;infrared region photo&#8208;response, with the absorption shoulders in short&#8208;wavelength region (SWR) usually being neglected. Herein, by developing a series of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with varied side&#8208;group conjugations, we observe an enhanced SWR absorption band with increased side&#8208;group conjugation length. The underpinning factors of how molecular structures and geometries improve SWR absorption are clearly elucidated through theoretical modelling and crystallography. Moreover, a clear relationship between the enhanced SWR absorption and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is established, both of which are favorable for the OPV performance and can be tailored by rational structure design of NFAs. Finally, the rationally designed NFA, BO&#8208;TTBr, affords a decent PCE of 18.5&#8201;% when processed with a non&#8208;halogenated green solvent.

The structurally elusive cyclotriphosphazene (P3N3, 1), an inorganic aromatic analogue of benzene, has been synthesized by scanning probe manipulation and visually inspected by high&#8208;resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM).







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is at the verge of emerging as the method of choice for the generation and visualization of unstable or unconventional molecules, which could not be obtained via traditional synthetic methods. A case in point is the on&#8208;surface synthesis of the structurally elusive cyclotriphosphazene (P3N3), an inorganic aromatic analogue of benzene. Here, we report the preparation of this fleetingly existing species on Cu(111) and Au(111) surfaces at 5.2&#8197;K through molecular manipulation with unprecedented precision, i.e., voltage pulse&#8208;induced sextuple dechlorination of an ultra&#8208;small (about 6&#8197;&#197;) hexachlorophosphazene P3N3Cl6 precursor by the tip of a scanning probe microscope. Real&#8208;space atomic&#8208;level imaging of cyclotriphosphazene reveals its planar D3h&#8208;symmetric ring structure. Furthermore, this demasking strategy has been expanded to generate cyclotriphosphazene from a hexaazide precursor P3N21 via a different stimulation method (photolysis) for complementary measurements by matrix isolation infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy.

         <title>Tuning Binding Strength of Multiple Intermediates towards Efficient pH&#8208;universal Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution by Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy Heterocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective and stable Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy heterocatalysts are synthesized for pH&#8208;universal electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The O&#8208;exposed Mo8O26 clusters covalently confined on NbNxOy nanodomains provide a distinctive interface configuration and appropriate electronic structure, which regulates the binding strength of multiple intermediates, thereby accelerating the entire HER kinetics.







Abstract
Developing efficient and robust hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for scalable and sustainable hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting is strategic and challenging. Herein, heterogeneous Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy supported on N&#8208;doped graphene (defined as Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy/NG) is synthesized by controllable hydrothermal reaction and nitridation process. The O&#8208;exposed Mo8O26 clusters covalently confined on NbNxOy nanodomains provide a distinctive interface configuration and appropriate electronic structure, where fully exposed multiple active sites give excellent HER performance beyond commercial Pt/C catalyst in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes. Theoretical studies reveal that the Mo8O26&#8208;NbNxOy interface with electronic reconstruction affords near&#8208;optimal hydrogen adsorption energy and enhanced initial H2O adsorption. Furthermore, the terminal O atoms in Mo8O26 clusters cooperate with Nb atoms to promote the initial H2O adsorption, and subsequently reduce the H2O dissociation energy, accelerating the entire HER kinetics.

         <title>The Molecular Basis of Catalysis by SDR Family Members Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabG and Enoyl&#8208;ACP Reductase FabI in Type&#8208;II Fatty Acid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct substrate allosteric recognition and reduction catalytic mechanisms of ketoacyl&#8208;ACP reductase FabG and enoyl&#8208;ACP reductase FabI in Type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthesis are reported. The enzymes use alternative catalytic tunnels and core catalytic triads to recognize different ACP, NAD(P)H and fatty acid substrates for asymmetric reduction catalysis.







Abstract
The short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily members acyl&#8208;ACP reductases FabG and FabI are indispensable core enzymatic modules and catalytic orientation controllers in type&#8208;II fatty acid biosynthesis. Herein, we report their distinct substrate allosteric recognition and enantioselective reduction mechanisms. FabG achieves allosteric regulation of ACP and NADPH through ACP binding across two adjacent FabG monomers, while FabI follows an irreversible compulsory order of substrate binding in that NADH binding must precede that of ACP on a discrete FabI monomer. Moreover, FabG and FabI utilize a backdoor residue Phe187 or a &#8220;rheostat&#8221; &#945;8 helix for acyl chain length selection, and their corresponding triad residues Ser142 or Tyr145 recognize the keto&#8208; or enoyl&#8208;acyl substrates, respectively, facilitating initiation of nucleophilic attack by NAD(P)H. The other two triad residues (Tyr and Lys) mediate subsequent proton transfer and (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyacyl&#8208; or saturated acyl&#8208;ACP production.

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;Boosted Kinetic and Selective Molecular Sieving of C6 Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine can improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes, leading to a significant kinetic selectivity for benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Porous molecular sorbents have excellent selectivity towards hydrocarbon separation with energy saving techniques. However, to realize commercialization, molecular sieving processes should be faster and more efficient compared to extended frameworks. In this work, we show that utilizing fluorine to improve the hydrophobic profile of leaning pillararenes affords a substantial kinetic selective adsorption of benzene over cyclohexane (20&#8201;:&#8201;1 for benzene). The crystal structure shows a porous macrocycle that acts as a perfect match for benzene in both the intrinsic and extrinsic cavities with strong interactions in the solid state. The fluorinated leaning pillararene surpasses all reported organic molecular sieves and is comparable to the extended metal&#8211;organic frameworks that were previously employed for this separation such as UIO&#8208;66. Most importantly, this sieving system outperformed the well&#8208;known zeolitic imidazolate frameworks under low pressure, which opens the door to new generations of molecular sieves that can compete with extended frameworks for more sustainable hydrocarbon separation.

         <title>Enantioconvergent Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkylation of Tertiary Allylic C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular enantioconvergent alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds provides facile access to a range of enantioenriched allylic compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. The deracemization has been accomplished through a rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the obtained E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species markedly regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2&#8242;&#8208;allylation pathway.







Abstract
Enantioconvergent catalysis enables the conversion of racemic molecules into a single enantiomer in perfect yield and is considered an ideal approach for asymmetric synthesis. Despite remarkable advances in this field, enantioconvergent transformations of inert tertiary C&#8722;H bonds remain largely unexplored due to the high bond dissociation energy and the surrounding steric repulsion that pose unparalleled constraints on bond cleavage and formation. Here, we report an enantioconvergent Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkylation of racemic tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds of &#945;&#8208;alkenes, providing a unique approach to access a broad range of enantioenriched &#947;,&#948;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds featuring quaternary carbon stereocenters. Mechanistic studies reveal that a stereoablative event occurs through the rate&#8208;limiting cleavage of tertiary allylic C&#8722;H bonds to generate &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species, and the achieved E/Z&#8208;selectivity of &#963;&#8208;allyl&#8208;Pd species effectively regulates the diastereoselectivity via a nucleophile coordination&#8208;enabled SN2&#8242;&#8208;allylation pathway.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Polymerization of a Bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycle into a Brick&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle forms in bulk columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline phases, while in chlorinated solvents it self&#8208;assembles into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets with a brick&#8208;like organization. This exotic 2D assembly is enabled by solvent effects and a sophisticated hydrogen&#8208;bonding pattern, where each monomer interacts with four vicinal macrocycles only through urea&#8208;urea interactions.







Abstract
We report on a dendronized bis&#8208;urea macrocycle 1 self&#8208;assembling via a cooperative mechanism into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets formed solely by alternated urea&#8208;urea hydrogen bonding interactions. The pure macrocycle self&#8208;assembles in bulk into one&#8208;dimensional liquid&#8208;crystalline columnar phases. In contrast, its self&#8208;assembly mode drastically changes in CHCl3 or tetrachloroethane, leading to 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks. Theoretical calculations, complemented by previously reported crystalline structures, indicate that the 2D assembly is formed by a brick&#8208;like hydrogen bonding pattern between bis&#8208;urea macrocycles. This assembly is promoted by the swelling of the trisdodecyloxyphenyl groups upon solvation, which frustrates, due to steric effects, the formation of the thermodynamically more stable columnar macrocycle stacks. This work proposes a new design strategy to access 2D supramolecular polymers by means of a single non&#8208;covalent interaction motif, which is of great interest for materials development.

         <title>A Negatively Curved &#960;&#8208;Expanded Pyracylene Comprising a Tropylium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negatively curved pyracylene scaffolds with an incorporated 7&#8208;membered ring were synthesized by progressive &#960;&#8208;expansion. The embedded tropone unit allowed facile generation of the aromatic tropylium cation, which displays considerable stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption, and characteristic structural features in the solid state.







Abstract
We disclose &#960;&#8208;expanded pyracylenes and their cationic species comprising 7&#8208;membered rings. The compounds were synthesized by stepwise oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to monitor the effect of successive cyclization on the structural and optoelectronic properties. As shown by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the complete cyclization leads to a boat&#8208;shaped scaffold featuring negative curvature provided by the 7&#8208;membered ring. The embedded tropone unit enabled the convenient generation of a stabilized tropylium cation, showing bathochromically shifted absorption bands reaching into the near&#8208;infrared region beyond 1000&#8197;nm. The altered structural features, supported by theoretical calculations, point towards the positively charged 7&#8208;membered ring having aromatic character.

         <title>Achiral Dichroic Dyes&#8208;mediated Circularly Polarized Emission Regulated by Orientational Order Parameter through Cholesteric Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy was developed for regulating circularly polarized luminescence performance by increasing the order parameter value of achiral dichroic dye in cholesteric liquid crystal media without changing the helical superstructure. Additionally, the circularly polarized luminescence and fluorescence intensity response (contrast ratio) was also improved as the order parameter value increased under the DC electric field. Efficient encryption could be achieved by modulating the structure of achiral dichroic dyes in cholesteric liquid crystals.







Abstract
It is noteworthy that cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) platforms have been witnessed in high&#8208;performance circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) behaviors through the highly organized chiral co&#8208;assembled arrangement of achiral dyes. However, most CPL&#8208;active design strategies are closely relative to the helix co&#8208;assembly structure of CLC rather than achiral dyes. Herein, we developed an intriguing regulation strategy for CPL&#8208;active CLC materials. They were regulated using the orientational order parameter (SF) of achiral dichroic dyes as an incisive probe for the order arrangement degree of achiral dyes in CLC media. The I&#8208;shaped phenothiazine derivative PHECN dye (SF=0.30) emitted a strong CPL signal (|glum|=0.47). In contrast, the T&#8208;shaped derivative (PHEBen) dye (SF=0.09) showed a weak circular polarization level (|glum|=0.07) at similar CLC textures. Most interestingly, this kind of dichroic PHECN dye with a higher SF could greatly improve the contrast ratio of CPL (&#916;glum=0.47) and emission intensity (&#916;FL=46.0&#8201;%) at direct&#8208;current electric field compared with the T&#8208;shaped PHEBen (&#916;glum=0.07 and &#916;FL=1.0&#8201;%) in CLC. This work demonstrates that an induced CPL emission can be mediated using achiral dichroic dye, which will open a new avenue for developing excellent CPL&#8208;active display materials.

         <title>Photoswitchable and Reversible Fluorescent Eutectogels for Conformal Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the glowing sucker octopus, a reversible fluorescent eutectogel is prepared by incorporating anthracene groups as the photoswitchable fluorescent unit for conformal encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, which can be reversibly written/erased with patterns by non&#8208;contact stimulation and conformally deform with arbitrary substrates. The developed eutectogel provides a promising strategy for the future development of advanced intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.







Abstract
Smart fluorescent materials that can respond to environmental stimuli are of great importance in the fields of information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, traditional fluorescent materials usually face problems such as lack of tunable fluorescence and insufficient surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, hindering their practical applications. Herein, inspired by the glowing sucker octopus, we present a novel strategy to fabricate a reversible fluorescent eutectogel with high transparency, adhesive and self&#8208;healing performance for conformal information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Using anthracene as luminescent unit, the eutectogel exhibits photoswitchable fluorescence and can therefore be reversibly written/erased with patterns by non&#8208;contact stimulation. Additionally, different from mechanically irreversible adhesion via glue, the eutectogel can adhere to various irregular substrates over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 65&#8201;&#176;C) and conformally deform more than 1000&#8197;times without peeling off. Furthermore, by exploiting surface&#8208;adaptive adhesion, high transparency and good stretchability of the eutectogel, dual encryption can be achieved under UV and stretching conditions to further improve the security level. This study should provide a promising strategy for the future development of advanced intelligent anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Electrolyte Interphases in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the fundamental aspects and the recent progress made in the emerging field of the formation of electrolyte interphases (EIs) in aqueous electrolytes.







Abstract
The narrow electrochemical stability window of water poses a challenge to the development of aqueous electrolytes. In contrast to non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, the products of water electrolysis do not contribute to the formation of a passivation layer on electrodes. As a result, aqueous electrolytes require the reactions of additional components, such as additives and co&#8208;solvents, to facilitate the formation of the desired solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the anode and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the cathode. This review highlights the fundamental principles and recent advancements in generating electrolyte interphases in aqueous batteries.

         <title>Multivariate Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Tunable Permanent Porosities for Capture of a Mustard Gas Simulant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;F groups were synthesized by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These single&#8208;crystalline materials are composed of tectons with as many as 4 different functionalities, which exhibit tunable hydrophobicity, and were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant (CEES).







Abstract
Precise synthesis of topologically predictable and discrete molecular crystals with permanent porosities remains a long&#8208;term challenge. Here, we report the first successful synthesis of a series of 11 isoreticular multivariate hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (MTV&#8208;HOFs) from pyrene&#8208;based derivatives bearing &#8722;H, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;NH2 and &#8722;F groups achieved by a shape&#8208;fitted, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking self&#8208;assembly strategy. These MTV&#8208;HOFs are single&#8208;crystalline materials composed of tecton, as verified by single&#8208;crystal diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, Raman spectra, water sorption isotherms and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These MTV&#8208;HOFs exhibit tunable hydrophobicity with water uptake starting from 50 to 80&#8201;% relative humidity, by adjusting the combinations and ratios of functional groups. As a proof of application, the resulting MTV&#8208;HOFs were shown to be capable of capturing a mustard gas simulant, 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) from moisture. The location of different functional groups within the pores of the MTV&#8208;HOFs leads to a synergistic effect, which resulted in a superior CEES/H2O selectivity (up to 94&#8201;%) compared to that of the HOFs with only pure component and enhanced breakthrough performance (up to 4000&#8197;min/g) when compared to benchmark MOF materials. This work is an important advance in the synthesis of MTV&#8208;HOFs, and provides a platform for the development of porous molecular materials for numerous applications.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction via Regulating Charge Transfer Ability in a One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (1D PyTTA&#8208;COF) have been applied for CO2 photoreduction for the first time. The stabilization of the aromatic backbone by interchain interaction in 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF improved exciton dissociation and attenuated the thermal relaxation processes of excited photoelectrons, aiding the movement of photoelectrons across the imine linkage to catalytic sites for CO2 conversion.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold potential for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. However, high energy barrier of imine linkage impede the in&#8208;plane photoelectron transfer process, resulting in inadequate efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Herein, we present a dimensionality induced local electronic modulation strategy through the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1D) pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PyTTA&#8208;COF). The dual&#8208;chain&#8208;like edge architectures of 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF enable the stabilization of aromatic backbones, thus reducing energy loss during exciton dissociation and thermal relaxation, which provides energetic photoelectron to traverse the energy barrier of imine linkages. As a result, the 1D PyTTA&#8208;COF exhibits significantly enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation when coordinated with metal cobalt ion, yielding a remarkable CO evolution of 1003&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 over an 8&#8208;hour period, which surpasses that of the corresponding 2D counterpart by a factor of 59. These findings present a valuable approach to address in&#8208;plane charge transfer limitations in imine&#8208;based COFs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Host&#8208;Guest System Regulated by the Multiple Roles of a Gold(I)&#8208;Carbene Motif</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host has resulted in a host&#8211;guest system showing long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL), thus illustrating that third&#8208;row transition metals can be used to achieve LPL. The introduction of a chiral unit on the guest molecule provides a simple approach to obtain circularly polarized LPL multifunctional materials.







Abstract
The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) is critical for achieving a high&#8208;efficiency long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) from organic materials. However, the use of a transition&#8208;metal complex for LPL materials has not been explored because it can also shorten the emission lifetime by accelerating the phosphorescence decay. Here, we report a new class of LPL materials by doping a monovalent Au&#8208;carbene complex into a boron&#8208;embedded molecular host. The donor&#8208;acceptor systems exhibit photoluminescence with both high efficiencies (&gt;57&#8201;%) and long lifetimes (ca. 40&#8197;ms) at room temperature. It is revealed that the Au atom promotes the population of low&#8208;lying triplet excited states of the host aggregate (T1*) which can be converted into the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state, thereby resulting in afterglow luminescence. Moreover, the use of a chirality unit on the guest molecule results in the LPL being circularly polarized. This work illustrates that transition&#8208;metal complexes can be used for developing organic afterglow systems by exquisite control over the excited state mechanism.

         <title>Optimized Crystal Framework by Asymmetric Core Isomerization in Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both the regional isomerization and selenium&#8208;substitution of the small molecular acceptors (SMAs) play significant roles in developing efficient organic solar cells (OSCs), while their synergistic effects remain elusive. Herein, we developed three isomeric SMAs (S&#8208;CSeF, A&#8208;ISeF, and A&#8208;OSeF) via subtly manipulating the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position (central, inner, or outer) and type of heteroaromatic ring on the central core by synergistic strategies for efficient OSCs, respectively. Crystallography of asymmetric A&#8208;OSeF presents a closer intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and more ordered 3&#8208;dimensional network packing and efficient charge&#8208;hopping pathways. With the successive out&#8208;shift of the mono&#8208;selenium substituted position, the neat films give a slightly wider bandgap and gradually higher crystallinity and electron mobility. The PM1:A&#8208;OSeF afford favourable fibrous phase separation morphology with more ordered molecular packing and efficient charge transportation compared to the other two counterparts. Consequently, the A&#8208;OSeF&#8208;based devices achieve a champion efficiency of 18.5%, which represents the record values for the reported selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our developed precise molecular engineering of the position and type of selenium&#8208;based heteroaromatic ring of SMAs provides a promising synergistic approach to optimizing crystal stacking and boosting top&#8208;ranked selenium&#8208;containing SMAs&#8208;based OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of High&#8208;Density Binuclear Site Catalysts from Double Framework Interfaces at the Cooling Stage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;nuclear site catalysts with dual atoms have the potential for applications in energy and catalysis chemistry. Understanding the formation mechanism of dual metal sites is crucial for optimizing local structures and designing desired binuclear sites catalysts. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the formation process of dual atoms through the pyrolysis of the interface of a double framework using Zn atoms in metal organic frameworks and Co atoms in covalent organic frameworks. We unambiguously revealed that the cooling stage is the key point to form the binuclear sites by employing the in situ synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectrum technique. The binuclear site catalysts show higher activity and selectivity than single dispersed atom catalysts for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. This work guides us to synthesize and optimize the various binuclear sites for extensive catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>UV&#8208;to&#8208;NIR Harvesting Conjugated Porous Polymer Nanocomposite: Upconversion and Plasmon Expedited Thioether Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalysts capable of harvesting a broad range of the solar spectrum are essential for sustainable chemical transformations and environmental remediation. Herein, we have integrated NIR&#8208;absorbing upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) with UV&#8208;vis absorbing conjugated porous organic polymer (POP) through the in situ multicomponent C&#8208;C coupling to fabricate a UC&#8208;POP nanocomposite. The light&#8208;harvesting ability of the UC&#8208;POP is further augmented by loading plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNP) into UC&#8208;POP. A three&#8208;times enhancement in the upconversion luminescence is observed upon the incorporation of AuNP in UC&#8208;POP, subsequently boosting the photocatalytic activity of UC&#8208;POP&#8208;Au. The spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical investigations infer the enhanced photocatalytic oxidation of thioethers, including mustard gas simulant by UC&#8208;POP&#8208;Au compared to POP and UC&#8208;POP due to the facile electron&#8208;hole pair generation, suppressed exciton recombination, and efficient charge carrier migration. Thus, the unique design strategy of combining plasmonic and upconversion nanoparticles with a conjugated porous organic polymer opens up new vistas towards artificial light harvesting.</dc:description>

         <title>Bayesian Optimization&#8208;guided Discovery of High&#8208;performance Methane Combustion Catalysts based on Multi&#8208;component PtPd@CeZrOx Core&#8211;Shell Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formula regulation of multi&#8208;component catalysts by manual search is undoubtedly a time&#8208;consuming task, which has severely impeded the development efficiency of high&#8208;performance catalysts. In this work, PtPd@CeZrOx core&#8208;shell nanospheres, as a successful case study, is explicitly demonstrated how Bayesian optimization (BO) accelerates the discovery of methane combustion catalysts with the optimal formula ratio, which directly results in a lower temperature of methane conversion than ones reported hitherto in literature. As a consequence, the best sample obtained in the present work could be efficiently developed after two rounds of iterations, containing only 18 controllable experiments in all that is far less than the common human workload via the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error search for optimal compositions. Further, this BO&#8208;based machine learning strategy can be straightforward extended to serve the autonomous discovery in multi&#8208;component material systems for other desired properties, showing promising opportunities to practical applications in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Photon Infrared Stimulation of Endogenous Neuroreceptors in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To interrogate neural circuits and crack their codes, in vivo brain activity imaging must be combined with spatiotemporally precise stimulation in three dimensions using genetic or pharmacological specificity. This challenge requires deep penetration and focusing as provided by infrared light and multiphoton excitation, and has promoted two&#8208;photon photopharmacology and optogenetics. However, three&#8208;photon brain stimulation in vivo remains to be demonstrated. We report the regulation of neuronal activity in zebrafish larvae by three&#8208;photon excitation of a photoswitchable muscarinic agonist at 50 pM, a billion&#8208;fold lower concentration than used for uncaging, and with mid&#8208;infrared light of 1560 nm, the longest reported photoswitch wavelength. Robust, physiologically relevant photoresponses allow modulating brain activity in wild&#8208;type animals with spatiotemporal and pharmacological precision. Computational calculations predict that azobenzene&#8208;based ligands have high three&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section and can be used directly with pulsed infrared light. The expansion of three&#8208;photon pharmacology will deeply impact basic neurobiology and neuromodulation phototherapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing Up the Size Limit of Boron&#8208;doped peri&#8208;Acenes: Modular Synthesis and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroatom&#8208;doped peri&#8208;acenes (PAs) have recently attracted considerable attention considering their fascinating physical properties and chemical stability. However, the precise sole addition of boron atoms along the zigzag edges of PAs remains challenging, primarily due to the limited synthetic approach. Herein, we present a novel one&#8208;pot modular synthetic strategy toward unprecedented boron&#8208;doped PAs (B&#8208;PAs), including B&#8208;[4,2]PA (1a&#8208;2), B&#8208;[4,3]PA (1b&#8208;2) and B&#8208;[7,2]PA (1c&#8208;3) derivatives, through efficient intramolecular electrophilic borylation. Their chemical structures are unequivocally confirmed with a combination of mass spectrometry, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, 1b&#8208;2 exhibits an almost planar geometry, whereas 1a&#8208;2 displays a distinctive bowl&#8208;like distortion. Furthermore, the optoelectronic properties of this series of B&#8208;PAs are thoroughly investigated by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with DFT calculation. Compared with their parent all&#8208;carbon analogs, the obtained B&#8208;PAs exhibit high stability, wide energy gaps, and high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 84%. This study reveals the exceptional ability of boron doping to finely tune the physicochemical properties of PAs, showcasing their potential applications in optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloadditions of Indoles with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Indoline Fused Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) are becoming ever more important in drug design and development as bridged scaffolds that provide underexplored chemical space, but are difficult to access. Here a silver&#8208;catalyzed dearomative [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition strategy for the synthesis of indoline fused BCHs from N&#8208;unprotected indoles and bicyclobutane precursors is described. The strain&#8208;release dearomative cycloaddition operates under mild conditions, tolerating a wide range of functional groups. It is capable of forming BCHs with up to four contiguous quaternary carbon centers, achieving yields of up to 99%. In addition, a scale&#8208;up experiment and the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts further highlighted the synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented 1,2&#8208;Aryl Shift Accompanying Double Alkyne Benzannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first ever case of a tandem intramolecular hydroarylation of alkynes accompanied by a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is described. Harnessing the unique electron&#8208;rich character of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole scaffolds, we have demonstrated that the hydroarylation of alkynes proceeds at the already occupied positions 2 and 5 leading to a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds only in the presence of cationic gold catalyst, and it leads to heretofore unknown &#960;&#8208;expanded, centrosymmetric pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles. The utility is verified in the preparation of 13 products that bear six conjugated rings. The observed compatibility with various functional groups allows for increased tunability with regard to the photophysical properties as well as providing sites for further functionalization. Our computational studies additionally suggest that the formation of the six&#8208;membered rings accompanied with a 1,2&#8208;aryl shift is a highly exoergic process, whereas the formation of products containing 7&#8208;membered rings is endoergic, rationalizing the observed reaction course. Steady&#8208;state UV/visible spectroscopy revealed that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first ever case of a tandem intramolecular hydroarylation of alkynes accompanied by a 1,2-aryl shift is described. Harnessing the unique electron-rich character of 1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole scaffolds, we have demonstrated that the hydroarylation of alkynes proceeds at the already occupied positions 2 and 5 leading to a 1,2-aryl shift. Remarkably, the reaction proceeds only in the presence of cationic gold catalyst, and it leads to heretofore unknown &#960;-expanded, centrosymmetric pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles. The utility is verified in the preparation of 13 products that bear six conjugated rings. The observed compatibility with various functional groups allows for increased tunability with regard to the photophysical properties as well as providing sites for further functionalization. Our computational studies additionally suggest that the formation of the six-membered rings accompanied with a 1,2-aryl shift is a highly exoergic process, whereas the formation of products containing 7-membered rings is endoergic, rationalizing the observed reaction course. Steady-state UV/visible spectroscopy revealed that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S-shaped N-doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. Their optical properties were rationalized through TD-DFT calculations. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the assembly of cellulose&#8208;based oligosaccharides through sequence modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and nucleic acids with programmable sequences are widely explored for the production of tunable, self&#8208;assembling functional materials. Herein we demonstrate that the primary sequence of oligosaccharides can be designed to access materials with tunable shapes and properties. Synthetic cellulose&#8208;based oligomers were assembled into 2D or 3D rod&#8208;like crystallites. Sequence modifications within the oligosaccharide core influenced the molecular packing and led to the formation of square&#8208;like assemblies based on the rare cellulose IVII allomorph. In contrast, modifications at the termini generated elongated aggregates with tunable surfaces, resulting in self&#8208;healing supramolecular hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable Organocatalysis from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Carbodiimide Adducts with Tunable Release Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are powerful organocatalysts, but practical applications often require in situ generation from stable precursors that &#8220;mask&#8221; the NHC reactivity via reversible binding. Previously established &#8220;masks&#8221; are often simple small molecules, such that the NHC structure is used to control both catalytic activity and activation temperature, leading to undesirable tradeoffs. Herein, we show that NHC&#8208;carbodiimide (CDI) adducts can be masked precursors for switchable organocatalysis and that the CDI substituents can control the reaction profile without changing the NHC structure. Large electronic variations on the CDI (e.g., alkyl versus aryl) drastically change the catalytically active temperature, whereas smaller perturbations (e.g., different para&#8208;substituted phenyls) tune the catalyst release within a narrower window. This control was demonstrated for three classic NHC&#8208;catalyzed reactions, each influencing the NHC&#8208;CDI equilibrium in different ways. Our results introduce a new paradigm for controlling NHC organocatalysis as well as present practical considerations for designing appropriate masks for various reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective High&#8208;Throughput Assay Showcased for the Identification of (R)&#8208; as well as (S)&#8208;Selective Unspecific Peroxygenases for C&#8722;H Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput assay was established to assess stereoselectivity, stereopreference, and activity in peroxygenase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay accurately predicts the ee value of the product with &#177;11&#8201;% accuracy. It enabled the discovery of novel wild&#8208;type fungal peroxygenases with remarkable enantioselectivity for both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;alcohols. Homology models and docking studies supported the observed stereopreferences.







Abstract
Identifying (bio)catalysts displaying high enantio&#8208;/stereoselectivity is a fundamental prerequisite for the advancement of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, a high&#8208;throughput, stereoselective screening assay is reported that gives information on enantioselectivity, stereopreference and activity as showcased for peroxygenase&#8208;catalyzed hydroxylation. The assay is based on spectrophotometric analysis of the simultaneous formation of NAD(P)H from the alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of the sec&#8208;alcohol product formed in the peroxygenase reaction. The assay was applied to investigate a library comprising 44 unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) containing 25 UPOs not reported yet. Thereby, previously non&#8208;described wild&#8208;type UPOs displaying (S)&#8208; as well as (R)&#8208;stereoselectivity for the hydroxylation of representative model substrates were identified, reaching up to 98&#8201;% ee for the (R)&#8208; and 94&#8201;% ee for the (S)&#8208;enantiomer. Homology models with concomitant docking studies indicated the structural reason for the observed complementary stereopreference.

         <title>Unlocking Catalytic Potential: Exploring the Impact of Thermal Treatment on Enhanced Electrocatalysis of Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the impact of thermal treatments on the optimization of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts for electrochemical applications. It focuses on atomic&#8208;level structural changes induced by heat and assesses their influence on electrocatalysis. The article also offers tailored approaches to guide researchers in selecting effective techniques and thermal settings, thereby advancing electrochemical research.







Abstract
In the evolving field of electrocatalysis, thermal treatment of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts has become an essential strategy for performance enhancement. This review systematically investigates the impact of various thermal treatments on the catalytic potential of nano&#8208;electrocatalysts. The focus encompasses an in&#8208;depth analysis of the changes induced in structural, morphological, and compositional properties, as well as alterations in electro&#8208;active surface area, surface chemistry, and crystal defects. By providing a comprehensive comparison of commonly used thermal techniques, such as annealing, calcination, sintering, pyrolysis, hydrothermal, and solvothermal methods, this review serves as a scientific guide for selecting the right thermal technique and favorable temperature to tailor the nano&#8208;electrocatalysts for optimal electrocatalysis. The resultant modifications in catalytic activity are explored across key electrochemical reactions such as electrochemical (bio)sensing, catalytic degradation, oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, fuel cells, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Through a detailed examination of the underlying mechanisms and synergistic effects, this review contributes to a fundamental understanding of the role of thermal treatments in enhancing electrocatalytic properties. The insights provided offer a roadmap for future research aimed at optimizing the electrocatalytic performance of nanomaterials, fostering the development of next&#8208;generation sensors and energy conversion technologies.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis with Anomalous Chloride Promoted Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous Cl&#8722;&#8208;promoted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism with a typical catalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH), is proposed. First, both Fe leaching and active lattice oxygen are suppressed by the adsorption of Cl&#8722; on desired Fe sites, which improves the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability.

A highly selective and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst is the bottleneck for direct seawater splitting because of side reactions primarily caused by chloride ions (Cl&#8722;). Most studies about OER catalysts in seawater focus on the repulsion of the Cl&#8722; to reduce its negative effects. Herein, we demonstrate that the absorption of Cl&#8722; on the specific site of a popular OER electrocatalyst, nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH), does not have a significant negative impact; rather, it is beneficial for its activity and stability enhancement in natural seawater. A set of in situ characterization techniques reveals that the adsorption of Cl&#8722; on the desired Fe site suppresses Fe leaching, and creates more OER&#8208;active Ni sites, improving the catalyst's long&#8208;term stability and activity simultaneously. Therefore, we achieve direct alkaline seawater electrolysis for the very first time on a commercial&#8208;scale alkaline electrolyser (AE, 120&#8197;cm2 electrode area) using the NiFe LDH anode. The new alkaline seawater electrolyser exhibits a reduction in electricity consumption by 20.7&#8201;% compared to the alkaline purified water&#8208;based AE using commercial Ni catalyst, achieving excellent durability for 100&#8197;h at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;An anomalous Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-promoted oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism with a typical catalyst, nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH), is proposed. First, both Fe leaching and active lattice oxygen are suppressed by the adsorption of Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on desired Fe sites, which improves the catalyst's long-term stability. Second, more high-valency OER-active Ni sites are created, thus increasing the activity.

         <title>When Is a Bond Broken? The Polarizability Perspective.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Static polarizability maxima along bond dissociation coordinates represent the onset of electron density localization and thus can used to be define when is a chemical bond broken.







Abstract
The question of when a chemical bond can be said to be broken is of fundamental chemical interest but has not been widely studied. Herein we propose that the maxima of static polarizability along bond dissociation coordinates naturally define cutoff points for bond rupture, as they represent the onset of localization of shared electron density into constituent fragments. Examples of computed polarizability maxima over the course of bond cleavage in main&#8208;group and transition metal compounds are provided, across covalent, dative and charge&#8208;shift bonds. The behavior along reaction paths is also considered. Overall, the static polarizability is found to be a sensitive reporter of electronic structure reorganization associated with bond stretching, and thus can serve as a metric for describing bond cleavage (or diagnose the absence of a chemical bond).

N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) monolayers have been self&#8208;assembled on Au(111) and characterized with high thermal stability and a large impact on work&#8208;function values, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHOs) have been prepared on Au(111) and their thermal stability, adsorption geometry, and molecular order were characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, polarized X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The strong &#963;&#8208;bond character of NHO anchoring to Au induced high geometrical flexibility that enabled a flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry via coordination to a gold adatom. The flat&#8208;lying adsorption geometry was utilized to further increase the surface interaction of the NHO monolayer by backbone functionalization with methyl groups that induced high thermal stability and a large impact on work&#8208;function values, which outperformed that of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes. STM measurements, supported by DFT modeling, identified that the NHOs were self&#8208;assembled in dimers, trimers, and tetramers constructed of two, three, and four complexes of NHO&#8722;Au&#8208;adatom. This self&#8208;assembly pattern was correlated to strong NHO&#8722;Au interactions and steric hindrance between adsorbates, demonstrating the crucial influence of the carbon&#8208;metal &#963;&#8208;bond on monolayer properties.

         <title>Concentrated Ionic Fluids: Is There a Difference Between Chloride&#8208;Based Brines and Deep Eutectic Solvents?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductivity, viscosity, water, and chloride content were measured for brines and aqueous DESs. Low viscosity brines favour copper etching due to higher mass transport. Low water content DESs promote etching for silver and nickel.







Abstract
Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) have been lauded as novel solvents, but is there really a difference between them and concentrated aqueous brines? They provide a method of adjusting the activity of water and chloride ions which can affect mass transport, speciation and reactivity. This study proposes a continuum of properties across concentrated ionic fluids and uses metal processing as an example. Charge transport is shown to be governed by fluidity and there is no discontinuity between molar conductivity and fluidity irrespective of cation, charge density or ionic radius. Diffusion coefficients of iron(III) and copper(II) chloride in numerous concentrated ionic fluids show the same linear correlation between diffusion coefficient and fluidity. These oxidising agents were used to etch copper, silver and nickel and while the etching rate increased with fluidity for copper, etching of silver and nickel only occurred at high chloride and low water activity as passivation occurred when water activity increased. Overall, brines provide a high chloride content at a lower viscosity than DESs, but unlike DESs, brines are unable to prevent passivation due to their high water content. The results show how selective etching of mixed metal waste streams can be achieved by tuning chloride and water activity.

         <dc:description>A copper&#8208;catalyzed dearomative alkynylation of pyridines is reported with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities. The synthetically valuable enantioenriched 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydropyridine products afforded are generated from a readily available chemical, pyridine, and commercially available terminal alkynes. The three&#8208;component reaction between a pyridine, a terminal alkyne, and methyl chloroformate employs copper chloride and StackPhos, a chiral biaryl P,N&#8208; ligand, as the catalytic system. Under mild reaction conditions, the desired 1,2addition products are delivered in up to 99% yield with regioselectivity ratios up to 25:1 and enantioselectivities values of up to 99% ee. Activated and non&#8208;activated terminal alkynes containing a wide range of functional groups are well tolerated in the transformation. Even acetylene gas delivered mono&#8208;alkynylated products in high yield and ee. Application of the methodology in an efficient enantioselective synthesis of the chiral piperidine indolizidine, coniceine, is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Active Sites of Cobalt Phthalocyanine in Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many metal coordination compounds catalyze CO2 electroreduction to CO, but cobalt phthalocyanine hybridized with conductive carbon such as carbon nanotubes is currently the only one that can generate methanol. The underlying structure&#8208;reactivity correlation and reaction mechanism desperately demand elucidation. Here we report the first in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy characterization, combined with ex situ spectroscopic and electrocatalytic measurements, to study CoPc&#8208;catalyzed CO2 reduction to methanol. Molecular dispersion of CoPc on CNT surfaces, as evidenced by the observed electronic interaction between the two, is crucial to fast electron transfer to the active sites and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction. CO, the key intermediate in the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;methanol pathway, is found to be labile on the active site, which necessitates a high local concentration in the microenvironment to compete with CO2 for active sites and promote methanol production. A comparison of the electrocatalytic performance of structurally related porphyrins indicates that the bridging aza&#8208;N atoms of the Pc macrocycle are critical components of the CoPc active site that produces methanol. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy identifies the active site as Co (I) and supports an increasingly non&#8208;centrosymmetric Co coordination environment at negative applied potential, likely due to the formation of a Co&#8208;CO adduct during the catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control over Polynucleotide Brush Growth on DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology provides an approach to create precise, tunable, and biocompatible nanostructures for biomedical applications. However, the stability of these structures is severely compromised in biological milieu due to their fast degradation by nucleases. Recently, we showed how enzymatic polymerization could be harnessed to grow polynucleotide brushes of tunable length and location on the surface of DNA origami nanostructures, which greatly enhances their nuclease stability. Here, we report on strategies that allow for both spatial and temporal control over polymerization through activatable initiation, cleavage, and regeneration of polynucleotide brushes using restriction enzymes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes in a spatiotemporally controlled way provides access to &#8220;smart&#8221; functionalized DNA architectures with potential applications in drug delivery and supramolecular assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Intrapenetrated Hierarchical Zeolites with Highly Complete Framework via Protozeolite Seeding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Creation of intrapenetrated mesopores with open highway from external surface into the interior of zeolite crystals are highly desirable that can significantly improve the molecular transport and active sites accessibility of microporous zeolites to afford enhanced catalytic properties. Here, different from traditional zeolite&#8208;seeded methods that generally produced isolated mesopores in zeolites, nanosized amorphous protozeolites with embryo structure of zeolites were used as seeds for the construction of single&#8208;crystalline hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites with intrapenetrated mesopores (mesopore volume of 0.51 cm3g&#8208;1) and highly complete framework. In this strategy, in contrast to the conventional synthesis, only a small amount of organic structure directing agents and a low crystallization temperature were adopted to promise the protozeolites as the dominant growth directing sites to induce crystallization. The protozeolite nanoseeds provided abundant nucleation sites for surrounding precursors to be crystallized, followed by oriented coalescence of crystallites resulting in the formation of intrapenetrated mesopores. The as&#8208;prepared hierarchical ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 443.9 hours and a high propylene selectivity of 47.92 % at a WHSV of 2 h&#8208;1 in the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene reaction. This work provides a facile protozeolite&#8208;seeded strategy for the synthesis of intrapenetrated hierarchical zeolites that are highly effective for catalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Strategy to Access Alternating Styrene/Substituted Styrene Copolymers by Using a Traceless Controlling Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a synthetic strategy for alternating copolymers of styrene and substituted styrenes by utilizing &#945;&#8208;styryl boronate pinacol ester (StBpin) as the comonomer through radical alternating copolymerization followed by protodeboronation. The excellent alternating polymerization behavior of StBpin comonomer in such radical polymerization system is considered to be attributed to the steric hindrance and radical stabilization exerted by the Bpin group. This strategy is general with a wide range of substituted styrene comonomers regardless of the electronic nature of the substituents, and the protodeboronation of the alternating Bpin&#8208;containing polymers is highly efficient without polymer backbone alternation. RAFT living polymerization was also compatible with this approach. Thus, this strategy provides a way to build&#8208;up alternating copolymers consisting of similar styrene&#8208;type comonomers, which has been inaccessible by conventional synthetic methods.</dc:description>

         <title>The Synthesis of a Multiple D&#8208;A Conjugated Macrocycle and Its Application in Organic Photovoltaic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a novel class of materials, D&#8208;A conjugated macrocycles hold significant promise for chemical science. However, their potential in photovoltaic remains largely untapped due to the complexity of introducing multiple donor and acceptor moieties into the design and synthesis of cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Here, we report a multiple D&#8208;A ring&#8208;like cyclic conjugated molecule (RCM) via the coupling of dimer molecule DBTP&#8208;C3 as a template and thiophenes in high yields. RCM exhibits a narrow optical gap (1.33 eV) and excellent thermal stability, and shows a remarkable photoluminescence yield (&#934;PL) of 11.1% in solution, much higher than non&#8208;cyclic analogues. Organic solar cell (OSC) constructed with RCM as electron acceptor shows efficient charge separation at donor&#8208;acceptor band offsets and achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.2%&#8208;approximately fourfold higher than macrocycle&#8208;based OSCs reported so far. This is partly due to low non&#8208;radiative voltage loss down to 0.20 eV and a high electroluminescence yield (&#934;EL) of 4&#215;10&#8208;4. Our findings emphasize the potential of D&#8208;A cyclic conjugated molecules in advancing organic photovoltaic technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Interplay of Dual&#8208;Active&#8208;Sites&#160;on Metallic Ni&#8208;MOFs Loaded with Pt for Thermal&#8208;Photocatalytic Conversion of Atmospheric CO2 under Infrared Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Infrared light driven photocatalytic reduction of atmospheric CO2 is challenging due to the ultralow concentration of CO2 (0.04%) and the low energy of infrared light. Herein, we develop a metallic nickel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework loaded with Pt (Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF), which shows excellent activity for thermal&#8208;photocatalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 with H2 even under infrared light irradiation. The open Ni sites are&#160;beneficial to capture and activate atmospheric CO2, while the photogenerated electrons dominate H2 dissociation on the Pt sites. Simultaneously, thermal energy results in spilling of dissociated H2 to Ni sites,&#160;where the adsorbed CO2 is thermally reduced to CO and CH4. The synergistic interplay of dual&#8208;active&#8208;sites renders Pt/Ni&#8208;MOF a record efficiency of 9.57% at 940 nm for converting atmospheric CO2, enables the procurement of CO2 to be independent of the emission sources, and improves the energy efficiency for trace CO2 conversion by eliminating the capture media regeneration and molecular CO2 release.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1&#8208;Azaspiro[3.3]heptanes were synthesized, characterized, and validated biologically as bioisosteres of piperidine. The key synthesis step was thermal [2+2] cycloaddition between endocyclic alkenes and Graf's isocyanate, ClO2S&#8208;NCO, into spirocyclic &#946;&#8209;lactams. Reduction of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring with alane produced 1&#8209;azaspiro[3.3]heptanes. Incorporation of this core into the anesthetic drug Bupivacaine instead of the piperidine fragment resulted in the new patent&#8208;free analogue with high activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Radical Oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;Substituted Styrenes via Late&#8208;Stage Stereomutation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report an unprecedented copper&#8208;catalyzed highly enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective radical oxyboration of &#946;&#8208;substituted styrenes. The lynchpin of success is ascribed to the development of a late&#8208;stage stereomutation strategy, which enables enantioenriched cis&#8208;isomers among a couple of early&#8208;generated diastereomers to be converted into trans&#8208;isomer counterparts, thus fulfilling high diastereocontrol; while the degree of enantio&#8208;differentiation is determined by the borocupration process of the C=C bond. This reaction provides an efficient protocol to access enantioenriched trans&#8208;1,2&#8208; dioxygenation products. The value of this method has further been highlighted in a diversity of follow&#8208;up stereospecific transformations and further modifying complex molecules.</dc:description>

The lynchpin of success is ascribed to the development of a late-stage stereomutation strategy, which enables enantioenriched cis-isomers among a couple of early-generated diastereomers to be converted into trans-isomer counterparts, thus fulfilling high diastereocontrol; while the degree of enantio-differentiation is determined by the borocupration process of the C=C bond. This reaction provides an efficient protocol to access enantioenriched trans-1,2- dioxygenation products. The value of this method has further been highlighted in a diversity of follow-up stereospecific transformations and further modifying complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Chiral Induction of C60&#160;and C70&#160;Fullerenes by Axially Chiral Porous Aromatic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral induction has been an important topic in chemistry, not only for its relevance in understanding the mysterious phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in nature but also due to its critical implications in medicine and the chiral industry. The induced chirality of fullerenes by host&#8208;guest interactions has been rarely reported, mainly attributed to their chiral resistance from high symmetry and challenges in their accessibility. Herein, we report two new pairs of chiral porous aromatic cages (PAC), R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 (with Br substituents) and R&#8208;PAC&#8208;3, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;3 (with CH3 substituents) enantiomers. PAC&#8208;2, rather than PAC&#8208;3, achieves fullerene encapsulation and selective binding of C70 over C60 in fullerene carbon soot. More significantly, the occurrence of chiral induction between R&#8208;PAC&#8208;2, S&#8208;PAC&#8208;2 and fullerenes is confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and the intense CD signal within the absorption region of fullerenes. DFT calculations reveal the contribution of electrostatic effects originating from face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8208;fullerene interactions dominate C70 selectivity and elucidate the substituent effect on fullerene encapsulation. The disturbance from the differential interactions between fullerene and surrounding chiral cages on the intrinsic highly symmetric electronic structure of fullerene could be the primary reason accounting for the induced chirality of fullerene.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric N&#8208;Alkylation of 1H&#8208;Indoles via Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intermolecular enantioselective N&#8208;alkylation reaction of 1H&#8208;indoles has been developed by cooperative rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid catalyzed N&#8208;H bond insertion reaction. N&#8208;Alkyl indoles with newly formed stereocenter adjacent to the indole nitrogen atom are produced in good yields (up to 95%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee). Importantly, both &#945;&#8208;aryl and &#945;&#8208;alkyl diazoacetates are tolerated, which is extremely rare in asymmetric X&#8208;H (X = N, O, S et al.) and C&#8208;H insertion reactions. With this method, only 0.1 mol% of rhodium catalyst and 2.5 mol% of chiral phosphoric acid are required to complete the conversion as well as achieve the high enantioselectivity. Computational studies reveal the cooperative relay of rhodium and chiral phosphoric acid, and the origin of the chemo and stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Modification of Polypeptides at Selenocysteine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mild strategies for the selective modification of peptides and proteins are in demand for applications in therapeutic peptide and protein discovery, and in the study of fundamental biomolecular processes. Herein, we describe the development of an electrochemical selenoetherification (e&#8208;SE) platform for the efficient site&#8208;selective functionalization of polypeptides. This methodology utilizes the unique reactivity of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine, to effect formation of valuable bioconjugates via stable selenoether linkages under mild electrochemical conditions. The power of e&#8208;SE is highlighted through late&#8208;stage C&#8208;terminal modification of the FDA&#8208;approved cancer drug leuprolide, and assembly of a library of anti&#8208;HER2 affibody&#8208;conjugates bearing complex cargoes. Following assembly by e&#8208;SE, the utility of functionalized affibodies for in vitro imaging and targeting of HER2 positive breast and lung cancer cell lines is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Photosynthesis of Benzonitriles on BiOBr Nanosheets Promoted by Vacancy Associates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic organic functionalization reactions represent a green, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable synthesis route for value&#8208;added chemicals. However, heterogeneous photocatalysis is inefficient in directly activating ammonia molecules for the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added nitrogenous organic products when compared with oxygen activation in the formation of related oxygenated compounds. In this study, we report the heterogeneous photosynthesis of benzonitriles by the ammoxidation of benzyl alcohols (99% conversion, 93% selectivity) promoted using BiOBr nanosheets with surface vacancy associates. In contrast, reaction using catalysts with other types of vacancy sites resulted in oxidation to benzaldehyde. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations have demonstrated a specificity of vacancy type with respect to product selectivity, which arises from the adsorption and activation of NH3 and O2 that is required to promote subsequent C&#8208;N coupling and oxidation to nitrile. This study provides a better understanding of the role of vacancies as catalytic sites in heterogeneous photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Elastomer for Multi&#8208;Level Encryption and Transient Information Display</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Information security has gained increasing attention in the past decade, leading to the development of advanced materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption and instantaneous information display. However, it remains challenging to achieve high information security with simple encryption procedures and low&#8208;energy stimuli. Herein, a series of strain/temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are developed to achieve dual&#8208;modal, multi&#8208;level information encryption and real&#8208;time, rewritable transient information display. The as&#8208;prepared polydomain LCEs can change from an opaque state to a transparent state under strain or temperature stimuli, with the transition strains or temperatures highly dependent on the concentration of long&#8208;chain flexible spacers. Information encrypted by different LCE inks can be decrypted under specific strains or temperatures, leading to multi&#8208;level protection of information security. Furthermore, with the combination of the phase transition of polydomain LCEs and the photothermal effect of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), we achieved a repeatable transient information display by using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light as a pen for writing. This study provides new insight into the development of advanced encryption materials with versatility and high security for broad applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Neuroprotective Bioorthogonal Catalysis in Mitochondria using Protein&#8208;Integrated Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis holds promise for controlling cell function precisely, yet achieving selective and efficient chemical reactions within organelles is challenging. In this study, we introduce a new strategy using protein&#8208;integrated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) to enable synergistic bioorthogonal chemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis within mitochondria. Utilizing catalytically active tris(4,4'&#8208;dicarboxylicacid&#8208;2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl) ruthenium(II) to self&#8208;assemble with [1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4'&#8208;biscarboximidamide, we synthesized nanoscale RuB&#8208;HOFs that exhibit high photocatalytic reduction activity. Notably, RuB&#8208;HOFs efficiently enter cells and preferentially localize to mitochondria, where they facilitate bioorthogonal photoreduction reactions. Moreover, we show that RuB&#8208;HOFs encapsulating catalase can produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in mitochondria through photocatalytic reduction of pro&#8208;H2S and degrade hydrogen peroxide through enzymatic catalysis simultaneously, offering significant neuroprotection effect against oxidative stress. Our findings not only introduce a versatile chemical toolset for mitochondria&#8208;targeted bioorthogonal catalysis for prodrug activation but also pave the way for potential therapeutic applications in treating diseases related to cellular oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic Matching of Complex Monoterpene Indole Alkaloid Chemical Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs) are endowed with high structural and spacial complexity and characterized by diverse biological activities. Given this complexity&#8208;activity combination in MIAs, rapid and efficient access to chemical matter related to and with complexity similar to these alkaloids would be highly desirable, since such compound classes might display novel bioactivity. We describe the design and synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) collection obtained by the unprecedented combination of MIA fragments through complexity&#8208;generating transformations, resulting in arrangements not currently accessible by biosynthetic pathways. Cheminformatic analyses revealed that both the pseudo&#8208;NPs and the MIAs reside in a unique and common area of chemical space with high spacial complexity&#8208;density that is only sparsely populated by other natural products and drugs. Investigation of bioactivity guided by morphological profiling identified pseudo&#8208;NPs that inhibit DNA synthesis and modulate tubulin. These results demonstrate that the pseudo&#8208;NP collection occupies similar biologically relevant chemical space that Nature has endowed MIAs with.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Roles of Solvophobic Effects and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; Interactions in the Formation of [2]Catenanes Featuring di&#8208;(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of [2]catenanes has been prepared from di&#8208;NHC building blocks utilizing solvophobic effects and/or &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking interactions. The dinickel naphtobiscarbene complex syn&#8208;[1] and the kinked biphenyl&#8208;bridged bipyridyl ligand L2 yield the [2]catenane [2&#8208;IL](OTf)4 by self&#8208;assembly. Solvophobic effects are pivotal for the formation of the interlocked species. Substitution of the biphenyl&#8208;linker in L2 for a pyromellitic diimide group gave ligand L3 which yielded with syn&#8208;[1] the [2]catenane [3&#8208;IL](OTf)4. This assembly exhibits enhanced stability in diluted solution aided by additional &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking interactions. The &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking was augmented by the introduction of a pyrene bridge between two NHC donors in ligand L4. Di&#8208;NHC precursor H2&#8208;L4(PF6)2 reacts with Ag2O to give the [Ag2L42]2 [2]catenane [4&#8208;IL](PF6)4 showing strong &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking interactions between the pyrene groups. This assembly was readily converted into the [Au2L42]2 gold species [5&#8208;IL](PF6)4 exhibiting exceptional stability based on the strong &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking interactions and the enhanced stability of the Au&#8208;CNHC bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Range of Bio&#8208;orthogonal Tags for Multiplex Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiplex optical detection in live cells is challenging due to overlapping signals and poor signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise associated with some chemical reporters. To address this, the application of spectral phasor analysis to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy for unmixing three bio&#8208;orthogonal Raman probes within cells is reported. Triplex detection of a metallacarborane using the B&#8211;H stretch at 2480&#8208; 2650 cm&#8208;1 , together with a bis&#8208;alkyne and deuterated fatty acid can be achieved within the cell&#8208;silent region of the Raman spectrum. When coupled to imaging in the high&#8208;wavenumber region of the cellular Raman spectrum, nine discrete regions of interest can be spectrally unmixed from the hyperspectral SRS dataset, demonstrating a new capability in the toolkit of multiplexed Raman imaging of live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;Diborylation of Alkynes with a Neutral sp2&#8208;sp3 Diboron Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of two distinct boryl groups at the same carbon center in organic molecules has attracted growing research interest due to its potential for facilitating controlled, precise synthesis through stepwise dual carbon&#8208;boron bond transformations. Here we report a method to access unsymmetrical 1,1&#8208;diborylalkene (UDBA) stereoselectively via the reaction of readily available alkynes with a neutral sp2&#8208;sp3 diboron reagent (NHC)BH2&#8208;Bpin (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene). Attributing to the chemically easily distinguishable nature of the sp2 and sp3 boryl moieties, controllable stepwise derivatization of the resultant UDBAs is realized. This process leads to various multifunctionalized olefins and organoborons, such as acylboranes, which are difficult to prepare by other methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Substituents Allow Boosted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence in J&#8208;Type Aggregates for Bioimaging and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing molecular fluorophores with enhanced fluorescence in aggregate state for the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging is highly desirable but remains a tremendous challenge due to the lack of reliable design guidelines. Herein, we report an aromatic substituent strategy to construct highly bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates. Introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at 3,5&#8208;aryl and meso positions of classic boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) skeleton can promote slip&#8208;stacked J&#8208;type arrangement and further boost NIR&#8208;II fluorescence of J&#8208;aggregates via increased electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction. Notably, NOBDP&#8208;NO2 with three nitro groups (&#8208;NO2) shows intense NIR&#8208;II fluorescence at 1065 nm and high absolute quantum yield of 3.21% in solid state, which can be successfully applied in bioimaging, high&#8208;level encoding encryption, and information storage. Moreover, guided by this electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent strategy, other skeletons (thieno&#8208;fused BODIPY, aza&#8208;BODIPY, and heptamethine cyanine) modified with &#8208;NO2 are converted into J&#8208;type aggregates with enhanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence, showing great potential to convert aggregation caused emission quenching (ACQ) dyes into brilliant J&#8208;aggregates. This study provides a universal method for construction of strong NIR&#8208;II emissive J&#8208;aggregates by rationally manipulating molecular packing and establishing relationships among molecular structures, intermolecular interactions, and fluorescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A Lantern&#8208;Shaped Pd(II) Cage Constructed from Four Different Low Symmetry Ligands with Positional and Orientational Control: an Ancillary Pairings Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the key challenges of metallo&#8208;supramolecular chemistry is to maintain the ease of self&#8208;assembly but, at the same time, create structures of increasingly high levels of complexity. In palladium(II) quadruply&#8208;stranded lantern&#8208;shaped cages, this has been achieved through either 1) the formation of heteroleptic (multi&#8208;ligand) assemblies, or 2) homoleptic assemblies from low&#8208;symmetry ligands. Heteroleptic cages formed from low symmetry ligands. A hybid of these two approaches would add an additional rich level of complexity but no examples of these have been reported. Here we use a system of ancillary complementary ligand pairings at the termini of cage ligands to target heteroleptic assemblies: these complementary pairs can only interact (through coordination to a single Pd(II) metal ion) between ligands in a cis position on the cage. Complementarity between each pair (and orthogonality to other pairs) is controlled by denticity (tridentate to monodentate or bidentate to bidentate) and/or hydrogen bonding capability (AA to DD or AD to DA). This allows positional and orientational control over ligands with different ancillary sites. Using this approach, we have successfully used low&#8208;symmetry ligands to synthesise complex heteroleptic cages, including an example with four different low symmetry ligands.</dc:description>

A perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic framework (COF) has been developed for a fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. The largely reduced electron density on the C&#8722;O&#8722; groups after discharge results in the unique proton affinity of the COF electrode and an excellent rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Electrochemical proton storage plays an essential role in designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;rate energy storage devices, e.g., aqueous batteries. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated covalent organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;COFs) are promising electrode materials, but their competitive proton and metal&#8208;ion insertion mechanisms remain elusive, and proton storage in COFs is rarely explored. Here, we report a perinone&#8208;based poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL)&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D c&#8208;COF for fast proton storage in both a mild aqueous Zn&#8208;ion electrolyte and strong acid. We unveil that the discharged C&#8722;O&#8722; groups exhibit largely reduced basicity due to the considerable &#960;&#8208;delocalization in perinone, thus affording the 2D c&#8208;COF a unique affinity for protons with fast kinetics. As a consequence, the 2D c&#8208;COF electrode presents an outstanding rate capability of up to 200&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (over 2500&#8197;C), surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art conjugated polymers, COFs, and metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Our work reports the first example of pure proton storage among COFs and highlights the great potential of BBL&#8208;ladder&#8208;type 2D conjugated polymers in future energy devices.

         <title>Photoredox Cascade Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Production with Biomass Photoreforming</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photoredox cascade photocatalyst consisting of dual&#8208;dye sensitized Pt&#8208;TiO2 nanoparticle photocatalyst and 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) molecular catalyst was constructed. The system produced H2 efficiently under blue&#8208;light to simultaneously generate one&#8208;electron oxidized TEMPO+ that oxidized various biomass substrates ranging from water&#8208;soluble glycerol to insoluble cellulose.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising method to provide both a clean energy resource in the form of hydrogen (H2) and valuable chemicals as the results of water reduction and biomass oxidation. To overcome the poor contact between heterogeneous photocatalysts and biomass substrates, we fabricated a new photoredox cascade catalyst by combining a homogeneous catalyst, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine 1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO), and a heterogeneous dual&#8208;dye sensitized photocatalyst (DDSP) composed of two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridine photosensitizers (RuP6 and RuCP6) and Pt&#8208;loaded TiO2 nanoparticles. During blue&#8208;light irradiation (&#955;=460&#177;15&#8197;nm; 80&#8197;mW), the DDSP photocatalytically reduced aqueous protons to form H2 and simultaneously oxidized TEMPO&#8226; radicals to generate catalytically active TEMPO+. It oxidized biomass substrates (water&#8208;soluble glycerol and insoluble cellulose) to regenerate TEMPO&#8226;. In the presence of N&#8208;methyl imidazole as a proton transfer mediator, the photocatalytic H2 production activities for glycerol and cellulose reforming reached 2670 and 1590&#8197;&#956;mol H2 (gTiO2)&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which were comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art heterogeneous photocatalysts.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Studies of Soluble Inorganic Nanostructures with X&#8208;rays and Neutrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced X&#8208;ray scattering and absorption as well as neutron scattering can extract structural information describing assembly and supramolecular assembly of soluble inorganic nanostructures (SoINs). Here we review the use of X&#8208;rays and neutrons for SoIN characterization, covering basic principles, practices, data analysis, and recent relevant studies that probe the solution state of materials/inorganic chemistry.







Abstract
This Review addresses the use of X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering as well as X&#8208;ray absorption to describe how inorganic nanostructured materials assemble, evolve, and function in solution. We first provide an overview of techniques and instrumentation (both large user facilities and benchtop). We review recent studies of soluble inorganic nanostructure assembly, covering the disciplines of materials synthesis, processes in nature, nuclear materials, and the widely applicable fundamental processes of hydrophobic interactions and ion pairing. Reviewed studies cover size regimes and length scales ranging from sub&#8208;&#197;ngstr&#246;m (coordination chemistry and ion pairing) to several nanometers (molecular clusters, i.e. polyoxometalates, polyoxocations, and metal&#8208;organic polyhedra), to the mesoscale (supramolecular assembly processes). Reviewed studies predominantly exploit 1)&#8197;SAXS/WAXS/SANS (small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray or neutron scattering), 2)&#8197;PDF (pair&#8208;distribution function analysis of X&#8208;ray total scattering), and 3)&#8197;XANES and EXAFS (X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, respectively). While the scattering techniques provide structural information, X&#8208;ray absorption yields the oxidation state in addition to the local coordination. Our goal for this Review is to provide information and inspiration for the inorganic/materials science communities that may benefit from elucidating the role of solution speciation in natural and synthetic processes.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Role of Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Tethered Benzimidazolium Cation in Promoting CO2/Pure Water Co&#8208;Electrolysis to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through investigating the organic cation effect on CO2 electroreduction, benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) was found to synergistically enhance CO2 to C2+ product (mainly C2H4) conversion over Cu electrode. As a result, the use of Beim+&#8208;containing alkaline ionomer yielded a high C2H4 partial current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), as a promising route to realize negative carbon emissions, is known to be strongly affected by electrolyte cations (i.e., cation effect). In contrast to the widely&#8208;studied alkali cations in liquid electrolytes, the effect of organic cations grafted on alkaline polyelectrolytes (APE) remains unexplored, although APE has already become an essential component of CO2 electrolyzers. Herein, by studying the organic cation effect on CO2RR, we find that benzimidazolium cation (Beim+) significantly outperforms other commonly&#8208;used nitrogenous cations (R4N+) in promoting C2+ (mainly C2H4) production over copper electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that the Beim+ can synergistically boost the CO2 to *CO conversion and reduce the proton supply at the electrocatalytic interface, thus facilitating the *CO dimerization toward C2+ formation. By utilizing the homemade APE ionomer, we further realize efficient C2H4 production at an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 331&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from CO2/pure water co&#8208;electrolysis, thanks to the dual&#8208;role of Beim+ in synergistic catalysis and ionic conduction. This study provides a new avenue to boost CO2RR through the structural design of polyelectrolytes.

A key intermediate in bioinspired umpolung of nucleophiles is an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication. We identify that the meso&#8208;substituent of the porphyrin controls its accessibility and report the detailed study of an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication with the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin ligand. We investigate the dynamics of the system and extensively characterize the species, providing crucial information for future catalyst design. Finally, we correlate the meso&#8208;substituent nature to catalytic chlorination reactivity.







Abstract
Isoporphyrins have recently been identified as remarkable species capable of turning the nucleophile attached to the porphyrin ring into an electrophile, thereby providing umpolung of reactivity (Inorg. Chem. 2022, 61, 8105&#8211;8111). They are generated by nucleophilic attack on an iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication, a class of species that has received scant attention. Here, we explore the effect of the porphyrin meso&#8208;substituent and report a iron(III) &#960;&#8208;dication bearing the meso&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) ligand. We provide an extensive study of the species by UV/Vis absorption, 2H&#8197;NMR, EPR, applied field M&#246;ssbauer, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. We further explore the system's highly dynamic and tunable properties and address the nature of the axial ligands as well as the conformation of the porphyrin ring. The insights presented are essential for the rational design of catalysts for the umpolung of nucleophiles. Such catalytic avenues could for example provide a novel method for electrophilic chlorinations. We further examine the importance of electronic tuning of the porphyrin by nature of the meso&#8208;substituent as a factor in catalyst design.

         <title>Green Solvent Processable, Asymmetric Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Layer Material for Efficient and Stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hole transport layer material (BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O) for perovskite solar cells is designed, introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. It capable of achieving high crystallinity even when processed from green solvents. The n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O without dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The corresponding scaled modules (15.64&#8197;cm2) also deliver high PCEs over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
The use of dopant&#8208;free hole transport layers (HTLs) is critical in stabilizing n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs). However, these HTL materials are often processed with toxic solvents, which is not ideal for industrial production. Upon substituting them with green solvents, a trade&#8208;off emerges between maintaining the high crystallinity of the HTL materials and ensuring high solubility in the new solvents. In this paper, we designed a novel, linear, organic small molecule, BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O, by introducing an asymmetric polar oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain. This method not only overcomes the solubility limitations in green solvents but also enables stacking the conjugated main chains in two patterns, which further enhances crystallinity and hole mobility. As a result, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p pero&#8208;SCs based on chlorobenzene&#8208; or green (natural compound) solvent 3&#8208;methylcyclohexanone&#8208;processed BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL that without any dopant delivered world&#8208;recorded power conversion efficiencies of 24.11&#8201;% (certified of 23.82&#8201;%) and 23.53&#8201;%, respectively. The devices also demonstrated remarkable operational and high&#8208;temperature stabilities, maintaining over 84&#8201;% and 79.5&#8201;% of their initial efficiency for 2000&#8197;h, respectively. Encouragingly, dopant&#8208;free BDT&#8208;C8&#8208;3O HTL exhibits significant advantages in large&#8208;area fabrication, achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCEs exceeding 20&#8201;% for 5&#215;5&#8197;cm2 modules (active area: 15.64&#8197;cm2), even when processed using green solvents.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Intramolecular Aggregation&#8208;induced Electrochemiluminescence by Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based Supramolecular Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures are systematically studied. Their strong ECL emission is attributed to the following three factors: (i) the free rotation of the benzene ring is restricted, (ii) intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the conjugated donor&#8208;acceptor architecture, and (iii) electrostatic interactions between Zn2+ and the electrode surface.







Abstract
The precisely modulated synthesis of programmable light&#8208;emitting materials remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we construct four tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based supramolecular architectures (SA, SB, SC, and SD), revealing that they exhibit higher electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensities and efficiencies than the tetraphenylethylene monomer and can be classified as highly efficient and precisely modulated intramolecular aggregation&#8211;induced electrochemiluminescence (PI&#8208;AIECL) systems. The best&#8208;performing system (SD) shows a high ECL cathodic efficiency exceeding that of the benchmark tris(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) chloride in aqueous solution by nearly six&#8208;fold. The electrochemical characterization of these architectures in an organic solvent provides deeper mechanistic insights, revealing that SD features the lowest electrochemical band gap. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the band gap of the guest ligand in the SD structure is the smallest and most closely matched to that of the host scaffold. Finally, the SD system is used to realize ECL&#8208;based cysteine detection (detection limit=14.4&#8197;nM) in real samples. Thus, this study not only provides a precisely modulated supramolecular strategy allowing chromophores to be controllably regulated on a molecular scale, but also inspires the programmable synthesis of high&#8208;performance aggregation&#8208;induced electrochemiluminescence emitters.

         <title>Rational Design of Porous Ionic Liquids for Coupling Natural Gas Purification with Waste Gas Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>

We for the first time report a type of porous ionic liquids that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products.







Abstract
Removal of trace impurities for natural gas purification coupled with waste gas conversion is highly desired in industry. We here report a type of porous ionic liquids (PILs) that can realize the continuous flow separation of CH4/CO2/H2S and the conversion of the captured H2S to useful products. The PILs are synthesized through a step&#8208;by&#8208;step surface modification of ionic liquids (ILs) onto UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH nanocrystals. The introduction of free tertiary amine groups on the nanocrystal surface endows these PILs with an exceptional ability to enrich H2S from CO2 and CH4 with impressive selectivity, while the permanent pores of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH act as containers to store an exceptionally higher amount of the selectively captured H2S than the corresponding nonporous ILs. Simultaneously, the tertiary amines as dual functional moieties offer effective catalytic sites for the conversion of the H2S stored in PILs into 3&#8208;mercaptoisobutyric acid, a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Captopril (an antihypertensive drug). Molecular dynamics, density functional theory calculations and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations help understand both the mechanisms of separation and catalysis performance, confirming that the tertiary amines as well as the permanent pores in UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH play vital roles in the whole procedure.

         <title>Aldol Condensation for the Construction of Organic Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldol&#8208;condensation&#8208;derived organic functional materials have exerted a profound influence on n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic thermoelectrics (OTEs), and NIR&#8208;II photothermal conversion. This all&#8208;encompassing Review highlights the recent decade's developments, charting the course for progress in this growing and multidisciplinary domain.







Abstract
Aldol condensation is a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable synthetic method, offering the advantages of low complexity, substrate universality, and high efficiency.

Fabrication of Pillar&#8208;Cage Fluorinated Anion Pillared Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via a Pillar Embedding Strategy and Efficient Separation of SO2 through Multi&#8208;Site Trapping







Abstract
Flue gas desulfurization is crucial for both human health and ecological environments. However, developing efficient SO2 adsorbents that can break the trade&#8208;off between adsorption capacity and selectivity is still challenging. In this work, a new type of fluorinated anion&#8208;pillared metal&#8211;organic frameworks (APMOFs) with a pillar&#8208;cage structure is fabricated through pillar&#8208;embedding into a highly porous and robust framework. This type of APMOFs comprises smaller tetrahedral cages and larger icosahedral cages interconnected by embedded [NbOF5]2&#8722; and [TaOF5]2&#8722; anions acting as pillars. The APMOFs exhibits high porosity and density of fluorinated anions, ensuring exceptional SO2 adsorption capacity and ultrahigh selectivity for SO2/CO2 and SO2/N2 gas mixtures. Furthermore, these two structures demonstrate excellent stability towards water, acid/alkali, and SO2 adsorption. Cycle dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm the excellent separation performance of SO2/CO2 gas mixtures and their cyclic stability. SO2&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferred adsorption domains for SO2 molecules. The multiple&#8208;site host&#8211;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions facilitate selective recognition and dense packing of SO2 in this hybrid porous material. This work will be instructive for designing porous materials for flue gas desulfurization and other gas&#8208;purification processes.

         <title>N=8 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons: Solution Synthesis and High Charge Carrier Mobility
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N=8 armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs) were successfully synthesized in solution utilizing a custom arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibits a noteworthy near&#8208;infrared absorption profile which signifies an exceptionally low optical band gap of 0.52&#8197;eV and demonstrates a record high dc charge&#8208;carrier mobility of up to 270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Structurally defined graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have emerged as promising candidates for nanoelectronic devices. Low band gap (&lt;1&#8197;eV) GNRs are particularly important when considering the Schottky barrier in device performance. Here, we demonstrate the first solution synthesis of 8&#8208;AGNRs through a carefully designed arylated polynaphthalene precursor. The efficiency of the oxidative cyclodehydrogenation of the tailor&#8208;made polymer precursor into 8&#8208;AGNRs was validated by FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV/Vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption spectroscopy, and further supported by the synthesis of naphtho[1,2,3,4&#8208;ghi]perylene derivatives (1 and 2) as subunits of 8&#8208;AGNR, with a width of 0.86&#8197;nm as suggested by the X&#8208;ray single crystal analysis. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and solid&#8208;state NMR analyses provided further structural support for 8&#8208;AGNR. The resulting 8&#8208;AGNR exhibited a remarkable NIR absorption extending up to &#8764;2400&#8197;nm, corresponding to an optical band gap as low as &#8764;0.52&#8197;eV. Moreover, optical&#8208;pump TeraHertz&#8208;probe spectroscopy revealed charge&#8208;carrier mobility in the dc limit of &#8764;270&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the 8&#8208;AGNR.

         <title>A Reversible Six&#8208;Electron Transfer Cathode for Advanced Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite with facilitated electrochemical kinetics and feasible thermodynamics is proposed as a promising six&#8208;electron transfer cathode for aqueous Zn batteries. The reversible three&#8208;phase conversion (TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe) and proton&#8208;dependent reaction mechanism of the nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C composite is newly revealed and unambiguously verified.







Abstract
The electrochemical reactions for the storage of Zn2+ while embracing more electron transfer is a foundation of the future high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries. Herein, we report a six&#8208;electron transfer electrochemistry of nano&#8208;sized TeO2/C (n&#8208;TeO2/C) cathode by facilitating the reversible conversion of TeO2&#8596;Te and Te&#8596;ZnTe. Benefitting from the integrated conductive nanostructure and the proton&#8208;rich environment in providing optimized electrochemical kinetics (facilitated Zn2+ uptake and high electronic conductivity) and feasible thermodynamic process (low Gibbs free energy change), the as&#8208;prepared n&#8208;TeO2/C with stable cycling performance exhibits a superior reversible capacity of over 800&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. A precise understanding of the reaction mechanism via ex situ and in situ characterizations presents that the reversible six&#8208;electron transfer reaction is proton&#8208;dependent, and a proton generating and consuming mechanism of three&#8208;phase conversion n&#8208;TeO2/C in the weakly acidic electrolyte is thoroughly revealed.

         <title>Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents Enable Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Achiral Luminophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation of an achiral fluorescent dye in a chiral deep eutectic solvent enables the generation of full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Herein, chiral deep eutectic solvents (DES) are prepared by lauric acid as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and chiral menthol as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). When achiral fluorescent molecules are dopedin the menthol&#8208;based chiral DES, they emit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with handedness controlled by the molecular chirality (l or d) of menthol. Remarkably, the strategy is universal and a series of achiral fluorescent molecules can be endowed with CPL activity, showing a full&#8208;color and white CPL upon appropriate mixing, which paves the way to prepare white CPL materials. Interestingly, CPL appears only in a certain temperature range in the DES. Variable&#8208;temperature spectra and other characterization methods reveal that the H&#8208;bond network in the chiral DES plays an important role in inducing CPL. This work unveils how the interior structure as well as the hydrogen&#8208;bond network of a chiral DES can transfer its chirality to achiral luminophores for the first time and realizes a full&#8208;color and white CPL in a DES.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electron Buffer Layer on ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4 Boosts Ethanol Synthesis from CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon&#8208;based electron buffer layer was employed to neutralize the excessive electrons transferred from ZnOx to Fe species. A suitable CO adsorption strength and C&#8722;C coupling barrier was achieved as a consequence of the Fe&#8208;based active sites, yielding a high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 from CO2+H2. The result differs from the common ZnFe bimetallic catalyst for which hydrocarbons dominate.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into ethanol with renewable H2 has attracted tremendous attention due to its integrated functions of carbon elimination and chemical synthesis, but remains challenging. The electronic properties of a catalyst are essential to determine the adsorption strength and configuration of the key intermediates, therefore altering the reaction network for targeted synthesis. Herein, we describe a catalytic system in which a carbon buffer layer is employed to tailor the electronic properties of the ternary ZnOx&#8722;Fe5C2&#8722;Fe3O4, in which the electron&#8208;transfer pathway (ZnOx&#8594;Fe species or carbon layer) ensures the appropriate adsorption strength of &#8722;CO* on the catalytic interface, facilitating C&#8722;C coupling between &#8722;CHx* and &#8722;CO* for ethanol synthesis. Benefiting from this unique electron&#8208;transfer buffering effect, an extremely high ethanol yield of 366.6&#8197;gEtOH&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 (with CO of 10&#8197;vol&#8201;% co&#8208;feeding) is achieved from CO2 hydrogenation. This work provides a powerful electronic modulation strategy for catalyst design in terms of highly oriented synthesis.

         <title>Azopolyesters with Intrinsic Crystallinity and Photoswitchable Reversible Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Liquid Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters (azopolyesters) from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides possess remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and novel photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities, owing to photoinduced trans&#8208;cis isomerizations of azobenzenes being inlaid with soft alkyl side&#8208;chain. This represents a new design strategy for the synthesis of reversible adhesives.







Abstract
Herein, we introduce a variety of azopolyesters (azobenzene&#8208;based polyesters) with remarkable intrinsic crystallinity and photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition abilities from copolymerization of azobenzene&#8208;based epoxides with cyclic anhydrides. The length of the soft alkyl side&#8208;chain inlaid with azobenzenes and stereoregularity of main&#8208;chain of azopolymers have tremendous effects on crystallization properties of the resulting polyesters with melting temperature (Tm) in the range of 51&#8211;251&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, some of azopolyesters possess excellently photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transition performance thanks to trans&#8208;cis photoisomerization of azobenzenes. Trans&#8208;azopolyesters are yellow solids with Tms or glass transition temperatures (Tgs) above room temperature, whereas cis&#8208;polymers are red liquids with Tgs below &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. These azopolyesters could be applied as novel light&#8208;switchable adhesives for quartz/quartz, wood/wood and quartz/wood adhesion, with the strength in the range of 0.73&#8211;0.89&#8197;MPa for trans&#8208;polymers. Conversely, the adhesion strength of liquefied cis&#8208;azopolyesters generated from the irradiation of trans&#8208;polymers by UV light was about 0.1&#8197;MPa, which shows light enable to control the adhesion process with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Locking the Conformation of a Paddlewheel Rhodium Complex: Design, Synthesis, and Applications in Catalytic Nitrene Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design principle for the modification of Rh2(esp)2 is presented. The introduction of a subtle substituent can freeze the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst, allowing for the isolation of two conformationally distinct complexes. The utility of the conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts has been demonstrated in three model cases.







Abstract
The exponential proliferation of conformers makes it impossible to examine the entire population in most systems. Controlling conformational ensembles is thus pivotal in many areas of chemistry. Rh2(esp)2, a dicarboxylate&#8208;derived paddlewheel rhodium complex, is one of the most effective catalysts for nitrene chemistry. Its enormous success has led to preparing many analogous complexes. However, there has been little consideration for the conformational dynamics of the parent catalyst. Herein, we report a new ligand modification principle that prevents conformer interconversion. The resulting complex comprises two isolable conformers, whose structures have been determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Combined experimental and computational data has revealed similarities and dissimilarities between the conformationally confined and parent complexes. Three model cases have demonstrated the utility of conformational fixation in the development of stereoselective catalysts for nitrene transfer reactions. The design principle described in this study can be combined with other established modification strategies, serving as a springboard for further advancement of the chemistry of paddlewheel metal complexes.

         <title>Biogenetic Chiral Deep Eutectic Solvents that Produce Self&#8208;Assembled Chiroptical Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer of chirality from chiral deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to achiral solutes has been used to control self&#8208;assembly. The DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, with chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids occurring through the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the solutes during aggregation.







Abstract
Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) show particular properties compared to ionic liquids and other traditional organic solvents. Controlled synthesis of chiral materials in DESs is unprecedented due to the complex interplays between DESs and solutes. In this work, all bio&#8208;derived chiral DESs were prepared using choline chloride or cyclodextrin as hydrogen bonding acceptors and natural chiral acids as donors, which performed as chiral matrices for the rational synthesis of chiroptical materials by taking advantage of the efficient chirality transfer between the DESs and solutes. In a very selective manner, building units with molecular pockets could facilitate strong binding affinity towards chiral acid components of DESs disregarding the presence of competitive hydrogen bonding acceptors. Chirality transfer from DESs to nanoassemblies leads to chirality amplification in the presence of minimal amounts of entrapped chiral acids, thanks to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of solutes during aggregation. This work utilizes chiral DESs to control supramolecular chirality, and illustrates the structural basis for the fabrication of DES&#8208;based chiral materials.

         <title>Alignment of Heptagonal Diimide and Triazine Enables Narrowband Pure&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The endeavor to develop high&#8208;performance narrowband blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with low efficiency roll&#8208;off represents an attractive challenge. Herein, we introduce a hetero&#8208;acceptor design strategy centered around the heptagonal diimide (BPI) building block to create an efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer. The alignment of a twisted BPI unit and a planar diphenyltriazine (TRZ) fragment imparts remarkable exciton dynamic properties to 26tCz&#8208;TRZBPI, including a fast radiative decay rate (kR) of 1.0 &#215; 107 s&#8208;1 and a swift reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.8 &#215; 106 s&#8208;1, complemented by a slow non&#8208;radiative decay rate (kNR) of 6.0 &#215; 103 s&#8208;1.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endeavor to develop high-performance narrowband blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with low efficiency roll-off represents an attractive challenge. Herein, we introduce a hetero-acceptor design strategy centered around the heptagonal diimide (BPI) building block to create an efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizer. The alignment of a twisted BPI unit and a planar diphenyltriazine (TRZ) fragment imparts remarkable exciton dynamic properties to 26tCz-TRZBPI, including a fast radiative decay rate (kR) of 1.0 &#215; 107 s-1 and a swift reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) of 1.8 &#215; 106 s-1, complemented by a slow non-radiative decay rate (kNR) of 6.0 &#215; 103 s-1. Consequently, 26tCz-TRZBPI facilitates the fabrication of high-performance narrowband pure-blue TADF-sensitized fluorescence OLEDs (TSF-OLEDs) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.3% and low efficiency roll-off even at a high brightness level of 10000 cd m-2 (EQE10000: 16.8%). This showcases a record-breaking external quantum efficiency at a high luminance level of 10000 cd m-2 for narrowband blue TSF-OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Gas&#8208;Phase Hydrogenation of CO2 to Methanol Catalysed by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Large scale production of green methanol obtained from CO2 and green hydrogen is a highly wanted process due to the role of methanol as hydrogen/energy carrier and for the production of chemicals. Starting with a short summary of the advantages of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as catalysts in liquid&#8208;phase reactions, the present article highlights the opportunities that MOFs may offer also for some gas&#8208;phase reactions, in particular for the selective CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. It is commented that there is a temperature compatibility window that combines the thermal stability of some MOFs with the temperature required in the CO2 hydrogenation to methanol that frequently ranges from 250 to 300 oC. The existing literature in this area is briefly summarized organized according to the role of MOF as providing the active sites or as support of active metal nanoparticles. Emphasis is made to show how the flexibility in design and synthesis of MOFs can be used to enhance the catalytic activity by adjusting the composition of the nodes and the structure of the linkers. The influence of structural defects and material crystallinity, as well as the role that should play theoretical calculations in models have been also highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Co doped 1T&#8208;MoS2 Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst will determine the mass distributions of hydrogen&#8208;powered clean technologies, while still faces grand challenges. In this work, a synergistic ligand modulation plus Co doping strategy is applied to 1T&#8208;MoS2 catalyst via CoMo&#8208;metal&#8208;organic frameworks precursors, boosting the HER catalytic activity and durability of 1T&#8208;MoS2. Confirmed by Cs corrected transmission electron microscope and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, the polydentate 1,2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)ethane ligand can stably link with two&#8208;dimensional 1T&#8208;MoS2 layers through cobalt sites to expand interlayer spacing of MoS2 (Co&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;bpe), which promotes active site exposure, accelerates water dissociation, and optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H in alkaline HER processes. Theoretical calculations indicate the promotions in the electronic structure of 1T&#8208;MoS2 originate in the formation of three&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic constructs by linking &#960;&#8208;conjugated ligand, which weakens the hybridization between Mo&#8208;3d and S&#8208;2p orbitals, and in turn makes S&#8208;2p orbital more suitable for hybridization with H&#8208;1s orbital. Therefore, Co&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;bpe exhibits excellent stability and exceedingly low overpotential for alkaline HER (118 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2). In addition, integrated into an anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzer, Co&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;bpe is much superior to the Pt/C catalyst at the large current densities. This study provides a feasible ligand modulation strategy for designs of two&#8208;dimensional catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Desymmetrization of Geminal Difluoromethylenes using a Palladium/Copper/Lithium Ternary System for the Stereodivergent Synthesis of Fluorinated Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated amino acids and related peptides/proteins have been found widespread applications in pharmaceutical and agricultural compounds. However, strategies for introducing a C&#8208;F bond into amino acids in an enantioselective manner are still limited and no such asymmetric catalysis strategy has been reported. Herein, we have successfully developed a Pd/Cu/Li ternary system for stereodivergent synthesis of chiral fluorinated amino acids. This method involves a sequential desymmetrization of geminal difluoromethylenes and allylic substitution with amino acid Schiff bases via Pd/Li and Pd/Cu dual activation, respectively. A series of non&#8208;natural amino acids bearing a chiral allylic/benzylic fluorine motif are easily synthesized in high yields with excellent regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and &gt;99% ee). A density functional theory (DFT) study revealed the F&#8208;Cu interaction of the allylic substrate and the Cu catalyst significantly influence the stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel and efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed regioselective and stereodivergent ring&#8208;closing reaction of aminoenynes with aldehydes and boronic acids or hydrosilane is developed. This three&#8208;component reaction allows for the modular synthesis of a series of exocyclic 1,3&#8208;dienes bearing 5&#8208; to 8&#8208;membered saturated N&#8208;heterocycles. The reactions utilize a simple Pd&#8208;catalyst and work with broad range of aminoenynes, aldehydes and organometallic reagents under mild reaction conditions. The products represent useful intermediates for chemical synthesis due to the versatility of the conjugated diene. Preliminary mechanistic details of the method are also revealed.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and convenient approach that combines high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) with machine learning (ML) technologies to achieve the first selective cross&#8208;dimerization of sulfoxonium ylides via iridium catalysis is presented. A variety of valuable amide&#8208;, ketone&#8208;, ester&#8208;, and N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted unsymmetrical E&#8208;alkenes are synthesized in good yields with high stereoselectivities. This mild method avoids the use of diazo compounds and is characterized by simple operation, high step&#8208;economy, and excellent chemoselectivity and functional group compatibility.&#160;The combined experimental and computational studies identify an amide&#8208;sulfoxonium ylide as a carbene precursor. Furthermore, a comprehensive exploration of the reaction space is also performed (600 reactions) and a machine learning model for reaction yield prediction has been constructed.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Recognition in Water by an Endo&#8208;Functionalized Cavity: Tuning the Complementarity of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precise binding towards structurally similar substrates is a common feature of biomolecular recognition. However, achieving such selectivity especially in distinguishing subtle differences in substrates with synthetic hosts can be quite challenging. Herein, we report a novel design strategy of combining different rigid skeletons to adjust the distance of recognition sites within the cavity, which allows for highly selective recognition of hydrogen bonding complementary substrates, such as 4&#8208;chromanone. X&#8208;ray single crystal structures and Density Functional Theory calculations confirmed that the distance of endo&#8208;functionalized groups within the rigid cavity is crucial for achieving high binding selectivity via hydrogen bonding. The thermodynamic data and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a significant influence of the hydrophobic cavity on binding affinity. The new receptor possesses both high selectivity and high affinity, which provide valuable insights for the design of customized receptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C&#8208;H Amination Assisted by an Isolated Iron&#8208;Imido Radical Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report the use of a base metal complex [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe(OEt2)] (1&#8208;OEt2) (pyrpyrr22&#8722; = 3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8208;bis(pyrrolyl)pyridine) as a catalyst for intermolecular amination of Csp3&#8722;H bonds of 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene (2a) using 2,4,6&#8208;trimethyl phenyl azide (3a) as the nitrene source. The reaction is complete within one hour at 80 &#176;C using as low as 2 mol% 1&#8208;OEt2 with control in selectivity for single C&#8722;H amination versus double C&#8722;H amination. Catalytic C&#8722;H amination reactions can be extended to other substrates such as cyclohexadiene and xanthene derivatives and can tolerate a variety of aryl azides having methyl groups in both ortho positions. Under stoichiometric conditions the imido radical species [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{=N(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)] (1&#8208;imido) can be isolated in 56% yield, and spectroscopic, magnetometric, and computational studies confirmed it to be an S = 1 FeIV complex. Complex 1&#8208;imido reacts with 2a to produce the ferrous aniline adduct [(tBupyrpyrr2)Fe{NH(2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H2)(C14H11)}] (1&#8208;aniline) in 45% yield. Lastly, it was found that complexes 1&#8208;imido and 1&#8208;aniline are both competent intermediates in catalytic intermolecular C&#8722;H amination.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Lewis Pairs in the Assembly of Supramolecular Macrocycles, Molecular Cages, Polymers, and 3D&#8208;Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covering an exceptionally wide range of bond strengths, the dynamic nature and facile tunability of dative B&#8208;N bonds is highly attractive when it comes to the assembly of supramolecular polymers and materials. This review offers an overview of advances in the development of functional materials where Lewis pairs (LPs) play a key role in their assembly and critically influence their properties. Specifically, we describe the reversible assembly of linear polymers with interesting optical, electronic and catalytic properties, discrete macrocycles and molecular cages that take up diverse guest molecules and undergo structural changes triggered by external stimuli, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with intriguing interlocked structures that can embed and separate gases such as CO2 and acetylene, and soft polymer networks that serve as recyclable, self&#8208;healing, and responsive thermosets, gels and elastomeric materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensionally (3D) well&#8208;ordered and highly integrated graphene hybrid architectures are considered to be next&#8208;generation multifunctional graphene materials but still remain elusive.

         <title>Absolute CO2/Xenon Separation in Ultramicropore MOF for Anesthetic Gases Regeneration</title>

         <dc:description>
A portable closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery device is highly needed to guarantee sufficient supply for clinical anesthetic purposes. Herein, an innovative way to recover Xe in exhaled anesthetic gases by using hydrolytically stable NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni MOF is reported. The unprecedented CO2/Xe selectivity (825) of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery in exhaled gases, making it an ideal adsorbent for actual Xe anesthesia gas regeneration.







Abstract
Xe is an ideal anesthetic gas, but it has not been widely used in practice due to its high cost and low output. Closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling is an economically viable method to ensure adequate supply in medical use. Herein, we design an innovative way to recover Xe by using a stable fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni to eliminate CO2 from moist exhaled anesthetic gases. Unlike other Xe recovery MOFs with low Xe/CO2 selectivity (less than 10), NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni could achieve absolute molecular sieve separation of CO2/Xe with excellent CO2 selectivity (825). Mixed&#8208;gas breakthrough experiments assert the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni as a molecular sieve adsorbent for the effective and energy&#8208;efficient removal of carbon dioxide with 99.16&#8201;% Xe recovery. Absolute CO2/Xe separation in NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni makes closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery and recycling can be easily realized, demonstrating the potential of NbOFFIVE&#8208;1&#8208;Ni for important anesthetic gas regeneration under ambient conditions.

         <title>Mesoporous Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Catalytic RNA Deprotection and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the pore size of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystal into the mesopore regime (2 to 50&#8197;nm) not only allows RNA molecules to enter but also their chemical conversion within the pores. The orderly aligned metal sites in the pores efficiently catalyse the removal of propargyl carbonate protecting groups from the RNA, restoring their original bioactivity.







Abstract
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with mespores (2 to 50&#8197;nm) allows the inclusion of large biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. However, chemical reaction on the nucleic acids, to further regulate their bioactivity, is yet to be demonstrated within MOF pores. Here, we report the deprotection of carbonate protected RNA molecules (21 to 102&#8197;nt) to restore their original activity using a MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst. Two MOFs, MOF&#8208;626 and MOF&#8208;636 are designed and synthesized, with mesopores of 2.2 and 2.8&#8197;nm, respectively, carrying isolated metal sites (Ni, Co, Cu, Pd, Rh and Ru). The pores favor the entrance of RNA, while the metal sites catalyze C&#8722;O bond cleavage at the carbonate group. Complete conversion of RNA is achieved by Pd&#8208;MOF&#8208;626, 90&#8197;times more efficiently than Pd(NO3)2. MOF crystals are also removable from the aqueous reaction media, leaving a negligible metal footprint, 3.9&#8197;ppb, only 1/55 of that using homogeneous Pd catalysts. These features make MOF potentially suited for bioorthogonal chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;Extending the pore size of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystal into the mesopore regime (2 to 50&#8197;nm) not only allows RNA molecules to enter but also their chemical conversion within the pores. The orderly aligned metal sites in the pores efficiently catalyse the removal of propargyl carbonate protecting groups from the RNA, restoring their original bioactivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with mespores (2 to 50&#8197;nm) allows the inclusion of large biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. However, chemical reaction on the nucleic acids, to further regulate their bioactivity, is yet to be demonstrated within MOF pores. Here, we report the deprotection of carbonate protected RNA molecules (21 to 102&#8197;nt) to restore their original activity using a MOF as a heterogeneous catalyst. Two MOFs, MOF-626 and MOF-636 are designed and synthesized, with mesopores of 2.2 and 2.8&#8197;nm, respectively, carrying isolated metal sites (Ni, Co, Cu, Pd, Rh and Ru). The pores favor the entrance of RNA, while the metal sites catalyze C&#8722;O bond cleavage at the carbonate group. Complete conversion of RNA is achieved by Pd-MOF-626, 90&#8197;times more efficiently than Pd(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. MOF crystals are also removable from the aqueous reaction media, leaving a negligible metal footprint, 3.9&#8197;ppb, only 1/55 of that using homogeneous Pd catalysts. These features make MOF potentially suited for bioorthogonal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Naphth[4]arene: Synthesis, Conformations, and Application in Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Crystalline Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphth[4]arene (NA[4]A), a new kind of macrocyclic arene, is synthesized by a macrocycle conversion approach. Benefiting from the flexible conformation of NA[4]A, two conformation&#8208;dependent supramolecular crystalline assemblies between NA[4]A and TCNB are selectively fabricated, and show color&#8208;tunable fluorescence and two&#8208;photon excited upconversion emission regulated by the macrocyclic conformations.







Abstract
Although the chemistry of macrocyclic arenes has seen rapid development in recent years, the synthesis of new macrocyclic arenes from aromatic rings with no directing groups remains a challenge. In this work, a new macrocyclic arene, naphth[4]arene (NA[4]A), composed of four naphthalene rings bridged by methylene groups, was synthesized using macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;macrocycle conversion. NA[4]A shows 1,3&#8208;alternate and 1,2&#8208;alternate conformations in the solid state, which can be selectively obtained. By supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of NA[4]A and 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in different concentrations and temperatures, two conformation&#8208;dependent crystalline luminescent co&#8208;assemblies 1,2&#8208;NTC and 1,3&#8208;NTC can be selectively prepared. Interestingly, the two charge&#8208;transfer crystalline assemblies containing NA[4]A with different conformations show bright yellow and green fluorescence, and also display high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 45&#8201;% and 43&#8201;%. Furthermore, they exhibit color&#8208;tunable two&#8208;photon excited upconversion emission.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Metal Oxide Interactions in Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 Catalysts Drive Selective and Stable CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts prepared by impregnation evolve into a unique nanostructure under CO2 hydrogenation conditions, leading to selective and stable methanol production. Space and time&#8208;resolved operando characterization and simulations reveal that the rapid restructuring process leads to InPdx alloy particles decorated by InOx layers, whose proximity is crucial to avoiding performance losses typically observed when palladium agglomerates.







Abstract
Ternary Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 catalysts exhibit technological potential for CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis, but developing scalable systems and comprehending complex dynamic behaviors of the active phase, promoter, and carrier are key for achieving high productivity. Here, we show that the structure of Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 systems prepared by wet impregnation evolves under CO2 hydrogenation conditions into a selective and stable architecture, independent of the order of addition of Pd and In phases on the zirconia carrier. Detailed operando characterization and simulations reveal a rapid restructuring driven by the metal&#8208;metal oxide interaction energetics. The proximity of InPdx alloy particles decorated by InOx layers in the resulting architecture prevents performance losses associated with Pd sintering. The findings highlight the crucial role of reaction&#8208;induced restructuring in complex CO2 hydrogenation catalysts and offer insights into the optimal integration of acid&#8208;base and redox functions for practical implementation.

         <title>Reforming the Uniformity of Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Nanoscale Structure Regulation for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is proposed and constructed to improve the uniformity of SEI, in which LiNxOy generated by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives occupies the top layer and LiF formed by lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) dominates the bottom layer next to lithium metal anodes. A lithium metal pouch cell with a specific energy of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at the cell level undergoes 173&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The stability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries depends on the uniformity of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium metal anodes. Rationally improving SEI uniformity is hindered by poorly understanding the effect of structure and components of SEI on its uniformity. Herein, a bilayer structure of SEI formed by isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) additives in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes was demonstrated to improve SEI uniformity. In the bilayer SEI, LiNxOy generated by ISDN occupies top layer and LiF dominates bottom layer next to anode. The uniformity of lithium deposition is remarkably improved with the bilayer SEI, mitigating the consumption rate of active lithium and electrolytes. The cycle life of lithium metal batteries with bilayer SEI is three times as that with common anion&#8208;derived SEI under practical conditions. A prototype lithium metal pouch cell of 430&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 undergoes 173&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates the effect of a reasonable structure of SEI on reforming SEI uniformity.

         <title>Accelerated Multi&#8208;step Sulfur Redox Reactions in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Enabled by Dual Defects in Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>

A novel dual&#8208;defect MOF, which incorporates both linker defects and cluster defects, is reported as a new type of sulfur catalyst to achieve targeted and synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of polysulfides.







Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Accelerated conversion by catalysis can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced Li&#8722;S performance. However, a catalyst with single active site cannot simultaneously accelerate multiple LiPSs conversion. Herein, we developed a novel dual&#8208;defect (missing linker and missing cluster defects) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new type of catalyst to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of LiPSs. Electrochemical tests and first&#8208;principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that different defects can realize targeted acceleration of stepwise reaction kinetics for LiPSs. Specifically, the missing linker defects can selectively accelerate the conversion of S8&#8594;Li2S4, while the missing cluster defects can catalyze the reaction of Li2S4&#8594;Li2S, so as to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. Hence, the Li&#8722;S battery with an electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1 delivers a capacity of 1087&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C after 100&#8197;cycles. Even at high sulfur loading of 12.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and E/S=3.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&#8722;1, an areal capacity of 10.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 45&#8197;cycles can still be obtained.

Electrochemical tests and first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that different defects can realize targeted acceleration of stepwise reaction kinetics for LiPSs. Specifically, the missing linker defects can selectively accelerate the conversion of S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, while the missing cluster defects can catalyze the reaction of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, so as to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect. Hence, the Li&#8722;S battery with an electrolyte to sulfur (E/S) ratio of 8.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; delivers a capacity of 1087&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C after 100&#8197;cycles. Even at high sulfur loading of 12.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and E/S=3.9&#8197;mL&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, an areal capacity of 10.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 45&#8197;cycles can still be obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast and Non&#8208;equilibrium Uptake of Hydrogen by Pd Icosahedral Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon absorbing hydrogen, the PdHx in icosahedral nanocrystals exists in one single phase and the single&#8208;phase pathway can bypass the formation of high&#8208;energy phase boundaries involved in the conventional two&#8208;phase pathway. The single&#8208;phase pathway is instrumental to the facile and fast synthesis of PdHx nanocrystals with controllable compositions for different catalytic applications.







Abstract
We report for the first time that Pd nanocrystals can absorb H via a &#8220;single&#8208;phase pathway&#8221; when particles with a proper combination of shape and size are used. Specifically, when Pd icosahedral nanocrystals of 7&#8208; and 12&#8208;nm in size are exposed to H atoms, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide each particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of phase boundaries is no longer favored. As such, absorption of H atoms is dominated by the single&#8208;phase pathway and one can readily obtain PdHx with anyx in the range of 0&#8211;0.7. When switched to Pd octahedral nanocrystals, the single&#8208;phase pathway is only observed for particles of 7&#8197;nm in size. We also establish that the H&#8208;absorption kinetics will be accelerated if there is a tensile strain in the nanocrystals due to the increase in lattice spacing. Besides the unique H&#8208;absorption behaviors, the PdHx (x=0&#8211;0.7) icosahedral nanocrystals show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward the formic acid oxidation due tothe decrease in chemical potential for H atoms in a Pd lattice under tensile strain.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Phase&#8208;Separating Fluorescent Molecules for Intracellular Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we designed a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight compound that forms molecular coacervates based on liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the aqueous solution. The molecular coacervates deliver proteins into mammalian cells and disperse the payload within the cytosol upon photoillumination. This work showcases a small&#8208;molecule coacervation system and photoresponsive cytosolic protein delivery.







Abstract
Cellular membranes, including the plasma and endosome membranes, are barriers to outside proteins. Various vehicles have been devised to deliver proteins across the plasma membrane, but in many cases, the payload gets trapped in the endosome. Here we designed a photo&#8208;responsive phase&#8208;separating fluorescent molecule (PPFM) with a molecular weight of 666.8 daltons. The PPFM compound condensates as fluorescent droplets in the aqueous solution by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), which disintegrate upon photoirradiation with a 405&#8197;nm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) lamp within 20&#8197;min or a 405&#8197;nm laser within 3&#8197;min. The PPFM coacervates recruit a wide range of peptides and proteins and deliver them into mammalian cells. Photolysis disperses the payload from condensates into the cytosolic space. Altogether, a type of small molecules that are photo&#8208;responsive and phase separating are discovered; their coacervates can serve as transmembrane vehicles for intracellular delivery of proteins, whereas photo illumination triggers the cytosolic distribution of the payload.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Mediated Interbacterial Communication Activates Silent Secondary Metabolite Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bacterial MVs induced silent secondary metabolite production in a wide range of bacteria by imitating interbacterial interactions. X.&#8197;innexi activated the production of xeinamides, xeidopeptides and xenoamicins through quorum sensing suppression by B.&#8197;multivorans MVs treatment. Xenoamicins carried in X.&#8197;innexi MVs suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, indicating interbacterial hostile interaction by MVs and secondary metabolites.







Abstract
Most bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are &#8220;silent BGCs&#8221; that are expressed poorly or not at all under normal culture conditions. However, silent BGCs, even in part, may be conditionally expressed in response to external stimuli in the original bacterial habitats. The growing knowledge of bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) suggests that they could be promising imitators of the exogenous stimulants, especially given their functions as signaling mediators in bacterial cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication. Therefore, we envisioned that MVs added to bacterial cultures could activate diverse silent BGCs. Herein, we employed Burkholderia multivorans MVs, which induced silent metabolites in a wide range of bacteria in Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla. A mechanistic analysis of MV&#8208;induced metabolite production in Xenorhabdus innexi suggested that the B.&#8197;multivorans MVs activate silent metabolite production by inhibiting quorum sensing in X.&#8197;innexi. In turn, the X.&#8197;innexi MVs carrying some MV&#8208;induced peptides suppressed the growth of B.&#8197;multivorans, highlighting the interspecies communication between B.&#8197;multivorans and X.&#8197;innexi through MV exchange.

         <title>Consecutive Single&#8208;Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Isomerization of Novel Octamolybdate Anions within a Microporous Hybrid Framework with Robust Water Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three sequential thermally&#8208;triggered single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal isomerizations of novel octamolybdate anions occur within a hybrid coordination network formed by the assembly of polyoxometalate clusters and copper(II)&#8208;complexes of a macrocyclic tetraaza ligand. Up to three different microporous phases with accessible voids can be isolated, which exhibit robust water sorption properties.







Abstract
The 3D hybrid framework [{Cu(cyclam)}3(&#954;&#8208;Mo8O27)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (1) (cyclam=1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradecane) undergoes sequential single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformations upon heating to afford two different anhydrous phases (2&#8201;a and 3&#8201;a). These transitions modify the framework dimensionality and enable the isomerization of &#954;&#8208;octamolybdate (&#954;&#8208;Mo8) anions into &#955; (2&#8201;a) and &#956; (3&#8201;a) forms through metal migration. Hydration of 3&#8201;a involves condensation of one water molecule to the cluster to afford the &#947;&#8208;Mo8 isomer in 4, which dehydrates back into 3&#8201;a through the 6&#8201;a intermediate. In contrast, 2&#8201;a reversibly hydrates to form 5, exhibiting the same Mo8 cluster as that of 1. It is remarkable that three of the Mo8 clusters (&#954;, &#955; and &#956;) are new and that up to three different microporous phases can be isolated from 1 (2&#8201;a, 3&#8201;a, and 6&#8201;a). Water vapor sorption analyses show high recyclability and the highest uptake values for POM&#8208;based systems. The isotherms display an abrupt step at low humidity level desirable for humidity control devices or water harvesting in drylands.

Hydration of &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; involves condensation of one water molecule to the cluster to afford the &#947;-Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; isomer in &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, which dehydrates back into &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; through the &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; intermediate. In contrast, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; reversibly hydrates to form &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, exhibiting the same Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cluster as that of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. It is remarkable that three of the Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; clusters (&#954;, &#955; and &#956;) are new and that up to three different microporous phases can be isolated from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;6&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;). Water vapor sorption analyses show high recyclability and the highest uptake values for POM-based systems. The isotherms display an abrupt step at low humidity level desirable for humidity control devices or water harvesting in drylands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of Heptacoordinated FeIII Bifunctional Complexes for Efficient Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, [Fe2L2(H2O)2(SO4)].2(CH4O)] (C2), has been designed to optimize H2O splitting activity via strategically altering the ligand substitution. The favourable structural conformation with bridging &#8722;SO42&#8722; and engineered electronic environment facilitate the intramolecular oxo&#8208;oxo coupling leading to O&#8722;O bond formation during electrolysis, which effectively enhanced the catalytic functionalities of C2.







Abstract
In this research, highly efficient heterogeneous bifunctional (BF) electrocatalysts (ECs) have been strategically designed by Fe coordination (CR) complexes, [Fe2L2(H2O)2Cl2] (C1) and [Fe2L2(H2O)2(SO4)].2(CH4O) (C2) where the high seven CR number synergistically modifies the electronic environment of the Fe centre for facilitation of H2O electrolysis. The electronic status of Fe and its adjacent atomic sites have been further modified by the replacement of &#8722;Cl&#8722; in C1 by &#8722;SO42&#8722; in C2. Interestingly, compared to C1, the O&#8722;S&#8722;O bridged C2 reveals superior BF activity with extremely low overpotential (&#951;) at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (140&#8197;mVOER, 62&#8197;mVHER) and small Tafel slope (120.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1OER, 45.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1HER). Additionally, C2 also facilitates a high&#8208;performance alkaline H2O electrolyzer with cell voltage of 1.54&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits remarkable long&#8208;term stability. Thus, exploration of the intrinsic properties of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based ECs opens up a new approach to the rational design of a wide range of molecular catalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical Reversible Reforming between Ethylamine and Acetonitrile on Heterostructured Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a successful development of an ethylenediamine&#8208;acetonitrile electrochemical reversible reformation system was achieved, utilizing a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 heterostructured catalyst synthesized through an in situ construction strategy as the multifunctional catalyst.







Abstract
Rational design of electrocatalysts is essential to achieve desirable performance of electrochemical synthesis process. Heterostructured catalysts have thus attracted widespread attention due to their multifunctional intrinsic properties, and diverse catalytic applications with corresponding outstanding activities. Here, we report an in situ restoration strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets. Such Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit excellent activity and selectivity towards reversible electrochemical reforming of ethylamine and acetonitrile. In the acetonitrile reduction process, Pd acts as reaction center, while Ni(OH)2 provide proton hydrogen through promoting the dissociation of water. Also ethylamine oxidation process can be achieved on the surface of the heterostructured nanosheets with abundant Ni(II) defects. More importantly, an electrolytic cell driven by solar cells was successfully constructed to realize ethylamine&#8208;acetonitrile reversible reforming. This work demonstrates the importance of heterostructure engineering in the rational synthesis of multifunctional catalysts towards electrochemical synthesis of fine chemicals.

Two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based organic semiconductors were designed and synthesized. They demonstrate a high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield of 46&#8211;67&#8201;% and typical ambipolar transport character in simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistors. High quality blue electroluminescence CIE (0.179, 0.119) with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm is achieved.







Abstract
The development of blue&#8208;emissive ambipolar organic semiconductor is an arduous target due to the large energy gap, but is an indispensable part for electroluminescent device, especially for the transformative display technology of simple&#8208;structured organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (SS&#8208;OLET). Herein, we designed and synthesized two new dibenzothiophene sulfone&#8208;based high mobility blue&#8208;emissive organic semiconductors (DNaDBSOs), which demonstrate superior optical property with solid&#8208;state photoluminescent quantum yield of 46&#8211;67&#8201;% and typical ambipolar&#8208;transporting properties in SS&#8208;OLETs with symmetric gold electrodes. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical characterizations reveal the natural of ambipolar property for such blue&#8208;emissive DNaDBSOs&#8208;based materials is ascribed to a synergistic effect on lowering LUMO level and reduced electron injection barrier induced by the interfacial dipoles effect on gold electrodes due to the incorporation of appropriate DBSO unit. Finally, efficient electroluminescence properties with high&#8208;quality blue emission (CIE (0.179, 0.119)) and a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 48&#8197;nm are achieved for DNaDBSO&#8208;based SS&#8208;OLET, showing good spatial control of the recombination zone in conducting channel. This work provides a new avenue for designing ambipolar emissive organic semiconductors by incorporating the synergistic effect of energy level regulation and molecular&#8208;metal interaction, which would advance the development of superior optoelectronic materials and their high&#8208;density integrated optoelectronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Analysis of Rhizonin Biosynthesis Reveals Origin of Pharmacophoric Furylalanine Moieties in Diverse Cyclopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic origin of rhizonins, hepatotoxic cyclopeptides with unusual 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, has been elucidated. Functional analysis of the biosynthesis gene cluster, labeling experiments, and heterologous reconstitution revealed the biosynthetic precursors and a novel dioxygenase (RhzB) that catalyzes Fua formation and allowed the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster by genome mining.

Rhizonin A and B are hepatotoxic cyclopeptides produced by bacterial endosymbionts (Mycetohabitans endofungorum) of the fungus Rhizopus microsporus. Their toxicity critically depends on the presence of 3&#8208;furylalanine (Fua) residues, which also occur in pharmaceutically relevant cyclopeptides of the endolide and bingchamide families. The biosynthesis and incorporation of Fua by non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), however, has remained elusive. By genome sequencing and gene inactivation we elucidated the gene cluster responsible for rhizonin biosynthesis. A suite of isotope labeling experiments identified tyrosine and l&#8208;DOPA as Fua precursors and provided the first mechanistic insight. Bioinformatics, mutational analysis and heterologous reconstitution identified dioxygenase RhzB as necessary and sufficient for Fua formation. RhzB is a novel type of heme&#8208;dependent aromatic oxygenases (HDAO) that enabled the discovery of the bingchamide biosynthesis gene cluster through genome mining.

         <title>Co&#8208;encapsulating Cofactor and Enzymes in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Multienzyme Cascade Reactions with Cofactor Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach that confines a cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade within hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) is presented. The system features excellent cargo loading, cascade activity recovery, and cofactor recycling capabilities. The success of the approach depends on the polyelectrolyte interacting with the HOF monomers in place of enzymes and anchoring cofactors and enzymes within the HOFs.







Abstract
Use of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) for enzyme immobilization faces challenges in the improvement of enzyme activity recovery and the assembly of cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme systems. Herein, we report a polyelectrolyte&#8208;assisted encapsulation approach (PAEA) that enables two cascades with four oxidoreductases and two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) cofactors co&#8208;encapsulated in BioHOF&#8208;1 with excellent cargo loading and over 100&#8201;% cascade activity. The key role of the polyelectrolyte is to coat enzymes and tether NAD(P)H, thus interacting with HOF monomers in place of enzymes, avoiding the destruction of enzymes by HOF monomers. The versatility and efficiency of PAEA are further illustrated by an HOF&#8208;101&#8208;based bio&#8208;nanoreactor. Moreover, the immobilization by PAEA makes enzymes and NAD(P)H display excellent stability and recyclability. This study has demonstrated a facile and versatile PAEA for fabricating cofactor&#8208;dependent multienzyme cascade nanoreactors with HOFs.

         <title>Electronic Configuration Tuning of Centrally Extended Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency Approaching 19&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores were synthesized via a newly developed strategy for organic solar cells, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to &#8776;19&#8201;% were achieved. The properties of new acceptors were systematically investigated and elucidated experimentally and computationally.







Abstract
In the molecular optimizations of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), extending the central core can tune the energy levels, reduce nonradiative energy loss, enhance the intramolecular (donor&#8208;acceptor and acceptor&#8208;acceptor) packing, facilitate the charge transport, and improve device performance. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize acceptors featuring conjugation&#8208;extended electron&#8208;deficient cores. Among these, the acceptor CH&#8208;BBQ, embedded with benzobisthiadiazole, exhibited an optimal fibrillar network morphology, enhanced crystallinity, and improved charge generation/transport in blend films, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 18.94&#8201;% for CH&#8208;BBQ&#8208;based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs; 18.19&#8201;% for binary OSCs) owing to its delicate structure design and electronic configuration tuning. Both experimental and theoretical approaches were used to systematically investigate the influence of the central electron&#8208;deficient core on the properties of the acceptor and device performance. The electron&#8208;deficient core modulation paves a new pathway in the molecular engineering of NFAs, propelling relevant research forward.

         <title>Nucleophilic Carbenes Derived from Dichloromethane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel catalysts promote cyclopropanation reactions of electron&#8208;deficient alkenes using dichloromethane as a methylene source. An asymmetric variant using a chiral pyridine&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand provides access to pharmaceutically relevant 2&#8208;aryl cyclopropyl carboxylates in highly enantioenriched form. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of a nucleophilic nickel carbene that reacts by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination pathway.







Abstract
Nickel PyBox catalysts promote nucleophilic cyclopropanation reactions using CH2Cl2 as a methylene source and Mn as a stoichiometric reductant. The substrate scope includes a broad range of alkenes bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, including esters, amides, ketones, nitriles, sulfones, phosphonate esters, trifluoromethyl groups, and electron&#8208;deficient arenes. Enantioselective cyclopropanations of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters have been developed using chiral PyBox ligands. Mechanistic studies suggest the intermediacy of a (PyBox)Ni=CH2 species, which adds to the alkene by a stepwise [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition/C&#8722;C reductive elimination mechanism. DFT models provide a rationale for the nucleophilic character of the nickel carbene and the sense of enantioinduction.

         <title>Overcoming Cancer Resistance to Platinum Drugs by Inhibiting Cholesterol Metabolism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtIV complexes of fenofibric acid relieve the drug resistance of cancer cells via regulating cholesterol metabolism besides damaging DNA. By inhibiting the expression of cholesterol&#8208;related proteins, the complexes impede the accumulation and promote the removal of cholesterol, leading to both apoptosis and pyroptosis. Cholesterol metabolism provides a new target for potentiating antitumor activity and overcoming the drug resistance of Pt drugs.







Abstract
Drug resistance is a serious challenge for platinum anticancer drugs. Platinum complexes may get over the drug resistance via a distinct mechanism of action. Cholesterol is a key factor contributing to the drug resistance. Inhibiting cellular cholesterol synthesis and uptake provides an alternative strategy for cancer treatment. Platinum(IV) complexes FP and DFP with fenofibric acid as axial ligand(s) were designed to combat the drug resistance through regulating cholesterol metabolism besides damaging DNA. In addition to producing reactive oxygen species and active platinum(II) species to damage DNA, FP and DFP inhibited cellular cholesterol accumulation, promoted cholesterol efflux, upregulated peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#945;), induced caspase&#8208;1 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, thus leading to both apoptosis and pyroptosis in cancer cells. The reduction of cholesterol significantly relieved the drug resistance of cancer cells. The double&#8208;acting mechanism gave the complexes strong anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo, particularly against cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells.

         <title>Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Along the Nonpolar Axis in Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
So far, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has been discussed based on the classical explanation that photocurrent originates from macroscopic polarization. Herein, we report the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs. The light polarization dependence is consistent with the shift current mechanism, which possesses effective features, such as ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature.







Abstract
The origin of the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was considered as a built&#8208;in electric field formed by the macroscopic polarization of materials. Alternatively, the &#8220;shift current mechanism&#8221; has been gradually accepted as the more appropriate description of the BPVE. This mechanism implies that the photocurrent generated by the BPVE is a topological current featuring an ultrafast response and dissipation&#8208;less nature, which is very attractive for photodetector applications. Meanwhile, the origin of the BPVE in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has not been discussed and is still widely accepted as the classical mechanism without any experimental evidence. Herein, we observed the BPVE along the nonpolar axis in OIHPs, which is inconsistent with the classical explanation. Furthermore, based on the nonlinear optical tensor correlation, we substantiated that the BPVE in OIHPs is originated in the shift current mechanism.

         <title>Narrow&#8208;Pore Engineering of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Weak Interaction&#8208;Triggered Multiple Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs with narrow pore sizes of less than 1&#8197;nm were constructed by the condensation of tetramethylpyrazine as the smallest tetratopic monomer with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers. Their aggregates in water feature negative charges and can be tuned through protonation/deprotonation, to give pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa values with high selectivity.







Abstract
Vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as promising crystalline materials, but their narrow pore engineering is severely impeded by the weak reversibility of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond formation reaction, which has led to less exploration of their ultramicroporous structures and properties. Herein, we developed a single aromatic ring&#8208;based tetratopic monomer, tetramethylpyrazine, which undergoes a smooth Knoevenegal condensation at its four arylmethly carbon atoms with linear aromatic dialdehyde monomers upon the self&#8208;catalyzed activation of pyridine nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers in the presence of an organic anhydride. This has resulted in the formation of two vinylene&#8208;linked COFs, which both crystallized in orthorhombic lattices, and layered in AA stacking fashions along the vertical directions. They exhibit high surface areas and well&#8208;tailored ultramicropore sizes up to 0.5&#8197;nm. The unique cross&#8208;linking mode at two pairs of para&#8208;positions of each pyrazine unit through carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds afford them with &#960;&#8208;extended conjugation over the in&#8208;plane backbones and substantial semiconducting characters. The resultant COFs can be well&#8208;dispersed in water to form stable sub&#8208;microparticles with negative charges (zeta potentials: ca. &#8722;30&#8197;mV), and exhibiting tunable aggregation behaviors through protonation/deprotonation. As a consequence, they exhibit pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent colorimetric responses to various anions with different pKa values in high selectivity.

         <title>Electrochemical Nanoreactor Provides a Comprehensive View of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Cancer&#8208;drug Kinetics</title>

Transducing the tightly&#8208;channeled catalytic activity of &#8220;nanoconfined&#8221; enzyme cascades into electrical current affords a powerful and novel way to observe specific enzyme reactions, directly and in real time. Here, the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221; is used to extract detailed kinetic and mechanistic information on the inhibitory action of a high&#8208;profile cancer drug that inhibits a common cancer&#8208;associated variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).







Abstract
The ability to control enzyme cascades entrapped in a nanoporous electrode material (the &#8220;Electrochemical Leaf&#8221;, e&#8208;Leaf) has been exploited to gain detailed kinetic insight into the mechanism of an anti&#8208;cancer drug. Ivosidenib, used to treat acute myeloid leukemia, acts on a common cancer&#8208;linked variant of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1 R132H) inhibiting its &#8220;gain&#8208;of&#8208;function&#8221; activity&#8212;the undesired reduction of 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) to the oncometabolite 2&#8208;hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The e&#8208;Leaf quantifies the kinetics of IDH1 R132H inhibition across a wide and continuous range of conditions, efficiently revealing factors underlying the inhibitor residence time. Selective inhibition of IDH1 R132H by Ivosidenib and another inhibitor, Novartis 224, is readily resolved as a two&#8208;stage process whereby initial rapid non&#8208;inhibitory binding is followed by a slower step to give the inhibitory complex. These kinetic features are likely present in other allosteric inhibitors of IDH1/2. Such details, essential for understanding inhibition mechanisms, are not readily resolved in conventional steady&#8208;state kinetics or by techniques that rely only on measuring binding. Extending the new method and analytical framework presented here to other enzyme systems will be straightforward and should rapidly reveal insight that is difficult or often impossible to obtain using other methods.

         <title>Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H Amidation for the Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208;Diamines</title>

         <dc:description>
A camphorsulfonic acid&#8208;based directing group was designed for the Ir&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines, allowing the synthesis of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic studies provided insights into the matched/mismatched effect observed in the C&#8722;H amidation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines.







Abstract
Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are privileged scaffolds among bioactive natural products, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ligands for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based asymmetric catalysis and organocatalysts. Despite this interest, the construction of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine motifs still remains a challenge. To address this, an iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation reaction was developed. This method relies on the design of a new, cheap and cleavable exo&#8208;protecting/directing group derived from camphorsulfonic acid, which is directly installed from easily accessible precursors, and furnishes scalemic free 1,2&#8208;diamines upon cleavage of both nitrogen substituents. It was found applicable to both &#945;&#8208;secondary and &#945;&#8208;tertiary&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, for which a two&#8208;step protocol involving intermolecular olefin hydroamination and C(sp3)&#8208;H amidation was developed. Kinetic and computational studies provided insights into the observed reactivity difference between pairs of diastereoisomeric substrates.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Free Generation of Cyanocarbenes from Alkynyl Triazenes for the Synthesis of Nitrile Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes using different light sources induced an unusual cleavage of the triazene moiety leading to a methylene nitrile. By varying the reaction conditions, a cyanocarbene and a variety of substitution patterns bearing a nitrile group become selectively available under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions without the use of a toxic cyanating agent or the need for unstable substrates.







Abstract
The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists and especially acid&#8208;induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern involving the cleavage of the N1&#8722;N2 bond of the triazene moiety resulting in a unique approach to cyanocarbenes from a readily available, stable, and insensitive precursor. This allows to access various nitrile compounds without the use of a toxic cyanating agent by exploiting the reactivity pattern of carbenes. By variation of the reaction conditions and light sources, different substitution patterns can be obtained selectively in good yields under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions, thus introducing the alkynyl triazene unit as a photo accessible methylene nitrile synthon. Using this synthon, subclasses like &#945;&#8208;alkoxynitriles, &#945;&#8208;aminonitriles and &#945;&#8208;cyanohydrazones become easily available.

     alt="Light-Induced Metal-Free Generation of Cyanocarbenes from Alkynyl Triazenes for the Synthesis of Nitrile Derivatives"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes using different light sources induced an unusual cleavage of the triazene moiety leading to a methylene nitrile. By varying the reaction conditions, a cyanocarbene and a variety of substitution patterns bearing a nitrile group become selectively available under mild and metal-free conditions without the use of a toxic cyanating agent or the need for unstable substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists and especially acid-induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern involving the cleavage of the N1&#8722;N2 bond of the triazene moiety resulting in a unique approach to cyanocarbenes from a readily available, stable, and insensitive precursor. This allows to access various nitrile compounds without the use of a toxic cyanating agent by exploiting the reactivity pattern of carbenes. By variation of the reaction conditions and light sources, different substitution patterns can be obtained selectively in good yields under mild and metal-free conditions, thus introducing the alkynyl triazene unit as a photo accessible methylene nitrile synthon. Using this synthon, subclasses like &#945;-alkoxynitriles, &#945;-aminonitriles and &#945;-cyanohydrazones become easily available. These exhibit synthetically valuable substitution patterns for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, intermediates for total synthesis and amino acid synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of C60/[10]CPP&#8208;Catenanes by Regioselective, Nanocapsule&#8208;Templated Bingel Bis&#8208;Addition</title>

         <dc:description>
The combination of three approaches (tether, nanohoop template &amp; supramolecular shadow mask) enabled the itero&#8208; and regioselective synthesis of [2]catenanes via bis&#8208;addition of bis&#8208;bromomalonates to the complex C60&#11814;[10]CPP. The use of a &#8220;traceless&#8221; nanocapsule shadow mask was key for obtaining 87&#8201;% selectivity for the &#8220;in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3&#8242;&#8242; product, where the formation of a total of 22 isomers is theoretically possible.







Abstract
The addition of two unsymmetric malonate esters to the Buckminster fullerene C60 can lead to 22 spectroscopically distinguishable isomeric products and therefore represents a formidable synthesis challenge. In this work, we achieve 87&#8201;% selectivity for the formation of a single (in,out&#8208;trans&#8208;3) isomer by combining three approaches: (i) we use a starting material, in which the two malonates are covalently connected (tether approach); (ii) we form the strong supramolecular complex of C60 with the shape&#8208;persistent [10]CPP macrocycle (template approach) and (iii) we embed this complex further within a self&#8208;assembled nanocapsule (shadow mask approach). Variation of the spacer chain shed light on the limitations of the approach and the ring dynamics in the unusual [2]catenanes were studied in silico with atomistic resolution. This work significantly widens the scope of mechanically interlocked architectures comprising cycloparaphenylenes (CPP).

         <title>Biaxially&#8208;Strained Phthalocyanine at Polyoxometalate@Carbon Nanotube Heterostructure Boosts Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is a promising non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based molecular catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To enhance its catalytic activity and long&#8208;term durability, a host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to fabricate FePc&#8208;polyoxometalate@carbon nanotubes with a one&#8208;dimensional ternary heterostructure. The polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated nanotubes are able to tune the structure and ORR performances of FeN4 centers.







Abstract
Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) with unique FeN4 site has attracted increasing interests as a promising non&#8208;precious catalyst. However, the plane symmetric structure endows FePc with undesired catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report a novel one&#8208;dimensional heterostructured ORR catalyst by coupling FePc at polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanotubes (FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NTs) using host&#8208;guest chemistry. The encapsulation of polyoxometalates can induce a local tensile strain of single&#8208;walled NTs to strengthen the interactions with FePc. Both the strain and curvature effects of {PW12}@NT scaffold tune the geometric structure and electronic localization of FeN4 centers to enhance the ORR catalytic performance. As expected, such a heterostructured FePc&#8208;{PW12}@NT electrocatalyst exhibits prominent durability, methanol tolerance, and ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#8197;V and a low Tafel slope of 30.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in alkaline medium. Besides, the assembled zinc&#8208;air battery demonstrates an ultrahigh power density of 280&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, excellent charge/discharge ability and long&#8208;term stability over 500&#8197;h, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 cathode. This study offers a new strategy to design novel heterostructured catalysts and opens a new avenue to regulate the electrocatalytic performance of phthalocyanine molecules.

         <title>Supramolecular Memristor Based on Bistable [2]Catenanes: Toward High&#8208;Density and Non&#8208;Volatile Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular memristors have been successfully fabricated through the introduction of a bistable [2]catenane, which can stablize charge injection effciently. The AuTS&#8208;S&#8208;C3&#8208;SO3&#8722;Na+//[2]catenane//Ga2O3/EGaIn junctions serve as both resistive switches and diodes. The non&#8208;volatile memristors undergo repeated switching cycles of over 1000&#8197;times and a retention time exceeding 500&#8197;seconds under ambient conditions.







Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for data storage and neuromorphic computing calls for innovative, high&#8208;density solutions, such as resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM). However, the integration of resistive switching and rectification at the nanoscale remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we introduce a bistable [2]catenane&#8208;based supramolecular junction that simultaneously functions as a resistive switch and a diode. All supramolecular junctions are highly stable and reproducible over thousands of resistive switching cycles, because the nano&#8208;confinement of two mechanically interlocked rings can stabilize the radical states of pyridinium moieties under ambient conditions. The successful realization of supramolecular junctions in functionality with a thickness of approximately 2&#8197;nm presents a promising avenue for the development of molecule&#8208;scale based RRAM for a better solution to high density and energy efficiency.

         <title>Photoinduced Metallonitrene Formation by N2 Elimination from Azide Diradical Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond ultraviolet&#8208;pump/mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveals that singlet and triplet azide&#8208;anion diradical ligands facilitate the efficient formation of a metallonitrene from a diamagnetic azido precursor.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal nitrides/nitrenes are highly promising reagents for catalytic nitrogen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer reactivity. They are typically prepared in situ upon optically induced N2 elimination from azido precursors. A full exploitation of their catalytic potential, however, requires in&#8208;depth knowledge of the primary photo&#8208;induced processes and the structural/electronic factors mediating the N2 loss with birth of the terminal metal&#8208;nitrogen core. Using femtosecond infrared spectroscopy, we elucidate here the primary molecular&#8208;level mechanisms responsible for the formation of a unique platinum(II) nitrene with a triplet ground state from a closed&#8208;shell platinum(II) azide precursor. The spectroscopic data in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations provide compelling evidence that product formation requires the initial occupation of a singlet excited state with an anionic azide diradical ligand that is bound to a low&#8208;spin d8&#8208;configured PtII ion. Subsequent intersystem crossing generates the Pt&#8208;bound triplet azide diradical, which smoothly evolves into the triplet nitrene via N2 loss in a near barrierless adiabatic dissociation. Our data highlight the importance of the productive, N2&#8208;releasing state possessing azide &#960;&#960;* character as a design principle for accessing efficient N&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer catalysts.

Subsequent intersystem crossing generates the Pt-bound triplet azide diradical, which smoothly evolves into the triplet nitrene via N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loss in a near barrierless adiabatic dissociation. Our data highlight the importance of the productive, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-releasing state possessing azide &#960;&#960;* character as a design principle for accessing efficient N-atom-transfer catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalization of Pentacene: A Facile and Versatile Approach to Contorted Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes has proven to be the key step in the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Despite their highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs also exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields.







Abstract
In this work, a facile and versatile strategy for the synthesis of contorted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) starting from the functionalized pentacene was established. A series of novel PAHs 1&#8211;4 and their derivatives were synthesized through a simple two&#8208;step synthesis procedure involving an intramolecular reductive Friedel&#8211;Crafts cyclization of four newly synthesized pentacene aldehydes 5&#8211;8 as a key step. All the molecules were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied in detail. Interestingly, the most striking feature of 1&#8211;4 is their highly contorted carbon structures and the accompanying helical chirality. In particular, the optical resolution of 2 was successfully achieved by chiral&#8208;phase HPLC, and the enantiomers were characterized by circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence spectroscopy. Despite the highly nonplanar conformations, these contorted PAHs exhibited emissive properties with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good fluorescence quantum yields, implying the potential utility of this series PAHs as high&#8208;quality organic laser dyes. By using a self&#8208;assembly method with the help of epoxy resin, a bottle microlaser based on 3&#8201;a was successfully illustrated with a lasing wavelength of 567.8&#8197;nm at a threshold of 0.3&#8197;mJ/cm2. We believe that this work will shed light on the chemical versatility of pentacene and its derivatives in the construction of novel functionalized PAHs.

         <title>Prussian Blue&#8208;Type Sodium&#8208;ion Conducting Solid Electrolytes for All Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) show promise as solid electrolytes due to their low cost and rapid Na+ conductivity. Lattice parameters and Na+ channel sizes are influenced by transition metals, which in turn affect Na+ conductivity by modifying its interaction with PBA frameworks. Leveraging these insights, all solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries using PBAs as solid electrolytes have been developed for the first time.







Abstract
Conventional solid electrolyte frameworks typically consist of anions such as sulphur, oxygen, chlorine, and others, leading to inherent limitations in their properties. Despite the emergence of sulphide, oxide, and halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, their utilization is hampered by issues, including the evolution of H2S gas, the need for expensive elements, and poor contact. Here, we first introduce Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) open&#8208;framework structures as a solid electrolyte that demonstrates appreciable Na+ conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). We delve into the relationship between Na+ conductivity and the lattice parameter of N&#8208;coordinated transition metal, which is attributed to the reduced interaction between Na+ and the framework, corroborated by the distribution of relaxation times and density functional theory calculations. Among the five PBAs studied, Mn&#8208;PBA have exhibited the highest Na+ conductivity of 9.1&#215;10&#8722;2mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Feasibility tests have revealed that Mn&#8208;PBA have maintained a cycle retention of 95.1&#8201;% after 80cycles at 30&#8201;&#176;C and a C&#8208;rate of 0.2C. Our investigation into the underlying mechanisms that play a significant role in governing the conductivity and kinetics of these materials contributes valuable insights for the development of alternative strategies to realize all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Controllable One&#8208;Step Assembly of Uniform Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Cylindrical Micelles by a Tailored Nucleation&#8208;Growth Process and Their Application as Tougheners</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step strategy has been used to assemble cylindrical micelles with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer by an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. This strategy was used to produce uniform cylindrical micelles at decent scales for practical applications, and their dramatic toughening effect for glassy thermoplastics was demonstrated.







Abstract
The fabrication of uniform cylindrical nanoobjects from soft materials has attracted tremendous research attention from both fundamental research and practical application points of view but has also posed outstanding challenges in terms of their preparation. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step method to assemble cylindrical micelles (CMs) with highly controllable lengths from a single liquid crystalline block copolymer by an in situ nucleation&#8208;growth strategy. By adjusting the assembly conditions, the lengths of the CMs are controlled from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. Several influencing factors are systematically investigated to comprehensively understand the process. Particularly, the solvent quality is found determinative in either enhancing or suppressing the nucleation process to produce shorter and longer CMs, respectively. Taking advantage of this strategy, the lengths of CMs can be nicely controlled over a wide concentration range of four orders of magnitude. Lastly, CMs are produced on decent scales and applied as additives to dramatically toughen glassy plastic matrix, revealing an unprecedented length&#8208;dependent toughening effect.

         <title>Bimetallic Anionic Organic Frameworks with Solid&#8208;State Cation Conduction for Charge Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>

The Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP metal&#8211;organic frameworks, comprising a cation&#8208;rich phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, exhibit a high cation content, possess two distinct binding sites (&#8722;O[Li/Na]A and &#8722;O[Li/Na]B) and reversible redox chemistry. These MOFs demonstrate solid&#8208;state conduction of Li+ and Na+ ions, making them the first reported MOFs with such properties.







Abstract
A new phosphonate&#8208;based anionic bimetallic organic framework, with the general formula of A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP (wherein A is Li+ or Na+, and DOBDP6&#8722; is the 2,5&#8208;dioxido&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenediphosphate ligand) is prepared and characterized for energy storage applications. With four alkali cations per formula unit, the A4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP MOF is found to be the first example of non&#8208;solvated cation conducting MOF with measured conductivities of 5.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 3.4&#215;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for Li4&#8208; and Na4&#8208; phases, indicating phase and composition effects of Li+ and Na+ shuttling through the channels. Three orders of magnitude increase in ionic conductivity is further attained upon solvation with propylene carbonate, placing this system among the best MOF ionic conductors at room temperature. As positive electrode material, Li4&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP delivers a specific capacity of 140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high average discharge potential of 3.2&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) with 90&#8201;% of capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles. The significance of this research extends from the development of a new family of electroactive phosphonate&#8208;based MOFs with inherent ionic conductivity and reversible cation storage, to providing elementary insights into the development of highly sought yet still evasive MOFs with mixed&#8208;ion and electron conduction for energy storage applications.

With four alkali cations per formula unit, the A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP MOF is found to be the first example of non-solvated cation conducting MOF with measured conductivities of 5.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 3.4&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;- and Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;- phases, indicating phase and composition effects of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; shuttling through the channels. Three orders of magnitude increase in ionic conductivity is further attained upon solvation with propylene carbonate, placing this system among the best MOF ionic conductors at room temperature. As positive electrode material, Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Zn&#8722;DOBDP delivers a specific capacity of 140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a high average discharge potential of 3.2&#8197;V (vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li) with 90&#8201;% of capacity retention over 100&#8197;cycles. The significance of this research extends from the development of a new family of electroactive phosphonate-based MOFs with inherent ionic conductivity and reversible cation storage, to providing elementary insights into the development of highly sought yet still evasive MOFs with mixed-ion and electron conduction for energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Histone Deacetylase 3&#8208;Directed PROTACs Have Anti&#8208;inflammatory Potential by Blocking Polarization of M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to target the non&#8208;enzymatic histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) function. A newly developed potent and selective HDAC3 PROTAC provided an anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine expression profile in cultured cells and inhibited the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 phenotype in primary macrophages.







Abstract
Macrophage polarization plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes. The histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) has a deacetylase&#8208;independent function that can activate pro&#8208;inflammatory gene expression in lipopolysaccharide&#8208;stimulated M1&#8208;like macrophages and cannot be blocked by traditional small&#8208;molecule HDAC3 inhibitors. Here we employed the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology to target the deacetylase&#8208;independent function of HDAC3. We developed a potent and selective HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC, P7, which induces nearly complete HDAC3 degradation at low micromolar concentrations in both THP&#8208;1 cells and human primary macrophages. P7 increases the anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion in THP&#8208;1&#8208;derived M1&#8208;like macrophages. Importantly, P7 decreases the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines in M1&#8208;like macrophages derived from human primary macrophages. This can be explained by the observed inhibition of macrophage polarization from M0&#8208;like into M1&#8208;like macrophage. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the HDAC3&#8208;directed PROTAC P7 has anti&#8208;inflammatory activity and blocks macrophage polarization, demonstrating that this molecular mechanism can be targeted with small molecule therapeutics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Electron Transfer&#8208;Based High&#8208;Capacity Organic Lithium&#8208;Iodine (Chlorine) Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The static organic lithium&#8208;iodine (chlorine) batteries fueled by brand&#8208;new three&#8208;electron redox chemistry (redox couples: I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0) with electrochemically active tetrabutylammonium triiodide cathode exhibit excellent specific energy density, representing a significant advancement in the field of halogen batteries.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type batteries apply the principle that more charge transfer is preferable. The underutilized electron transfer mode within two undermines the electrochemical performance of halogen batteries. Here, we realised a three&#8208;electron transfer lithium&#8208;halogen battery based on I&#8722;/I+ and Cl&#8722;/Cl0 couples by using a common commercial electrolyte saturated with Cl&#8722; anions. The resulting Li||tetrabutylammonium triiodide (TBAI3) cell exhibits three distinct discharging plateaus at 2.97, 3.40, and 3.85&#8197;V. Moreover, it has a high capacity of 631&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1I (265&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1electrode, based on entire mass loading) and record&#8208;high energy density of up to 2013&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1I (845&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1electrode). To support these findings, experimental characterisations and density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the redox chemistry involved in this novel interhalogen strategy. We believe our paradigm presented here has a foreseeable inspiring effect on other halogen batteries for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pursuit.

         <title>NADH Photosynthesis System with Affordable Electron Supply and Inhibited NADH Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative NADH photosynthesis system is developed, in which the oxidation of biomass derivatives is used as an electron supply module (ESM) to supply electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is used as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Benefiting from the inhibition of REM, the NADH photosynthesis system exhibits a two&#8208;fold enhancement in the NADH yield compared with the system without REM.







Abstract
Photosynthesis offers a green approach for the recycling of nicotinamide cofactors primarily NADH in bio&#8208;redox reactions. Herein, we report an NADH photosynthesis system where the oxidation of biomass derivatives is designed as an electron supply module (ESM) to afford electrons and superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT) cascade catalysis is designed as a reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination module (REM) to inhibit NADH degradation. Glucose as the electron donor guarantees the reaction sustainability accompanied with oxidative products of gluconic acid and formic acid. Meanwhile, enzyme cascades of SOD/CAT greatly eliminate ROS, leading to a &#8776;2.00&#8208;fold elevation of NADH yield (61.1&#8201;% vs. 30.7&#8201;%). The initial reaction rate and turnover frequency (TOF) increased by 2.50&#8197;times and 2.54&#8197;times, respectively, compared with those systems without REM. Our study establishes a novel and efficient platform for NADH photosynthesis coupled to biomass&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

         <title>Flexible, Miniaturized Sensing Probes Inspired by Biofuel Cells for Monitoring Synaptically Released Glutamate in the Mouse Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by the structure and working principle of biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting devices have the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of structural and functional maladaptive changes in neural circuits after a variety of CNS trauma and diseases.







Abstract
Chemical biomarkers in the central nervous system can provide valuable quantitative measures to gain insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain, has been found to be upregulated in various neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, epilepsy, chronic pain, and migraines. However, quantitatively monitoring glutamate release in situ has been challenging. This work presents a novel class of flexible, miniaturized probes inspired by biofuel cells for monitoring synaptically released glutamate in the nervous system. The resulting sensors, with dimensions as low as 50 by 50&#8197;&#956;m, can detect real&#8208;time changes in glutamate within the biologically relevant concentration range. Experiments exploiting the hippocampal circuit in mice models demonstrate the capability of the sensors in monitoring glutamate release via electrical stimulation using acute brain slices. These advances could aid in basic neuroscience studies and translational engineering, as the sensors provide a diagnostic tool for neurological disorders. Additionally, adapting the biofuel cell design to other neurotransmitters can potentially enable the detailed study of the effect of neurotransmitter dysregulation on neuronal cell signaling pathways and revolutionize neuroscience.

         <title>Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Optical Probes for Imaging Quadruplex DNA Structures via Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New platinum(II)&#8208;based optical probes for G&#8208;quadruplex DNA are reported, which switch&#8208;on their emission intensity and, more importantly, they display a selective and distinct lengthening of their emission lifetime when bound to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA. We show that this effect can be used to selectively visualise these structures in cells using Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplex DNA is a non&#8208;canonical structure that forms in guanine&#8208;rich regions of the genome. There is increasing evidence showing that G&#8208;quadruplexes have important biological functions, and therefore molecular tools to visualise these structures are important. Herein we report on a series of new cyclometallated platinum(II) complexes which, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA, display an increase in their phosphorescence, acting as switch&#8208;on probes. More importantly, upon binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes they display a selective and distinct lengthening of their emission lifetime. We show that this effect can be used to selectively visualise these structures in cells using Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (PLIM).

         <title>Asymmetric Allenylation of Alkynes mediated by Chiral Organoselenated Reagents under Oxidative Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A selenium&#8208;mediated methodology for the asymmetric synthesis of allenyl amides is described. This was achieved in two steps from simple alkynes, and features highly stereocontrolled &#946;&#8208;H&#8208;syn&#8208;eliminations of vinyl selenoxides performed with good yields and ee up to 99&#8201;%.







Abstract
The reactivity of novel chiral lactamide&#8208;substituted diselenide&#8208;based reagents under oxidative conditions was exploited to develop a metal&#8208;free method for the preparation of enantioenriched allenylamides from simple alkynes in good yields, and with enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The key of the success in this method is attributed to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded lactamide appendages that ensure configurational stability of chiral vinyl selenoxide intermediates for an optimal enantiotopic &#946;&#8208;syn&#8208;elimination step.

         <title>Achiral Au(I) Cyclic Trinuclear Complexes with High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Near&#8208;Infrared TADF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two achiral Au(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes with circularly polarized near&#8208;infrared thermally activated delay fluorescence (NIR&#8208;TADF) have been synthesized and characterized, whose photoluminescence quantum yields are very high in the solid state. Utilizing the circularly polarized light (CPL) function and 3D printing technology, the CPL&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting logo was successfully fabricated with achiral material.







Abstract
Realizing high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region is challenging and valuable for luminescent material, especially for thermally activated delay fluorescence (TADF) material. In this work, we report two achiral cyclic trinuclear Au(I) complexes, Au3(4&#8208;Clpyrazolate)3 and Au3(4&#8208;Brpyrazolate)3 (denoted as Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au), obtained through the reaction of 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole and 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole with Au(I) salts, respectively. Both Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au exhibit TADF with high PLQY (&gt;70&#8201;%) in the NIR I (700&#8211;900&#8197;nm) (&#955;max = 720&#8197;nm) region, exceeding other NIR&#8722;TADF emitters in the solid state. Photophysical experiments and theoretical calculations confirmed the efficient NIR&#8722;TADF properties of Cl&#8722;Au and Br&#8722;Au were attributed to the small energy gap
&#916;E(S1&#8208;T2) (S = singlet, T = triplet) and the large spin&#8208;orbital coupling induced by ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal&#8208;metal charge transfer of molecular aggregations. In addition, both complexes crystallize in the achiral Pna21 space group (mm2 point group) and are circularly polarized light (CPL) active with maxima luminescent dissymmetry factor |glum| of 3.4 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (Cl&#8722;Au) and 2.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (Br&#8722;Au) for their crystalline powder samples, respectively. By using Cl&#8722;Au as the emitting ink, 3D&#8208;printed luminescent logos are fabricated, which own anti&#8208;counterfeiting functions due to its CPL behavior dependent on the crystallinity.

         <title>Photocatalytic Oxidative Coupling of Methane over Au1Ag Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Modified ZnO with Oxygen and Water Vapor: Synergy of Gold and Silver</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst exhibits excellent C2H6 yield via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane with O2 and H2O. Au single atoms in Au1Ag alloy effectively activate O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8722;H activation of CH4 to form *CH3 on ZnO. Electron deficient Au single atoms effectively transfer electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to the Ag of the Au1Ag alloy, promoting subsequent *CH3 coupling to form C2H6.







Abstract
C&#8722;H dissociation and C&#8722;C coupling are two key steps in converting CH4 into multi&#8208;carbon compounds. Here we report a synergy of Au and Ag to greatly promote C2H6 formation over Au1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy nanoparticles (Au1Ag NPs)&#8208;modified ZnO catalyst via photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (POCM) with O2 and H2O. Atomically dispersed Au in Au1Ag NPs effectively promotes the dissociation of O2 and H2O into *OOH, promoting C&#8722;H activation of CH4 on the photogenerated O&#8722; to form *CH3. Electron&#8208;deficient Au single atoms, as hopping ladders, also facilitate the migration of electron donor *CH3 from ZnO to Au1Ag NPs. Finally, *CH3 coupling can readily occur on Ag atoms of Au1Ag NPs. An excellent C2H6 yield of 14.0&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 79&#8201;% and an apparent quantum yield of 14.6&#8201;% at 350&#8197;nm is obtained via POCM with O2 and H2O, which is at least two times that of the photocatalytic system. The bimetallic synergistic strategy offers guidance for future catalyst design for POCM with O2 and H2O.

         <title>Hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conductive Covalent Organic Framework with Anisotropic Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT)&#8208;dioxin linked covalent organic framework, denoted as HD&#8208;COF, was designed, and synthesized. The unique &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages in the HD&#8208;COF structure led to efficient anisotropic charge transport. In situ formed HD&#8208;COF film demonstrated enhanced electric conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with magic blue.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with efficient charge transport is of immense interest for applications in optoelectronic devices. To enhance COF charge transport properties, electroactive building blocks and dopants can be used to induce extended conduction channels. However, understanding their intricate interplay remains challenging. We designed and synthesized a tailor&#8208;made COF structure with electroactive hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) core units and planar dioxin (D) linkages, denoted as HD&#8208;COF. With the support of theoretical calculations, we found that the HAT units in the HD&#8208;COF induce strong, eclipsed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The unique stacking of HAT units and the weak in&#8208;plane conjugation of dioxin linkages leads to efficient anisotropic charge transport. We fabricated HD&#8208;COF films to minimize the grain boundary effect of bulk COFs, which resulted in enhanced conductivity. As a result, the HD&#8208;COF films showed an electrical conductivity as high as 1.25&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after doping with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate.

         <title>Flux&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Y2Ti2O5S2 for Photocatalytic Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>

Single crystals of Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) were synthesized in a flux environment. Significantly reduced particle sizes and enhanced photocatalytic performance were observed, indicating the utility of flux&#8208;assisted methods in the preparation of oxysulfide photocatalysts.







Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting is an ideal means of producing hydrogen in a sustainable manner, and developing highly efficient photocatalysts is a vital aspect of realizing this process. The photocatalyst Y2Ti2O5S2 (YTOS) is capable of absorbing at wavelengths up to 650&#8197;nm and exhibits outstanding thermal and chemical durability compared with other oxysulfides. However, the photocatalytic performance of YTOS synthesized using the conventional solid&#8208;state reaction (SSR) process is limited owing to the large particle sizes and structural defects associated with this synthetic method. Herein, we report the synthesis of YTOS particles by a flux&#8208;assisted technique. The enhanced mass transfer efficiency in the flux significantly reduced the preparation time compared with the SSR method. In addition, the resulting YTOS showed improved photocatalytic H2 and O2 evolution activity when loaded with Rh and Co3O4 co&#8208;catalysts, respectively. These improvements are attributed to the reduced particle size and enhanced crystallinity of the material as well as the slower decay of photogenerated carriers on a nanosecond to sub&#8208;microsecond time range. Further optimization of this flux&#8208;assisted method together with suitable surface modification is expected to produce high&#8208;quality YTOS crystals with superior photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Modulating the Reaction Configuration by Breaking the Structural Symmetry of Active Sites for Efficient Photocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;concentration CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrical active site with a polarized electronic structure in oxygen vacancy containing Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles on ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon framework switches the CO2 reaction configuration from a single&#8208;site linear model to a multiple&#8208;site bending one, enabling a high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 even under natural sunlight.







Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 is considered as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the environmental and energy issues. However, the weak CO2 adsorption and tough CO2 activation process seriously compromise the CO production, due to the chemical inertness of CO2 molecule and the formed fragile metal&#8208;C/O bond. Herein, we designed and fabricated oxygen vacancy contained Co3O4 hollow nanoparticles on ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon framework (Vo&#8722;HCo3O4/OMNC) towards photoreduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2. In situ spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the constructed oxygen vacancy is able to break the local structural symmetry of Co&#8722;O&#8722;Co sites. The formation of asymmetric active site switches the CO2 configuration from a single&#8208;site linear model to a multiple&#8208;sites bending one with a highly stable configuration, enhancing the binding and structural polarization of CO2 molecules. As a result, Vo&#8722;HCo3O4/OMNC shows unprecedent activity in the photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 (10&#8201;% CO2/Ar) under laboratory light source or even natural sunlight, affording a syngas yield of 337.8 or 95.2&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, with an apparent quantum yield up to 4.2&#8201;%.

         <title>Creating an Amyloid &#8216;Kaleidoscope&#8217; Using Short Iodinated Peptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide fibrils are widely used as functional biomaterials, but the understanding at atomic level remains limited. In this study, we determined the fibril atomic structures of GFGGNDNFG and three iodinated derivatives to understand how the introduction of iodine affects the fibril structure and properties. Additionally, we designed a novel iodinated peptide, and its fibril properties and structures align well with our design expectations.







Abstract
Amyloid fibrils formed by peptides with different sequences exhibit diversified morphologies, material properties and activities, making them valuable for developing functional bionanomaterials. However, the molecular understanding underlying the structural diversity of peptide fibrillar assembly at atomic level is still lacking. In this study, by using cryogenic electron microscopy, we first revealed the structural basis underlying the highly reversible assembly of 1GFGGNDNFG9 (referred to as hnRAC1) peptide fibril. Furthermore, by installing iodine at different sites of hnRAC1, we generated a collection of peptide fibrils with distinct thermostability. By determining the atomic structures of the iodinated fibrils, we discovered that iodination at different sites of the peptide facilitates the formation of diverse halogen bonds and triggers the assembly of entirely different structures of iodinated fibrils. Finally, based on this structural knowledge, we designed an iodinated peptide that assembles into new atomic structures of fibrils, exhibiting superior thermostability, that aligned with our design. Our work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the atomic&#8208;level processes underlying the formation of diverse peptide fibril structures, and paves the way for creating an amyloid &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; by employing various modifications and peptide sequences to fine&#8208;tune the atomic structure and properties of fibrillar nanostructures.

         <title>Smart Emulsions Stabilized by a Multi&#8208;headgroup Surfactant Tolerant to High Concentrations of Acids and Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;headgroup surfactant was synthesized that can be transformed among cationic (di&#8208;UAPAc), zwitterionic and bola structures by pH trigger. In strong acidity, di&#8208;UAPAc co&#8208;stabilizes OID emulsions in combination with silica particles which convert to Pickering emulsions upon addition of high concentration of salts.







Abstract
Retaining emulsions stable at high acidity and salinity is still a great challenge. Here, we report a novel multi&#8208;headgroup surfactant (C3H7&#8722;NH+(C10COOH)2, di&#8208;UAPAc) which can be reversibly transformed among cationic, anionic and zwitterionic forms upon pH variation. Stable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion (OID) emulsions in strong acidity (pH=2) can be co&#8208;stabilized by low concentrations of di&#8208;UAPAc and silica nanoparticles. High salinity at pH=2 improves the adsorption of di&#8208;UAPAc on silica particles through hydrogen bonding, resulting in the transformation of OID emulsions into Pickering emulsions. Moreover, emulsification/demulsification and interconversion between OID and Pickering emulsions together with control of the viscosity and droplet size can be triggered by pH. The present work provides a new protocol for designing surfactants for various applications in harsh aqueous media, such as strong acidity and high salinity, involved in oil recovery and sewerage treatments.

         <title>Manganese/Cobalt Bimetallic Relay Catalysis for Divergent Dehydrogenative Difluoroalkylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for the divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products were concisely constructed.







Abstract
The involvement of manganese radical for halogen atom transfer (XAT) reactions has been esteemed as one reliable method but encountered with limited catalytic models. In this paper, a novel bimetallic relay catalysis of Mn2(CO)10 and cobaloxime has been developed for divergent dehydrogenative difluoroalkylation of alkenes using commercially available difluoroalkyl bromides. A wide range of structurally diverse terminal, cyclic and internal alkenes as well as tetrasubstituted alkenes are found to be good coupling partners to deliver difluoroalkylated allylic products and difluoromethylated cyclic products, accompanied with the production of H2 as the by&#8208;product. This bimetallic relay strategy features broad substrate scope, mild reaction conditions and excellent functional group compatibility. Its success represents an important step&#8208;forward to expedite the construction of a rich library of difluoroalkylated products.

         <title>Multitargeting Prodrugs that Release Oxaliplatin, Doxorubicin and Gemcitabine are Potent Inhibitors of Tumor Growth and Effective Inducers of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtIV prodrug (2) can release Gem, Oxal, and Dox in their active form upon cellular reduction. It effectively induces release of ICD markers, DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells and exhibited superior in vivo tumor growth inhibition in two murine models (LLC and CT26) with significantly lower body weight loss. An ICD re&#8208;challenge study showed better tumor free survival compared to the FDA drugs.







Abstract
A multitargeting prodrug (2) that releases gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and doxorubicin in their active form in cancer cells is a potent cytotoxic agent with nM IC50s; it is highly selective to cancer cells with mean selectivity indices to human (136) and murine (320) cancer cells. It effectively induces release of DAMPs (CALR, ATP &amp; HMGB1) in CT26 cells facilitating more efficient phagocytosis by J774 macrophages than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration. The viability of CT26 cells co&#8208;cultured with J774 macrophages and treated with 2 was reduced by 32&#8201;% compared to the non&#8208;treated cells, suggesting a synergistic antiproliferative effect between the chemical and immune reactions. 2 inhibited in vivo tumor growth in two murine models (LLC and CT26) better than the FDA drugs or their co&#8208;administration with significantly lower body weight loss. Mice inoculated with CT26 cells treated with 2 showed slightly better tumor free survival than doxorubicin.

         <title>Insights into Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Catalyzed Defluorination of Aromatic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional calculations establish a novel mechanism of aromatic defluorination by P450 Compound I. This is achieved via either an initial epoxide intermediate or through a 1,2&#8208;fluorine shift in an electrophilic intermediate, which highlights that the P450s can defluorinate fluoroarenes. However, in the absence of a proton donor a strong Fe&#8722;F bond can be obtained as shown from the calculations.

         <title>Linkages Make a Difference in the Photoluminescence of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different linkages endow COFs with huge differences in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield for imine&#8208;linked and vinylene&#8208;linked pyrene&#8208;based COFs. Different charge&#8208;transfer pathways in imine&#8208;linked and vinylene&#8208;linked COFs influence the exciton relaxation way and quenching of fluorescence.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with structural designability and tunability of photophysical properties enable them to be a promising class of organic luminescent materials by incorporating well&#8208;designed fluorescent units directly into the periodic skeletons. The photophysical properties of COFs are mainly affected by the structural features, which determine the conjugation degree, charge delocalization ability, and exciton dynamics of COFs. To understand the relationship between COF structures and their photophysical properties, two COFs with the same pyrene chromophore units but different linkages (imine or vinylene) were designed and synthesized. Interestingly, different linkages endow COFs with huge differences in solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) for imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked pyrene&#8208;based COFs, which possess PLQY values of 0.34&#8201;% and 15.43&#8201;%, respectively. The femtosecond&#8208;transient absorption spectra and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory reveal the different charge&#8208;transfer pathways in imine&#8208; and vinylene&#8208;linked COFs, which influence the exciton relaxation way and fluorescence intensity. In addition, an effective white&#8208;light device was obtained by coating the vinylene&#8208;linked COF on a light&#8208;emitting diode strip.

         <title>Strong and Ultra&#8208;tough Ionic Hydrogel Based on Hyperbranched Macro&#8208;Cross&#8208;linker: Influence of Topological Structure on Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperbranched PCL was used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a novel family of strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogels. By tailoring the hyperbranched topological structure, the optimal balance of covalent/non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking could be obtained. As a result, the well&#8208;designed hydrogel possesses high strength, superior toughness, and good ionic conductivity, with potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.







Abstract
The application of hydrogels often suffers from their inherent limitation of poor mechanical properties. Here, a carboxyl&#8208;functionalized and acryloyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polycaprolactone (PCL) was synthesized and used as a macro&#8208;cross&#8208;linker to fabricate a super strong and ultra&#8208;tough ionic hydrogel. The terminal acryloyl groups of hyperbranched PCL are chemically incorporated into the network to form covalent cross&#8208;links, which contribute to robust networks. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic domains formed by the spontaneous aggregation of PCL chains and coordination bonds between Fe3+ and COO&#8722; groups serve as dynamic non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links, which enhance the energy dissipation ability. Especially, the influence of the hyperbranched topological structure of PCL on hydrogel properties has been well investigated, exhibiting superior strengthening and toughening effects compared to the linear one. Moreover, the hyperbranched PCL cross&#8208;linker also endowed the ionic hydrogel with higher sensitivity than the linear one when used as a strain sensor. As a result, this well&#8208;designed ionic hydrogel possesses high mechanical strength, superior toughness, and well ionic conductivity, exhibiting potential applications in the field of flexible strain sensors.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Absorbing Monodispersed Oligomers Based on N&#8722;B&#8592;N Unit</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monodisperse oligomers with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light absorption were developed based on resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). Interesting properties and excellent opto&#8208;electronic device performance are demonstrated with the monodisperse oligomers.







Abstract
Organic molecules with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR II) light absorption are essential for many biological and opto&#8208;electronic applications. Herein, we report monodispersed oligomers as NIR II light absorber using a new molecular design strategy of resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, i.e. balanced resonant boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond (B&#8722;N) and boron&#8208;nitrogen coordination bond (B&#8592;N). We synthesize a series of monodispersed oligomers with thiophene&#8208;fused 4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (TB), which contains resonant N&#8722;B&#8592;N unit, as the repeating unit. The TB pentamer exhibits the maximum absorption wavelength of 1169&#8197;nm, which is the longest for oligomers reported so far. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) with the TB tetramer as the electron acceptor shows the specific detectivity of 2.98&#215;1011 Jones at 1180&#8197;nm under zero bias. This performance is among the best for NIR II OPDs. These results indicate a new kind of NIR II absorbing molecules as excellent opto&#8208;electronic materials.

         <title>An RNA&#8208;Cleaving DNAzyme That Requires an Organic Solvent to Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme was derived from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool by forcing the sequences to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent in aqueous solution. The DNAzyme was isolated via a counter&#8208;selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by a positive selection in the same buffered solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO, and its activity was shown to be dependent on the presence of the cosolvent.







Abstract
Engineering functional nucleic acids that are active under unusual conditions will not only reveal their hidden abilities but also lay the groundwork for pursuing them for unique applications. Although many DNAzymes have been derived to catalyze diverse chemical reactions in aqueous solutions, no prior study has been set up to purposely derive DNAzymes that require an organic solvent to function. Herein, we utilized in vitro selection to isolate RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzymes from a random&#8208;sequence DNA pool that were &#8220;compelled&#8221; to accept 35&#8201;% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent, via counter selection in a purely aqueous solution followed by positive selection in the same solution containing 35&#8201;% DMSO. This experiment led to the discovery of a new DNAzyme that requires 35&#8201;% DMSO for its catalytic activity and exhibits drastically reduced activity without DMSO. This DNAzyme also requires divalent metal ions for catalysis, and its activity is enhanced by monovalent ions. A minimized, more efficient DNAzyme was also derived. This work demonstrates that highly functional, organic solvent&#8208;dependent DNAzymes can be isolated from random&#8208;sequence DNA libraries via forced in vitro selection, thus expanding the capability and potential utility of catalytic DNA.

         <title>Improved Interfacial Ion Migration and Deposition through the Chain&#8208;Liquid Synergistic Effect by a Carboxylated Hydrogel Electrolyte for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative double&#8208;network carboxylated hydrogel electrolyte was designed to stabilize zinc anode. The charged functional groups on polymer chains synergize with liquid phase components to reconstruct the solvent sheath and guide the directional migration of Zn2+ ions. The robust chemical bonding of hydrogel layer to Zn slab induces a dendrite&#8208;free plating behavior, ultimately ensuring the long&#8208;term operation of zinc ion hybrid capacitors.







Abstract
The large&#8208;scale applicability of Zn&#8208;metal anodes is severely impeded by the issues such as the dendrite growth, complicated hydrogen evolution, and uncontrollable passivation reaction. Herein, a negatively charged carboxylated double&#8208;network hydrogel electrolyte (Gelatin/Sodium alginate&#8208;acetate, denoted as Gel/SA&#8208;acetate) has been developed to stabilize the interfacial electrochemistry, which restructures a type of Zn2+ ion solvent sheath optimized via a chain&#8208;liquid synergistic effect. New hydrogen bonds are reconstructed with water molecules by the zincophilic functional groups, and directional migration of hydrated Zn2+ ions is therefore induced. Concomitantly, the robust chemical bonding of such hydrogel layers to the Zn slab exhibits a desirable anti&#8208;catalytic effect, thereby greatly diminishing the water activity and eliminating side reactions. Subsequently, a symmetric cell using the Gel/SA&#8208;acetate electrolyte demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 1580&#8197;h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 5600&#8197;h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;%. The resultant zinc ion hybrid capacitors deliver exceptional properties including the capacity retention of 98.5&#8201;% over 15000&#8197;cycles, energy density of 236.8&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and high mechanical adaptability. This work is expected to pave a new avenue for the development of novel hydrogel electrolytes towards safe and stable Zn anodes.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Potassium&#8208;Modified Nickel&#8208;Zinc Carbide Boosts Production of Higher Alcohols beyond CH4 in CO2 Hydrogenation</title>

A Ni&#8722;Zn bimetal catalyst breaks the limits of methanation over metallic Ni0 for CO2 hydrogenation. K promotion of the Ni&#8722;Zn catalyst facilitates the in situ formation of Ni3Zn1C0.7 IMC, enhances CO2 adsorption, and accelerates C&#8722;C coupling, thereby promoting C2+OH production.







Abstract
Ni&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied in the hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4, but selective and efficient synthesis of higher alcohols (C2+OH) from CO2 hydrogenation over Ni&#8208;based catalyst is still challenging due to successive hydrogenation of C1 intermediates leading to methanation. Herein, we report an unprecedented synthesis of C2+OH from CO2 hydrogenation over K&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Zn bimetal catalyst with promising activity and selectivity. Systematic experiments (including XRD, in situ spectroscopic characterization) and computational studies reveal the in situ generation of an active K&#8208;modified Ni&#8722;Zn carbide (K&#8208;Ni3Zn1C0.7) by carburization of Zn&#8208;incorporated Ni0, which can significantly enhance CO2 adsorption and the surface coverage of alkyl intermediates, and boost the C&#8722;C coupling to C2+OH rather than conventional CH4. This work opens a new catalytic avenue toward CO2 hydrogenation to C2+OH, and also provides an insightful example for the rational design of selective and efficient Ni&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to multiple carbon products.

         <title>77&#8201;% Photothermal Conversion in Blatter&#8208;Type Diradicals: Photophysics and Photodynamic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state of the Blatter&#8208;type diradical is responsible for highly efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Also, it is first applied to photothermal therapy of tumor cells, demonstrating good stability and the highest photo&#8208;thermal conversion in the diradicaloid field.







Abstract
Diradicals based on the Blatter units and connected by acetylene and alkene spacers have been prepared. All the molecules show sizably large diradical character and low energy singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Their photo&#8208;physical properties concerning their lowest energy excited state have been studied in detail by steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption spectroscopy. We have fully identified the main optical absorption band and full absence of emission from the lowest energy excited state. A computational study has been also carried out that has helped to identify the presence of a conical intersection between the lowest energy excited state and the ground state which produces a highly efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion of the absorbed radiation. Furthermore, an outstanding photo&#8208;thermal conversion 77.23&#8201;% has been confirmed, close to the highest in the diradicaloid field. For the first time, stable diradicals are applied to photo&#8208;thermal therapy of tumor cells with good stability and satisfactory performance at near&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Dual Nickel(II)/Mechanoredox Catalysis: Mechanical&#8208;Force&#8208;Driven Aryl&#8208;Amination Reactions Using Ball Milling and Piezoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a new class of synergistic catalytic system that uses a nickel(II) catalyst and a mechanoredox catalyst to promote mechanochemical&#8208;force&#8208;driven C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. This reaction shows a broad substrate scope, an inexpensive catalyst, short reaction time, and an almost negligible quantity of solvents. The present approach accordingly complements existing nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysis.







Abstract
The combination of a nickel(II) catalyst and a mechanoredox catalyst under ball&#8208;milling conditions promotes mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;driven C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this nickel(II)/mechanoredox cocatalyst system, the modulation of the oxidation state of the nickel center, induced by piezoelectricity, is used to facilitate a highly efficient aryl&#8208;amination reaction, which is characterized by a broad substrate scope, an inexpensive combination of catalysts (NiBr2 and BaTiO3), short reaction times, and an almost negligible quantity of solvents. Moreover, this reaction can be readily up&#8208;scaled to the multi&#8208;gram scale, and all synthetic operations can be carried out under atmospheric conditions without the need for complicated reaction setups. Furthermore, this force&#8208;induced system is suitable for excitation&#8208;energy&#8208;accepting molecules and poorly soluble polyaromatic substrates that are incompatible with solution&#8208;based nickel(II)/photoredox cocatalysts.

         <title>Enhanced Li+ Diffusion and Lattice oxygen Stability by the High Entropy Effect in Disordered&#8208;Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy strategy improves the Li+ diffusion and oxygen lattice stability of the Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalts cathode during charging, and enables multiple 3d TM to participate in charge compensation cooperatively, resulting in better cycling retention and higher reversible capacity.







Abstract
Cation&#8208;disordered Rocksalt oxides (DRXs) are a promising new class of cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their natural abundance, low cost and great electrochemical performance. High entropy strategy in Mn&#8208;based DRXs appears to be an effective strategy for improving the rate capability, but it suffers from challenges including capacity degradation. The present paper reports a new group of high entropy DRXs (HE DRX) based on Ni2+&#8208;Nb5+ pair; the structural and chemical evolution upon cycling of DRXs with an increasing transition metal (TM) species are systematically investigated. An explanation is proposed for how the crystal field stability energy determines that HE DRX could exist in single Rocksalt solid solution structures. We further reveal that the charge compensation mechanism in HE DRX is the result of various TM synergistic effect. More importantly, through various in situ and ex situ techniques and theoretical calculation, the effective integration of more TM cation species within the HE DRX framework promotes better Li+ diffusion and improves lattice oxygen stability, consequently increasing capacity upon cycling.

         <title>Stabilizing Low&#8208;Valence Single Atoms by Constructing Metalloid Tungsten Carbide Supports for Efficient Hydrogen Oxidation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence single&#8208;atom sites are induced and stabilized by constructing a metalloid tungsten carbide support (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd), leading to the realization of superior mass activity for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).







Abstract
Designing novel single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) supports to modulate the electronic structure is crucial to optimize the catalytic activity, but rather challenging. Herein, a general strategy is proposed to utilize the metalloid properties of supports to trap and stabilize single&#8208;atoms with low&#8208;valence states. A series of single&#8208;atoms supported on the surface of tungsten carbide (M&#8208;WCx, M=Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a facile pyrolysis method. Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WCx, the single&#8208;atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low&#8208;valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal&#8208;metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low&#8208;valence single atoms on the WCx surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru&#8208;WCx exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52&#8197;A&#8201;mgRu&#8722;1 for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively. In&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis demonstrates that an ideal dual&#8208;sites cooperative mechanism achieves a suitable adsorption balance of Had and OHad, resulting in an energetically favorable Volmer step. This work offers new guidance for the precise construction of highly active SACs.

Benefiting from the metalloid properties of WC&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the single-atoms exhibit weak coordination with surface W and C atoms, resulting in the formation of low-valence active centers similar to metals. The unique metal-metal interaction effectively stabilizes the low-valence single atoms on the WC&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; surface and improves the electronic orbital energy level distribution of the active sites. As expected, the representative Ru-WC&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits superior mass activities of 7.84 and 62.52&#8197;A&#8201;mg&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER), respectively. In-depth mechanistic analysis demonstrates that an ideal dual-sites cooperative mechanism achieves a suitable adsorption balance of H&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; and OH&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in an energetically favorable Volmer step. This work offers new guidance for the precise construction of highly active SACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Developing scalable systems and understanding dynamic behaviors are crucial for advancing the technological potential of multicomponent catalysts for CO2&#8208;based methanol synthesis. In their Research Article (e202306563), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers show that the reaction&#8208;induced restructuring of Pd&#8208;In2O3/ZrO2 systems, prepared via impregnation, leads to a unique architecture that integrates the necessary acid&#8208;base functionality of In2O3 with the H2 splitting ability of an InPd2 alloy, while also ensuring high stability.

The sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides are recognized as the main obstacles to the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In their Research Article (e202306901), Dan Luo, Zhongwei Chen et&#8197;al. report a novel dual&#8208;defect metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a new catalyst type to achieve synergistic catalysis for the multi&#8208;step conversion reaction of lithium polysulfides. The missing linker defect and missing cluster defect significantly catalyze the sulfur reduction reaction. As a result, dual&#8208;defect MOF&#8208;based separators lead to a strongly improved electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.

Palladium icosahedral nanocrystals , a type of multiply&#8208;twinned nanocrystals, are found to enable facile and fast hydrogen absorption. In their Research Article (e202306906), Manos Mavrikakis, Younan Xia et&#8197;al. demonstrate that, upon absorbing hydrogen, the H&#8208;saturated twin boundaries can divide the particle into 20 smaller single&#8208;crystal units in which the formation of high&#8208;energy phase boundaries is no longer favored. Meanwhile, the presence of tensile strain accelerates the kinetics of hydrogen absorption due to the increase in lattice spacing. Notably, the as&#8208;obtained PdHx nanocrystals with controllable compositions also show remarkable thermal and catalytic stability toward formic acid oxidation, which can also be attributed to the tensile strain.

Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs), which transport small molecules, proteins, and nucleotides within a lipid bilayer, serve as communication facilitators. Toshiyuki Wakimoto et&#8197;al. revealed in their Research Article (e202307304) that MVs&#8208;mediated interbacterial communication triggers silent secondary metabolite production in various bacteria. Particularly striking is the competitive interaction between Burkholderia multivorans and Xenorhabdus innexi, involving the exchange of their respective MVs and the MVs&#8208;induced secondary metabolites.

         <title>Azoheteroarene and Diazocine Molecular Photoswitches: Self&#8208;Assembly, Responsive Materials and Photopharmacology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes have emerged as versatile molecular photoswitches beyond azobenzenes. In this minireview, we highlight some of the most promising azo&#8208;based molecular photoswitches (arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines and diazocines) and discuss their application in supramolecular assembly, responsive materials and photopharmacology.







Abstract
Aromatic units tethered with an azo (&#8722;N=N&#8722;) functionality comprise a unique class of compounds, known as molecular photoswitches, exhibiting a reversible transformation between their E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers in response to photo&#8208;irradiation. Photoswitches have been explored extensively in the recent past to prepare dynamic self&#8208;assembled materials, optoelectronic devices, responsive biomaterials, and more. Most of such materials involve azobenzenes as the molecular photoswitch and to date, SciFinder lists more than 7000&#8197;articles and 1000&#8197;patents. Subsequently, a great deal of effort has been invested to improve the photo&#8208;isomerization efficiency and related mesoscopic properties of azobenzenes. Recently, azoheteroarenes and cyclic azobenzenes, such as arylazopyrazoles, arylazoisoxazoles, arylazopyridines, and diazocines, have emerged as second generation molecular photoswitches beyond conventional azobenzenes. These photoswitches offer distinct photoswitching behavior and responsive properties which make them highly promising candidates for multifaceted applications ranging from photoresponsive materials to photopharmacophores. In this minireview, we introduce the structural refinement and photoresponsive properties of azoheteroarenes and diazocines and summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art on utilizing these photoswitches as responsive building blocks in supramolecular assembly, material science and photopharmacology, highlighting their versatile photochemical behavior, enhanced functionality, and latest applications.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction of Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review highlights the inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with different configurations and summarizes their latest progress for heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions. These enable to design efficient DACs with well&#8208;defined structures for boosting catalysis.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have been a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their unique intrinsic properties. The synergy between dual atoms provides flexible active sites, promising to enhance performance and even catalyze more complex reactions. However, precisely regulating active site structure and uncovering dual&#8208;atom metal interaction remain grand challenges. In this review, we clarify the significance of the inter&#8208;metal interaction of DACs based on the understanding of active center structures. Three diatomic configurations are elaborated, including isolated dual single&#8208;atom, N/O&#8208;bridged dual&#8208;atom, and direct dual&#8208;metal bonding interaction. Subsequently, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date progress in heterogeneous oxidation reactions, hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, electrocatalytic reactions, and photocatalytic reactions are summarized. The structure&#8208;activity relationship between DACs and catalytic performance is then discussed at an atomic level. Finally, the challenges and future directions to engineer the structure of DACs are discussed. This review will offer new prospects for the rational design of efficient DACs toward heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Recent Advances in Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly (PISA) Syntheses in Non&#8208;Polar Media</title>

         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a versatile technique for the rational synthesis of block copolymer nanoparticles in non&#8208;polar media. In principle, such formulations offer commercial applications but only one review article has been published in this field. The current review summarizes the advances reported since 2016, including thermally induced morphological transitions, gel rheology behaviour and in situ monitoring techniques.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) is a powerful and highly versatile technique for the rational synthesis of colloidal dispersions of diblock copolymer nanoparticles, including spheres, worms or vesicles. PISA can be conducted in water, polar solvents or non&#8208;polar media. In principle, the latter formulations offer a wide range of potential commercial applications. However, there has been just one review focused on PISA syntheses in non&#8208;polar media and this prior article was published in 2016. The purpose of the current review article is to summarize the various advances that have been reported since then. In particular, PISA syntheses conducted using reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (RAFT) polymerization in various n&#8208;alkanes, poly(&#945;&#8208;olefins), mineral oil, low&#8208;viscosity silicone oils or supercritical CO2 are discussed in detail. Selected formulations exhibit thermally induced worm&#8208;to&#8208;sphere or vesicle&#8208;to&#8208;worm morphological transitions and the rheological properties of various examples of worm gels in non&#8208;polar media are summarized. Finally, visible absorption spectroscopy and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) enable in situ monitoring of nanoparticle formation, while small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can be used to examine micelle fusion/fission and chain exchange mechanisms.

         <title>meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized pyridines have broad applications in chemical science. However, direct functionalization of pyridine C&#8722;H bonds at the meta&#8208;position is difficult. Significant advances have been achieved in recent years through directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation or temporary dearomatization strategies. Herein, we describe the advances and challenges in the development of meta&#8208;selective functionalization of pyridines.







Abstract
The pyridine moiety is an important core structure for a variety of drugs, agrochemicals, catalysts, and functional materials. Direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in pyridines is a straightforward approach to access valuable substituted pyridines. Compared to the direct ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization, meta&#8208;selective pyridine C&#8722;H functionalization is far more challenging due to the inherent electronic properties of the pyridine entity. This review summarizes currently available methods for pyridine meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization using a directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation, and temporary dearomatization strategies. Recent advances in ligand control and temporary dearomatization are highlighted. We analyze the advantages as well as limitations of current techniques and hope to inspire further developments in this important area.

&lt;p&gt;Functionalized pyridines have broad applications in chemical science. However, direct functionalization of pyridine C&#8722;H bonds at the &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;position is difficult. Significant advances have been achieved in recent years through directing group, non-directed metalation or temporary dearomatization strategies. Herein, we describe the advances and challenges in the development of &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;selective functionalization of pyridines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pyridine moiety is an important core structure for a variety of drugs, agrochemicals, catalysts, and functional materials. Direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds in pyridines is a straightforward approach to access valuable substituted pyridines. Compared to the direct &lt;i&gt;ortho-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;para-&lt;/i&gt;functionalization, &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;selective pyridine C&#8722;H functionalization is far more challenging due to the inherent electronic properties of the pyridine entity. This review summarizes currently available methods for pyridine &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;C&lt;i&gt;&#8722;&lt;/i&gt;H functionalization using a directing group, non-directed metalation, and temporary dearomatization strategies. Recent advances in ligand control and temporary dearomatization are highlighted. We analyze the advantages as well as limitations of current techniques and hope to inspire further developments in this important area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photochemical Desaturation and Epoxidation with Oxygen by Sequential Flavin Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nature, flavoenzymes mediate mechanistically unrelated transformations such as desaturations and epoxidations with oxygen from air. We disclose the combination of both activities in a sequential fashion using molecular flavin catalysts in the organic laboratory. Our protocol consists of initial photochemical desaturation of silyl enol ethers and subsequent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketone formation with molecular oxygen.







Abstract
Catalytic desaturations are important strategies for the functionalization of organic molecules. In nature, flavoenzymes mediate the formation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds by concomitant cofactor reduction. Contrary to many laboratory methods for these reactions, such as the Saegusa&#8208;Ito oxidation, no transition metal reagents or catalysts are required. However, a molecular flavin&#8208;mediated variant has not been reported so far. We disclose a photochemical approach for silyl enol ether oxidation, which leads to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones (13 examples) in very good yields. The flavin catalysts are stable throughout the desaturation reaction, and we successfully applied them in a subsequent aerobic epoxidation by simply changing the reaction conditions. This protocol allowed us to directly convert silyl enol ethers into &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxyketones in a one&#8208;pot fashion (12 examples). Sequential flavin catalysis is not limited to one specific reactivity combination and can, inter alia, couple the photochemical oxidation with radical additions. We anticipate that flavin&#8208;catalyzed desaturation will be applicable to other substrate classes and that its sequential catalytic activity will enable rapid substrate diversification.

The first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;methanobactin OB3b, a unique carcerand&#8208;like chalkophore, is reported. Key features were a cyclodehydratation&#8208;thioacylation sequence for accessing two unprecedented azlactone building blocks and metal ion&#8208;templation for enabling cyclization of the methanobactin peptide backbone.

Here, we report the first total synthesis of Cu(I)&#8208;bound methanobactin OB3b featuring as key transformations a cyclodehydration&#8208;thioacylation sequence, to generate the conjugated heterocyclic systems, and a copper&#8208;templated cyclization, to complete the caged structure of the very sensitive target compound.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accelerating Effect in a Covalent&#8211;Organic Framework with Imidazole Groups Boosts Electroreduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generally, the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic media is irrepressible. Here, we report an imidazole&#8208;linked covalent&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst, which exhibits a better performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in an acidic electrolyte than in a neutral electrolyte.







Abstract
Solvent effect plays an important role in catalytic reaction, but there is little research and attention on it in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). Herein, we report a stable covalent&#8208;organic framework (denoted as PcNi&#8208;im) with imidazole groups as a new electrocatalyst for eCO2RR to CO. Interestingly, compared with neutral conditions, PcNi&#8208;im not only showed high Faraday efficiency of CO product (&#8776;100&#8201;%) under acidic conditions (pH &#8776; 1), but also the partial current density was increased from 258 to 320&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. No obvious degradation was observed over 10&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 250&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The mechanism study shows that the imidazole group on the framework can be protonated to form an imidazole cation in acidic media, hence reducing the surface work function and charge density of the active metal center. As a result, CO poisoning effect is weakened and the key intermediate *COOH is also stabilized, thus accelerating the catalytic reaction rate.

         <title>Scalable Electrochemical Decarboxylative Olefination Driven by Alternating Polarity
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical conversion of unactivated carboxylic acids to olefins under alternating polarity is reported. By modulating electrode surface quality and local acidity, chemoselective Hofer&#8208;Moest reactivity is realized on conventionally difficult substrates, including primary and secondary unactivated carboxylic acids. This simple protocol is exceptionally scalable (1&#8197;kg) and cost&#8208;effective.







Abstract
A mild, scalable (kg) metal&#8208;free electrochemical decarboxylation of alkyl carboxylic acids to olefins is disclosed. Numerous applications are presented wherein this transformation can simplify alkene synthesis and provide alternative synthetic access to valuable olefins from simple carboxylic acid feedstocks. This robust method relies on alternating polarity to maintain the quality of the electrode surface and local pH, providing a deeper understanding of the Hofer&#8208;Moest process with unprecedented chemoselectivity.

         <title>Breaking K+ Concentration Limit on Cu Nanoneedles for Acidic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K+ concentration (4.22&#8197;M), breaking the K+ solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M). This enables a highly efficient CO2RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1, with a FEC2+ of 90.69&#177;2.15&#8201;% at 1400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a single pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of 25.49&#177;0.82&#8201;% at a CO2 flow rate of 7&#8197;sccm.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) in acidic electrolyte is one of the most advanced routes for tackling our current climate and energy crisis. However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the poor selectivity towards the valuable C2+ products are the major obstacles for the upscaling of these technologies. High local potassium ions (K+) concentration at the cathode's surface can inhibit proton&#8208;diffusion and accelerate the desirable carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling process. However, the solubility limit of potassium salts in bulk solution constrains the maximum achievable K+ concentration at the reaction sites and thus the overall acidic CO2RR performance of most electrocatalysts. In this work, we demonstrate that Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K+ concentrations (4.22&#8197;M) &#8211; thus breaking the K+ solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M) &#8211; which enables a highly efficient CO2RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1.

&lt;p&gt;Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration (4.22&#8197;M), breaking the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M). This enables a highly efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1, with a FE&lt;sub&gt;C2+&lt;/sub&gt; of 90.69&#177;2.15&#8201;% at 1400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a single pass carbon efficiency (SPCE) of 25.49&#177;0.82&#8201;% at a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flow rate of 7&#8197;sccm.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to multi-carbon products (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) in acidic electrolyte is one of the most advanced routes for tackling our current climate and energy crisis. However, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the poor selectivity towards the valuable C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products are the major obstacles for the upscaling of these technologies. High local potassium ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration at the cathode's surface can inhibit proton-diffusion and accelerate the desirable carbon-carbon (C&#8722;C) coupling process. However, the solubility limit of potassium salts in bulk solution constrains the maximum achievable K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration at the reaction sites and thus the overall acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance of most electrocatalysts. In this work, we demonstrate that Cu nanoneedles induce ultrahigh local K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations (4.22&#8197;M) &#8211; thus breaking the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solubility limit (3.5&#8197;M) &#8211; which enables a highly efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR in 3&#8197;M KCl at pH=1.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Ring&#8208;Opening Reactions of Unstrained Heterocycles Using Cobalt Vinylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt catalysts promote enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of unstrained heterocycles by the reductive addition of 1,1&#8208;dichloroalkenes. The products are acyclic homoallylic alcohols containing a vinylzinc motif, which can be further functionalized with an electrophile. Mechanistic studies suggest that ring&#8208;opening occurs by an outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by a Zn(II) Lewis acid.







Abstract
Cobalt catalysts promote highly enantioselective ring&#8208;opening reactions of 2,5&#8208;dihydrofurans using vinylidenes. The products are acyclic organozinc compounds that can be functionalized with an electrophile. The proposed mechanism involves the generation of a cobalt vinylidene species that adds to the alkene by a [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition pathway. Ring&#8208;opening then occurs via outer&#8208;sphere &#946;&#8208;O elimination assisted by coordination of a ZnX2 Lewis acid to the alkoxide leaving group. DFT models reveal that competing inner&#8208;sphere syn &#946;&#8208;H and &#946;&#8208;O elimination pathways are suppressed by the geometric constraints of the metallacycle intermediate. These models rationalize the observed stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

         <title>Base&#8208;Promoted Glycosylation Allows Protecting Group&#8208;Free and Stereoselective O&#8208;Glycosylation of Carboxylic Acids

         <dc:description>
Fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids was reported. This transformation, which employs bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions with visible light irradiation. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities.







Abstract
Here we report a simple and general method to achieve fully unprotected, stereoselective glycosylation of carboxylic acids, employing bench&#8208;stable allyl glycosyl sulfones as donors. Running the glycosylation reaction under basic conditions was crucial for the efficiencies and selectivities. Both the donor activation stage and the glycosidic bond forming stage of the process are compatible with free hydroxyl groups, thereby allowing for the use of fully unprotected glycosyl donors. This transformation is stereoconvergent, occurs under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions at ambient temperature with visible light (455&#8197;nm) irradiation, and displays remarkable scope with respect to both reaction partners. Many natural products and commercial drugs, including an acid derived from the complex anticancer agent taxol, were efficiently glycosylated. Experimental studies provide insights into the origin of the stereochemical outcome.

Abstract
A photocatalytic self&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition of vinyldiazo compounds is described, which provides cyclopentene derivatives with conservation of one diazo functional group. Experimental insights and density functional theory indicate that the reaction is triggered by an unusual single electron oxidation of vinyldiazo compounds, while the photolysis for the generation of free carbene species is not involved. The synthetic applications of the resulting cyclopentenyl &#945;&#8208;diazo compounds were demonstrated based on the rich chemistry of the diazo functional group.

         <title>Ultrafast Detection of Monoamine Oxidase A in Live Cells and Clinical Glioma Tissues Using an Affinity Binding&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Photon Fluorogenic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By studying the interaction between small molecules and enzymes, we have successfully developed an affinity binding&#8208;based two&#8208;photon small&#8208;molecule fluorogenic probe (CD1) for the ultrafast detection of endogenous monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8722;A) content in complex biological systems.







Abstract
Abnormal expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAO&#8722;A) has been implicated in the development of human glioma, making MAO&#8722;A a promising target for therapy. Therefore, a rapid determination of MAO&#8722;A is critical for diagnosis. Through in silico screening of two&#8208;photon fluorophores, we discovered that a derivative of N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenamine (pre&#8208;mito) can effectively fit into the entrance of the MAO&#8722;A cavity. Substitutions on the N&#8208;pyridine not only further explore the MAO&#8722;A cavity, but also enable mitochondrial targeting ability. The aminopropyl substituted molecule, CD1, showed the fastest MAO&#8722;A detection (within 20&#8197;s), high MAO&#8722;A affinity and selectivity. It was also used for in situ imaging of MAO&#8722;A in living cells, enabling a comparison of the MAO&#8722;A content in human glioma and paracancerous tissues. Our results demonstrate that optimizing the affinity binding&#8208;based fluorogenic probes significantly improves their detection rate, providing a general approach for rapid detection probe design and optimization.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Fluorinative Bifunctionalization of Aziridines and Azetidines with gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes</title>

An unprecedented fluorinative bifunctionalization of aziridines and azetidines with gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes is disclosed via Pd catalysis for the first time, which reveals a novel ring&#8208;opening mode of cyclic amines.







Abstract
An unprecedented Pd&#8208;catalyzed fluorinative bifunctionalization of aziridines and azetidines was successfully developed via regioselective C&#8722;C and C&#8722;F bond cleavage of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes, leading to various &#946;,&#946;&#8242;&#8208;bisfluorinated amines and &#946;,&#947;&#8208;bisfluorinated amines. This reaction was achieved by incorporating a 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl group and a fluorine atom scissored from gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropane in 100&#8201;% atom economy for the first time. The mechanistic investigations indicated that the reaction underwent amine attacking 2&#8208;fluorinated allyl palladium complex to generate &#951;2&#8208;coordinated N&#8208;allyl aziridine followed by fluoride ligand transfer affording the final &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;fluorinated amines.

We report a rare polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction displays broad scope with mechanistic investigations supporting a unique synergistic activation pathway that displays chemoselectivity for styrene boronic acids in the presence of other SOMOphiles. SOMO=singly occupied molecular orbital.







Abstract
We report the development of a C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) coupling reaction using styrene boronic acids and redox&#8208;active esters under photoredox catalysis. The reaction proceeds through an unusual polarity&#8208;mismatched radical addition mechanism that is orthogonal to established processes. Synergistic activation of the radical precursor and organoboron are critical mechanistic events. Activation of an N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) ester by coordination to boron enables electron transfer, with decomposition leading to a nucleofuge rebound, activating the organoboron to radical addition. The unique mechanism enables chemoselective coupling of styrene boronic acids in the presence of other alkene radical acceptors. The scope and limitations of the reaction, and a detailed mechanistic investigation are presented.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbofunctionalization of Alkynes with Organohalides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first report of 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as coupling partners in the field of gold catalysis has been presented. Mechanistic investigations, including NMR, tandem mass spectrometry and DFT studies, reveal that an oxidative addition/carbophilic activation pathway is preferred over the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first gold&#8208;catalyzed 1,2&#8208;dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes using organohalides as non&#8208;prefunctionalized coupling partners. The mechanism of the reaction involves an oxidative addition/&#960;&#8208;activation mechanism in contrast to the migratory insertion/cis&#8208;trans isomerization pathway that is predominantly observed with other transition metals yielding products with anti&#8208;selectivity. Mechanistic insights include several control experiments, NMR studies, HR&#8208;MSMS analyses, and DFT calculations that strongly support the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Bifunctional Carbanionic Synthesis of Fully Bio&#8208;Based Triblock Structures Derived from &#946;&#8208;Farnesene and ll&#8208;Dilactide: Thermoplastic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the bifunctional carbanionic polymerization of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and subsequent end&#8208;functionalization with ethoxy ethyl glycidyl ether, telechelic multihydroxy functional polyfarnesene is accessible. Via organobase&#8208;catalyzed ROP of ll&#8208;dilactide a fully bio&#8208;based A2BA2&#8208;type block copolymer structure was generated. The material was investigated in terms of its morphology, mechanical and thermoplastic elastomer properties.







Abstract
Current environmental challenges and the shrinking fossil&#8208;fuel feedstock are important criteria for the next generation of polymer materials. In this context, we present a fully bio&#8208;based material, which shows promise as a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Due to the use of &#946;&#8208;farnesene and L&#8208;lactide as monomers, bio&#8208;based feedstocks, namely sugar cane and corn, can be used. A bifunctional initiator for the carbanionic polymerization was employed, to permit an efficient synthesis of ABA&#8208;type block structures. In addition, the &#8220;green&#8221; solvent MTBE (methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether) was used for the anionic polymerisation, enabling excellent solubility of the bifunctional anionic initiator. This afforded low dispersity (&#272;=1.07 to 1.10) and telechelic polyfarnesene macroinitiators. These were employed for lactide polymerization to obtain H&#8208;shaped triblock copolymers. TEM and SAXS revealed clearly phase&#8208;separated morphologies, and tensile tests demonstrated elastic mechanical properties. The materials featured two glass transition temperatures, at &#8208; 66&#8201;&#176;C and 51&#8201;&#176;C as well as gyroid or cylindrical morphologies, resulting in soft elastic materials at room temperature.

         <title>Combinatorial Screening of Water/Proton Permeation of Self&#8208;Assembled Pillar[5]arene Artificial Water Channel Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary combinations of pillararene libraries have been used to construct selective artificial water channels that present increased water transport activities across lipid bilayers compared to their components A&#8211;D. These channels are capable of transporting water at a rate that is one order of magnitude below that of the natural aquaporins.







Abstract
Artificial water channels (AWCs) that selectively transport water and reject ions through bilayer membranes have potential to act as synthetic Aquaporins (AQPs). AWCs can have a similar osmotic permeability, better stability, with simpler manufacture on a larger&#8208;scale and have higher functional density and surface permeability when inserted into the membrane. Here, we report the screening of combinatorial libraries of symmetrical and unsymmetrical rim&#8208;functionalized PAs A&#8211;D that are able to transport ca. 107&#8211;108 water molecules/s/channel, which is within 1 order of magnitude of AQPs&#8217; and show total ion and proton rejection. Among the four channels, C and D are 3&#8211;4&#8197;times more water permeable than A and B when inserted in bilayer membranes. The binary combinations of A&#8211;D with different molar ratios could be expressed as an independent (linear ABA), a recessive (inhibition AB, AC, DB, ACA), or a dominant (amplification, DBD) behavior of the water net permeation events.

The binary combinations of &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt; with different molar ratios could be expressed as an independent (linear &lt;b&gt;ABA&lt;/b&gt;), a recessive (inhibition &lt;b&gt;AB&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;AC&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;DB&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;ACA&lt;/b&gt;), or a dominant (amplification, &lt;b&gt;DBD&lt;/b&gt;) behavior of the water net permeation events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response in a Densely&#8208;Stacked Van Der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Oxychloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;sole functional module&#8221; strategy that assembles dense structures comprising well&#8208;aligned nonlinear optical&#8208;efficient modules is proposed. This has led to the discovery of a densely&#8208;stacked van der Waals transition&#8208;metal oxychloride with a giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation response.







Abstract
Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental optical property of nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. Thus far, it has proved difficult to engineer large SHG responses, particularly in the mid&#8208;infrared region, owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the arrangement and density of functional NLO&#8208;active units. Herein, a new assembly strategy employing functional modules only, and aimed at maximizing the density and optimizing the spatial arrangement of highly efficient functional modules, has been applied to the preparation of NLO crystals, affording the van der Waals crystal MoO2Cl2. This exhibits the strongest powder SHG response (2.1&#215;KTiOPO4 (KTP) @ 2100&#8197;nm) for a transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide, a wide optical transparency window, and a sufficient birefringence. MoO2Cl2 is the first SHG&#8208;active transition&#8208;metal oxyhalide effective in the infrared region. Theoretical studies and crystal structure analysis suggest that the densely packed, optimally&#8208;aligned [MoO4Cl2] modules within the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals layers are responsible for the giant SHG response.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Arylation&#8208;Induced Glycolate Aldol Additions of Silyl Glyoxylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 42, October 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral (diene)Rh(I) complex catalyzes the enantioselective three&#8208;component coupling reaction of silyl glyoxylates, boronic acids, and aldehydes to yield complex fully substituted mandelates. Notable features include the mild generation of chiral Rh&#8208;enolates by 1,2&#8208;Brook rearrangement and, from that point, modular preparation of glycolate aldol adducts.







Abstract
(Diene)Rh(I) complexes catalyze the stereoselective three&#8208;component coupling of silyl glyoxylates, arylboronic acids, and aldehydes to give glycolate aldol products. The participation of Rh&#8208;alkoxides in the requisite Brook rearrangement was established through two component Rh&#8208;catalyzed couplings of silyl glyoxylates with ArB(OH)2 to give silyl&#8208;protected mandelate derivatives. The intermediacy of a chiral Rh&#8208;enolate was inferred through enantioselective protonation using a chiral Rh&#8208;catalyst. Diastereoselective three&#8208;component couplings with aldehydes as terminating electrophiles to give racemic products were best achieved with a bulky aryl ester on the silyl glyoxylate reagent. Optimal enantioselective couplings were carried out with the tert&#8208;butyl ester variant using an anisole&#8208;derived enantiopure tricyclo[3.2.2.02,4]nonadiene ligand.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Formal [1,3]&#8208;Aryl Shift within Molecular Bows</title>

Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach was proposed to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows with integrated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties.







Abstract
Delving into the influence of strain on organic reactions in small molecules at the molecular level can unveil valuable insight into developing innovative synthetic strategies and structuring molecules with superior properties. Herein, we present a molecular&#8208;strain engineering approach to facilitate the consecutive [1,2]&#8208;aryl shift (formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift) in molecular bows (MBs) that integrate 1,4&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2,5&#8208;cyclohexadiene moieties. By introducing ring strain into MBs through tethering the bow limb, we can harness the intrinsic mechanical forces to drive multistep aryl shifts from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208; to the ortho&#8208;position. Through the use of precise intramolecular strain, the seemingly impractical [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift was realized, resulting in the formation of ortho&#8208;disubstituted products. The solvent and temperature play a crucial role in the occurrence of the [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. The free energy calculations with inclusion of solvation support a feasible mechanism, which entails multistep carbocation rearrangements, for the formal [1,3]&#8208;aryl shift. By exploring the application of molecular strain in synthetic chemistry, this research offers a promising direction for developing new tools and strategies towards precision organic synthesis.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Biltz Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Biltz synthesis establishes straightforward access to 5,5&#8208;disubstituted (thio)hydantoins by combining a 1,2&#8208;diketone and a (thio)urea. Its appealing features include inherent atom and step economy together with the potential to generate structurally diverse products. However, control of the stereochemistry of this reaction has proven to be a daunting challenge. Herein, we describe the first example of enantioselective catalytic Biltz synthesis which affords more than 40 thiohydantoins with high stereo&#8208; and regio&#8208; control, irrespective of the symmetry of thiourea structure. A one pot synthesis of corresponding hydantoins is also documented. Remarkably, experimental studies and DFT calculations establish the reaction pathway and origin of stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coformer Approach for Supramolecular Polymerization at High Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound is poorly soluble in nonpolar solvent because of its organization through its hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs into a crystalline polymorph prior to supramolecular polymerization. Mixing a &#8220;supramolecular coformer&#8221; compound with the parent compound provide highly soluble co&#8208;aggregates, enabling supramolecular polymerization at high concentrations.







Abstract
Insolubility of functional molecules caused by polymorphism sometimes poses limitations for their solution&#8208;based processing. Such a situation can also occur in the preparation processes of supramolecular polymers formed in a solution. An effective strategy to address this issue is to prepare amorphous solid states by introducing a &#8220;coformer&#8221; molecule capable of inhibiting the formation of an insoluble polymorph through co&#8208;aggregation. Herein, inspired by the coformer approach, we demonstrated a solubility enhancement of a barbiturate &#960;&#8208;conjugated compound that can supramolecularly polymerize through six&#8208;membered hydrogen&#8208;bonded rosettes. Our newly synthesized supramolecular coformer molecule features a sterically demanding methyl group in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of the parent molecule. Although the parent molecule exhibits low solubility in nonpolar solvents due to the formation of a crystalline polymorph comprising a tape&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded array prior to the supramolecular polymerization, mixing with the coformer compound enhanced the solubility by inhibiting mesoscopic organization of the tapes. The two monomers were then co&#8208;polymerized into desired helicoidal supramolecular polymers through the formation of heteromeric rosettes.

         <title>Visible Light Responsive Dinuclear Zinc Complex Consisting of Proximally Arranged Two d10&#8208;Zinc Centers
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear Zn complex showing anomalous visible&#8208;light absorption using Zn orbitals is developed. Key to the success of the low&#8208;energy absorption is the short distance between coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers, which enables the Zn&#8722;Zn orbital interactions to dramatically decrease the energy gap of the complex. Such Zn&#8722;Zn interactions facilitate untapped photo&#8208;functions of a group&#8197;12 Zn metal.







Abstract
So far, Zn(II)&#8208;based d10 complexes have been known to be colorless unless they are accompanied by chromophoric groups, and therefore both fundamental and advanced photophysical performance of Zn centers of complexes, especially in visible&#8208;light regions has been unexplored. Here, we first demonstrate a dinuclear Zn(II) complex that shows visible light absorption using an orbital distributed over closely contacted two Zn centers experimentally determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A contrastive study demonstrated that intermetallic orbital interaction in dinuclear Zn(II) complex is responsible for capturing visible light to exhibit orangish yellow color, whereas an analogous one without such an interaction is colorless. This work demonstrates that introduction of Zn&#8722;Zn interactions to Zn(II) molecules contradicts the common notion that Zn is unresponsive to visible light and expands the photophysical field of zinc chemistry.

         <title>Ultrafluorogenic Monochromophore&#8208;Type BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazine Series for Dual&#8208;Color Bioorthogonal Imaging with a Single Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a series of ultrafluorogenic BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes, employing a monochromophoric strategy to acheive broad&#8208;spectrum fluorogenicity and effective bioorthogonal cellular imaging. These probes showcase a unique turn&#8208;on pattern with BCN and TCO, pioneering dual&#8208;color live&#8208;cell imaging with a single probe.







Abstract
Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)&#8208;selective fluorogenicity with three&#8208; to four&#8208;digit&#8208;fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far&#8208;red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY&#8208;Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN&#8208;selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY&#8208;Tz&#8208;BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual&#8208;color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY&#8208;Tz probe.

&lt;p&gt;This study presents a series of ultrafluorogenic BODIPY-Tz probes, employing a monochromophoric strategy to acheive broad-spectrum fluorogenicity and effective bioorthogonal cellular imaging. These probes showcase a unique turn-on pattern with BCN and TCO, pioneering dual-color live-cell imaging with a single probe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various fluorogenic probes utilizing tetrazine (Tz) as a fluorescence quencher and bioorthogonal reaction partner have been extensively studied over the past few decades. Herein, we synthesized a series of boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-Tz probes using monochromophoric design strategy for bioorthogonal cellular imaging. The BODIPY-Tz probes exhibited excellent bicyclo[6.1.0]nonyne (BCN)-selective fluorogenicity with three- to four-digit-fold enhancements in fluorescence over a wide range of emission wavelengths, including the far-red region. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of BODIPY-Tz probes in bioorthogonal fluorescence imaging of cellular organelles without washing steps. We also elucidated the aromatized pyridazine moiety as the origin of BCN-selective fluorogenic behavior. Additionally, we discovered that the fluorescence of the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cyclooctene (TCO) adducts was quenched in aqueous media via photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) process. Interestingly, we observed a distinctive recovery of the initially quenched fluorescence of BODIPY-Tz-TCO upon exposure to hydrophobic media, accompanied by a significant bathochromic shift of its emission wavelength relative to that exhibited by the corresponding BODIPY-Tz-BCN. Leveraging this finding, for the first time, we achieved dual-color bioorthogonal cellular imaging with a single BODIPY-Tz probe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Chiral Fixation and Chiral Regulation Endowed by Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality has been achieved by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, reversible [2+2] cycloaddition of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains allows inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and de&#8208;crosslinking to be controlled by light. This approach offers a pattern&#8208;embedded storage and retrieval mechanism for photo&#8208;editing chiral polymers.







Abstract
The construction of chiral superstructures through the self&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral polymers usually relies on the interplay of multiple non&#8208;covalent bonds, which is significantly limited by the memory ability of induced chirality. Although the introduction of covalent crosslinking can undoubtedly enhance the stability of chiral superstructures, the concurrent strong constraining effect hinders the application of chirality&#8208;smart materials. To address this issue, we have made a first attempt at the reversible fixation of supramolecular chirality by introducing dynamic covalent crosslinking into the chiral self&#8208;assembly of side&#8208;chain polymers. After chiral induction, the reversible [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the cinnamate group in the polymer chains can be further controlled by light to manipulate inter&#8208;chain crosslinking and decrosslinking. Based on this photo&#8208;programmable and dynamic chiral fixation strategy, a novel pattern&#8208;embedded storage mechanism of chiral polymeric materials was established for the first time.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Support Interactions Boost the Electrocatalytic Water Splitting of Supported Ruthenium Nanoparticles on a Ni3N/NiO Heterojunction at Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of a Ni3N/NiO heterostructure in Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO results in a highly electroactive surface that ensures high electroactivity and alleviates the overbinding effect. The construction of a high&#8208;density triple&#8208;phase interface is achieved, with highly active catalytic sites for electrochemical water splitting, involving hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER).







Abstract
Developing highly efficient and stable hydrogen production catalysts for electrochemical water splitting (EWS) at industrial current densities remains a great challenge. Herein, we proposed a heterostructure&#8208;induced&#8208;strategy to optimize the metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) and the EWS activity of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations firstly predicted that the Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures can improve the structural stability, electronic distributions, and orbital coupling of Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO compared to Ru&#8208;Ni3N and Ru&#8208;NiO, which accordingly decreases energy barriers and increases the electroactivity for EWS. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO catalyst with a 2D Ni3N/NiO&#8208;heterostructures nanosheet array, uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles, and strong MSI, was successfully constructed in the experiment, which exhibited excellent HER and OER activity with overpotentials of 190&#8197;mV and 385&#8197;mV at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Furthermore, the Ru&#8208;Ni3N/NiO&#8208;based EWS device can realize an industrial current density (1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at 1.74&#8197;V and 1.80&#8197;V under alkaline pure water and seawater conditions, respectively. Additionally, it also achieves a high durability of 1000&#8197;h (@ 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in alkaline pure water.

         <title>Divergent Photosensitizer Controlled Reactions of 4&#8208;Hydroxycoumarins and Unactivated Olefins: Hydroarylation and Subsequent [2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins were converted into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, allowing for hydroarylation of unactivated and electron&#8208;rich olefins. Moreover, by tuning the photocatalyst (PC), structurally complex cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products were constructed in a single step via a cascade of hydroarylation and [2+2] cycloaddition.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photoinduced approach for hydroarylation of unactivated olefins using 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins as the arylating reagent. Key to the success of this reaction is the conversion of nucleophilic 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins into electrophilic carbon radicals via photocatalytic arene oxidation, which not only circumvents the polarity&#8208;mismatch issue encountered under ionic conditions but also accommodates a broad substrate scope and inhibits side reactions that were previously observed. Moreover, divergent reactivity was achieved by changing the photocatalyst, enabling a subsequent [2+2] cycloaddition to deliver cyclobutane&#8208;fused pentacyclic products that are otherwise challenging to access in high yields and with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies have elucidated the mechanism of the reactions and the origin of the divergent reactivity.

         <title>Porous Cyclodextrin Polymer Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free and Ultra&#8208;Long Life Solid&#8208;State Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A solid polymer electrolyte based on non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect of CD&#8208;Si and double transmission channels is exploited to suppress Zn dendrites growth and shuttle effect of polyiodide, achieving outstanding cycle&#8208;stability of symmetrical batteries and ultralong&#8208;life solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery.







Abstract
Zn&#8208;I2 batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, safety, and environmental friendliness. However, their performance is still limited by the irreversible growth of Zn dendrites, hydrogen evolution reactions, corrosion, and shuttle effect of polyiodide. In this work, we have prepared a new porous polymer (CD&#8208;Si) by nucleophilic reaction of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with SiCl4, and CD&#8208;Si is applied to the solid polymer electrolyte (denoted PEO/PVDF/CD&#8208;Si) to solve above&#8208;mentioned problems. Through the anchoring of the CD&#8208;Si, a conductive network with dual transmission channels was successfully constructed. Due to the non&#8208;covalent anchoring effect, the ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) can reach 1.64&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C. The assembled symmetrical batteries can achieve highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free galvanizing/stripping (stable cycling for 7500&#8197;h at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1200&#8197;h at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;I2 battery shows an ultra&#8208;long life of over 35,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to elucidate the working mechanism of CD&#8208;Si in the polymer matrix. This work provides a novel strategy towards solid electrolytes for Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>Controlling Metal&#8208;Oxide Reducibility for Efficient C&#8722;H Bond Activation in Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through catalyst post&#8208;treatment in an NH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O solution, structural and chemical properties of supported metal oxide species can be controlled because of dissolution&#8208;recrystallization of amorphous or/and low&#8208;crystalline support in the parent catalyst. The method is applicable for tailoring the catalyst reducibility and thus its activity for C&#8722;H activation in hydrocarbons.







Abstract
Knowing the structure of catalytically active species/phases and providing methods for their purposeful generation are two prerequisites for the design of catalysts with desired performance. Herein, we introduce a simple method for precise preparation of supported/bulk catalysts. It utilizes the ability of metal oxides to dissolve and to simultaneously precipitate during their treatment in an aqueous ammonia solution. Applying this method for a conventional VOx&#8722;Al2O3 catalyst, the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated Al sites was tuned simply by changing the pH value of the solution. These sites affect the strength of V&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds of isolated VOx species and thus the reducibility of the latter. This method is also applicable for controlling the reducibility of bulk catalysts as demonstrated for a CeO2&#8722;ZrO2&#8722;Al2O3 system. The application potential of the developed catalysts was confirmed in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene with CO2 and in the non&#8208;oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Our approach is extendable to the preparation of any metal oxide catalysts dissolvable in an ammonia solution.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;2D Layered Organic&#8208;Inorganic Manganese Bromide with a Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield for White Light&#8208;Emitting Diode and X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered organic&#8211;inorganic manganese bromide with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and high thermal quenching resistance was developed and explored as a green phosphor for wide color gamut light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and as a scintillator for sensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging, with performance superior to that of most commercial phosphors and scintillators, respectively.







Abstract
Eco&#8208;friendly lead&#8208;free organic&#8211;inorganic manganese halides (OIMHs) have attracted considerable attention in various optoelectronic applications because of their superior optical properties and flexible solution processibility. Herein, we report a novel pseudo&#8208;2D layered OIMH (MTP)2MnBr4 (MTP: methyltriphenylphosphonium), which exhibits intense green emission under UV/blue or X&#8208;ray excitation, with a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, high resistance to thermal quenching (I150&#8201;&#176;C=84.1&#8201;%) and good photochemical stability. These features enable (MTP)2MnBr4 as an efficient green phosphor for blue&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes, demonstrating a commercial&#8208;level luminous efficiency of 101&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1 and a wide color gamut of 116&#8201;% NTSC. Moreover, these (MTP)2MnBr4 crystals showcase outstanding X&#8208;ray scintillation properties, delivering a light yield of 67000 photon MeV&#8722;1, a detection limit of 82.4&#8197;nGy&#8201;s&#8722;1, and a competitive spatial resolution of 6.2&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 for X&#8208;ray imaging. This work presents a new avenue for the exploration of eco&#8208;friendly luminescent OIMHs towards multifunctional light&#8208;emitting applications.

         <title>DNA Nanostructures: Self&#8208;Adjuvant Carriers for Highly Efficient Subunit Vaccines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we provide a concise overview of the unique properties exhibited by DNA nanostructures. Then we delve into the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in efficient subunit vaccines construction, and propose potential directions for future development in this field.







Abstract
Subunit vaccines based on antigen proteins or epitopes of pathogens or tumors show advantages in immunological precision and high safety, but are often limited by their low immunogenicity. Adjuvants can boost immune responses by stimulating immune cells or promoting antigen uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs), yet existing clinical adjuvants struggle in simultaneously achieving these dual functions. Additionally, the spatial organization of antigens might be crucial to their immunogenicity. Hence, superior adjuvants should potently stimulate the immune system, precisely arrange antigens, and effectively deliver antigens to APCs. Recently, precisely organizing and delivering antigens with the unique editability of DNA nanostructures has been proposed, presenting unique abilities in significantly improving the immunogenicity of antigens. In this minireview, we will discuss the principles behind using DNA nanostructures as self&#8208;adjuvant carriers and review the latest advancements in this field. The potential and challenges associated with self&#8208;adjuvant DNA nanostructures will also be discussed.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse structural designs has led to the development of chalcone&#8208;flavylium systems that exhibit efficient switching across a wide spectrum of visible light, including long&#8208;wavelength red light in aqueous environments avoiding the typical UV&#8208;induced switches.







Abstract
The chalcone&#8208;flavylium photochromic system switches in aqueous media. However, the chalcone&#8594;flavylium conversion requires detrimental ultra&#8208;violet (UV) light for the switching which deters their applications in the biological domain. To address this issue, we have synthesized strategically modified chalcone scaffolds that can be reversibly switched to the flavylium forms with visible light ranging from 456&#8197;nm (blue) to 640&#8197;nm (red).

         <title>Reversible Boron&#8208;Insertion into Aromatic C&#8722;C Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via reversible boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes. The reaction mechanism was clarified to consist of sequential two electrocyclic reactions with E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety through a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.







Abstract
Formation of borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives was achieved via boron&#8208;insertion into aromatic C&#8722;C bonds in the photo&#8208;promoted skeletal rearrangement reaction of triarylboranes bearing an ortho&#8208;phosphino substituent (ambiphilic phosphine&#8208;boranes). The borabicyclo[3.2.0]heptadiene derivatives were fully characterized by NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses. The dearomatized products were demonstrated to undergo the reverse reaction in the dark at room temperature, realizing photochemical and thermal interconversion between triarylboranes and boron&#8208;doped bicyclic systems. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that sequential two electrocyclic reactions involving E/Z&#8208;isomerization of an alkene moiety proceed via a highly strained trans&#8208;borepin intermediate.

         <title>Merging Visible Light Photocatalysis and P(III)&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Activation by a Single Catalyst: Modular Assembly of P&#8208;Alkyne Hybrid Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation strategies provide an efficient approach for synthesis by minimizing atom, step, and redox economy. Developing milder, greener, and more effective protocols for these strategies is always highly desirable to the scientific community. In this study, the utilization of a single rhodium complex enabled the visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced late&#8208;stage C&#8211;H activation of biaryl&#8208;type phosphines with alkynyl bromides, employing inherent phosphorus atoms as directing groups. This chemistry combines P(III)&#8208;directed C&#8211;H activation with visible light photocatalysis, under exogenous photosensitizer&#8208;free conditions, offering a unique platform for ligand design and preparation.Furthermore, this study also explores the asymmetric catalysis and coordination chemistry of the resulting P&#8208;alkyne hybrid ligands with specific transition metals. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate the mechanistic intricacies of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light Photoiniferter Polymerization for Dispersity Control in High Molecular Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights, controlled sequence and tunable dispersities remains a challenge. A simple and effective visible&#8208;light controlled photoiniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported here to realize this goal. Key to this strategy is the use of switchable RAFT agents (SRAs) to tune polymerization activities coupled with the inherent high livingness of photoiniferter RAFT polymerization. The polymerization activities of SRAs were in situ adjusted by addition of acid. In addition to switchable chain transfer coefficient, photolysis and polymerization kinetic studies revealed that neutral and protonated SRAs showed different photolysis and polymerization rates, which is unique to photoiniferter RAFT polymerization in dispersity control. This strategy features no catalyst, no exogenous radical source, temporal regulation by visible light, and tunable dispersities in the unprecedented high molecular weight regime (up to ~500 kg mol&#8208;1). Pentablock copolymers with three different dispersity combinations were also synthesized, highlighting that high livingness was maintained even for blocks with large dispersities. Tg was lowered for high&#8208;dispersity polymers of similar MWs due to the existence of more low&#8208;MW polymers. This strategy holds great potential in synthesis of advanced materials with controlled molecular weight, dispersity and sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Thermal Quenching of Photoluminescence from an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid [MnBr4]2&#8208;&#8208;based Halide Mediated by Crystalline&#8211;Crystalline Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) behavior has been of primary importance for applications in information security. Excavating novel optical effects to create more possibilities for information encoding has become a continuous challenge. Herein, we present an unprecedented PL temporary quenching that highly couples with thermodynamic phase transition in a hybrid crystal (DMML)2MnBr4 (DMML = N,N&#8208;dimethylmorpholinium). Such unusual PL behavior originates from the anomalous variation of [MnBr4]2&#8208; tetrahedrons that leads to non&#8208;radiation recombination near the phase transition temperature of 340 K. Remarkably, suitable detectable temperature, narrow responsive window, high sensibility, and good cyclability of this PL temporary quenching will endow encryption applications with high concealment, operational flexibility, durability, and commercial popularization. Profited from these attributes, a fire&#8208;new optical encryption model is devised to demonstrate high confidential information security. This unprecedented optical effect would provide new insights and paradigms for the development of luminescent materials to enlighten future information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Guest Molecules inside Cation&#8208;Lidded Cucurbiturils Reveals that Hydration of Receptor Sites Can Impede Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Docking of alkali metal ions to water&#8208;soluble macrocyclic receptors generally reduces the affinity of guest molecules due to competitive binding. The idea that solvation water molecules could display a larger steric hindrance towards guest binding than cations has not been considered to date. We show that the docking of large cations to cucurbit[5]uril (CB5) unexpectedly increases (by a factor of 5&#8208;8) the binding of hydrophobic guests, methane and ethane. This is due to the removal of water molecules from the carbonyl portals of CB5 during cation binding, which frees up space for hydrophobe encapsulation. In contrast, smaller cations like sodium protrude deeply into the cavity of CB5 and cause the expected decrease in binding, such that the rational selection of alkali cations allows for a variation of up to a factor of 20 in binding of methane and ethane. The statistical analysis of crystallographic data shows that the cavity volume of CB5 can be enlarged by placing large alkali ions (Rb+ and Cs+) centro&#8208;symmetrically at the portals. The results reveal a hitherto elusive steric hindrance of solvation water molecules near receptor binding sites, which is pertinent for the design of supramolecular catalysts and the understanding of biological receptors.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The advancement of sustainable photoredox catalysis in synthetic organic chemistry has evolved immensely because of the development of versatile and cost&#8208;effective reagents. In recent years, a substantial effort has been dedicated to exploring the utility of formic acid salts in various photochemical reactions. In this context, formates have demonstrated diverse capabilities, functioning as reductants, sources of carbonyl groups, and reagents for hydrogen atom transfer. Notably, the CO2&#8226;&#8211; radical anion derived from formate exhibits strong reductant properties for cleaving both C&#8208;X and C&#8208;O bonds. Moreover, these salts play a pivotal role in carboxylation reactions, further highlighting their significance in a variety of photochemical transformations. The ability of formates to serve as reductants, carbonyl sources, and hydrogen atom transfer reagents reveal exciting possibilities in synthetic organic chemistry. This minireview highlights an array of captivating discoveries, underscoring the crucial role of formates in diverse and distinctive photochemical methods, enabling access to a wide range of value&#8208;added compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylated ketones have attracted significant attention as valuable building blocks in organic synthesis. Such compounds are generally accessed through trifluoromethylation of ketones. Here we report an alternative disconnection approach for the construction of &#945;&#8208;CF3 carbonyl compounds by using aroyl fluorides as bifunctional reagents for fluoroaroylation of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes through cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis. This strategy bypasses the use of expensive or sensitive trifluoromethylation reagents and/or the requirement for ketone pre&#8208;functionalization, thus enabling an efficient and general synthetic method to access &#945;&#8208;CF3&#8208;substituted ketones. A wide variety of gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and aroyl fluorides bearing a diverse set of functional groups are eligible substrates. Notably, the developed methodology also provides rapid access to mono&#8208; or difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies reveal that merging photoredox catalysis with NHC catalysis is essential for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver and Copper Nitride Cooperate for CO Electroreduction to Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The need of carbon sources for the chemical industry, alternative to fossil sources, has pointed to CO2 as a possible feedstock. While CO2 electroreduction (CO2R) allows production of interesting organic compounds, it suffers from large carbon losses, mainly due to carbonate formation. This is why, quite recently, tandem CO2R, a two&#8208;step process, with first CO2R to CO using a solid oxide electrolysis cell followed by CO electroreduction (COR), has been considered, since no carbon is lost as carbonate in either step. Here we report a novel copper&#8208;based catalyst, silver&#8208;doped copper nitride, with record selectivity for formation of propanol (Faradic efficiency: 45%), an industrially relevant compound, from CO electroreduction in gas&#8208;fed flow cells. Selective propanol formation occurs at metallic copper atoms derived from copper nitride and is promoted by silver doping as shown experimentally and computationally. In addition, the selectivity for C2+ liquid products (Faradic efficiency: 80%) is among the highest reported so far. These findings open new perspectives regarding the design of catalysts for production of C3 compounds from CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A Heterometallic Porphyrin Dimer as a Potential Quantum Gate: Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations and Spin Coherence Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of two&#8208;qubit quantum gates, precise control over the intramolecular spin&#8208;spin interaction between molecular spin units plays a pivotal role. A weak but measurable exchange coupling is especially important for achieving selective spin addressability that allows controlled manipulation of the computational basis states &#448;00&#10217; &#448;01&#10217; &#448;10&#10217; &#448;11&#10217; by microwave pulses. Here, we report the synthesis and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) study of a heterometallic meso&#8208;meso (m&#8208;m) singly&#8208;linked VIVO&#8211;CuII porphyrin dimer. X&#8208;band continuous wave EPR measurements in frozen solutions suggest a ferromagnetic exchange coupling of ca. 8 &#8729; 10&#8722;3 cm&#8722;1. This estimation is supported by Density Functional Theory calculations, which also allow disentangling the ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnetic contributions to the exchange. Pulsed EPR experiments show that the dimer maintains relaxation times similar to the monometallic CuII porphyrins. The addressability of the two individual spins is made possible by the different g&#8208;tensors of VIV and CuII&#8208;ions, in contrast to homometallic dimers where tilting of the porphyrin planes plays a key role. Therefore, single&#8208;spin addressability in the heterometallic dimer can be maintained even with small tilting angles, as expected when deposited on surface, unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum gates for practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;responsive protein conformation transistor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analogous to electronic transistors, transistor&#8208;like responsive materials undergo sharp structural transitions in response to a very narrow range of microenvironment signals. This kind of material is typically limited in synthetic polymer&#8208;derived nanoscale assembly or disassembly and has profound implications for modern high&#8208;tech applications. Herein, we evolve this system from synthetic polymers to biopolymers and extend the corresponding assembly scale from nanoscale to meso/macro&#8208;scale. We develop unique protein nanocrystals with core&#8208;shell structures through a two&#8208;step nucleation process. The protein nanocrystals exhibit exceptional transistor&#8208;like pH&#8208;responsive mesoscale assembly through formation of inter&#8208;particle &#946;&#8208;sheet linkers. This allows ultrasensitive cross&#8208;linking behavior, such as self&#8208;coacervation at water/water interface, ultrafast gelation in seconds, and ultrasensitive swelling for detection of basic vapors at extremely low concentration. This breakthrough has great promise for broader applications such as drug encapsulation and delivery, biosensing, cytomimetic materials, and microfluidic chemistry</dc:description>

         <title>Tailored Design of &#960;&#8208;Extended Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron using Indolo[3,2&#8208;b]Indole as a Multi&#8208;Nitrogen Bridge</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Extending the &#960;&#8208;skeletons of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) organoboron emitters can feasibly modulate their optoelectronic properties. Here, we first adopt the indolo[3,2&#8208;b]indole (32bID) segment as a multi&#8208;nitrogen bridge and develop a high&#8208;efficiency &#960;&#8208;extended narrowband green emitter. This moiety establishes not only a high&#8208;yield one&#8208;shot multiple Bora&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction towards a &#960;&#8208;extended MR skeleton, but a compact N&#8208;ethylene&#8208;N motif for a red&#8208;shifted narrowband emission. An emission peak at 524 nm, a small full width at half maximum of 25 nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96% are concurrently obtained in dilute toluene. The extended molecular plane also results in a large horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio of 87%. A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% and a maximum power efficiency of 135.2 lm/W are thereafter recorded for the corresponding device, also allowing a low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQEs of 34.5% and 28.1% at luminance of 1,000 cd/m2 and 10,000 cd/m2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical two&#8208;electron water oxidation (2e WOR) is gaining surging research traction for sustainable hydrogen peroxide production. However, the strong oxidizing environment and thermodynamically competitive side&#8208;reaction (4e WOR) posit as thresholds for the 2e WOR. We herein report a custom&#8208;crafted covalent triazine network possessing strong oxidizing properties as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept metal&#8208;free functional organic network electrocatalyst for catalyzing 2e WOR. As the first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind, the material shows a maximum of 89.9% Faradaic Efficiency and 1428 &#956;mol/h/cm2 H2O2 production rate at 3.0 V bias potential (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), which are either better or comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. We have experimentally confirmed a stepwise 2e WOR mechanism which was further computationally endorsed by density functional theory studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating the Solvating Power of Solvents with the Strength of Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction in Electrolytes of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The solvation structure of Li+ plays a significant role in determining the physicochemical properties of electrolytes. However, to date, there is still no clear definition of the solvating power of different electrolyte solvents, and even the solvents that preferentially participate in the solvation structure remain controversial. In this study, we comprehensively discuss the solvating power and solvation process of Li+ ions using both experimental characterizations and computational calculations. Our findings reveal that the solvating power is dependent on the strength of the Li+&#8208;solvent (ion&#8208;dipole) interaction. Additionally, we uncover that anions tend to enter the solvation sheath in most electrolyte systems through Li+&#8208;anion (ion&#8208;ion) interaction, which is weakened by the shielding effect of solvents. The competition between the Li+&#8208;solvent and Li+&#8208;anion interactions ultimately determines the final solvation structures. This insight into the fundamental understanding of the solvation structure of Li+ ions provides inspiration for the design of multifunctional mixed&#8208;solvent electrolytes for advanced batteries.</dc:description>
