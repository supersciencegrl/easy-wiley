      <title>A surface strained and geometry tailored nanoreactor promotes the ammonia electrosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>A surface strained and geometry optimized TiO  2  nanoreactor was reported to enhance the performance of the electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation. The nanotubular confinement allows to spatially regulate the mass transport of nitrogen during the NRR process and offers an enlarged surface area, thus boosting the ammonia production with high selectivity. Besides, both experimental and theoretical evidence support strained Ti  3+  sites demonstrate a more favorable pathway for the N  2  activation and selective NH  3  production with a faster kinetic rate than the pristine TiO  2  . Therefore, TiO  2  &#8208;based nanoreactor with surface and bulk structure tailoring delivered the NH  3  yield rate up to 5.50 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;2  (16.67 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  &#8208;1  ) and the high faradaic efficiency of 26% under ambient aqueous conditions. Our findings highlight the concept of lattice strain and geometry modified nanoreactors, which will have broad implications in the renewable energy catalysis and electrosynthesis of valuable products.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Multiplexed Activity Profiling of Synthetic Acylphloroglucinol Scaffolds</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report novel formic acid&#8208;mediated rearrangements of dearomatized acylphloroglucinols to access a structurally diverse group of synthetic acylphloroglucinol scaffolds (SASs). Density functional theory (DFT)&#8208;optimized orbital and stereochemical analyses shed light on the mechanism of these rearrangements. Products were evaluated by multiplexed activity profiling (MAP), an unbiased platform which determines multiple biological readouts simultaneously at single&#8208;cell resolution for markers of cell signaling and can aid in distinguishing genuine activity from assay interference. Using MAP, we identified a number of SASs that suppressed pS6 (Ser235/236), a marker for activation of the mTOR and ERK signaling pathways.

      <title>Effects of anion carriers on capacitance and self&#8208;discharge behaviors of zinc ion capacitor</title>

      <title>Mn&#8208;O Covalency Governs the Intrinsic Activity of Co&#8208;Mn Spinel Oxides for Boosted Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal (TM)&#8208;based bimetallic spinel oxides can efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) presumably attributed to enhanced electron transfer between TMs, but the existing model cannot fully explain the efficient TM redox cycling. Here, we discover a critical role of TM&#8208;O covalency in governing the intrinsic catalytic activity of Co  3&#8208;x  Mn  x  O  4  spinel oxides. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the Co sites significantly raises the Mn valence and enlarges Mn&#8208;O covalency in octahedral configuration, thereby lowering the charge transfer energy to favor Mn  Oh  &#8208;PMS interaction. With appropriate Mn  IV  /Mn  III  ratio to balance PMS adsorption and Mn  IV  reduction, the Co  1.1  Mn  1.9  O  4  exhibits remarkable catalytic activities for PMS activation and pollutant degradation, outperforming all the reported TM spinel oxides. The improved understandings on the origins of spinel oxides activity for PMS activation may inspire the development of more active and robust metal oxide catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Needles from haystacks: single&#8208;scan selective excitation of individual NMR signals in overlapping multiplets</title>
      <dc:description>2D NMR is an immensely powerful structural tool, but time&#8208;consuming. Targeting individual chemical groups by selective excitation in a 1D experiment can give the information required far more quickly. A major problem, however, is that proton NMR spectra are often extensively overlapped, so that in practice only a minority of sites can be selectively excited. Here we overcome that problem using a fast, single&#8208;scan method that allows selective excitation of the signals of a single proton multiplet even where it is severely overlapped by other multiplets. The advantages of the method are illustrated in a selective 1D NOESY experiment, the most efficient way to determine relative configuration unambiguously by NMR. The new approach presented here has the potential to broaden significantly the applicability of selective excitation, and unlock its real potential for many other experiments.</dc:description>

      <title>Precise alkoxyamine&#8208;design enables automated tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of digital poly(phosphodiester)s</title>
      <dc:description>Increasing data storage density is one of the major challenges of the information industry.

The overpotential (at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) for NiP2&#8208;650 (c/m  ) in alkaline media could be significantly reduced by 26% and 96% compared with  c&#8208;NiP2  and  m&#8208;NiP2  , respectively. The enhancement of&#160;catalytic activity should be attributed to the strong water dissociation ability and the rearrangement of electrons around the phase&#8208;junction, which markedly improved the Volmer step and benefited the reduction process of adsorbed protons.</dc:description>

      <title>Antioxidative Stannous Oxalate Derived Lead&#8208;Free Stable CsSnX3&#160;(X = Cl, Br, and I) Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>The current research on all&#8208;inorganic perovskite NCs is mainly focused on Pb&#8208;based materials (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I). However, the toxicity of Pb has become a major obstacle to its application. Correspondingly, lead&#8208;free CsSnX3 perovskite NCs are becoming a promising alternative, but suffer from extremely poor stability. Herein, we highlight the significant effect of Sn(II) precursors used in the synthesis on the stability of the resultant CsSnX3 NCs. A new method is proposed for synthesizing CsSnX3 NCs using Cs2CO3, SnC2O4, and NH4X as corresponding constituent precursors, wherein the ratio of reactants can be facilely adjusted. Stable CsSnX3 NCs can be obtained with the use of antioxidative SnC2O4 as the Sn(II) precursor. Experimental results show that the improvement of NCs stability is mainly ascribed to the role of oxalate in the SnC2O4 precursor. Oxalate ion has a strong antioxidative ability and can effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn(II) during the synthesis. Besides, oxalate as a bidentate capping ligand is demonstrated to be coordinated on the surface of formed NCs. This can not only passivate the uncoordinated Sn on the surface but also prevent the oxidation of the NCs.</dc:description>

      <title>Shear stress&#8208;responsive polymersome nanoreactors inspired by the marine bioluminescence of dinoflagellates</title>
      <dc:description>Some marine plankton called dinoflagellates emit light in response to the movement of surrounding water, resulting in a phenomenon called milky seas or sea sparkle. The underlying concept, a shear&#8208;stress induced permeabilisation of biocatalytic reaction compartments, is transferred to polymer&#8208;based nanoreactors. Amphiphilic block copolymers that carry nucleobases in their hydrophobic block are self&#8208;assembled into polymersomes. The membrane of the vesicles can be transiently switched between an impermeable to a semipermeble state by shear forces occurring in flow or during turbulent mixing of polymersome dispersions. Nucleobase pairs in the hydrophobic leaflet separate when mechanical force is applied, exposing their hydrogen bonding motifs and therefore making the membrane less hydrophobic and more permeable for water soluble compounds. This polarity switch is used to release payload of the polymersomes on demand, and to activate biocatalytic reactions in the interior of the polymersomes, such as luminescence reactions or radical polymerizations catalysed by the enzyme horseradish peroxidase. Such bio&#8208;inspired shear stress&#8209;responsive nanoreactors have potential for applications ranging from gel&#8208;formation on demand, to three&#8208;dimensional inkjet printing, and shear&#8208;stress triggered drug delivery.</dc:description>

      <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair Chelation as a Vehicle for Low Temperature Semiconductor Element and Polymer Deposition</title>

The resulting hydride complexes [PB{SiH2}] and [PB{GeH2}] are indefinitely stable at room temperature, yet can deposit films of silicon and germanium, respectively, upon mild thermolysis in solution. Hallmarks of this work include: (1) the ability to recycle the FLP phosphine&#8208;borane ligand (PB) after element deposition, and (2) the single&#8208;source precursor [PB{SiH2}] deposits Si films at a record low temperature from solution (110 &#176;C). The dialkylsilicon(II) adduct [PB{SiMe2}] was also prepared, and shown to release poly(dimethylsilane) [SiMe2]n upon heating. Overall, this study introduces a &#8220;closed loop&#8221; deposition strategy for semiconductors that steers materials science away from the use of harsh reagents or high temperatures.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous Enantiospecific Detection of Multiple Compounds in Mixtures using NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>Chirality plays a fundamental role in nature, but its detection and quantification still face many limitations. To date, the enantiospecific analysis of mixtures necessarily requires prior separation of the individual components. The simultaneous enantiospecific detection of multiple chiral molecules in a mixture represents a major challenge, which would lead to a significantly better understanding of the underlying biological processes; e.g. via enantiospecifically analysing metabolites in their native environment. Here, we report on the first in situ enantiospecific detection of a thirty&#8208;nine&#8208;component mixture. As a proof of concept, eighteen essential amino acids at physiological concentrations were simultaneously enantiospecifically detected using NMR spectroscopy and a chiral solvating agent. This work represents a first step towards the simultaneous multicomponent enantiospecific analysis of complex mixtures, a capability that will have substantial impact on metabolism studies, metabolic phenotyping, chemical reaction monitoring, and many other fields where complex mixtures containing chiral molecules require efficient characterisation.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing isolated M&#8208;N3C1 active sites for efficient collaborative oxygen reduction catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) are of great importance for oxygen reduction, a critical process in renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. The catalytic performance of SACs largely depends on the structure of their active sites, but explorations of highly active structures for SAC active sites are still limited. Herein, we demonstrate a combined experimental and theoretical study of oxygen reduction catalysis on SACs, which incorporate M&#8208;N 3  C 1  site structure, composed of atomically dispersed transition metals (e.g., Fe, Co, and Cu) in nitrogen doped carbon nanosheets. The resulting SACs with M&#8208;N 3  C 1  sites exhibited prominent oxygen reduction catalytic activities in both acidic and alkaline media, following the trend Fe&#8208;N 3  C 1  &gt; Co&#8208;N 3  C 1  &gt; Cu&#8208;N 3  C 1  . Theoretical calculations suggest the C atoms in these structures behave as collaborative adsorption sites to M atoms, thanks to interactions between the d  / p  orbitals of the M/C atoms in the M&#8208;N 3  C 1  sites, enabling dual site oxygen reduction. Compared with the common single site mechanism, the proposed dual site mechanism was determined to be more favorable for oxygen reduction catalysis, in good agreement with the experimental findings.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymers via the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Interest in linear conjugated polymers has significantly increased in recent decades due to their semiconducting properties and promising applications in organic optoelectronics. To date, the extension of linear conjugated polymers into two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2D CPs), which can also be regarded as 2D &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs), remains largely unexplored due to limited synthetic methodologies. In this work, we demonstrate the first synthesis of vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs, namely, 2D poly(phenylenequinoxalinevinylene)s  2D&#8208;PPQV1  and  2D&#8208;PPQV2  ,  via  the Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) reaction of  C  2  &#8208;symmetric 1,4&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)benzene or 4,4'&#8208;bis(diethylphosphonomethyl)biphenyl with  C  3  &#8208;symmetric 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;  a  :2',3'&#8208;  c  ]phenazine as monomers. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations unveil the crucial role of the initial reversible C&#8208;C single bond formation for the synthesis of crystalline 2D CPs. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) studies and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption measurements demonstrate the formation of proclaimed crystalline, dual&#8208;pore structures with surface areas of up to 440 m  2  /g. More importantly, the optoelectronic properties of the obtained  2D&#8208;PPQV1  (E  g  =2.2 eV) and  2D&#8208;PPQV2  (E  g  =2.2 eV) are compared with those of cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked  2D&#8208;CN&#8208;PPQV1  (E  g  =2.4 eV) produced by the Knoevenagel reaction and imine&#8208;linked 2D COF analog (  2D&#8208;C=N&#8208;PPQV1  , E  g  =2.3 eV), unambiguously proving the superior conjugation of the vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs using the HWE reaction.</dc:description>

More importantly, the optoelectronic properties of the obtained  2D&#8208;PPQV1  (E  g  =2.2 eV) and  2D&#8208;PPQV2  (E  g  =2.2 eV) are compared with those of cyano&#8208;vinylene&#8208;linked  2D&#8208;CN&#8208;PPQV1  (E  g  =2.4 eV) produced by the Knoevenagel reaction and imine&#8208;linked 2D COF analog (  2D&#8208;C=N&#8208;PPQV1  , E  g  =2.3 eV), unambiguously proving the superior conjugation of the vinylene&#8208;linked 2D CPs using the HWE reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Assembly&#8208;Induced Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Spirocyclic Chiral Silver(I) Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular assembly of molecular chiral compounds is crucial for the comprehension of chirality propagation and achieving superior chirality&#8208;related properties. In this work, spirocyclic Ag 9  clusters as a new form of intrinsically chiral metal clusters have been constructed through vertex&#8208;sharing of two in situ  generated heteroaryl diide&#8208;centered metal rings. Such core&#8208;peripheral type clusters exhibit versatile photoluminescent and chiroptical behaviours under different aggregation conditions. In contrast to a ligand&#8208;based fluorescence emission in a diluted solution of the clusters, a solvent polarity&#8208;caused assembly gives rise to new cluster&#8208;based phosphorous luminescence due to radiative mode switching and aggregation&#8208;induced emission. Furthermore, the assembly of cluster enantiomers engenders micrometer&#8208;long helical nanofibers, whose handedness is determined by absolute configuration of individual spirocyclic clusters. Benefiting from exciton couplings of helical arrangements of chelating ligands at both molecular and microscopic levels, the assembled film of cluster enantiomers exhibits circularly polarized luminescence with a remarkably high anisotropy factor of 0.16.</dc:description>

Zeolite channel geometry&#8211;reaction intermediate relationships during the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon process were identified using advanced solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. As described by M. Baldus, B.&#8197;M.

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethane through Stabilization of an Ethoxy Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>
Iodide&#8208;derived copper shows higher selectivity and faster kinetics towards ethane production from CO2 than other catalyst systems. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202004846), H.&#8197;M. Chen, Y. Zheng, S.&#8197;Z. Qiao, and co&#8208;workers use in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and in&#8197;situ Raman techniques to show that trace iodine and positively charged copper species better stabilize the ethoxy intermediate, which was found to be the selectivity&#8208;determining intermediate towards ethane production.

      <dc:description>The reaction of bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl pinacol boronic ester (BCB&#8208;Bpin) with nucleophiles has been studied. Unlike BCBs bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, which react with nucleophiles at the &#946;&#8208;position, BCB&#8208;Bpin reacts with a diverse set of heteroatom (O, S, N)&#8208;centred nucleophiles exclusively at the &#945;&#8208;position. Aliphatic alcohols, phenols, carboxylic acids, thiols and sulfonamides were found to be competent nucleophiles, providing ready access to &#945;&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted cyclobutyl boronic esters. In contrast, sterically hindered bis&#8208;sulfonamides and related nucleophiles reacted with BCB&#8208;Bpin at the &#946;&#8217;&#8208;position leading to cyclopropanes with high trans&#8208;selectivity.

We report that, using the spiro&#8208;cyclization of amides as a benchmark reaction, aerobic iodoarene catalysis can be enabled by relying on a pyrylium photocatalyst under blue light irradiation.

      <title>Dual Intramolecular Electron Transfer for In Situ Coreactant&#8208;Embedded Electrochemiluminescence Microimaging of Membrane Protein</title>
      <dc:description>The demand for transporting coreactant to emitter and short lifetime of the radicals in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission inhibit greatly its application in cytosensing and microscopic imaging. Herein we designed a dual intramolecular electron transfer strategy and tertiary amine conjugated polymer dots (TEA&#8208;Pdots) to develop a coreactant&#8208;embedded ECL mechanism and microimaging system. The TEA&#8208;Pdots could produce ECL emission at +1.2 V without need of coreactant in test solution. The superstructure and intramolecular electron transfer led to unprecedented ECL strength, which was 132 and 45 times stronger than those from the mixture of Pdots with TEA at equiv  alent and 62.5 times higher amounts, respectively. The ECL efficiency was even higher than that of typical [Ru(bpy) 3  ] 2+  system. Therefore, this strategy and coreactant&#8208;embedded ECL system could be used for in situ ECL microimaging of membrane protein on single living cells without additional permeable treatment for transporting coreactant. The feasibility and validity were demonstrated by evaluating the specific protein expression on cell surface. This work opens new avenues for ECL applications in single cell analysis and dynamic study of biological events.</dc:description>

      <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Symmetry&#8208;Tuned Polarity and Photocatalytic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>The polarity of a semiconducting molecule dominantly affects its intrinsic photophysical properties, which can be tuned by varying the molecular geometry. Herein, we developed a  D3h&#8208;symmetric tricyanomesitylene as a new monomer which could be reticulated into a vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF) via Knoevenagel condensation with another  D3h&#8208;symmetric monomer 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8242;&#8208;formyl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Meanwhile, replacing tricyanomesitylene with a  C2v&#8208;symmetric 3,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine gave birth to a less&#8208;symmetric vinylene&#8208;linked COF (g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF). The octupolar conjugated characters of  g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF  were reflected in its scarce solvatochromic effects either in ground or excited states, and endowed it with more promising semiconducting behaviors as compared with  g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF, such as enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and excellent photo&#8208;induced charge generation and separation. Along with the matched energy level,  g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF  enabled the two&#8208;half reactions of photocatalytic water splitting with average O2  evolution rate of 51.0 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1  and H2  evolution rate of 2518.9 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1. Such values are among the highest of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art COF photocatalysts.</dc:description>

Herein, we developed a  D3h&#8208;symmetric tricyanomesitylene as a new monomer which could be reticulated into a vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF) via Knoevenagel condensation with another  D3h&#8208;symmetric monomer 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8242;&#8208;formyl&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine. Meanwhile, replacing tricyanomesitylene with a  C2v&#8208;symmetric 3,5&#8208;dicyano&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylpyridine gave birth to a less&#8208;symmetric vinylene&#8208;linked COF (g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF). The octupolar conjugated characters of  g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF  were reflected in its scarce solvatochromic effects either in ground or excited states, and endowed it with more promising semiconducting behaviors as compared with  g&#8208;C52N6&#8208;COF, such as enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and excellent photo&#8208;induced charge generation and separation. Along with the matched energy level,  g&#8208;C54N6&#8208;COF  enabled the two&#8208;half reactions of photocatalytic water splitting with average O2  evolution rate of 51.0 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1  and H2  evolution rate of 2518.9 &#956;mol h&#8208;1  g&#8208;1. Such values are among the highest of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art COF photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Non&#8208;metal single&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;atom catalysis of hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;metal&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) feature low cost, simple synthesis methods and effective regulation for substrates, while there are few studies on this aspect. Herein, we developed a simplified pressurized gas&#8208;assisted process, and first reported a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom phosphorus with atomic&#8208;level dispersion on unique single&#8208;crystal Mo  2  C hexagonal nanosheet arrays with (001) plane exposure supported by carbon sheet (SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS). The SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS is structurally stable and shows exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Because of the bidirectional regulation of single P atoms, P bonds with the surrounding Mo atoms to form a localized electronic state. A so&#8208;called high&#8208;active &#8220;window&#8221; based on the active sites of P atoms and their adjacent Mo atoms shows the &#916;G  H*  close to zero for hydrogen evolution, which is the most ideal &#916;G  H*  reported so far. Meanwhile, the moderate d&#8208;band center value of SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS can be also used as an ideal standard value to evaluate the HER performance in non&#8208;metal&#8208;based SACs. Our work is investigation of the origin of the HER electrocatalytic activity based on non&#8208;metal&#8208;based SACs, and also provides an efficient strategy to achieve the synthesis and application of non&#8208;metal SACs.</dc:description>

Herein, we developed a simplified pressurized gas&#8208;assisted process, and first reported a non&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom phosphorus with atomic&#8208;level dispersion on unique single&#8208;crystal Mo  2  C hexagonal nanosheet arrays with (001) plane exposure supported by carbon sheet (SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS). The SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS is structurally stable and shows exceptional electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Because of the bidirectional regulation of single P atoms, P bonds with the surrounding Mo atoms to form a localized electronic state. A so&#8208;called high&#8208;active &#8220;window&#8221; based on the active sites of P atoms and their adjacent Mo atoms shows the &#916;G  H*  close to zero for hydrogen evolution, which is the most ideal &#916;G  H*  reported so far. Meanwhile, the moderate d&#8208;band center value of SAP&#8208;Mo  2  C&#8208;CS can be also used as an ideal standard value to evaluate the HER performance in non&#8208;metal&#8208;based SACs. Our work is investigation of the origin of the HER electrocatalytic activity based on non&#8208;metal&#8208;based SACs, and also provides an efficient strategy to achieve the synthesis and application of non&#8208;metal SACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Double&#8208;layered supramolecular prisms self&#8208;assembled by geometrically non&#8208;equivalent tetratopic subunits</title>

The formation of these complicated structures is controlled by both predetermined angles of the ligands and the mismatched structural tensions created from the multi&#8208;layered geometry of the building blocks.

      <title>Transcription Factor Based Small&#8208;Molecule Sensing with a Rapid Cell Phone Enabled Fluorescent Bead Assay</title>
      <dc:description>
The allosteric transcription factor TetR acts as a sensor and actuator in this quantum dot enabled fluorescent bead assay for the small molecule anhydrotetracycline. This rapid, antibody&#8208;free biosensor produces a visible change in fluorescent color, which can be detected by eye or with an inexpensive digital camera, based on dose&#8208;dependent analyte&#8208;responsive protein&#8208;DNA binding. The adaptable sensor uses easily accessible biomolecular components.







Abstract
Recently, allosteric transcription factors (TFs) were identified as a novel class of biorecognition elements for in vitro sensing, whereby an indicator of the differential binding affinity between a TF and its cognate DNA exhibits dose&#8208;dependent responsivity to an analyte. Described is a modular bead&#8208;based biosensor design that can be applied to such TF&#8208;DNA&#8208;analyte systems. DNA&#8208;functionalized beads enable efficient mixing and spatial separation, while TF&#8208;labeled semiconductor quantum dots serve as bright fluorescent indicators of the TF&#8208;DNA bound (on bead) and unbound states. The prototype sensor for derivatives of the antibiotic tetracycline exhibits nanomolar sensitivity with visual detection of bead fluorescence. Facile changes to the sensor enable sensor response tuning without necessitating changes to the biomolecular affinities. Assay components self&#8208;assemble, and readout by eye or digital camera is possible within 5&#8197;minutes of analyte addition, making sensor use facile, rapid, and instrument&#8208;free.

      <title>Activating chalcogen bonding (ChB) in alkylseleno/ alkyltelluroacetylenes toward ChB directionality control</title>

      <title>A New Class of NIR&#8208;II Gold Nanoclusters Based Protein Biolabels for In Vivo Tumor&#8208;Targeted Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>Photoluminescence imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) has recently emerged as a promising technique for  in vivo  deep&#8208;tissue imaging. However, it remains a challenge to design bright NIR&#8208;II luminescent nanomaterials that enable efficient labelling of proteins without disturbing their physiological properties  in vivo  . Herein, we developed an efficient strategy to synthesize bright NIR&#8208;II gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) protected by biocompatible cyclodextrin (CD). Leveraging on the ultrasmall size feature of Au NCs (&lt;2 nm) and strong macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8208;guest chemistry, the as&#8208;synthesized CD&#8208;Au NCs can readily label proteins/antibodies. Moreover, the CD&#8208;Au NCs&#8208;labelled proteins/antibodies enable highly efficient  in vivo  tracking during blood circulation, without disturbing their biodistribution and tumor targeting ability, thus leading to a sensitive tumor&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II visualization. In addition, CD&#8208;Au NCs are stable in the harsh biological environment, and show good biocompatibility and high renal clearance efficiency. Therefore, the renal&#8208;clearable and host&#8208;guest recognition&#8208;based NIR&#8208;II biolabels developed in this study provide a promising platform to monitor the physiological behaviors of biomolecules in living organisms.</dc:description>

      <title>Mediating Reaction Orthogonality in Polymer and Materials Science</title>
      <dc:description>
Selective regulation of multiple reaction pathways in complex chemical systems is crucial for modern syntheses. This Review presents strategies for activating such reactions in polymer and materials science, with an emphasis on systems activated via photochemical stimuli.







Abstract
Selective control of chemical reactions is critical for the proper regulation of processes ranging from intricate biological systems to large scale industrial manufacturing. The progression of synthetic chemistry toward the complexity seen in Nature requires increased control over many concurrent chemical reactions in a non&#8208;interfering (orthogonal) fashion. Fortunately, the practically endless pool of synthetic chemical reactions developed to date can often be combined in an orthogonal manner to provide elegant solutions to complex chemical problems. In this review, we first highlight some of the many photochemical reactions that have been applied in orthogonal reaction protocols; the highly selective nature of photochemical reactions makes them well&#8208;suited for independent activation in the presence of other reaction components. The application of these orthogonal reactions, especially photochemical reactions, for the synthesis and modification of polymers and polymeric materials is also summarized. Importantly, the use of orthogonal chemical reactions can provide additional opportunities for synthesizing advanced and functional polymeric materials compared to traditional synthetic procedures.

      <title>Fortified Coiled Coils: Enhancing Mechanical Stability with Lactam or Metal Staples</title>
      <dc:description>Coiled coils (CCs) are powerful supramolecular building blocks for biomimetic materials, increasingly used for their mechanical properties. Here, we introduce helix&#8208;inducing macrocyclic constraints, so&#8208;called staples, to tune thermodynamic and mechanical stability of CCs. We show that thermodynamic stabilization of CCs against helix uncoiling primarily depends on the number of staples, whereas staple positioning controls CC mechanical stability. Inserting a covalent lactam staple at one key force application point significantly increases the barrier to force&#8208;induced CC dissociation and reduces structural deformity. A reversible His&#8208;Ni  2+  &#8208;His metal staple also increases CC stability, but ruptures upon mechanical loading to allow helix uncoiling. Staple type, position and number are key design parameters in using helical macrocyclic templates for fine&#8208;tuning CC properties in emerging biomaterials.</dc:description>

      <title>Bandgap Engineering of Hydroxyl&#8208;Functionalized Borophene for Superior Photo&#8208;Electrochemical Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconducting boron nanosheets (few&#8208;layer borophene) have been theoretically predicted, but their bandgap tunability has not been experimentally confirmed. In this study, hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized borophene (borophene&#8208;OH) with tunable bandgap was fabricated by liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation using 2&#8208;butanol solvent. Surface energy matching between boron and 2&#8208;butanol produced smooth borophene, and the exposed unsaturated B sites generated by B&#8208;B bond breaking during exfoliation coordinated with OH groups to form semiconducting borophene&#8208;OH, enabling a tunable bandgap of 0.65&#8211;2.10 eV by varying its thickness. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements demonstrated that the use of borophene&#8208;OH to fabricate working electrodes for PEC&#8208;type photodetectors significantly enhanced the photocurrent density (5.0 &#956;A/cm2) and photoresponsivity (58.5 &#956;A/W) compared with other 2D monoelemental materials. Thus, borophene&#8208;OH is a promising semiconductor with great optoelectronic potential.</dc:description>

      <title>Targeting RNA G&#8208;quadruplex in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2: A Promising Therapeutic Target for COVID&#8208;19?</title>
      <dc:description>COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has become a global threat. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing innovative treatments are extremely urgent. G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are important non&#8208;canonical nucleic acids structures with distinct biofunctions. Here, we studied four putative G4&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. One of them (namely RG&#8208;1), which locates in the coding sequence (CDS) region of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), has been verified to form stable RNA G4 structure in live cells. G4&#8208;specific compounds, such as PDP, can stabilize RG&#8208;1 G4 and significantly reduce the protein levels of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N by inhibiting its translation bothin vitro andin vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that PQSs in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 can form G4 structures in live cells, and their biofunctions can be regulated by G4&#8208;specific stabilizer. We expect this finding will provide new insights into developing novel antiviral drugs against COVID&#8208;19.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;COVID&#8208;19 pandemic caused by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has become a global threat. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and developing innovative treatments are extremely urgent. G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) are important non&#8208;canonical nucleic acids structures with distinct biofunctions. Here, we studied four putative G4&#8208;forming sequences (PQSs) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome. One of them (namely RG&#8208;1), which locates in the coding sequence (CDS) region of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), has been verified to form stable RNA G4 structure in live cells. G4&#8208;specific compounds, such as PDP, can stabilize RG&#8208;1 G4 and significantly reduce the protein levels of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 N by inhibiting its translation bothin vitro andin vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that PQSs in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 can form G4 structures in live cells, and their biofunctions can be regulated by G4&#8208;specific stabilizer. We expect this finding will provide new insights into developing novel antiviral drugs against COVID&#8208;19.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Surface Interrogation of Electrodeposited MnOx and CaMnO3 Perovskites by Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy: Probing Active Sites and Kinetics for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report the surface interrogation scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI&#8208;SECM) of two electrodeposited manganese&#8208;based electrocatalysts, amorphous MnOx and perovskite CaMnO3, to investigate the manganese oxidation state relating to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under neutral conditions. The results indicate the amounts of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) species in MnOx and CaMnO3 depend on potential. A Mn(V) species was identified in both structures during the OER. Time&#8208;delay titration of Mn(V) further revealed that MnOx produced two types of active sites with different OER reactions rates, k&#8217;fast(MnOx) = 1.21 s&#8208;1 and k&#8217;slow(MnOx) = 0.24 s&#8208;1. In contrast, CaMnO3 perovskites in which the Mn(V) species formed at a less positive potential than that in MnOx, displayed only one kinetic behavior with a faster reaction rate of 1.72 s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating single&#8208;atom Pd sites with Cu for enhanced ambient ammonia electrosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The electrochemical reduction of N  2  to NH  3  is emerging as a promising alternative for sustainable and distributed production of NH  3  . However, the development has been impeded by difficulties in N  2  adsorption, protonation of *NN and inhibition of competing hydrogen evolution. To address the issues, we design a catalyst with diatomic Pd&#8208;Cu sites on N&#8208;doped carbon by modulation of single&#8208;atom Pd sites with Cu. The introduction of Cu not only shifts the partial density states of Pd toward the Fermi level but also promote the d&#8208;2&#960;* coupling between Pd and adsorbed N  2  , leading to enhanced N  2  chemisorption, activated protonation and suppressed hydrogen evolution. As a result, the catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 24.8 &#177; 0.8% and a desirable NH  3  yield rate of 69.2 &#177; 2.5 &#956;g h  &#8208;1  mg  cat.  &#8208;  1  , far outperforming the individual single&#8208;atom Pd catalyst.

      <title>Zwitterionic Polydopamine Engineered Interface for In Vivo Sensing with High Biocompatibility</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical sensing performance is often compromised by electrode biofouling (e.g., protein nonspecific binding) in complex biological fluids; however, the design and construction of a robust biointerface with superior antifouling ability and high tolerance of free radicals and excellent electrochemical performance remains a great challenge. Herein, inspired by nature, we demonstrate a robust polydopamine&#8208;engineered biointerfacing, to tailing zwitterionic molecules (i.e., sulfobetaine methacrylate, SBMA) through Michael Addition. The SBMA&#8208;PDA biointerface can resist nonspecific binding of proteins in complex biological fluids while enhancing interfacial electron transfer and electrochemical stability of the electrode. In addition, this sensing interface can be integrated with tissue&#8208;implantable microelectrode for  in vivo  analysis, preserving more than 92.0% of the initial sensitivity after 2 h of implantation in brain tissue and showing low acute neuroinflammatory responses. Moreover, this implantable microsensor demonstrates good stability both in normal and in Parkinson's disease (PD) rat brain tissue. This PDA&#8208;engineered zwitterionic biointerface is believed to be used to construct universal interface enabling wide analytical application  in vivo  with improved sensing performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Plasmonic Hot Electrons from Oxygen Vacancies for Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Catalytic CO2 Reduction on Bi2O3&#8208;x</title>
      <dc:description>Current plasmonic photocatalysts are mainly based on noble metal nanoparticles and rarely work in the infrared (IR) light range. Here, cost&#8208;effective Bi  2  O  3&#8208;  x  with oxygen vacancies was formed  in situ  on commercial bismuth powder by calcination at 453.15 K in atmosphere. Interestingly, defects introduced into Bi  2  O  3&#8208;  x  simultaneously induced a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the wavelength range of 600&#8208;1400 nm and enhanced the adsorption for CO  2  molecules, which enabled efficient photocatalysis of CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO (~100% selectivity) even under low&#8208;intensity near&#8208;IR light irradiation. Significantly, the apparent quantum yield for CO evolution at 940 nm reached 0.113%, which is approximately 4.0 times that found at 450 nm. We also showed that the unique LSPR allows for the realization of a nearly linear dependence of photocatalytic CO production rate on light intensity and operating temperature.
