         <dc:description>Chiral quinacridines react up to four times, step&#8208;by&#8208;step, with a&#8208;diazomalonates under Ru(II) and Rh(II) catalysis.

This multi&#8208;introduction of malonate groups is particularly useful to tune optical and chemical properties such as absorption, emission or Br&#248;nsted acidity but also cellular bioimaging.

         <title>An Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Route to Dewar 1,3,5&#8208;Triphosphabenzene and Subsequent Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, scalable iron&#8208;catalyzed route to a Dewar phosphabenzene is presented. This species isomerizes in the presence of base to form the 1,3,5&#8208;phosphabenzene, which then spontaneously rearranges to a novel triphospha(tricyclo) species. Onward coordination chemistry of all three phosphines is explored along with an extensive study into the reactivity of the Dewar phosphabenzene.







Abstract
The application of an alkyne cyclotrimerization regime with an [Fe(salen)]2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo (1) catalyst to triphenylmethylphosphaalkyne (2) yields gram&#8208;scale quantities of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(triphenylmethyl)&#8208;Dewar&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene (3). Bulky lithium salt LiHMDS facilitates a rearrangement of 3 to the 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene valence isomer (3&#8242;), which subsequently undergoes an intriguing phosphorus migration reaction to form the ring&#8208;contracted species (3&#8242;&#8242;). Density functional theory calculations provide a plausible mechanism for this rearrangement. Given the stability of 3, a diverse array of unprecedented transformations was investigated. We report novel crystallographically characterized products of successful nucleophilic/electrophilic addition and protonation/oxidation reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Iodonium Reagent via Dyotropic Rearrangement and Its Utilization in Fluoroalkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel hypervalent iodonium salt was developed with the exploitation of a dyotropic rearrangement of iodine and chlorine functions in fluoroalkyl chains from HFO&#8208;1234yf gas. The electrophilic reagent enabled the direct and metal&#8208;free introduction of a special fluoroalkyl group into aniline derivatives and N&#8208;containing heteroaromatic compounds. Detailed experimental and computational data were collected and used to propose a mechanistic description of this unique rearrangement.







Abstract
[1,2]&#8208;shift of atoms in alkyl fragments belongs to the class of dyotropic rearrangements. Various atoms, including halogens can be involved in the migration, however participation of iodine is unprecedented. Herein, we report our experimental and DFT studies on the oxidation triggered dyotropic rearrangement of iodo and chloro functions via butterfly&#8208;type transition state to demonstrate the migrating ability of &#955;3&#8208;iodane centre. With the exploitation of dyotropic rearrangement we designed and synthesized a novel fluoroalkyl iodonium reagent from industrial feedstock gas HFO&#8208;1234yf. We demonstrated that the hypervalent reagent serves as an excellent fluoroalkylation agent for various amines and nitrogen heterocycles.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries Enabled by Amidoxime&#8208;Functionalized Ion&#8208;Selective Polymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly ion&#8208;selective robust membranes are developed from a series of amidoxime&#8208;functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (AO&#8208;PIMs), which enable long lifetime operation of aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) using low&#8208;cost organic redox molecules at benign near&#8208;neutral pH, offering cost&#8208;effective electricity storage for grid&#8208;scale renewable power sources.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) based on aqueous organic electrolytes are a promising technology for safe and cost&#8208;effective large&#8208;scale electrical energy storage. Membrane separators are a key component in RFBs, allowing fast conduction of charge&#8208;carrier ions but minimizing the cross&#8208;over of redox&#8208;active species. Here, we report the molecular engineering of amidoxime&#8208;functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity (AO&#8208;PIMs) by tuning their polymer chain topology and pore architecture to optimize membrane ion transport functions. AO&#8208;PIM membranes are integrated with three emerging aqueous organic flow battery chemistries, and the synergetic integration of ion&#8208;selective membranes with molecular engineered organic molecules in neutral&#8208;pH electrolytes leads to significantly enhanced cycling stability.

         <title>Selenoviologen&#8208;Appendant Metallacycles with Highly Stable Radical Cations and Long&#8208;Lived Charge Separation States for Electrochromism and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two selenoviologen (SeV2+)&#8208;appendant metallacycles with tunable optoelectronic properties were synthesized. Selenoviologen radical cations (SeV+.) can be stabilized due to the metallacyclic effect (strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures), which were validated by electrochromism. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra not only confirmed the long&#8208;lived charge separation states of metallacycle, but also demonstrated its vital role in visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions with high efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%).







Abstract
Two coordinated metallacycles (rhomboid for M1, hexagonal for M2) with selenoviologens (SeV2+) pendants were synthesized via coordination&#8208;driven hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. M1/M2 with rigid and discrete metallacyclic cores showed tunable optoelectronic properties due to strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) revealed that the formation of macrocyclic structure can not only enhance the stability of radical cation, but also improve the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer and produce a long&#8208;lived charge separation state. The electrochromic performances of M1/M2&#8208;based devices were exhibited to show decent radical stabilization. By using M1/M2 as the photocatalyst, the improved catalytic efficiency (&gt;80&#8201;%) of visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions was achieved due to the highly stable radical cations and long&#8208;lived charge separation states, which were also confirmed by fs&#8208;TA.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two coordinated metallacycles (rhomboid for &lt;b&gt;M1&lt;/b&gt;, hexagonal for &lt;b&gt;M2&lt;/b&gt;) with selenoviologens (SeV&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) pendants were synthesized via coordination-driven hierarchical self-assembly. &lt;b&gt;M1&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;M2&lt;/b&gt; with rigid and discrete metallacyclic cores showed tunable optoelectronic properties due to strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and push&#8211;pull electron structures. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) revealed that the formation of macrocyclic structure can not only enhance the stability of radical cation, but also improve the efficiency of intramolecular charge transfer and produce a long-lived charge separation state. The electrochromic performances of &lt;b&gt;M1&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;M2&lt;/b&gt;-based devices were exhibited to show decent radical stabilization. By using &lt;b&gt;M1&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;M2&lt;/b&gt; as the photocatalyst, the improved catalytic efficiency (&amp;gt;80&#8201;%) of visible-light-induced cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions was achieved due to the highly stable radical cations and long-lived charge separation states, which were also confirmed by fs-TA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermally Depolymerizable Polyether Electrolytes for Convenient and Low&#8208;Cost Recycling of LiTFSI</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of F&#8208;containing thermally depolymerizable polyethers were prepared as solid electrolytes, and with the help of the thermal degradation of polyethers, the LiTFSI was successfully reclaimed in high yields of 80&#8201;%, providing an example for the recycling of LiTFSI and benefiting the cost control of solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with LiTFSI (lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonimide)) are promising candidates for solid&#8208;state batteries, owing to their good interfacial contact with solid electrodes. Here, three copolymerized polyethers were prepared as SPEs, using the catalysts of SnF2 or SnF2&#8208;LiPF6. The thermal depolymerization of these polyethers was observed at elevated temperatures, which limits their operating temperature ranges. Once the catalyst is removed, the thermal degradation temperatures of these SPEs are raised by 30&#8211;55&#8201;&#176;C, together with improved thermal performance in cells. For SPEs, the high price of LiTFSI is an obstacle for their large&#8208;scale application, and it's recycling is hindered by the strong interaction with polymers. By the thermal depolymerization of polyethers, LiTFSI can be easier reclaimed from above mentioned SPEs and even the commercial PEO(poly(ethylene&#8208;oxide)) based SPE in rates of 70&#8211;80&#8201;%, providing a low&#8208;cost strategy for the recycling of LiTFSI.

         <title>Leveraging Isothermal Titration Calorimetry to Explore Structure&#8211;Property Relationships of Protein Immobilization in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isothermal titration calorimetry was leveraged to systematically study how the structural properties of MOFs, such as hydrophobicity, pore size, and topology, influence the thermodynamics of protein immobilization by using a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs as the host and insulin as the model protein probe. The thermodynamics of binding can elucidate a major driving force for protein encapsulation, which could not be revealed in bulk adsorption studies.







Abstract
Proteins immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) often show extraordinary stability. However, most efforts to immobilize proteins in MOFs have only been exploratory. Herein, we present the first systematic study on the thermodynamics of protein immobilization in MOFs. Using insulin as a probe, we leveraged isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate how topology, pore size, and hydrophobicity of MOFs influence immobilization. ITC data obtained from the encapsulation of insulin in a series of Zr&#8208;MOFs reveals that MOFs provide proteins with a hydrophobic stabilizing microenvironment, making the encapsulation entropically driven. In particular, the pyrene&#8208;based NU&#8208;1000 tightly encapsulates insulin in its ideally sized mesopores and stabilizes insulin through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, resulting in the most enthalpically favored encapsulation process among this series. This study reveals critical insights into the structure&#8211;property relationships of protein immobilization.

         <title>Radical Hydro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Unactivated Alkenes and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which are highly in demand in various disciplines, particularly in chemical biology and drug discovery. Here, we report the first establishment of radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkenes, which is enabled by using 1&#8208;fluorosulfonyl 2&#8208;aryl benzoimidazolium (FABI) as an effective redox&#8208;active radical precursor. This method provides a new and facile approach for the synthesis of aliphatic sulfonyl fluorides from unactivated alkenes, and can be further applied to the late&#8208;stage modifications of natural products and peptides, as well as ligation of drugs in combination with click chemistry. Remarkably, this system could enable the radical hydro&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes, affording valuable alkenylsulfonyl fluoride products with a rare, high  Z&#8208;selectivity, which are normally less stable and more challenging to synthesize in comparison with the  E&#8208;configured products.</dc:description>

The synthetic useful &#945;&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;SF  5  carbonyl compounds were successfully prepared when allyl trimethylsilanes were used as the alkene substrates. Furthermore, the three&#8208;component adducts formed from SF  5  Cl, &#945;&#8208;diazoacetophenones and vinyl acetates were converted into pentafluorosulfanylfurans.

         <dc:description>Developing efficient catalytic systems for the hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) is essential in the world&#8217;s transition to renewable energy. There is a growing recognition that the HOR/HER activity depends on properties of the electrochemical interface, rather than just the composition and structure of the catalyst Herein, we demonstrate that specifically adsorbed organic additives (theophylline derivatives) could enhance the intrinsic HOR/HER activity in base on polycrystalline Pt by up to a factor of 3 via introducing weakly hydrogen&#8208;bonded water, which is supported by in situ surface enhanced infrared and Raman spectroscopies.

         <dc:description>
The 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl group is highly stereodirecting for the construction of challenging &#946;&#8208;configured 2,6&#8208;dideoxyglycosides and d/l&#8208;rhamnosides. Its synthetic potential was demonstrated in linear or convergent approaches to relevant complex carbohydrates. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies provided evidence that the reaction proceeds by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.







Abstract
Anomeric stereocontrol is usually one of the major issues in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates, particularly those involving &#946;&#8208;configured 2,6&#8208;dideoxyglycoside and d/l&#8208;rhamnoside moieties. Herein, we report that 2&#8208;(diphenylphosphinoyl)acetyl is highly effective as a remote stereodirecting group in the direct synthesis of these challenging &#946;&#8208;glycosides under mild conditions. A deoxy&#8208;trisaccharide as a mimic of the sugar chain of landomycin E was prepared stereospecifically in high yield. The synthetic potential was also highlighted in the synthesis of Citrobacter freundii O&#8208;antigens composed of a [&#8594;4)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;d&#8208;Manp&#8208;(1&#8594;3)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rhap(1&#8594;4)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Rhap&#8208;(1&#8594;] repeating unit, wherein the convergent assembly up to a nonasaccharide was realized with a strongly &#946;&#8208;directing trisaccharide donor. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR studies indicate the presence of intermolecular H&#8208;bonding between the donor and the bulky acceptor as direct spectral evidence in support of the concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery.

         <title>Origin of Red&#8208;Shifted Phosphorescence from Triphenylamines: Triplet Excimer or Impurity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
How much should triplet excimer phosphorescence shift in energy compared to that of the monomer? An original study on triphenylamine from more than 30&#8197;years ago showed a large shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is now debunked as new evidence suggests impurity phosphorescence interference. The purified aggregate phosphorescence shift is estimated to be &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
Triphenylamine (TPA) was reported to exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence, where the red&#8208;shifted band was assigned as the excimeric phosphorescence with an energy shift of &gt;3000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (J. Phys. Chem. 1991, 95, 7189). Here we show that purified TPA (purity: &gt;99.97&#8201;%) shows a single phosphorescence band with a small energy shift of &lt;200&#8197;cm&#8722;1 under the same experimental conditions. The new experimental results, along with theoretical calculations, suggest that the previously reported triplet excimer of TPA is probably not valid and is most likely due to an unidentified impurity. As&#8208;received TPA samples, however, do exhibit temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence bands, and the wavelength, relative intensity, and temperature dependence of the lower&#8208;energy phosphorescence band vary significantly depending on dopant structures. It was found that dopant phosphorescence could still become dominant even in dilute third&#8208;party solutions of the host at low temperature.

         <title>Enhancing the Release Efficiency of a Molecular Chemotherapeutic Prodrug by Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular prodrug, namely CS&#8208;P, was designed and synthesized to demonstrate the feasibility of using the PDT process to effectively promote the release of hypoxia&#8208;activated drugs. The experimental results indicated that CS&#8208;P can be selectively activated by tumor hypoxia to release chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers, and then further release chemotherapeutic drugs after light irradiation. The design strategy proposed provides a new idea for enhancing hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs release.







Abstract
Tumor&#8208;specific, hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs have been developed to alleviate the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. However, the release efficiency of hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs is restricted by the degree of tumor hypoxia, which further leads to poor cancer treatment effects. On the other hand, oxygen is consumed gradually in photodynamic therapy (PDT), which aggravates hypoxia at the tumor site. In this study, we combined hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs with PDT agents to promote the prodrugs release, thereby improving their bioavailability and therapeutic effects. As a proof of concept, a mitochondria&#8208;targeted molecular prodrug, CS&#8208;P, was designed and synthesized. It can be selectively activated by tumor hypoxia to release chemotherapeutic drugs and photosensitizers, and then further discharge drugs after light irradiation. The design strategy proposed in this paper provides a new idea for enhancing hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug release and real&#8208;time monitoring prodrug release.

         <title>Control of Redox&#8208;Active Ester Reactivity Enables a General Cross&#8208;Electrophile Approach to Access Arylated Strained Rings
</title>

         <dc:description>
Aliphatic strained rings can be (hetero)arylated through a decarboxylative cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. The keys to this advance are: 1)&#8197;a new ligand that enables tolerance of a variety of strained ring classes and 2)&#8197;electronic tunability of redox&#8208;active esters to control the rate of radical generation.







Abstract
Strained rings are increasingly important for the design of pharmaceutical candidates, but cross&#8208;coupling of strained rings remains challenging. An attractive, but underdeveloped, approach to diverse functionalized carbocyclic and heterocyclic frameworks containing all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers is the coupling of abundant strained&#8208;ring carboxylic acids with abundant aryl halides. Herein we disclose the development of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile approach that couples a variety of strained ring N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide (NHP) esters, derived from the carboxylic acid in one step, with various aryl and heteroaryl halides under reductive conditions. The chemistry is enabled by the discovery of methods to control NHP ester reactivity, by tuning the solvent or using modified NHP esters, and the discovery that t&#8208;BuBpyCamCN, an L2X ligand, avoids problematic side reactions. This method can be run in flow and in 96&#8208;well plates.

         <title>Efficient Broadband Near&#8208;Infrared Emission from Lead&#8208;Free Halide Double Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;inorganic bismuth halide perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 single crystal achieves efficient broadband NIR emission by introducing Na ions. Experiments and DFT calculations show that the emission originates from self&#8208;trapped excitons emission. The role of Na is to weaken the strong coupling between electrons and phonons and to localize the electron and hole wave functions to enhance this emission.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent materials are the most important component of NIR light&#8208;emitting devices (LED) and are crucial for their performance in sensing applications. A major challenge is to design novel NIR luminescent materials to replace the traditional Cr3+&#8208;doped systems. We report an all&#8208;inorganic bismuth halide perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 single crystal that achieves efficient broadband NIR emission by introducing Na ions. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the NIR emission originates from self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) emission, which can be enhanced by weakening the strong coupling between electrons and phonons. The high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of 51&#8201;%, the extensive full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 270&#8197;nm and the stability provide advantages as a NIR luminescent material. The single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based NIR LED demonstrated its potential applications in NIR spectral detection as well as night vision.

         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component reductive carbonylation of alkyl halides, aryl halides, and ethyl chloroformate is described. The use of ethyl chloroformate as a safe and readily available source of CO provides an efficient and practical alternative for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones.

Ethyl chloroformate is utilized as a safe and readily available source of CO in this multi&#8208;component protocol, providing an efficient and practical alternative for the synthesis of aryl&#8208;alkyl ketones. The reaction exhibits a wide substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies highlight the complexity of the cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and provide insight into the sequence of the three consecutive oxidative additions of aryl halide, chloroformate, and alkyl halide.

         <title>Reverse Sequence Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects are prepared in aqueous media using a highly counter&#8208;intuitive formulation based on reverse sequence polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The hydrophobic block is prepared first in the form of a ca. 600&#8197;nm charge&#8208;stabilized latex using an ionic reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent. Subsequent growth of a hydrophilic block produces sterically stabilized nanoparticles.







Abstract
We report a new aqueous polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) formulation that enables the hydrophobic block to be prepared first when targeting diblock copolymer nano&#8208;objects. This counter&#8208;intuitive reverse sequence approach uses an ionic reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent for the RAFT aqueous dispersion polymerization of 2&#8208;hydroxypropyl methacrylate (HPMA) to produce charge&#8208;stabilized latex particles. Chain extension using a water&#8208;soluble methacrylic, acrylic or acrylamide comonomer then produces sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles in an aqueous one&#8208;pot formulation. In each case, the monomer diffuses into the PHPMA particles, which act as the locus for the polymerization. A remarkable change in morphology occurs as the &#8776;600&#8197;nm latex is converted into much smaller sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles, which exhibit thermoresponsive behavior. Such reverse sequence PISA formulations enable the efficient synthesis of new functional diblock copolymer nanoparticles.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Four&#8208;Component Carbonylation of Ethers and Olefins: Direct Access to &#947;&#8208;Oxy Esters and Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nickel&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of ethers with olefins to synthesize &#947;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds has been developed. A variety of &#947;&#8208;substituted carbonyl compounds were produced in excellent yields under 1&#8197;atm pressure of CO. Notably, this strategy has been successfully applied to the one&#8208;step synthesis of the drug molecule Naftidrofuryl, which is a medicine for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD).







Abstract
Multi&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins, a reaction that installs both a carbon&#8211;carbon(heteroatom) bond and a carbonyl group across the double bond, is an attractive strategy for alkene functionalization. Herein, we developed a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed four&#8208;component carbonylation of olefins with ethers under low CO gas pressure. Using alcohols and amines as the reaction partner, diverse &#947;&#8208;oxy&#8208;substituted esters and amides were produced in good yields with excellent functional group tolerance. Notably, Naftidrofuryl, a medicine for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), can be synthesized by this process straightforwardly.

         <title>Selective, Anisotropic, or Consistent Polarized&#8208;Photon Out&#8208;Coupling of 2D Organic Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multichannel selective, anisotropic, or consistent polarized&#8208;photon out&#8208;coupling has been realized in a set of 2D organic microcrystals, with the polarization direction and degree being either varied or retained with respect to the source luminescence. The molecular arrangement and spatial distribution of the transition dipole moments are found to play prominent roles in determining the polarization properties of the source and out&#8208;coupled emissions.







Abstract
Nano&#8208; and micromaterials with anisotropic photoluminescence and photon transport have widespread application prospects in quantum optics, optoelectronics, and displays. But the nature of the polarization information of the out&#8208;coupled light, with respect to that of the source luminescence, has never been explored in active optical&#8208;waveguiding organic crystals. Herein, three different modes (selective, anisotropic, and consistent) of polarized&#8208;photon out&#8208;coupling are proposed and successfully implemented in a set of 2D organic microcrystals with highly linearly&#8208;polarized luminescence. It is found that the polarization direction and degree of the luminescence out&#8208;coupled through different waveguiding channels can either be essentially retained or distinctly changed with respect to those of the original luminescence, depending on the molecular arrangement and the orientation of transition dipole moments of the crystal. This work demonstrates the promising potential of 2D emissive microcrystals in multi&#8208;channel polarized photon transport.

         <title>Thermally Activated and Aggregation&#8208;Regulated Excitonic Coupling Enable Emissive High&#8208;Lying Triplet Excitons
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two naphthalene&#8208;based luminophores that exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from a higher&#8208;lying triplet excited state are reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that unusual RTP originates from the multiple accessible triplet excited&#8208;stated conformers, regulated by thermal activation and aggregation. This unique RTP family enables functional temperature sensing.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) originating from higher&#8208;lying triplet excitons remains a rather rarely documented occurrence for purely organic molecular systems. Here, we report two naphthalene&#8208;based RTP luminophores whose phosphorescence emission is enabled by radiative decay of high&#8208;lying triplet excitons. In contrast, upon cooling the dominant phosphorescence originates from the lowest&#8208;lying triplet excited state, which is manifested by a red&#8208;shifted emission. Photophysical and theoretical studies reveal that the unusual RTP results from thermally activated excitonic coupling between different conformations of the compounds. Aggregation&#8208;regulated excitonic coupling is observed when increasing the doping concentration of the emitters in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). Further, the RTP quantum efficiency improves more than 80&#8208;fold in 1,3&#8208;bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene (mCP) compared to that in PMMA. This design principle offers important insight into triplet excited state dynamics and has been exploited in afterglow&#8208;indicating temperature sensing.

         <title>Medium Diradical Character, Small Hole and Electron Reorganization Energies and Ambipolar Transistors in Difluorenoheteroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diradicals are electrically ambipolar owing to the semiaperture of the &#960;&#8208;electron shell which produces redox amphoteric behaviour and small reorganization energies for hole and electron transports.







Abstract
Four difluorenoheteroles having a central quinoidal core with the heteroring varying as furan, thiophene, its dioxide derivative and pyrrole have shown to be medium character diradicals. Solid&#8208;state structures, optical, photophysical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties have been discussed in terms of diradical character, variation of aromatic character and captodative effects (electron affinity). Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have been prepared, showing balanced hole and electron mobilities of the order of 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 or ambipolar charge transport which is first inferred from their redox amphoterism. Quantum chemical calculations show that the electrical behavior is originated from the medium diradical character which produces similar reorganization energies for hole and electron transports. The vision of a diradical as simultaneously bearing pseudo&#8208;hole and pseudo&#8208;electron defects might justify the reduced values of reorganization energies for both regimes. Structure&#8208;function relationships between diradical and ambipolar electrical behavior are revealed.

         <title>Application of an Imprint&#8208;and&#8208;Report Sensor Array for Detection of the Dietary Metabolite Trimethylamine N&#8208;Oxide and Its Precursors in Complex Mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) imprinted with a fluorophore were used as sensors to differentially detect four dietary metabolites (betaine, carnitine, choline, and TMAO) in a high&#8208;throughput manner. The method was successful in creating sensor arrays for the analytes at several concentrations, as well as differentiating human plasma samples with elevated TMAO from those with healthy TMAO levels.







Abstract
Trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO) is produced in the gut via metabolism of dietary betaine, choline, and carnitine, and elevated TMAO in plasma is associated with adverse health effects, including cardiovascular events. Currently, we lack high throughput methods for sensing these metabolites and detecting high TMAO. Thus, we have adapted our previously described &#8220;imprint&#8208;and&#8208;report&#8221; fluorescent sensing method using dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs) to create a sensor array for these four metabolites that functions at physiologically relevant concentrations. Templation of DCLs with dye and subsequent addition of analytes generates a fluorescent fingerprint for each metabolite and allows for differentiation via principal component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this system can be used to characterize mixtures of the metabolites in both buffer and human plasma samples. Using three to six DCLs, we can distinguish between plasma samples with healthy and elevated levels of TMAO.

A new type of crystalline luminescent organic nanodot (&lt;3.5&#8197;nm) prepared by kinetically trapped self&#8208;assembly is reported, which is then used as a simplified &#960;&#8208;packing model to simulate the precise structure of CDs.

Abstract
This work reports the successful preparation of a new type of crystalline luminescent organic nanodot (&lt;3.5&#8197;nm) by kinetically trapped self&#8208;assembly, which is then used as a simplified &#960;&#8208;packing model to simulate the structure of CDs. The precise structure and J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced photoluminescence (PL) of the nanodots are revealed by investigating the structural relationship between the nanodots and the corresponding single crystals and their properties. Compared with the single crystals, crystalline organic nanodots show longer PL lifetime, higher PL quantum yield, and narrower PL peak, indicating that they are potential organic quantum nanodots. In addition, the efficient &#960;&#8208;stacking environment in the corresponding single crystals can promote &#960;&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced PL anisotropy. This work indicates crystalline organic nanodots with precise structures to be potentially useful for understanding the structures of CDs and to be attractive potential luminescent materials.

         <title>Chiral RuII&#8208;PtII Complexes Inducing Telomere Dysfunction against Cisplatin&#8208;Resistant Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>

Chiral RuII&#8208;PtII complexes were developed to act as G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers in molecular crowding environments. When encapsulated with biotin&#8208;functionalized DNA cages, the nanoparticles induced telomere dysfunction and displayed significant antitumor activity against cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells.







Abstract
The application of G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers presents a promising anticancer strategy. However, the molecular crowding conditions within cells diminish the potency of current G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Herein, chiral RuII&#8208;PtII dinuclear complexes were developed as highly potent G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers even under challenging molecular crowding conditions. The compounds were encapsulated with biotin&#8208;functionalized DNA cages to enhance sub&#8208;cellular localization and provide cancer selectivity. The nanoparticles were able to efficiently inhibit the endogenous activities of telomerase in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells and cause cell death by apoptosis. The nanomaterials demonstrated high antitumor activity towards cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells as well as tumor&#8208;bearing mice. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first example of a RuII&#8208;PtII dinuclear complex as a G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizer with an anti&#8208;cancer effect towards drug&#8208;resistant tumors inside an animal model.

A facile synthetic route towards a series of novel [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived ligands (UCD&#8208;IMPHANOL) possessing central chirality and planar chirality has been developed. These ligands demonstrated excellent enantioselectivities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition.







Abstract
We present a facile synthetic route toward a novel series of imidazolinyl&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophanol (UCD&#8208;Imphanol) ligands possessing central and planar chirality. Both sets of diastereomeric ligands were successfully purified by column chromatography. The preliminary application of this family of ligands showed excellent activities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition. Enantioenriched pyrrolidines, in a substrate scope of 20 examples, were accessed in high levels of endo/exo ratios (up to &gt;99/1) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee) with excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) by using (S,S,SP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol/(S,S,RP)&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.

         <title>Dissipative Formation of Covalent Basket Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent basket cages can now be made to exist for a tunable period of time as a function of the chemical fuel used to drive their formation. The stage is thus set to explore the functional characteristics of these fascinating molecules and mimic the action of natural systems capable of directing folding, catalysis, and transport in a spatiotemporal manner.







Abstract
Living systems use chemical fuels to transiently assemble functional structures. As a step toward constructing abiotic mimics of such structures, we herein describe dissipative formation of covalent basket cage CBC 5 by reversible imine condensation of cup&#8208;shaped aldehyde 2 (i.e., basket) with trivalent aromatic amine 4. This nanosized [4+4] cage (V=5&#8197;nm3, Mw=6150&#8197;Da) has shape of a truncated tetrahedron with four baskets at its vertices and four aromatic amines forming the faces. Importantly, tris&#8208;aldehyde basket 2 and aliphatic tris&#8208;amine 7 undergo condensation to give small [1+1] cage 6. The imine metathesis of 6 and aromatic tris&#8208;amine 4 into CBC 5 was optimized to bias the equilibrium favouring 6. Addition of tribromoacetic acid (TBA) as a chemical fuel perturbs this equilibrium to result in the transient formation of CBC 5, with subsequent consumption of TBA via decarboxylation driving the system back to the starting state.

         <title>Monitoring the Dynamic Regulation of the Mitochondrial GTP&#8208;to&#8208;GDP Ratio with a Genetically Encoded Fluorescent Biosensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
GTP/GDP is known to be a sensitive indicator reflecting both energy consumption and the overall status of cellular metabolism. A genetically encoded sensor was developed for monitoring GTP/GDP ratio fluctuations in living cells, named GRISerHR, with excellent fluorescence response and selectivity. GRISerHR can accurately report on mitochondrial GTP/GDP ratio dynamics as modulated by metabolic perturbation, supporting the elucidation of metabolic regulation networks of guanosine nucleotides.







Abstract
The interconversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is known to be integral to a wide variety of biological cellular activities, yet to date there are no analytical methods available to directly detect the ratio of intracellular GTP to GDP. Herein, we report GRISerHR, a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor to monitor the GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratio in multiple cell types and in various organelles under metabolic perturbation. Additionally, we characterized the differential mitochondrial GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratios resulting from genetic modulation of two isoforms of a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme (succinyl&#8208;CoA synthetase; SCS&#8208;ATP and SCS&#8208;GTP) and of a phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle enzyme (PEPCK&#8208;M). Thus, our GRISerHR sensor achieves spatiotemporally precise detection of dynamic changes in the endogenous GTP&#8201;:&#8201;GDP ratio in living cells and can help deepen our understanding about the energy metabolic contributions of guanosine nucleotides in biology.

         <title>Combinatorial Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Cages with Systematically Fine&#8208;Tuned Cavities for Efficient Co&#8208;Encapsulation and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combinatorial self&#8208;assembly approach gives rise to a family of palladium&#8208;organic cages featuring systematically fine&#8208;tuned shapes and cavities. Emergent guest&#8208;binding and catalytic functions were observed that are due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages.







Abstract
Controllable arrangement of different ligands in a single assembly will not only bring increased complexity but also offers a new route to fine&#8208;tune the function of the designed architecture. We report here a combinatorial self&#8208;assembly with enPd(NO3)2 and three different ligands (L1&#8211;3), which gave rise to a family of six palladium&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;6) with systematically varied shapes and cavities, including three new heteroleptic (Pd5L12L2, Pd5L12L3, Pd4L2L3), one new homoleptic (Pd4L32) cages, and two known homoleptic (Pd6L14, Pd4L22) cages. Emergent functions due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages have been observed: the heteroleptic cages can form ternary complexes by co&#8208;encapsulation of both aromatic and aliphatic guests, while their homoleptic counterparts can only form binary complexes. Such a forced co&#8208;encapsulation effect endows the heteroleptic cages with enhanced catalytic power for the Knoevenagel condensation.

&lt;p&gt;A combinatorial self-assembly approach gives rise to a family of palladium-organic cages featuring systematically fine-tuned shapes and cavities. Emergent guest-binding and catalytic functions were observed that are due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controllable arrangement of different ligands in a single assembly will not only bring increased complexity but also offers a new route to fine-tune the function of the designed architecture. We report here a combinatorial self-assembly with enPd(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and three different ligands (&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&#8211;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), which gave rise to a family of six palladium-organic cages (&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;C1-6&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) with systematically varied shapes and cavities, including three new heteroleptic (&lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), one new homoleptic (&lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) cages, and two known homoleptic (&lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pd&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) cages. Emergent functions due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages have been observed: the heteroleptic cages can form ternary complexes by co-encapsulation of both aromatic and aliphatic guests, while their homoleptic counterparts can only form binary complexes. Such a forced co-encapsulation effect endows the heteroleptic cages with enhanced catalytic power for the Knoevenagel condensation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Doped Quintuple [9]Helicene with Azacorannulene as Core</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two conformers of a novel quintuple [9]helicene with an azabuckybowl as the core were obtained by the deliberate introduction of sulfur heteroatoms into the helical skeleton. The structure&#8211;property relationship of different conformers was investigated through detailed experiment and theoretical calculations. The success of the sulfur&#8208;doped strategy implies the potential of realizing higher multiple [n]helicenes with various conformers.







Abstract
Herein, a hetero(S,N)&#8208;quintuple [9]helicene (SNQ9H) molecule with an azacorannulene core was synthesized, currently representing the highest hetero&#8208;helicene reported in the field of multiple [n]helicenes. X&#8208;ray crystallography indicated that SNQ9H includes not only a propeller&#8208;shaped conformer SNQ9H&#8208;1, but also an unforeseen quasi&#8208;propeller&#8208;shaped conformer SNQ9H&#8208;2. Different conformers were observed for the first time in multiple [n&#8805;9]helicenes, likely owing to the doping of heteroatomic sulfurs in the helical skeletons. Remarkably, the ratio of SNQ9H&#8208;1 to SNQ9H&#8208;2 can be regulated in situ by the reaction temperature. Experimental studies on the photophysical and redox properties of SNQ9H and theoretical calculations clearly demonstrated that the electronic structures of SNQ9H depend on their molecular conformations. The strategy of introducing heteroatomic sulfurs into the helical skeleton may be useful in constructing various conformers of higher multiple [n]helicenes in the future.

         <title>Inducing Ring Complexation for Efficient Capture and Detection of Small Gaseous Molecules Using SERS for Environmental Surveillance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Practical applications of gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) suffer from poor analyte affinity to plasmonic substrates, low concentration, and inherently small Raman cross&#8208;sections. Herein, ring complexation is leveraged via formation of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions with small gases to yield effective capture and distinct spectral changes for multiplex detection of SO2 and NO2 in excess of CO2 mimicking artificial exhaust.







Abstract
Gas&#8208;phase surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) remains challenging due to poor analyte affinity to SERS substrates. The reported use of capturing probes suffers from concurrent inconsistent signals and long response time due to the formation of multiple potential probe&#8211;analyte interaction orientations. Here, we demonstrate the use of multiple non&#8208;covalent interactions for ring complexation to boost the affinity of small gas molecules, SO2 and NO2, to our SERS platform, achieving rapid capture and multiplex detection down to 100&#8197;ppm. Experimental and in&#8208;silico studies affirm stable ring complex formation, and kinetic investigations reveal a 4&#8208;fold faster response time compared to probes without stable ring complexation capability. By synergizing spectral concatenation and support vector machine regression, we achieve 91.7&#8201;% accuracy for multiplex quantification of SO2 and NO2 in excess CO2, mimicking real&#8208;life exhausts. Our platform shows immense potential for on&#8208;site exhaust and air quality surveillance.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Quantum Tunnelling in Spin Crossovers of Nitrenes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin crossover from triplet to singlet in two nitrene reactions is accompanied by simultaneous heavy&#8208;atom quantum tunnelling. Instanton theory was used to unveil the molecular mechanism of this tunnelling process and, in addition to excellent agreement with experiment, appreciable tunnelling effects were found even at room temperature.







Abstract
We simulate two recent matrix&#8208;isolation experiments at cryogenic temperatures, in which a nitrene undergoes spin crossover from its triplet state to a singlet state via quantum tunnelling. We detail the failure of the commonly applied weak&#8208;coupling method (based on a linear approximation of the potentials) in describing these deep&#8208;tunnelling reactions. The more rigorous approach of semiclassical golden&#8208;rule instanton theory in conjunction with double&#8208;hybrid density&#8208;functional theory and multireference perturbation theory does, however, provide rate constants and kinetic isotope effects in good agreement with experiment. In addition, these calculations locate the optimal tunnelling pathways, which provide a molecular picture of the reaction mechanism. The reactions involve substantial heavy&#8208;atom quantum tunnelling of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which unexpectedly even continues to play a role at room temperature.

         <title>&#8220;Like Recycles Like&#8221;: Selective Ring&#8208;Closing Depolymerization of Poly(L&#8208;Lactic Acid) to L&#8208;Lactide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is taken to decrease the ceiling temperature of L&#8208;lactide, enabling chemical recycling of high molecular weight poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) directly back to the cyclic lactide monomer (CRM) with high selectivity. By utilizing specific solvent interactions, the CRM can be performed at a moderate temperature; thereby, obstructing side reactions are diminished.







Abstract
Chemical recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) to the cyclic monomer L&#8208;lactide is hampered by low selectivity and by epimerization and elimination reactions, impeding its use on a large scale. The high number of side reactions originates from the high ceiling temperature (Tc) of L&#8208;lactide, which necessitates high temperatures or multistep reactions to achieve recycling to L&#8208;lactide. To circumvent this issue, we utilized the impact of solvent interactions on the monomer&#8211;polymer equilibrium to decrease the Tc of L&#8208;lactide. Analyzing the observed Tc in different solvents in relation to their Hildebrand solubility parameter revealed a &#8220;like recycles like&#8221; relationship. The decreased Tc, obtained by selecting solvents that interact strongly with the monomer (dimethyl formamide or the green solvent &#947;&#8208;valerolactone), allowed chemical recycling of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) directly to L&#8208;lactide, within 1&#8211;4&#8197;h at 140&#8201;&#176;C, with &gt;95&#8201;% conversion and 98&#8211;99&#8201;% selectivity. Recycled L&#8208;lactide was isolated and repolymerized with high control over molecular weight and dispersity, closing the polymer loop.

&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; in different solvents in relation to their Hildebrand solubility parameter revealed a &#8220;like recycles like&#8221; relationship. The decreased &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, obtained by selecting solvents that interact strongly with the monomer (dimethyl formamide or the green solvent &#947;-valerolactone), allowed chemical recycling of high-molecular-weight poly(L-lactic acid) directly to L-lactide, within 1&#8211;4&#8197;h at 140&#8201;&#176;C, with &amp;gt;95&#8201;% conversion and 98&#8211;99&#8201;% selectivity. Recycled L-lactide was isolated and repolymerized with high control over molecular weight and dispersity, closing the polymer loop.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes with Carboranes: Facile Construction of a Library of Boron Cluster&#8208;Based AIE&#8208;Active Luminogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes enables the construction of a library of boron cluster&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens. This work provides not only a general design principle for a new type of luminogens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize photo&#8208;functional boron cluster derivatives.







Abstract
The classical aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active luminogens (AIEgens) usually include two&#8208;dimensional aromatic systems such as tetraphenylethenes, which are synthesized in several steps by using toxic additives. Here, we proposed a new molecular design strategy for the realization of AIE properties by combining three&#8208;dimensional aromatic boron clusters of carboranes with vinyl group(s). To obtain a library of the boron cluster&#8208;based AIEgens, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes with carboranes is reported. This reaction protocol proceeds in one step under mild conditions with rapid reaction rate, excellent yields and regioselectivity. Photophysical property studies demonstrate that the facile molecular motions in solution can be inhibited in the solid state for these molecules, which leads to interesting AIE properties. This work provides not only a general design principle for AIEgens but also an efficient methodology to synthesize boron cluster&#8208;based photo&#8208;functional molecules.

         <title>Unprecedented Ferroelectricity and Ferromagnetism in a Cr2+&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
[3,3&#8208;Difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CrCl4 is a Cr2+&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite that displays both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It shows ferroelectricity with a high ferroelectric Curie temperature (Tc) up to 387&#8197;K and a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits soft ferromagnet properties with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) have gained tremendous interest for their rich functional properties. However, the coexistence of more than one of ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity has been rarely found in OIHPs. Herein, we report a two&#8208;dimensional Cr2+&#8208;based OIHP, [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CrCl4 ([DFCBA]2CrCl4), which shows both ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism. It undergoes a 4/mmmFm type ferroelectric phase transition at a temperature as high as 387&#8197;K and shows multiaxial ferroelectricity with a saturate polarization of 2.1&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It acts as a soft ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of 32.6&#8197;K. This work throws light on the exploration of OIHPs with the coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism for applications in future multifunctional smart devices.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Guided Stepwise Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Lanthanide Hydroxide Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deliberately introduced anions guide the hierarchical assembly of the series of high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide hydroxide cluster intermediates Er12, Er34, and Er48 toward the complete sodalite cage of Er60.







Abstract
The ability to construct complex molecular architectures with precise control is critical for realizing molecule&#8208;based materials and functions. Using the assembly of a 60&#8208;metal complex of ErIII with histidine as an example, we demonstrate the rational assembly of otherwise synthetically elusive polynuclear lanthanide hydroxide clusters directed by the combined set of I&#8722; and CO32&#8722; as templates. We succeeded in the stepwise transformation starting from Er12 to Er60 by way of two key intermediates Er34 and Er48. The Er12, Er34, and Er48 core motifs represent respectively 1/6, 1/2, and 3/4 of the complete sodalite cage of Er60. This work, representing a rare example of rationally constructing high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide clusters guided by judiciously chosen templates, is expected to stimulate more future efforts for the controllable synthesis of complex molecular or supramolecular architectures with unprecedented structural sophistication and possibly useful properties.

         <title>Suppression of Chain Transfer at High Temperature in Catalytic Olefin Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living polymerization (PDI 1.04 to 1.08) of ethylene at the record 130&#8201;&#176;C is achieved by completely suppressing the chain transfer using the nickel catalysts bearing the indispensable combination of the major fluorine effect and the minor steric shielding effect. The nickel catalysts are even active at 200&#8201;&#176;C, and enable the formation of semi&#8208;crystalline, ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene at 150&#8201;&#176;C. The key chain transfer reactions are elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Living polymerization by suppressing chain transfer is a very useful method for achieving precise molecular weight and structure control. However, the suppression of chain transfer at high temperatures is extremely challenging in any catalytic polymerization. This has been a severe limitation for catalytic olefin polymerization, which is one of the most important chemical reactions. Here, we report the unprecedented living polymerization of ethylene at 130&#8201;&#176;C, with a narrow molecular weight distribution range of 1.04 to 1.08. This is a significant increase in the reaction temperature. Tailor&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts that exhibit both the steric shielding and fluorine effects play an essential role in this breakthrough. These nickel catalysts are even active at 200&#8201;&#176;C, and enable the formation of semi&#8208;crystalline, ultrahigh&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyethylene at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Mechanistic insights into the key chain transfer reaction are elucidated by density functional theory calculations.

Bioinspired palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of amino acid derivatives containing a vinyl iodide moiety by C&#8722;H activation enabled rapid access to a wide range of functionalized proline derivatives with an exocyclic double bond. Such functionalized prolines were used as intermediates for the total synthesis of several natural products: lucentamycin A, barmumycin, oxotomaymycin, and oxoprothracarcin.







Abstract
Bioinspired palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of amino acid derivatives containing a vinyl iodide moiety by C&#8722;H activation enabled rapid access to a wide range of functionalized proline derivatives with an exocyclic olefin. To demonstrate the practicality of this methodology, the functionalized prolines were used as intermediates for the synthesis of several natural products: lucentamycin A, oxotomaymycin, oxoprothracarcin, and barmumycin.

         <title>SuFEx&#8208;Enabled Elastic Polysulfates for Efficient Removal of Radioactive Iodomethane and Polar Aprotic Organics through Weak Intermolecular Forces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslinked elastic polysulfate network (TPC&#8208;cPS) was prepared by a &#8220;one&#8208;step&#8221; SuFEx reaction. TPC&#8208;cPS can adsorb pyridine and become a fast, efficient and recyclable mini&#8208;reactor and trapper for radioactive iodomethane and its vapors. TPC&#8208;cPS can also adsorb some polar aprotic organics (such as DMF) due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic interaction and van der Waals force with the organics.







Abstract
Capturing radioactive iodomethane and its vapors is a major challenge due to its low adsorption capacity. Herein, we have developed for the first time a pyridine&#8208;entrapped elastic crosslinked polysulfate gel (pyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS) as an efficient absorbent for iodomethane capture. Each pyridine&#8208;encased TPC&#8208;cPS network cell acts as a mini&#8208;reactor for salt formation between pyridine and iodomethane. The yield reaches up to 96.65&#8201;% and traps saturated iodomethane vapor of 1.573&#8197;g gpyridine/TPC&#8208;cPS&#8722;1 (equivalent to 18.103&#8197;g&#8201;gTPC&#8208;cPS&#8722;1), which is the highest capacity reported to date. Both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the unusual adsorption of polysulfate for polar aprotic organics can be attributed to the fact that the electrostatic interactions between the polar group (O=S=O) in the polymer backbone and the polar groups in the organic molecules fixed the solvent in the polymer matrix, while the van der Waals forces between the nonpolar groups in the polymer and molecules induced swelling.

         <title>A Nanopore&#8208;Based Saccharide Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneously assembled MspA nanopore is reported. When modified with a single phenylboronic acid adapter, it can be applied in the identification of monosaccharides at the single&#8208;molecule level.







Abstract
Saccharides play critical roles in many forms of cellular activities. Saccharide structures are however complicated and similar, setting a technical hurdle for direct identification. Nanopores, which are emerging single molecule tools sensitive to minor structural differences between analytes, can be engineered to identity saccharides. A hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A nanopore containing a phenylboronic acid was prepared, and was able to clearly identify nine monosaccharide types, including D&#8208;fructose, D&#8208;galactose, D&#8208;mannose, D&#8208;glucose, L&#8208;sorbose, D&#8208;ribose, D&#8208;xylose, L&#8208;rhamnose and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine. Minor structural differences between saccharide epimers can also be distinguished. To assist automatic event classification, a machine learning algorithm was developed, with which a general accuracy score of 0.96 was achieved. This sensing strategy is generally suitable for other saccharide types and may bring new insights to nanopore saccharide sequencing.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Release of Reactive Oxygen Species and NO for Overcoming Biofilm Heterogeneity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A therapeutic strategy to overcome biofilm heterogeneity is presented, in which antibacterial agent (NO) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) dispersant (reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;inducing Fe3+) are separately loaded in the yolk and shell compartment of a yolk&#8211;shell nanoplatform. The spatiotemporally ordered release manner and pharmacokinetic complementarity of ROS and NO improve the anti&#8208;biofilm outcome synergistically.







Abstract
The heterogeneity in biofilms is a major challenge in biofilm therapies due to different susceptibility of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to antibacterial agents. Here, we describe a therapeutic strategy that overcame biofilm heterogeneity, where antibacterial agent (NO) and EPS dispersant (reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;inducing Fe3+) were separately loaded in the yolk and shell compartment of a yolk&#8211;shell nanoplatform. Compared with traditional combinational chemotherapies which suffer from inconsistent pharmacokinetics profiles, this strategy drew on the pharmacokinetic complementarity of ROS and NO, where ROS with a short diffusion distance and a high redox potential corrupted the EPS, facilitating NO, which has a long diffusion distance and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, to penetrate the biofilm and eliminate the resident bacteria. Additionally, the construction of a three&#8208;dimensional spherical biofilm model is novel and clinically relevant.

         <title>One&#8208;For&#8208;All Polyolefin Functionalization: Active Ester as Gateway to Combine Insertion Polymerization with ROP, NMP, and RAFT</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. It allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials that comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.







Abstract
This work develops the Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process to afford well&#8208;defined polyolefin&#8211;polyvinyl block copolymers. &#945;&#8208;Diimine PdII&#8208;catalyzed olefin polymerizations were investigated through in&#8208;depth kinetic studies in comparison to an analog to establish the critical design that facilitates catalyst activation. Simple transformations lead to a diversity of functional groups forming polyolefin macroinitiators or macro&#8208;mediators for various subsequent controlled polymerization techniques. Preparation of block copolymers with different architectures, molecular weights, and compositions was demonstrated with ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP), and photoiniferter reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (PI&#8208;RAFT). The significant difference in the properties of polyolefin&#8211;polyacrylamide block copolymers was harnessed to carry out polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and study the nanostructure behaviors.

         <title>Property&#8208;Driven Development of Passively Permeable Macrocyclic Scaffolds Using Heterocycles
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide macrocycles display an array of bioactivity towards tough intracellular targets, but often exhibit poor physicochemical properties due to their multiple amide linkages. Here, the replacement of amide bonds with azole heterocycles is explored. The unique conformational space directed by heterocycles delivers macrocycles with high passive permeability, opening the door for the development of privileged macrocyclic scaffolds for drug discovery.







Abstract
Passive membrane permeability is a fundamental challenge in the development of bioactive macrocycles. To achieve this objective, chemists have resorted to various strategies, the most common of which is deployment of N&#8208;methylated amino acids and/or D&#8208;amino acids. Here we investigate the effect of heterocyclic grafts on the passive membrane permeability of macrocycles and report the structural consequences of iterative amino acid replacement by azole rings. Through stepwise substitution of amino acid residues for heterocycles, we show that lipophilicity and PAMPA permeability of a macrocycle can be vastly improved. Overall, changes in permeability do not scale linearly as more heterocycles are incorporated, underscoring the subtleties of conformation&#8208;property relationships in this class of molecule. NMR analysis and molecular dynamics simulations provide insights into the structural consequences of the added heterocycles and these frameworks can now be applied as macrocyclic scaffolds for drug discovery.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Sordarin Revealing a Diels&#8211;Alderase for the Formation of the Norbornene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of sordarin, a diterpene glycoside with potent antifungal bioactivity, has been uncovered. In particular, it involves three P450 enzymes for the modification of cycloaraneosene to form a biosynthetic intermediate with a terminal alkene and a cyclopentadiene ring, which undergoes an enzyme&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to form the rearranged sordaricin skeleton. Subsequent methyl oxidation and glycosylation form sordarin.







Abstract
Sordarin (1) is a fungal diterpene glycoside that displays potent antifungal bioactivity through inhibition of elongation factor 2. The structures of sordarin and related compounds feature a highly rearranged tetracyclic diterpene core. In this study, we identified a concise pathway in the biosynthesis of sordarin. A diterpene cyclase (SdnA) generates the 5/8/5 cycloaraneosene framework, which is decorated by a set of P450s that catalyze a series of oxidation reactions, including hydroxylation, desaturation, and C&#8722;C bond oxidative cleavage, to give a carboxylate intermediate with a terminal alkene and a cyclopentadiene moiety. A novel Diels&#8211;Alderase SdnG catalyzes an intramolecular Diels&#8211;Alder (IMDA) reaction on this intermediate to forge the sordarin core structure. Subsequent methyl hydroxylation and glycosylation complete the biosynthesis of sordarin. Our work discloses a new strategy used by nature for the formation of the rearranged diterpene skeleton.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Enantioisotopomers with Quantitative Chiral Analysis by Chiral Tag Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The validation and application of chiral tagging in molecular rotational resonance spectroscopy is reported for the assignment of absolute configuration and direct determination of enantiomeric excess for enantioisotopomers. Furthermore, a new catalytic, highly enantioselective, and scalable reaction is described for the direct synthesis of enantioisotopomers from styrene substrates.







Abstract
Fundamental to the synthesis of enantioenriched chiral molecules is the ability to assign absolute configuration at each stereogenic center, and to determine the enantiomeric excess for each compound. While determination of enantiomeric excess and absolute configuration is often considered routine in many facets of asymmetric synthesis, the same determinations for enantioisotopomers remains a formidable challenge. Here, we report the first highly enantioselective metal&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of enantioisotopomers that are chiral by virtue of deuterium substitution along with the first general spectroscopic technique for assignment of the absolute configuration and quantitative determination of the enantiomeric excess of isotopically chiral molecules. Chiral tag rotational spectroscopy uses noncovalent chiral derivatization, which eliminates the possibility of racemization during derivatization, to perform the chiral analysis without the need of reference samples of the enantioisotopomer.

         <title>Weak Cation&#8211;Solvent Interactions in Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes Stabilizing Potassium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In low&#8208;concentrated ether&#8208;based electrolytes, the weak K+&#8211;solvent interactions are conducive to enhancing the potassium metal performance, the oxidation stability of the electrolyte, and enabling the graphite anode to undergo K+ intercalation rather than K+&#8208;solvent co&#8208;intercalation behaviour.







Abstract
Conventional ether&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a low polarization voltage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, yet suffered from ion&#8211;solvent co&#8208;intercalation phenomena in a graphite anode, inferior potassium&#8208;metal performance, and limited oxidation stability. Here, we reveal that weakening the cation&#8211;solvent interactions could suppress the co&#8208;intercalation behaviour, enhance the potassium&#8208;metal performance, and improve the oxidation stability. Consequently, the graphite anode exhibits K+ intercalation behaviour (K||graphite cell operates 200&#8197;cycles with 86.6&#8201;% capacity retention), the potassium metal shows highly stable plating/stripping (K||Cu cell delivers 550&#8197;cycles with average Coulombic efficiency of 98.9&#8201;%) and dendrite&#8208;free (symmetric K||K cell operates over 1400&#8197;hours) properties, and the electrolyte exhibits high oxidation stability up to 4.4&#8197;V. The ion&#8211;solvent interaction tuning strategy provides a promising method to develop high&#8208;performance electrolytes and beyond.

         <title>Divide and Conquer: A Tailored Solid&#8208;state NMR Approach to Study Large Membrane Protein Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a protein&#8208;selective labelling approach that allowed us to probe a single lipoprotein (BamC) in the pentameric BAM membrane protein complex by proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Our results generate novel insights into the supramolecular structure of the BAM complex and provide evidence that the three BamC domains exhibit different dynamic properties within the 200&#8197;kDa complex embedded in lipid bilayers.







Abstract
Membrane proteins are known to exert many essential biological functions by forming complexes in cell membranes. An example refers to the &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM), a 200&#8197;kDa pentameric complex containing BAM proteins A&#8211;E that catalyzes the essential process of protein insertion into the outer membrane of gram&#8208;negative bacteria. While progress has been made in capturing three&#8208;dimensional structural snapshots of the BAM complex, the role of the lipoprotein BamC in the complex assembly in functional lipid bilayers has remained unclear. We have devised a component&#8208;selective preparation scheme to directly study BamC as part of the entire BAM complex in lipid bilayers. Combination with proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods allowed us to probe the structure, dynamics, and supramolecular topology of full&#8208;length BamC embedded in the entire complex in lipid bilayers. Our approach may help decipher how individual proteins contribute to the dynamic formation and functioning of membrane protein complexes in membranes.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State in Spiro Compact Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads Based on Pyromellitimide&#8208;Derived Rhodamine: Charge Transfer Dynamics and Electron Spin Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyad is prepared by linking the electron donor and acceptor via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the electron donor and acceptor is completely inhibited. The dyad shows a long&#8208;lived 3CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s) with a high energy level (ca. 2.61&#8197;eV), the electron spin multiplicity of the CT state was confirmed with time&#8208;resolved EPR spectra.







Abstract
We observed a long&#8208;lived charge transfer (CT) state in a novel orthogonal compact electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and pyromellitimide (PI),or thionated PI, as electron acceptor. The two parts in the dyads are connected via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the donor and acceptor is completely inhibited, which is beneficial to reduce the reorganization energy and to exploit the Marcus inverted region effect to prolong the CT state lifetime. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show that the charge separation is rather fast, while nanosecond transient absorption spectra confirmed the formation of long&#8208;lived CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra determined the spin multiplicity of the long living state and assigned it to a 3CT state. Replacement of an oxygen atom in the PI part with a sulfur atom favoring classical intersystem crossing processes, causes a consistently shortening of the lifetime of the 3CT state (0.29&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>Expanded Azaporphyrins Consisting of Multiple BODIPY Units: Global Aromaticity and High Affinities Towards Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;coupling reaction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;BODIPY under Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination conditions has led to the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;bridged cyclic BODIPY tetramer, pentamer, and hexamer. Subsequent oxidation of these BODIPY oligomers with DDQ in the presence of alkali metal ions gave 1, 2, and 3, which show high affinities towards alkali metal ions. Expanded azaporphyrins 1 and 2 display global aromaticity.







Abstract
The one&#8208;pot self&#8208;coupling reaction of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromo&#8208;BODIPY 9 under Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination conditions gave nitrogen&#8208;bridged cyclic BODIPY tetramer 10, pentamer 11, and hexamer 12. Oxidation of 10, 11, and 12 in the presence of alkali metal ions provided 13, 15, and 16, respectively, as the first examples of expanded azaporphyrins possessing more than six pyrrole rings. Curiously, the oxidation even in the absence of alkali metal ions gave the same complexes as a result of spontaneous complexation. 10&#8211;12 showed large association constants (104&#8211;106&#8197;M&#8722;1) with K+ and Na+, but the spontaneous complexations were not observed, indicating the extremely high affinities of 13&#8211;16 toward alkali metal ions, which can be ascribed to the multiple and effective ion&#8211;dipole interaction of the alkali metal ion with the negatively polarized F atoms of the BF2 walls surrounding the cavity. Importantly, 13, 14, and 15 show diatropic ring currents as a result of global aromaticity.

         <title>Molecular Stacking on Graphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first prototype of spatially defined graphene 2D hetero&#8208;architectures bearing vertically aligned multiple molecular bricks is realized based on a proposed &#8220;molecular building blocks&#8221; concept. The constructed nano&#8208;assemblies exhibit structural hierarchies across multiple height scales and versatile properties. The results represent a breakthrough and open the door for future construction of promising patterned 3D architectures.







Abstract
The sequential vertical polyfunctionalization of 2D addend&#8208;patterned graphene is still elusive. Here, we report a practical realization of this goal via a &#8220;molecular building blocks&#8221; approach, which is based on a combination of a lithography&#8208;assisted reductive functionalization approach and a post&#8208;functionalization step to sequentially and controllably link the molecular building blocks ethylpyridine, cis&#8208;dichlorobis(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl)ruthenium, and triphenylphosphine (4&#8208;methylbenzenethiol, respectively) on selected lattice regions of a graphene matrix. The assembled 2D hetero&#8208;architectures are unambiguously characterized by various spectroscopic and microscopic measurements, revealing the stepwise stacking of the molecular building blocks on the graphene surface. Our method overcomes the current limitation of a one&#8208;layer&#8208;only binding to the graphene surface and opens the door for a vertical growth in the z&#8208;direction.

Abstract
A critical step in advancing the practical application of copper&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is to bridge the large gap between device efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance. Described is a panel of air&#8208; and thermally stable two&#8208;coordinate CuI emitters featuring bulky pyrazine&#8208; (PzIPr) or pyridine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PyIPr*) and carbazole (Cz) ligands with enhanced amide&#8208;Cu&#8208;carbene bonding interactions. These CuI emitters display thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) from the 1LL&#8242;CT(Cz&#8594;PzIPr/PyIPr*) excited states across the blue to red regions with exceptional radiative rate constants of 1.1&#8211;2.2&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1. Vapour&#8208;deposited OLEDs based on these CuI emitters showed excellent external quantum efficiencies and luminance up to 23.6&#8201;% and 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively, alongside record device lifetimes (LT90) up to 1300&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 under our laboratory conditions, highlighting the practicality of the CuI&#8208;TADF emitters.

Vapour-deposited OLEDs based on these Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; emitters showed excellent external quantum efficiencies and luminance up to 23.6&#8201;% and 222&#8201;200&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, alongside record device lifetimes (LT&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt;) up to 1300&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under our laboratory conditions, highlighting the practicality of the Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-TADF emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineered Crown&#8208;Ether&#8208;Protein with Strong Adhesion over a Wide Temperature Range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C</title>

         <dc:description>
A crown&#8208;ether&#8208;protein adhesive was synthesized by host&#8211;guest molecular engineering. The internal dynamic molecular interactions endow the adhesives with extraordinary adhesion performance over a wide temperature range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C. Extremely strong adhesion, long&#8208;lasting adhesion, and biomedical sealing have been achieved. This work offers a promising molecular engineering strategy to fabricate robust supramolecular adhesives for applications under extreme conditions.







Abstract
The inherently tenuous adhesion strength and limited environmental tolerance of supramolecular adhesives severely restrict their application scenarios. It is challenging for the development of robust adhesives with extreme temperature tolerance. Herein, we report a new type of temperature&#8208;resistant crown&#8208;ether&#8208;protein (CEP) adhesive by harnessing synergistic host&#8211;guest molecular interactions between engineered crown ether and protein building blocks. The outputs of CEP adhesive demonstrate ultrahigh shearing adhesion strength of &#8776;22&#8197;MPa over a wide temperature range from &#8722;196 to 200&#8201;&#176;C, superior to other established supramolecular or polymeric adhesives. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition and internal bound water stabilized the system and led to superb adhesion under extreme conditions. Thus, this work pioneers a molecular engineering approach for the generation of adhesives with tailored applications in extreme settings.

         <title>Asymmetric Living Supramolecular Polymerization: Precise Fabrication of One&#8208;Handed Helical Supramolecular Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Right&#8208;handed helical seed micelles prepared from chiral poly(cholesterol allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) induced an asymmetric living supramolecular block copolymerization of achiral poly(alkoxy allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene). This led to right&#8208;handed supramolecular block copolymers with controlled length and low distribution. Remarkably, these copolymers showed white&#8208;light emission and circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Programming the organization of semiconducting polymers to form well&#8208;defined nanoarchitectures is desirable for fabricating functional materials. In this work, semiconducting copolymers, poly(cholesterol allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT) containing helical PCA and poly(alkoxy allene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (PAA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT) containing achiral PAA segments, were prepared. Crystallization of P3HT and helicity of PCA drove PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT self&#8208;assemble into spherical nanoparticles that gradually transformed into one&#8208;handed helical nanofibers. The chirality of PCA was transferred to the supramolecular architectures, induced high optical activity in P3HT. Interestingly, the chiral seed micelles of PCA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT induced asymmetric copolymerization of achiral PAA&#8208;b&#8208;P3HT, which led to helical supramolecular block copolymers with defined helicity and controlled length. Remarkably, the supramolecular copolymers showed white&#8208;light emission and circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Intramolecular Chloro&#8211;Sulfur Interaction and Asymmetric Side&#8208;Chain Isomerization to Balance Crystallinity and Miscibility in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of Cl atoms into the backbone in small&#8208;molecule donors (SMDs) enhances the molecular planarity and rigidity through intramolecular Cl&#8722;S interactions. Additionally, asymmetric isomerization of side chains balances crystallinity and miscibility to achieve ideal morphology for simultaneously high short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor to yield a record power conversion efficiency of 15.73&#8201;% among halogenated SMD&#8208;based binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.







Abstract
Intramolecular Cl&#8722;S non&#8208;covalent interaction is introduced to modify molecular backbone of a benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodamine (BTR) benchmark structure, helping planarize and rigidify the molecular framework for improving charge transport. Theoretical simulations and temperature&#8208;variable NMR experiments clearly validate the existence of Cl&#8722;S non&#8208;covalent interaction in two designed chlorinated donors and explain its important role in enhancing planarity and rigidity of the molecules for enhancing their crystallinity. The asymmetric isomerization of side&#8208;chains further optimizes the molecular orientation and surface energy to strike a balance between its crystallinity and miscibility. This carefully manipulated molecular design helps result in increased carrier mobility and suppressed charge recombination to obtain simultaneously enhanced short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) and a very high efficiency of 15.73&#8201;% in binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells.

         <title>Diastereodivergent Aldol&#8208;Type Coupling of Alkoxyallenes with Pentafluorophenyl Esters Enabled by Synergistic Palladium/Chiral Lewis Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a chiral palladium catalyst and a chiral Lewis base catalyst was used to achieve diastereodivergent aldol&#8208;type coupling reactions of alkoxyallenes with pentafluorophenyl esters. Each of the four stereoisomers of the coupling products could be selectively prepared from the same pair of substrates simply by using an appropriate pair of chiral catalysts. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the stereochemistry of this reaction.







Abstract
As a fundamental and synthetically useful C&#8722;C bond formation reaction, the aldol reaction is one of the most versatile transformations in organic synthesis. However, despite extensive research on asymmetric versions of the reaction, a unified method for stereoselective access to the complementary syn and anti diastereomeric products remains to be developed. In this study, we developed a synergistic palladium/chiral Lewis base system that overcomes the inherent diastereoselectivity bias of aldol reactions and, as a result, allowed us to achieve the first diastereodivergent coupling reactions of alkoxyallenes with pentafluorophenol esters. Computational studies suggest a mechanism involving an intermolecular protonative hydropalladation pathway rather than a palladium&#8208;hydride migratory insertion pathway. The origin of the stereochemistry for this synergistic catalysis system is rationalized by DFT calculations.

         <title>A Site Distance Effect Induced by Reactant Molecule Matchup in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site distance effects are important in a Cu1/N&#8208;doped graphene (Cu1/GN) single&#8208;atom catalyst with record&#8208;breaking kinetics in the oxidation of emerging organic pollutants. A strategy is reported to achieve the desired catalyst behavior by matching the active site with the properties of the reaction molecule peroxydisulfate (PDS).







Abstract
Understanding the site interaction nature of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), especially densely populated SACs, is vital for their application to various catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a site distance effect, which emphasizes how well the distance of the adjacent copper atoms (denoted as dCu1&#8722;Cu1) matches with the reactant peroxydisulfate (PDS) molecular size to determine the Fenton&#8208;like reaction reactivity on the carbon&#8208;supported SACs. The optimized dCu1&#8722;Cu1 in the range of 5&#8211;6&#8197;&#197;, which matches the molecular size of PDS, endows the catalyst with a nearly two times higher turnover frequency than that of dCu1&#8722;Cu1 beyond this range, accordingly achieving record&#8208;breaking kinetics for the oxidation of emerging organic contaminants. Further studies suggest that this site distance effect originates from the alteration of PDS adsorption to a dual&#8208;site structure on Cu1&#8722;Cu1 sites when dCu1&#8722;Cu1 falls within 5&#8211;6&#8197;&#197;, significantly enhancing the interfacial charge transfer and consequently resulting in the most efficient catalyst for PDS activation so far.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Triple&#8208;Phase Boundaries towards a Highly Functional Exsolved Catalyst for Dry Reforming of Methane under a Dilution&#8208;Free System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) extended nanocatalyst converts CO2 and CH4 to industrially useful syngas. Even under a dilution&#8208;free system, the precisely controlled exsolved nanocatalyst was highly active and stable for 1000&#8197;hours without any deactivation. DFT calculations revealed that the Lewis acid and base natures of support and metal, respectively, enhance the adsorption ability of reactants at the TPB site.







Abstract
Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has been emerging as a viable solution to achieving carbon neutrality enhanced by the Paris Agreement as it converts the greenhouse gases of CO2 and CH4 into industrially useful syngas. However, there have been limited studies on the DRM catalyst under mild operating conditions with a high dilution gas ratio due to their deactivation from carbon coking and metal sintering. Herein, we apply the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) concept to DRM catalyst via exsolution phenomenon that can secure elongated TPB by controlling the Fe&#8208;doping ratio in perovskite oxide. Remarkably, the exsolved catalyst with prolongated TPB shows exceptional CO2 and CH4 conversion rates of 95.9&#8201;% and 91.6&#8201;%, respectively, stable for 1000&#8197;hours under a dilution&#8208;free system. DFT calculations confirm that the Lewis acid of support and Lewis base of metal at the TPB promote the adsorption of reactants, resulting in lowering the overall CO2 dissociation and CH4 dehydrogenation energy.

         <title>A Small Molecular Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecule, 2,3,7,8&#8208;tetraaminophenazine&#8208;1,4,6,9&#8208;tetraone (TAPT), is reported for symmetric all&#8208;organic lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The rich C=O, C=N and NH2 groups enabled more than two plateaus, strong and plentiful intermolecular interactions, possible chelation with Li ions and hence insolubility, high capacity and cyclability.







Abstract
The structural designability of organic electrode materials makes them attractive for symmetric all&#8208;organic batteries (SAOBs) by virtue of different plateaus. However, quite a few works have reported all&#8208;organic batteries and it is still challenging to develop a high&#8208;performance organic material for SAOBs. Herein, a small molecule, 2,3,7,8&#8208;tetraaminophenazine&#8208;1,4,6,9&#8208;tetraone (TAPT), is reported for SAOBs. The rich C=O and C=N groups ensure the high capacity at both plateaus for C=O/C&#8722;O and C=N/C&#8722;N redox reactions, which are hence utilized as cathodic and anodic active centers respectively. Moreover, the presence of C=O, C=N and NH2 groups resulted in plentiful strong intermolecular interactions, leading to layered structures, insolubility and high stability. The rich functional groups also facilitated the chelation of N and O with Li cations and hence benefited the storage of Li cations. The electrochemical performances of TAPT&#8208;based SAOBs outperformed all of the previously reported SAOBs.

         <title>Discovery of a Potent and Selective Degrader for USP7</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first&#8208;in&#8208;class selective USP7 degrader U7D&#8208;1 was developed, inducing potent USP7 degradation in different kinds of cell lines. Importantly, this degrader showed notable anti&#8208;proliferative activities in mutant p53 cancer cells, with USP7 inhibitor having no activity.







Abstract
The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and more than half of cancers contain p53 mutations. The development of novel and effective therapeutic strategies for p53 mutant cancer therapy is a big challenge and highly desirable. Ubiquitin&#8208;specific protease 7 (USP7), also known as HAUSP, is a deubiquitinating enzyme and proposed to stabilize the oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 that promotes the proteosomal degradation of p53. Herein, we report the design and characterization of U7D&#8208;1 as the first selective USP7&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC). U7D&#8208;1 showed selective and effective USP7 degradation, and maintained potent cell growth inhibition in p53 mutant cancer cells, with USP7 inhibitor showing no activity. These data clearly demonstrated the practicality and importance of PROTAC as a preliminary chemical tool for investigating USP7 protein functions and a promising method for potential p53 mutant cancer therapy.

         <title>Pore&#8208;Structure Control in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for Capture of the Greenhouse Gas SF6 with Record Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) Ni(ina)2 has pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are perfectly compatible with the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for this potent greenhouse gas that is used in the electronics industry.







Abstract
In the electronics industry, the efficient recovery and capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from SF6/N2 mixtures is of great importance. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks with fine&#8208;tuning pore structures, Cu(peba)2, Ni(pba)2, and Ni(ina)2, were designed for SF6 capture. Among them, Ni(ina)2 has perfect pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are comparable to the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for SF6 gas. Ni(ina)2 exhibits the highest SF6/N2 selectivity (375.1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and ultra&#8208;high SF6 uptake capacity (53.5&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar) at ambient conditions. The remarkable separation performance of Ni(ina)2 was verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations and the SF6&#8208;loaded single&#8208;crystal structure provided critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. This porous coordination network has the potential to be used in industrial applications.

&lt;/b&gt; has pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are perfectly compatible with the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for this potent greenhouse gas that is used in the electronics industry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the electronics industry, the efficient recovery and capture of sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) from SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures is of great importance. Herein, three metal&#8211;organic frameworks with fine-tuning pore structures, &lt;b&gt;Cu(peba)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Ni(pba)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Ni(ina)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, were designed for SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; capture. Among them, &lt;b&gt;Ni(ina)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; has perfect pore sizes (6&#8197;&#197;) that are comparable to the kinetic diameter of sulfur hexafluoride (5.2&#8197;&#197;), affording the benchmark binding affinity for SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; gas. &lt;b&gt;Ni(ina)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits the highest SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (375.1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and ultra-high SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; uptake capacity (53.5&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K and 0.1&#8197;bar) at ambient conditions. The remarkable separation performance of &lt;b&gt;Ni(ina)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was verified by dynamic breakthrough experiments. Theoretical calculations and the SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-loaded single-crystal structure provided critical insight into the adsorption/separation mechanism. This porous coordination network has the potential to be used in industrial applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Polarization in the Sr6Cd2Sb6O7Se10 Oxyselenide through Design of Lateral Sublattices for Efficient Photoelectric Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new oxyselenide Sr6Cd2Sb6O7Se10 featuring polar lateral sublattices has been designed for efficient photoelectric conversion. The improved polarization of the heteroanionic Sb&#8722;Se/O sublattice facilitates the separation of photo&#8208;induced charge carriers, benefiting the wide spectral photoelectric response of this material.







Abstract
Highly&#8208;polarizable materials are favorable for photoelectric conversion due to their efficient charge separation, while precise design of them is still a big challenge. Herein a novel polar oxyselenide, Sr6Cd2Sb6O7Se10, is rationally designed. It contains lateral sublattices of polarizable [Sb2OSe4]4&#8722; chains and highly&#8208;orientated [CdSe3]4&#8722; chains. The intense polarization was evaluated by significant second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) signal (maximum: 12.6&#215;AgGaS2) in broad spectrum range. The polarization was found to mainly improve the carrier separation with a much longer recombination lifetime (76.5&#8197;&#956;s) than that of the nonpolar compound Sr2Sb2O2Se3 (18.0&#8197;&#956;s), resulting in better photoelectric performance. The single&#8208;crystal photoelectric device exhibited excellent response covering broad spectrum in 500&#8211;1000&#8197;nm with stable reproducibility. This work provides some new insights into the structure design of highly&#8208;polarizable heteroanionic materials for photoelectric conversion.

Closed&#8208;loop recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) to L&#8208;lactide (LLA) was enabled by specific solvent interactions. In their Research Article (e202204531), Karin Odelius and co&#8208;workers show how the ceiling temperature (Tc) depends not only on concentration, but also on solvent properties. This was utilized to lower the recycling temperature of PLLA, enabling direct ring&#8208;closing depolymerization of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight PLLA to the cyclic monomer LLA with high yield and high selectivity.

A combinatorial self&#8208;assembly approach with enPd(NO3)2 and three different ligands is demonstrated by Li&#8208;Xuan Cai, Qihui Chen, Qing&#8208;Fu Sun, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202204732). The controllable arrangement of different ligands not only gives rise to a family of six different palladium&#8211;organic cages with systematically varied shapes and cavities, but also leads to emergent host&#8211;guest chemistry of the heteroleptic cages due to the fusion of two half cavities from their parent homoleptic cages.

The rational synthesis of high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide clusters remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202205385), Min Feng, Zhiping Zheng, and co&#8208;workers developed a stepwise synthesis of a high&#8208;nuclearity sodalite cage&#8208;like cluster Er60, guided by judiciously selected anions. The successive introduction of I&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, and NO3&#8722; led to the isolation of three crucial intermediate clusters, namely the wheel&#8208;like Er12, ship&#8208;like Er34, and bowl&#8208;like Er48. These findings opened the &#8220;black box&#8221; of the elusive self&#8208;assembly process and provided mechanistic insights.

A polyolefin active ester exchange (PACE) process was developed for polyolefin&#8208;containing block copolymer synthesis and serves as a bridge connecting coordination&#8211;insertion polymerization to multiple controlled polymerization methods. As reported by Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, Eva Harth et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202205931), PACE allows for the synthesis of hybrid materials that comprise olefins and ester, styrene, vinylic, acrylate, and acrylamide segments with a broad window for tunability. Nano&#8208;objects with higher&#8208;order morphologies can be obtained directly via RAFT&#8208;mediated PISA.

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically formed using hard Lewis basic organic ligands with high oxidation state metal ions. The use of low&#8208;valent metals as structural elements in MOFs is far less common, despite the widespread use of such metals for catalysis, luminescence, and other applications. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of low&#8208;valent MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline, 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers formed by bonding interactions between metals and multitopic organic ligands. These are typically formed using hard Lewis basic organic ligands with high oxidation state metal ions. The use of low&#8208;valent metals as structural elements in MOFs is far less common, despite the widespread use of such metals for catalysis, luminescence, and other applications. This Minireview focuses on recent advances in the field of low&#8208;valent MOFs and offers a perspective on the future development of these materials.

         <title>Alloy&#8208;Type Anodes for High&#8208;Performance Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy&#8208;type anodes are one of the most promising anodes because of their high energy density, relatively low electrode potential and low cost, but they can also undergo large volume expansion, resulting in disintegration and fracturing of anodes. In this Review useful strategies to solve these problems are discussed including the structural design of anodes, construction of a protective interface on anodes, and selection of suitable electrolytes.







Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type anodes are one of the most promising classes of next&#8208;generation anode materials due to their ultrahigh theoretical capacity (2&#8211;10&#8197;times that of graphite). However, current alloy&#8208;type anodes have several limitations: huge volume expansion, high tendency to fracture and disintegrate, an unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, and low Coulombic efficiency. Efforts to overcome these challenges are ongoing. This Review details recent progress in the research of batteries based on alloy&#8208;type anodes and discusses the direction of their future development. We conclude that improvements in structural design, the introduction of a protective interface, and the selection of suitable electrolytes are the most effective ways to improve the performance of alloy&#8208;type anodes. Furthermore, future studies should direct more attention toward analyzing their synergistic promoting effect.

         <title>Lewis Base Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfur Heterocycles via the C1&#8208;Pyridinium Enolate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiocarbonyl&#8208;containing compounds undergo reactions with C1&#8208;Lewis base enolates to give sulfur heterocycles. Specifically, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyses the cyclisation of dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates to give an array of sulfur heterocycles. The transformation demonstrates the viability of thiocarbonyl&#8208;containing functionality in Lewis base organocatalysis, and defines a new approach to sulfur&#8208;heterocycles.







Abstract
While the addition of C1&#8208;Lewis base enolates to carbonyls and related structures are well established, the related addition to thiocarbonyls compounds are unknown. Herein, we report a reaction cascade in which a C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate undergos addition to dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates. The reaction provides access to a range of dihydrothiophenes and dihydrothiopyrans (28&#8208;examples). Mechanistic investigations, including isolation of intermediates, electronic correlation, and kinetic isotope effect studies support the viability of an activated acid intermediate giving rise to the C1&#8208;pyridinium enolate which undergoes turnover limiting cyclization.

     alt="Lewis Base Catalyzed Synthesis of Sulfur Heterocycles via the C1-Pyridinium Enolate"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thiocarbonyl-containing compounds undergo reactions with C1-Lewis base enolates to give sulfur heterocycles. Specifically, dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyses the cyclisation of dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates to give an array of sulfur heterocycles. The transformation demonstrates the viability of thiocarbonyl-containing functionality in Lewis base organocatalysis, and defines a new approach to sulfur-heterocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the addition of C1-Lewis base enolates to carbonyls and related structures are well established, the related addition to thiocarbonyls compounds are unknown. Herein, we report a reaction cascade in which a C1-pyridinium enolate undergos addition to dithioesters, trithiocarbonates and xanthates. The reaction provides access to a range of dihydrothiophenes and dihydrothiopyrans (28-examples). Mechanistic investigations, including isolation of intermediates, electronic correlation, and kinetic isotope effect studies support the viability of an activated acid intermediate giving rise to the C1-pyridinium enolate which undergoes turnover limiting cyclization. Subsequent formation of a &#946;-thiolactone regenerates the catalyst with loss of carbon oxysulfide providing the observed products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Transfer&#8208;Mediated Degradation of Ether&#8208;Based Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes in Alkali Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rethinking the stability of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes in alkali metal batteries: Ether solvent can act as a phase transfer reagent that dissolves alkali metals into solvated electrons and metal anions to decompose inert hydrofluoroether co&#8208;solvents, preventing the formation of stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases.







Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) have attracted interest in alkali metal batteries due to the advantages of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases (SEIs) on anodes and good chemical/electrochemical stability. Herein, a new degradation mechanism is revealed for ether&#8208;based LHCEs that questions their compatibility with alkali metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). Specifically, the ether solvent reacts with alkali metals to generate solvated electrons (es&#8722;) that attack hydrofluoroether co&#8208;solvents to form a series of byproducts. The ether solvent essentially acts as a phase&#8208;transfer reagent that continuously transfers electrons from solid&#8208;phase metals into the solution phase, thus inhibiting the formation of stable SEI and leading to continuous alkali metal corrosion. Switching to an ester&#8208;based solvating solvent or intercalation anodes such as graphite or molybdenum disulfide has been shown to avoid such a degradation mechanism due to the absence of es&#8722;.

         <title>An Aminative Rearrangement of O&#8208;(Arenesulfonyl)hydroxylamines: Facile Access to ortho&#8208;Sulfonyl Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aromatic rearrangement of hydroxylamine derivatives that leads directly to ortho&#8208;sulfonyl anilines from simple starting materials is reported. This is achieved through formation of a new C&#8722;N bond with excellent levels of regiocontrol for the ortho isomer(s), which is proposed to be the result of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring during the C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step.







Abstract
Ortho&#8208;sulfonyl anilines are important building blocks for a range of applications. We report the discovery of an aromatic rearrangement reaction of O&#8208;(arenesulfonyl)hydroxylamines which leads directly to ortho&#8208;sulfonyl anilines through formation of a new C&#8722;N bond with excellent levels of regiocontrol for the ortho position(s) over all others. We establish that the rearrangement is proceeding through an intermolecular mechanism and propose that the regiocontrol observed is the result of attractive non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring during the C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming step. Importantly, this method is complementary to classical aniline sulfonation in terms of the variously substituted regioisomers that can be obtained and it is also applicable to O&#8208;(benzylsulfonyl) hydroxylamines.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Targeting Circular Aptamer Strategy Enables the Recognition of Different Leukemia Cells with Enhanced Binding Ability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enhance the recognition and internalization ability of aptamers, we designed a dual&#8208;targeting circular aptamer (DTCA) that can simultaneously recognize two different biomarkers on cancer cells to significantly improve aptamer&#8211;receptor interactions. This molecular engineering technique considerably boosts binding avidity and expands the recognition spectrum of these aptamers to different subtypes of leukemia cells.







Abstract
Currently, the broad use of monovalent aptamers in oncology faces challenges, including insufficient recognition and internalization caused by a finite number of receptors on the cell surface, as well as a confined recognition spectrum. Herein, we describe the development of a dual&#8208;targeting circular aptamer (DTCA) that can recognize two different biomarkers on living cells to augment aptamer&#8211;receptor interactions, thus enhancing recognition of the target cells. This improvement not only boosts binding and internalization abilities, but also expands the recognition spectrum of these aptamers to different leukemia cells. Moreover, the stability of DTCA in serum can be significantly improved by an enzyme&#8208;promoted terminal ligation strategy. The chemical incorporation of 5&#8208;fluorodeoxyuridine into DTCA resulted in a pharmaceutically functional aptamer that exhibited excellent selectivity, as demonstrated by its high cytotoxicity against target cancer cells, but not to normal cells. The superiority of our newly developed strategy was further highlighted by its precise tumor&#8208;imaging capability.

         <title>Dual Honeycomb&#8208;Superlattice Enables Double&#8208;High Activity and Reversibility of Anion Redox for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed sodium&#8208;ion battery layered cathode has been constructed via dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice regulation, and this displayed double&#8208;high anion redox activity and reversibility. Experimental and theoretical studies are carried out to explore the mechanism.







Abstract
Anion redox contributes to the anomalous capacity exceeding the theoretical limit of layered oxides. However, double&#8208;high activity and reversibility is challenging due to the structural rearrangement and potential oxygen loss. Here, we propose a strategy for constructing a dual honeycomb&#8208;superlattice structure in Na2/3[Li1/7Mn5/14][Mg1/7Mn5/14]O2 to simultaneously realize high activity and reversibility of lattice O redox. Theoretical simulation and electrochemical tests show that [Li1/7Mn5/14] superlattice units remarkably trigger the anion redox activity and enable the delivery of a record capacity of 285.9&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 in layered sodium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Nuclear magnetic resonance and in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal that [Mg1/7Mn5/14] superlattice units are beneficial to the structure and anion redox reversibility, where Li+ reversibly shuttles between Na layers and transition&#8208;metal slabs in contrast to the absence of [Mg1/7Mn5/14] units. Our findings underline the importance of multifunctional units and provide a path to advanced battery materials.

Simple is powerful: Terbium complexes labeled with hexahistidine&#8208;tagged nanobodies were displaced from quantum dots via EGFR&#8208;nanobody binding. This simple concept resulted in a rapid and wash&#8208;free single&#8208;nanobody FRET immunoassay with picomolar limits of detection.







Abstract
Biosensing approaches that combine small, engineered antibodies (nanobodies) with nanoparticles are often complicated. Here, we show that nanobodies with different C&#8208;terminal tags can be efficiently attached to a range of the most widely used biocompatible semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Direct implementation into simplified assay formats was demonstrated by designing a rapid and wash&#8208;free mix&#8208;and&#8208;measure immunoassay for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Terbium complex (Tb)&#8208;labeled hexahistidine&#8208;tagged nanobodies were specifically displaced from QD surfaces via EGFR&#8208;nanobody binding, leading to an EGFR concentration&#8208;dependent decrease of the Tb&#8208;to&#8208;QD F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal. The detection limit of 80&#177;20&#8197;pM (16&#177;4&#8197;ng&#8201;mL&#8722;1) was 3&#8208;fold lower than the clinical cut&#8208;off concentration for soluble EGFR and up to 10&#8208;fold lower compared to conventional sandwich FRET assays that required a pair of different nanobodies.

         <title>Hydrazide Derivatives for Defect Passivation in Pure CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new passivator&#8212;benzoyl hydrazine (BH) with carboxyl, hydrazine and phenyl groups was developed to effectively passivate defects in CsPbI3 through synergetic effects of these groups. Consequently, a highest efficiency of 20.47&#8201;% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage and stability is achieved in a BH&#8208;CsPbI3 solar cell, the highest efficiency among all pure CsPbI3&#8208;based devices reported to date.







Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite presents preeminent chemical stability and a desirable band gap as the front absorber for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Unfortunately, CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still show low efficiency due to high density of defects in solution&#8208;prepared CsPbI3 films. Herein, three kinds of hydrazide derivatives (benzoyl hydrazine (BH), formohydrazide (FH) and benzamide (BA)) are designed to reduce the defect density and stabilize the phase of CsPbI3. Calculation and characterization results corroborate that the carboxyl and hydrazine groups in BH form strong chemical bonds with Pb2+ ions, resulting in synergetic double coordination. In addition, the hydrazine group in the BH also forms a hydrogen bond with iodine to assist the coordination. Consequently, a high efficiency of 20.47&#8201;% is achieved, which is the highest PCE among all pure CsPbI3&#8208;based PSCs reported to date. In addition, an unencapsulated device showed excellent stability in ambient air.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermophoretic AND Gate Operation on Extracellular Vesicles Improves Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging biomarkers for prostate cancer (PCa). A one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay for accurate identification of PCa&#8208;derived EVs directly in serum samples within 15&#8197;min is reported. The assay reached an overall accuracy of 91&#8201;% in discriminating PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in a single&#8208;step format, showing great potential for rapid, non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancers.







Abstract
Circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a valuable source of cancer biomarkers. However, the high degree of EV heterogeneity and the complexity of clinical samples pose a challenge in the sensitive identification of tumor&#8208;derived EVs. Here we introduce a one&#8208;step thermophoretic AND gate operation (Tango) assay that integrates polyethylene glycol (PEG)&#8208;enhanced thermophoretic accumulation of EVs and simultaneous AND gate operation on EV membranes by dual&#8208;aptamers recognition. By using the Tango assay to detect tumor&#8208;derived EVs with co&#8208;presence of EpCAM and PSMA directly from serum in a homogeneous, separation&#8208;free format, we can discriminate prostate cancer (PCa) patients from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients in the diagnostic gray zone with an accuracy of 91&#8201;% in 15&#8197;min. Our approach streamlines EV enrichment and AND gate operation on EVs in a single assay, providing a rapid, straightforward, and powerful method for precise and non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Revealing the Role of the Cyaphide Ion as a Bridging Ligand in Heterometallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hetero bi&#8208; and tri&#8208;metallic transition metal complexes featuring bridging cyaphide ions (C&#8801;P&#8722;) are reported. These were synthesized from reactions of Au(IDipp)(CP) with electron&#8208;rich, nucleophilic transition metal reagents. These studies suggest that the reactivity of Au(IDipp)(CP) is largely LUMO&#8208;driven and that it behaves as a metallo&#8208;phosphaalkyne.







Abstract
The synthesis of heterometallic transition metal complexes featuring bridging cyaphide ions (C&#8801;P&#8722;) is reported. These are synthesized from reactions of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with electron&#8208;rich, nucleophilic transition metal reagents, affording Au(IDipp)(&#956;2&#8722;C&#8801;P)Ni(MeIiPr)2 (MeIiPr=1,3&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) and Au(IDipp)(&#956;2&#8722;C&#8801;P)Rh(Cp*)(PMe3). These studies reveal that, in contrast to the cyanide ion, bimetallic cyaphido complexes strongly favor a &#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2 coordination mode that maximizes the interaction of the second metal (Ni, Rh) with the &#960;&#8208;manifold of the ion (and not the phosphorus atom lone pair). End&#8208;on bridging can be effectively unlocked by blocking the &#960;&#8208;manifold, as demonstrated by reaction of Au(IDipp)(&#956;2&#8722;C&#8801;P)Rh(Cp*)(PMe3) with an electrophilic transition metal reagent, W(CO)5(THF), which affords the heterotrimetallic compound Au(IDipp)(&#956;3&#8722;C&#8801;P)[Rh(Cp*)(PMe3)][W(CO)5].

         <title>Reconfigurable Liquids Constructed by Pillar[6]arene&#8208;Based Nanoparticle Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation, assembly and jamming of a novel pillar[6]arene surfactant at the oil&#8211;water interface is presented. By taking advantage of the high binding energy of pillar[6]arene surfactant to the interface and dynamic host&#8211;guest interactions, reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid constructs with redox or guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness can be achieved.







Abstract
The interfacial jamming of nanoparticle surfactants offers the possibility of structuring liquids and fabricating all&#8208;liquid constructs with advanced functionality. However, less attention has been given to structured liquids with multiple responsiveness. Here, we show a novel, yet highly simplified nanoparticle surfactant model, pillar[6]arene (PA[6]) surfactant, by taking advantage of the host&#8211;guest interactions between a water&#8208;soluble PA[6] and an oil&#8208;soluble ligand, ferrocenium terminated polystyrene. PA[6] surfactants form rapidly at the oil&#8211;water interface, assemble into an elastic film with excellent mechanical strength, and when jammed, offer a &#8220;solid&#8208;like&#8221; assembly to lock&#8208;in highly nonequilibrium shapes of the liquids. The interfacial assembly/jamming and disassembly/unjamming of PA[6] surfactants can be controlled by chemical redox or competitive guest reagents, endowing the structured liquids with redox or guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness.

&lt;p&gt;The formation, assembly and jamming of a novel pillar[6]arene surfactant at the oil&#8211;water interface is presented. By taking advantage of the high binding energy of pillar[6]arene surfactant to the interface and dynamic host&#8211;guest interactions, reconfigurable all-liquid constructs with redox or guest-competitive responsiveness can be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interfacial jamming of nanoparticle surfactants offers the possibility of structuring liquids and fabricating all-liquid constructs with advanced functionality. However, less attention has been given to structured liquids with multiple responsiveness. Here, we show a novel, yet highly simplified nanoparticle surfactant model, pillar[6]arene (PA[6]) surfactant, by taking advantage of the host&#8211;guest interactions between a water-soluble PA[6] and an oil-soluble ligand, ferrocenium terminated polystyrene. PA[6] surfactants form rapidly at the oil&#8211;water interface, assemble into an elastic film with excellent mechanical strength, and when jammed, offer a &#8220;solid-like&#8221; assembly to lock-in highly nonequilibrium shapes of the liquids. The interfacial assembly/jamming and disassembly/unjamming of PA[6] surfactants can be controlled by chemical redox or competitive guest reagents, endowing the structured liquids with redox or guest-competitive responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Working Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries at 80&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working feasibility at 80&#8201;&#176;C and 100&#8201;&#176;C of zinc&#8211;air batteries is demonstrated in this work. The operation of zinc&#8211;air batteries under high&#8208;temperature working conditions is systemically investigated. The electrolyte conductivity, the cathode and anode kinetics, and the anode anti&#8208;passivation are optimized at high temperatures, whereas declined anode Faraday efficiency originating from strengthened HER serves as the main bottleneck.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries possess inherent safety and are especially commendable facing high&#8208;temperature working conditions. However, their working feasibility at high temperatures has seldom been investigated. Herein, the working feasibility of high&#8208;temperature zinc&#8211;air batteries is systemically investigated. The effects of temperature on air cathode, zinc anode, and aqueous electrolyte are decoupled to identify the favorable and unfavorable factors. Specifically, parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction strengthens at high temperatures and leads to declined anode Faraday efficiency, which is identified as the main bottleneck. Moreover, zinc&#8211;air batteries demonstrate cycling feasibility at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This work reveals the potential of zinc&#8211;air batteries to satisfy energy storage at high temperatures and guides further development of advanced batteries towards harsh working conditions.

         <title>Highly Distorted Antimony(III) Chloride [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; Dimers for Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence up to 1070&#8197;nm</title>

         <dc:description>
Three zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid antimony chlorines show unusual room&#8208;temperature near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions. The maximum emission peak reaches 1070&#8197;nm for (C16H36P)SbCl4. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory analysis suggest that the NIR luminescence originates from the highly localized self&#8208;trapped excitons that are confined in edge&#8208;shared [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in the structures.







Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) hybrid metal halides with unique compositional and structural tunability appear as an emerging class of luminescent materials, but near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitters therein are largely unexplored to date. This study presents three novel 0D hybrid antimony chlorines with edge&#8208;sharing [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers, showing unusual room&#8208;temperature broadband NIR emission with the maximum emission wavelength up to 1070&#8197;nm. Photoluminescence studies and density functional theory calculation demonstrate that the emissions originate from the highly localized excitons, and that the confined [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers in these structures show low symmetry and a large degree of structural freedom. These hybrid antimony chlorines with [Sb2Cl8]2&#8722; dimers expand the range of new NIR materials in 0D metal halides.

         <title>Linear Nonalternant Isomers of Acenes Fusing Multiple Azulene Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular two&#8208;step [4+3] annulation approach to azulene units was developed starting from readily available aryl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene and ortho&#8208;haloaryl aldehyde by dehydration condensation followed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling. It facilitates the syntheses of four nonalternant isomers of pentacene and hexacene including DBA, BDA1, BDA2, and NDA which exhibit narrow band gaps and protonation&#8208;caused enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission.







Abstract
A modular approach to azulene building blocks was developed starting from readily available aryl&#8208;substituted cyclopentadiene and ortho&#8208;haloaryl aldehyde by dehydration condensation followed by palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H coupling. It facilitates the synthesis of four nonalternant isomers of pentacene and hexacene, namely, dibenzo[e,g]azulene, benzo[1,2&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;5,4&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, benzo[1,2&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;4,5&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, and naphtho[2,3&#8208;f&#8201;:&#8201;6,7&#8208;f&#8242;]diazulene, which exhibit narrow band gaps with high stability in addition to protonation&#8208;caused enhanced near&#8208;infrared fluorescence. We discovered that in these isomers, i) constitutional isomerism influences significantly their photoelectric properties and ii) the elongation of the conjugation system does not necessarily lead to a narrowing in the band gap. Due to the easy modifiability of the nonazulene building blocks, this strategy can be extended to modularly prepare numerous multiazulene&#8208;fused aromatics.

         <title>Cis&#8211;Trans Reisomerization Precedes Reprotonation of the Retinal Chromophore in the Photocycle of Schizorhodopsin 4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocycle of a light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping schizorhodopsin was characterized using time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, which demonstrated that cis&#8211;trans reisomerization precedes reprotonation of the retinal chromophore. This has never been observed for the conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins. Notably, the unprecedented sequence provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping.







Abstract
Recent discoveries of light&#8208;driven inward proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins have opened new avenues to exploring the mechanism of unidirectional transport because these proteins transport protons in the opposite direction to conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, despite their similar protein structure and membrane topology. Schizorhodopsin (SzR) is a newly discovered rhodopsin family of light&#8208;driven inward proton pumps. Here, we report time&#8208;resolved resonance Raman spectra showing that cis&#8211;trans thermal reisomerization precedes reprotonation at the Schiff base of the retinal chromophore in the photocycle of SzR AM_5_00977. This sequence has not been observed for the photocycles of conventional proton&#8208;pumping rhodopsins, in which reisomerization follows reprotonation, and thus provides insights into the mechanism of proton uptake to the chromophore during inward proton pumping. The present findings are expected to contribute to controlling the direction of proton transport in engineered proteins.

         <title>Photostability and Dynamic Helical Behavior in Chiral Poly(phenylacetylene)s with a Preferred Screw&#8208;Sense</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photostability of poly(phenylacetylene) (PPA) derivatives is closely linked to the dynamic helical behavior of the polyene scaffold. Quasi&#8208;static PPAs are stable under light exposure, while a photochemical electrocyclization is produced in dynamic PPAs.







Abstract
Helical polymers such as poly(phenylacetylene)s (PPAs) are interesting materials due to the possibility of tuning their helical scaffold (sense and elongation) once they have been prepared and by the presence of external stimuli. The main limitation in the application of PPAs is their poor photostability. These polymers degrade under visible light exposure through a photochemical electrocyclization process. In this work, it was demonstrated, through a selected example, how the photochemical degradation in PPAs is directly related to their dynamic helical behavior. Thus, while PPAs with dynamic helical structures show poor photostability under UV/Vis light exposure, poly&#8208;(R)&#8208;1, bearing an enantiopure sulfoxide group as pendant group and designed to have a quasi&#8208;static helical behavior, shows a large photostability due to the restricted conformational composition at the polyene backbone, needed to orient the conjugated double bonds prior to the photochemical electrocyclization process and the subsequent degradation of the material.

Abstract
The first rhodium&#8208;catalyzed highly chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydroformylation of cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized trisubstituted alkenes affording useful chiral cyclopropyl entities is reported. Compared to generally used diphosphine ligands for asymmetric catalysis, the modified hybrid phosphorus ligand, named (R,S)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;Yanphos, can convert a series of readily available cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized trisubstituted alkenes into high&#8208;value chiral cyclopropyl&#8208;functionalized aldehydes with high selectivities (81&#8211;98&#8201;% ee). Gram&#8208;scale reactions (TON up to 1500) and follow&#8208;up transformations to the corresponding alcohol, acid, esters and nitrile are also presented. Finally, a possible hydroformylation mechanism involving ring&#8208;open&#8208;hydroformylation pathways is proposed based on control and deuteroformylation reactions.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Zn&#8208;Based Halides with Ultra&#8208;Long Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence for Time&#8208;Resolved Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new zero&#8208;dimensional Zn&#8208;based metal halide with ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is reported. The RTP lifetimes can be facilely regulated via halide engineering, paving the way for designing spatial&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.







Abstract
Though fluorescence&#8208;tag&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology has distinguished itself with cost&#8208;effective features and huge information loading capacity, the clonable decryption process of spatial&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting cannot meet the requirements for high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Herein, we demonstrate a spatial&#8208;time&#8208;dual&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting system based on new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halides BAPPZn2(ClyBr1&#8722;y)8 (BAPP=1,4&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ammoniopropyl)piperazinium, y=0&#8211;1) with ultra&#8208;long room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP). Remarkably, the afterglow lifetime can be facilely tuned by regulating the halide&#8208;induced heavy&#8208;atom effect and can be identified by the naked eyes or with the help of a simple machine vision system. Therefore, the short&#8208;lived unicolor fluorescence and lasting&#8208;time&#8208;tunable RTP provide the prerequisites for unicolor&#8208;time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting, which lowers the decryption&#8208;device requirements and further provides the design strategy of advanced portable anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology.

         <title>Biomacromolecule&#8208;Fueled Transient Volume Phase Transition of a Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial materials that perform work under out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions have attracted significant attention. A metabolic cycle&#8208;inspired hydrogel which exhibits the biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled transient volume phase transition was developed. The hydrogel was prepared by introducing two inherently connected functions that are affinity and digestive capacity for fuel. The system could also be exploited to realize the fuel&#8208;stimulated transient release of the payload.







Abstract
A metabolic cycle&#8208;inspired hydrogel which exhibits the biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled transient volume phase transition is reported. This hydrogel has the affinity and digestive capacity for a fuel &#945;&#8208;poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine by incorporating acrylic acid and trypsin. The hydrogel captured fuel and transiently shrank owing to the construction of electrostatic cross&#8208;linkages. This process was inherently connected with the digestion of these cross&#8208;linkages and the release of oligo&#8208;lysine as waste, which induced the reswelling of the hydrogel at equilibrium. The transient volume change of the hydrogel realized the fuel&#8208;stimulated transient release of a payload. This study provides a strategy for engineering materials with biomacromolecule&#8208;fueled dynamic functions under the out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium condition.

         <title>Capture of Hydroxyl Radicals by Hydronium Cations in Water Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The observation and capture of hydroxyl radicals spontaneously generated at the air&#8211;water interface of water microdroplets in the form of OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+ is reported.







Abstract
Despite the high stability of bulk water, water microdroplets possess strikingly different properties, such as the presence of hydroxyl radicals (OH&#8901;) at the air&#8211;water interface. Previous studies exhibited the recombination of OH&#8901; into H2O2 molecules and the capture of OH&#8901; by oxidizing other molecules. By spraying pure water microdroplets into a mass spectrometer, we detected OH&#8901; in the form of (H4O2)+ that is essentially OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+, a hydroxyl radical combined with a hydronium cation through hydrogen bonding. We also successfully captured it with two OH&#8901; scavengers, caffeine and melatonin, and key oxidation radical intermediates that bear important mechanistic information were seen. It is suggested that some previous reactions involving (H4O2)+ should be attributed to reactions with OH&#8901;&#8722;H3O+ rather than with the water dimer cation (H2O&#8722;OH2)+.

It is suggested that some previous reactions involving (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; should be attributed to reactions with OH&#8901;&#8722;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rather than with the water dimer cation (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Oxazine&#8208;Based Fluorogenic Probe with Changeable &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Eliminate False&#8208;Positive Interference of Albumin and Its Application to Sensing Aminopeptidase&#8197;N</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe with a changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugated system for sensing the enzyme aminopeptidase N was developed, which effectively eliminated the false&#8208;positive interference of albumin. The probe was used to detect the enzyme in cells, human serum and the mouse urine without the influence of albumin.







Abstract
Many fluorophores/probes suffer from the interference of albumin in biosystems. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to overcome this interference by virtue of both an albumin&#8208;insensitive fluorophore and its changeable &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and demonstrate the strategy by designing an oxazine&#8208;based fluorogenic probe for aminopeptidase&#8197;N (APN). The modification on the N atom in the oxazine fluorophore with alanine through a cleavable linker locks the resulting probe in a non&#8208;conjugated, colorless and non&#8208;fluorescent state, so the non&#8208;specific interaction of albumin produces no spectroscopic response. APN can selectively cleave the alanine moiety, restoring the large &#960;&#8208;conjugation and strong fluorescence. The capability of the probe to eliminate the albumin influence has been demonstrated by imaging APN in different cell lines, and by quantitatively determining APN in human serum and mouse urine. The present strategy may be useful for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.

         <title>Photouncaging of Carboxylic Acids from Cyanine Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared Light
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocages based on cyanine dyes that are accessible on multigram scale enable the efficient delivery and release of carboxylic acids in live cells using tissue&#8208;penetrating near&#8208;infrared light. The photouncaging process was examined by using several techniques, with the findings suggesting a photooxidative pathway.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared light (NIR; 650&#8211;900&#8197;nm) offers unparalleled advantages as a biocompatible stimulus. The development of photocages that operate in this region represents a fundamental challenge due to the low energy of the excitation light. Herein, we repurpose cyanine dyes into photocages that are available on a multigram scale in three steps and efficiently release carboxylic acids in aqueous media upon irradiation with NIR light up to 820&#8197;nm. The photouncaging process is examined using several techniques, providing evidence that it proceeds via photooxidative pathway. We demonstrate the practical utility in live HeLa cells by delivery and release of the carboxylic acid cargo, that was otherwise not uptaken by cells in its free form. In combination with modularity of the cyanine scaffold, the realization of these accessible photocages will fully unleash the potential of the emerging field of NIR&#8208;photoactivation and facilitate its widespread adoption outside the photochemistry community.

         <title>Selective Reduction of Secondary Amides to Imines Catalysed by Schwartz's Reagent
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 33, August 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mild and selective catalytic reduction of secondary amides to imines was achieved using the classical organometallic reagent Cp2Zr(H)Cl (Schwartz's reagent) as a catalyst. This approach avoids overreduction of the imines to amines and utilises hydrosilanes to enable catalyst turnover and control the reactivity.







Abstract
The partial reduction of amides is a challenging transformation that must overcome the intrinsic stability of the amide bond and exhibit high chemoselective control to avoid overreduction to amine products. To address this challenge, we describe a zirconium&#8208;catalysed synthesis of imines by the reductive deoxygenation of secondary amides. This reaction exploits the excellent chemoselectivity of Schwartz's reagent (Cp2Zr(H)Cl) and utilises (EtO)3SiH as a mild stoichiometric reductant to enable catalyst turnover. The reaction generally proceeds with high yields (19 examples, 51 to 95&#8201;% yield) and tolerates a variety of functional groups (alkene, ester, nitro, etc.). Stoichiometric mechanistic investigations suggest the regeneration of the active [Zr]&#8722;H catalyst is achieved through the metathesis of Si&#8722;H and Zr&#8722;OR &#963;&#8208;bonds.

         <title>In Situ Periodic Regeneration of Catalyst during CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to maintain the high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction towards C2+ products over a copper catalyst. A positive potential pulse is applied periodically for a short time in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. As a result the surface structure and oxidation state of the Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method.







Abstract
Developing electrocatalytic reactions with high&#8208;efficiency can make important contributions to carbon neutrality. However, poor long&#8208;term stability of catalysts is a bottleneck for its practical application. Herein, an &#8220;in situ periodic regeneration of catalyst (PR&#8208;C)&#8221; strategy is proposed to give long&#8208;term high efficiency of CO2 electroreduction to generate C2+ products over Cu catalyst by applying a positive potential pulse for a short time periodically in the halide&#8208;containing electrolyte. The high Faradaic efficiency (81.2&#8201;%) and current density (22.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) could be maintained completely at least 36&#8197;h, while the activity and selectivity decreased continuously without using the PR&#8208;C method. Control experiments and operando characterization demonstrated that the surface structure and oxidation state of Cu could be recovered periodically by the PR&#8208;C method, which was beneficial for CO2 activation and C&#8722;C coupling.

         <dc:description>
A novel germinal N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline 1 degrades white phosphorus (P4) furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208; diphosphapyrrole 2. The latter further reacts readily with P4 and 1 to afford the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing species 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4 depending on the molar ratio of the reactants. Moreover, the products 3 and 4 can be converted into each other when treated with 1 and P4, respectively.







Abstract
White phosphorus (P4) undergoes degradation to P2 moieties if exposed to the new N,N&#8208;bis(silylenyl)aniline PhNSi2 1 (Si=Si[N(tBu)]2CPh), furnishing the first isolable 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole 2 and the two novel functionalized Si=P doubly bonded compounds 3 and 4. The pathways for the transformation of the non&#8208;aromatic 2,5&#8208;disila&#8208;3,4&#8208;diphosphapyrrole PhNSi2P2 2 into 3 and 4 could be uncovered. It became evident that 2 reacts readily with both reactants P4 and 1 to afford either the polycyclic Si=P&#8208;containing product [PhNSi2P2]2P2 3 or the unprecedented conjugated Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8722;Si=NPh chain&#8208;containing compound 4, depending on the employed molar ratio of 1 and P4 as well as the reaction conditions. Compounds 3 and 4 can be converted into each other by reactions with 1 and P4, respectively. All new compounds 1&#8211;4 were unequivocally characterized including by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In addition, the electronic structures of 2&#8211;4 were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Poly(phthalocyanine) Scaffolds Derived from a Mechanochemical Approach Towards Enhanced Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemistry&#8208;driven approach was developed to afford fully conjugated poly(phthalocyanine (Pc)) scaffolds under neat and ambient conditions, by leveraging the on&#8208;surface polymerization of ortho&#8208;positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts. The as&#8208;afforded scaffolds were featured by fully conjugated skeleton, abundant Pc linkages, and permanent porosity, providing them with attractive performance in energy storage.







Abstract
Phthalocyanines (Pc)&#8208;derived materials represent an attractive category of porous organic scaffolds featured by extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugated networks, but their construction is still limited to the solution&#8208;based pathways, producing materials with inferior conductivity and porosity. Herein, a mechanochemistry&#8208;driven approach was developed leveraging the on&#8208;surface polymerization of aromatic nitrile monomers with ortho&#8208;positioned dicyano groups in the presence of metal catalysts (magnesium, zinc, or aluminum) under neat and ambient conditions. Diverse Pc&#8208;functionalized conjugated porous networks (Pc&#8208;CPNs) were obtained featured by extensively and fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeletons, high surface areas, and hierarchical porosities. The monomers in this mechanochemical approach could be extended to those difficult to be handled in solution&#8208;based procedures. The Pc&#8208;CPNs displayed attractive electrochemical performance as supercapacitor and anodes in batteries, together with superb long&#8208;term stability.

A CuI&#8208;phosphine catalytic system activates 1,1&#8208;diborylalkenes stereoselectively. The energetically preferred formation of (Z)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;borylalkenyl copper (I) species and the subsequent coupling reaction with allyl bromides allow the exclusive formation of (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes. This new methodology is applicable to various 1,1&#8208;di(pinacolboryl)alkenes which can be efficiently coupled with different type of allyl halides. The (Z)&#8208;skipped dienes with bromide functionality are treated with NaOtBu to promote cyclization/aromatization patterns via enyne intermediates.

         <title>Chemical Investigations of Differentially Oxidized Polycylic Pyrroles from Bipolaris Fungi: Synthetic Entry Into the Bipolamine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial alkaloids from Bipolaris Fungi represent notable challenges to the field of chemical synthesis owing to their reactive, electron&#8208;rich bispyrrole architectures. Herein we explore the chemical reactivity of this unusual alkaloid framework resulting in the total synthesis of bipolamines D, E, G, and I and a discussion surrounding possible biosynthetic relationships within this family.







Abstract
indolizidine alkaloids of unusual biosynthetic origin have recently been characterized from several species of fungi within the Pleosporaceae family. Possessing distinct polycyclic architectures with two embedded electron&#8208;rich pyrroles as well as reported antibacterial activity against gram positive and negative pathogens, these natural products represent attractive targets for total synthesis. Herein we survey the differential functionalization of a chemically sensitive bispyrrole framework resulting in the preparation of multiple bipolamine alkaloids, work which sheds light on their innate chemical reactivity and potential biosynthetic relationships.

Herein we explore the chemical reactivity of this unusual alkaloid framework resulting in the total synthesis of bipolamines D, E, G, and I and a discussion surrounding possible biosynthetic relationships within this family.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;indolizidine alkaloids of unusual biosynthetic origin have recently been characterized from several species of fungi within the Pleosporaceae family. Possessing distinct polycyclic architectures with two embedded electron-rich pyrroles as well as reported antibacterial activity against gram positive and negative pathogens, these natural products represent attractive targets for total synthesis. Herein we survey the differential functionalization of a chemically sensitive bispyrrole framework resulting in the preparation of multiple bipolamine alkaloids, work which sheds light on their innate chemical reactivity and potential biosynthetic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Activate the In&#8197;Situ Synthesis of Trimethine Cyanines in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trimethine cyanines are synthesized from precursors, assisted by visible light, free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS). The reaction can proceed in&#8197;situ in live cells. The correlation of cyanine expression with the intrinsic cellular ROS production level causes more efficient cyanine production in the cancer cells. The study bridges ROS&#8208;activated in&#8208;cell synthetic chemistry and cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Environment&#8208;responsive in situ synthesis of molecular fluorescent dyes is challenging. Herein, we develop a photoextension strategy to make trimethine cyanines with decent conversion efficiency (up to 81&#8201;%) using 1&#8208;butyl 2,3,3&#8208;trimethyl 3H&#8208;indole derivatives as the sole precursors, and demonstrate a free radical mechanism. In the inducer&#8208;extension stage, free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were able to mediate similar reactions with no assistance of light. We explored a Mito&#8208;extension strategy to in situ synthesize trimethine cyanines in the living cells. The cellular ROS&#8208;dependence provided a foundation for preferential cyanine expression in cancer cells. Finally, we applied an iodized precursor as an intrinsic ROS&#8208;activated theranostic agent that integrated mitochondria&#8208;targeted cyanine synthesis, cell imaging and phototherapy.

         <title>Pincer&#8208;Supported Perfluororhodacyclopentanes: High Nucleophilicity of the M&#8722;CF Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by a PBP&#8208;pincer ligand was synthesized. The Rh&#8722;CF bond showed high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis thanks to the strong &#963;&#8208;donation from the boryl group.







Abstract
Perfluororhodacyclopentane supported by PBP pincer ligand PBP&#8208;RhIII(CF2)4 (2) was prepared from PBP&#8208;RhI&#8208;PPh3 (1) and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). By scXRD analysis, it was revealed that the Rh&#8722;CF bond trans to the boryl ligand was largely elongated compared to the one in the apical position. Although M&#8722;CF bonds of perfluorometallacyclopentanes are known to be very stable, 2 shows high reactivity toward hydrogenolysis, iodinolysis and protonolysis, thanks to the strong trans&#8208;effect of the highly &#963;&#8208;donating boryl ligand. Analogous PCP pincer complex PCP&#8722;RhIII(CF2)4 (4) showed slower reaction rate both in oxidative cyclization with TFE and hydrogenolysis of Rh&#8722;CF bond. Catalytic production of 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4&#8208;octafluorobutane from two TFE and hydrogen in one pot was achieved via repetitive oxidative cyclization of TFE and Rh followed by the hydrogenolysis of Rh&#8722;CF bonds. This report demonstrates the possible application of PBP&#8208;pincer skeleton to the preparation of fluorinated compounds from TFE.

         <title>Multifunctional Charge and Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Effects of Second&#8208;Sphere Imidazolium Pendants Promote Capture and Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Water Catalyzed by Iron Porphyrins
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants enable the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from through&#8208;space charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Charge effects are the dominant contributor to observed improvements in CO2 conversion with hydrogen bonding effects augmenting CO2 capture affinity, resulting effective homogeneous electrocatalytic CO2RR in water.







Abstract
Microenvironments tailored by multifunctional secondary coordination sphere groups can enhance catalytic performance at primary metal active sites in natural systems. Here, we capture this biological concept in synthetic systems by developing a family of iron porphyrins decorated with imidazolium (im) pendants for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which promotes multiple synergistic effects to enhance CO2RR and enables the disentangling of second&#8208;sphere contributions that stem from each type of interaction. Fe&#8208;ortho&#8208;im(H), which poises imidazolium units featuring both positive charge and hydrogen&#8208;bond capabilities proximal to the active iron center, increases CO2 binding affinity by 25&#8208;fold and CO2RR activity by 2000&#8208;fold relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (Fe&#8208;TPP). Comparison with monofunctional analogs reveals that through&#8208;space charge effects have a greater impact on catalytic CO2RR performance compared to hydrogen bonding in this context.

Ab&#8197;initio molecular dynamics simulations of the aqueous electron in various thermodynamic conditions at the accuracy of hybrid functional electronic structure theory. This work reveals that the red shift of the absorption maximum results from an increasing gyration radius with temperature.







Abstract
The temperature&#8208;dependent properties of the aqueous electron have been extensively studied using mixed quantum&#8208;classical simulations in a wide range of thermodynamic conditions based on one&#8208;electron pseudopotentials. While the cavity model appears to explain most of the physical properties of the aqueous electron, only a non&#8208;cavity model has so far been successful in accounting for the temperature dependence of the absorption spectrum. Here, we present an accurate and efficient description of the aqueous electron under various thermodynamic conditions by combining hybrid functional&#8208;based molecular dynamics, machine learning techniques, and multiple time&#8208;step methods. Our advanced simulations accurately describe the temperature dependence of the absorption maximum in the presence of cavity formation. Specifically, our work reveals that the red shift of the absorption maximum results from an increasing gyration radius with temperature, rather than from global density variations as previously suggested.

         <title>An Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)&#8208;Targeting DNA Nanodevice for Autophagy&#8208;Dependent Degradation of Proteins in Membrane&#8208;Bound Organelles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new targeted protein degradation (TPD) system composed of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeting DNA nanostructure carrying protein binding ligands is developed for proteins in membrane&#8208;bound organelles. It works with the guidance of artificial membrane receptors. The targeted proteins in ERs are degraded via an autophagy&#8208;dependent pathway. This nanosystem compensates the deficiency of current TPD strategies and may contribute to future cancer therapeutics.







Abstract
Targeted protein degradation via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways is a promising therapeutic approach, and proteins in cytoplasm or on the cell membrane can be easily contacted and have become the major targets. However, degradation of disease&#8208;related proteins that exist in membrane&#8208;bound organelles (MBO) such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains unsolved due to the membrane limits. Here we describe a DNA nanodevice that shows ER targeting capacity and undergoes new intracellular degradation via the autophagy&#8208;dependent pathway. Then the DNA nanostructure functionalized with specific ligands is used to selectively catch ER&#8208;localized proteins and then transport them to the lysosome for degradation. Through this technique, the degradation of both exogenous ER&#8208;resident protein (ER&#8208;eGFP) and endogenous overexpressed molecular chaperone (glucose&#8208;regulated protein 78) in cancer cells has been successfully executed with high efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;A new targeted protein degradation (TPD) system composed of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting DNA nanostructure carrying protein binding ligands is developed for proteins in membrane-bound organelles. It works with the guidance of artificial membrane receptors. The targeted proteins in ERs are degraded via an autophagy-dependent pathway. This nanosystem compensates the deficiency of current TPD strategies and may contribute to future cancer therapeutics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted protein degradation via proteasomal and lysosomal pathways is a promising therapeutic approach, and proteins in cytoplasm or on the cell membrane can be easily contacted and have become the major targets. However, degradation of disease-related proteins that exist in membrane-bound organelles (MBO) such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remains unsolved due to the membrane limits. Here we describe a DNA nanodevice that shows ER targeting capacity and undergoes new intracellular degradation via the autophagy-dependent pathway. Then the DNA nanostructure functionalized with specific ligands is used to selectively catch ER-localized proteins and then transport them to the lysosome for degradation. Through this technique, the degradation of both exogenous ER-resident protein (ER-eGFP) and endogenous overexpressed molecular chaperone (glucose-regulated protein 78) in cancer cells has been successfully executed with high efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Homologous and Heterologous Chiral Supramolecular Polymerization from Exclusively Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achiral C3&#8208;symmetric monomers have been used to build chiral supramolecular polymer architectures by a symmetry&#8208;breaking process in a vortex. Subsequently, the polymers can take the role of chiral seeds to control the ensuing homologous or heterologous chiral supramolecular polymerization.







Abstract
Among the enticing issues of chiral origins are: how chirality is born from the initial achiral units and the mechanisms for the transfer of chiral information. In this work, by combining a physical vortex and chiral seeds, a general process is revealed to generate chiral supramolecular polymers from achiral C3&#8208;symmetric molecules. The symmetry&#8208;broken assemblies from the achiral molecules could work as chiral seeds to initiate the polymerization of either homologous or heterologous achiral monomers. Concomitantly, the fragmentation of the polymer caused by the vortex during the nucleation&#8208;elongation stages is shown to enlarge the domains of the chiral nuclei and then guide the polymer to grow into the predominant helicity with a high reactivity ratio. Moreover, the chiral structural information can be stored in different forms of assemblies. These new polymerization modes will provide guidance for the preparation of chiral materials.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization and C&#8722;C Bond Activation to Access Non&#8208;canonical Tricyclic Cyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic Fe&#8722;NO complex catalyses the cycloisomerization of cyclopropyl enyne to fused non&#8208;canonical cyclobutanes with up to four consecutive stereocenters with exclusive diastereoselectivity. Only Ag(+I)&#8208;was found to show comparable activity, albeit significantly lower reactivity.







Abstract
Cycloisomerizations are powerful skeletal rearrangements that allow the construction of complex molecular architectures in an atom&#8208;economic way. We present here an unusual type of cyclopropyl enyne cycloisomerization that couples the process of a cycloisomerization with the activation of a C&#8722;C bond in cyclopropanes. A set of substituted non&#8208;canonical tricyclic cyclobutanes were synthesized under mild conditions using [(Ph3P)2Fe(CO)(NO)]BF4 as catalyst in good to excellent yields with high levels of stereocontrol.

The synthesis of a silyliumylidene cation complex stabilized by a Ni0&#8208;based donating ligand is reported. Experimental and theoretical studies demonstrate that the highly electrophilic SiII center is stabilized by a dative Ni&#8594;Si &#963;&#8208;interaction and &#960;&#8208;donations from the amino&#8208; and Ni&#8208;moieties. Due to the energetically close frontier orbitals localized on Si and Ni atoms, this silyliumylidene complex presents competitive reactivity at Si and Ni sites.

This paper describes the use of a cyclopropene&#8208;containing oleic acid analogue for studying live cell lipid uptake by dendritic cells. The minimal oleic acid analogue is incorporated into membranes and lipoproteins, which can be studied by live cell microscopy and lipoproteomics.







Abstract
In the field of lipid research, bioorthogonal chemistry has made the study of lipid uptake and processing in living systems possible, whilst minimising biological properties arising from detectable pendant groups. To allow the study of unsaturated free fatty acids in live cells, we here report the use of sterculic acid, a 1,2&#8208;cyclopropene&#8208;containing oleic acid analogue, as a bioorthogonal probe. We show that this lipid can be readily taken up by dendritic cells without toxic side effects, and that it can subsequently be visualised using an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with quenched tetrazine&#8208;fluorophore conjugates. In addition, the lipid can be used to identify changes in protein oleoylation after immune cell activation. Finally, this reaction can be integrated into a multiplexed bioorthogonal reaction workflow by combining it with two sequential copper&#8208;catalysed Huisgen ligation reactions. This allows for the study of multiple biomolecules in the cell simultaneously by multimodal confocal imaging.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of Functionalized Quinolines by Direct Conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of quinolines synthesis from a major lignin motif by a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported in yields of up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction path involves selective C&#8722;O bond cleavage, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, and C&#8722;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. This transformation provides a new example for the application of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 segments in the construction of N&#8208;heterocyclic aromatic compounds, thus offering a petroleum&#8208;independent path to heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.







Abstract
Direct production of heterocyclic aromatic compounds from lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 models remains a huge challenge due to the incompatible catalysis for aryl ether bonds cleavage and heterocyclic ring formation. Herein, the first example of quinoline synthesis from &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds by a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction is reported in yields up to 89&#8201;%. The reaction pathway involves selective cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, C&#8722;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. The control experiments suggest that both imine and chalcone were identified as the key intermediates, and the rate determining step as well as the preferred pathway were experimentally clarified and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on this protocol, the conversion of &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 polymer delivered 56&#8197;wt&#8201;% yield of quinoline derivative in three steps. This transformation provides a potential petroleum&#8208;independent choice for heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.

The reaction pathway involves selective cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds, dehydrogenation, aldol condensation, C&#8722;N bond formation along with heterocyclic aromatic ring construction. The control experiments suggest that both imine and chalcone were identified as the key intermediates, and the rate determining step as well as the preferred pathway were experimentally clarified and supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on this protocol, the conversion of &#946;-O-4 polymer delivered 56&#8197;wt&#8201;% yield of quinoline derivative in three steps. This transformation provides a potential petroleum-independent choice for heterocyclic aromatic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Chemistry with Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents: A Fad or the Future?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) continue to generate interest within and beyond the chemistry community. Their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions for sustainable chemistry. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) debuted with a promise of a superior sustainability footprint due to their low vapor pressure. However, their toxicity and high cost compromise this footprint, impeding their real&#8208;world applications. Fortunately, their property tunability through a rational selection of precursors, including bioderived ones, provides a strategy to ameliorate toxicity, lower cost, and endow new functions. This Review discusses whether ILs and DESs are sustainable solvents and how they contribute to sustainable chemical processes.

         <title>Thermochromic Phosphors Based on One&#8208;Dimensional Ionic Copper&#8208;Iodine Chains Showing Solid&#8208;State Photoluminescence Efficiency Exceeding 99&#8201;%</title>

A novel thermochromic 1D&#8208;Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208; ethylpyridinium)2 hybrid phosphor with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency is reported involving a mechanism of reversible single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation induced bytemperature&#8208;responsive concerted Cu atom migration in ionic copper&#8208;iodine chains .







Abstract
Thermochromic phosphors are intriguing materials for realizing thermochromic behaviors of light&#8208;emitting diodes. Here a highly luminescent and stable thermochromic phosphor based on one&#8208;dimensional Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 is reported. This unique ionic copper&#8208;iodine chain&#8208;based hybrid exhibits near&#8208;unity photoluminescence efficiency owing to the through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer character of relevant electronic transitions. More importantly, an alternative mechanism of thermochromic phosphorescence was unraveled, supported by a first principles simulation of concerted copper atom migration in the copper&#8208;iodine chain. Furthermore, we successfully fabricate a bright thermochromic light&#8208;emitting diode using this Cu4I6(4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;1&#8208;ethylpyridinium)2 thermochromic phosphor. Our reported flexible ionic copper&#8208;iodine chain&#8208;based thermochromic luminescent material represents a new type of cost&#8208;effective functional phosphor.

         <title>Stable Monodisperse Pb1&#8722;xCdxS Quantum Dots for NIR&#8208;II Bioimaging by Aqueous Coprecipitation of Bimetallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly monodisperse and stable Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs are prepared by a simple aqueous method with Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 clusters as building blocks. They emit at 1100&#8197;nm in the NIR&#8208;II window with 17.72&#8201;% PLQY in water. Fine lymphography, angiography and dual&#8208;channel bioimaging at low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) excitation can be successfully achieved by using these ternary QDs. The excellent stability makes this material very competitive in practical applications.







Abstract
Aqueous lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots (QDs) synthesized by traditional methods are unstable, so that they are usually coated with cadmium sulfide (CdS) to prevent oxidation, which are complicated and not satisfactory for mass production. Here, stable ternary Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs were synthesized by in situ coprecipitation of Pb4&#8722;nCdnO4 bimetallic clusters in an aqueous solution, which possess a uniform size of 4.0&#177;0.2&#8197;nm and the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission at 1100&#8197;nm with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 17.72&#8201;%. Stored at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in colloidal form, the PLQY of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs remained at 90.9&#8201;% of the initial value after 15&#8197;days, while stored as powder, the spectra did not change after 5&#8197;months. The high PLQY and good water compatibility of Pb1&#8722;xCdxS QDs provide a good performance in vivo vasculature imaging and lymphatic system imaging at a very low power density (10&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in the NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Sp&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen as New Anchoring Sites of Iron Single Atoms to Boost the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the specific structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an atomic Fe catalyst anchored by sp&#8208;N was designed and synthesized, which tailored the electronic structure of Fe and thus changed the binding energy between Fe centers and intermediate species in the ORR process. The as&#8208;synthesized catalyst (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY) exhibited excellent oxygen reduction performance and achieved long&#8208;term stability in the assembled zinc&#8211;air battery.







Abstract
Carbon supported single&#8208;atom catalysts with metal&#8208;Nx configuration are considered as one of the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, most of the metal&#8208;Nx active sites are composed by pyridinic N at the defect locations of graphene&#8208;like supports. Here, we employ graphdiyne (GDY) as a new carbon substrate to synthesize an iron (Fe) single atom catalyst (Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY), showing excellent catalytic performance. Benefitting from the abundant acetylenic bonds in GDY, sp&#8208;N anchored metal atoms are created without forming defects. The sp&#8208;N and OH ligands regulate the electronic structure of Fe atoms and optimize the adsorption energy of ORR intermediates on the active sites by reducing the electron local density of Fe atoms, which accelerates the reaction kinetics and promotes the ORR activity of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY. Furthermore, the practical application of Fe&#8722;N&#8722;GDY is corroborated by its high power density and long&#8208;term performance via assembling a zinc&#8211;air battery.

         <title>Thiol&#8208;Disulfide Exchange as a Route for Endosomal Escape of Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric nanogels with judiciously placed disulfide bonds have been synthesized and tested for cellular uptake and endosomal escape. Comparison with their non&#8208;disulfide counterparts show that disulfide moieties play a key role in endosomal escape.







Abstract
Endosomal entrapment has remained the major bottleneck for cytosolic delivery of nanoparticle&#8208;based delivery systems. Uncovering fundamentally new pathways for endosomal escape is therefore highly sought. Herein, we report that disulfide bonds can enhance endosomal escape through contacts with cellular exofacial thiols, in addition to facilitating cellular uptake. Our results are supported through comparative analysis of polymeric nanogels with variable accessibility to disulfide bonds by placing these functionalities at the core or the shell of the nanogels. The findings here inform future chemical design of delivery vehicles.

         <title>The Heaviest Bottleable Metallylone: Synthesis of a Monatomic, Zero&#8208;Valent Lead Complex (&#8220;Plumbylone&#8221;)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elusive plumbylone {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0} stabilized by a bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0Fe(CO)4} are reported. The latter can insert the PbFe(CO)4 moiety into a Rh&#8722;Cl bond to give a RhPbClFe(CO)4 complex.







Abstract
The elusive plumbylone {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0} 3 stabilized by the bis(silylene)xanthene chelating ligand 1, [SiII(Xant)SiII=PhC(NtBu)2Si(Xant)Si(NtBu)2CPh], and its isolable carbonyl iron complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Pb0Fe(CO)4} 4 are reported. The compounds 3 and 4 were obtained stepwise via reduction of the lead(II) dibromide complex {[SiII(Xant)SiII]PbBr2} 2, prepared from the bis(silylene)xanthene 1 and PbBr2, employing potassium naphthalenide and K2Fe(CO)4, respectively. While the genuine plumbylone 3 is rather labile even at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, its Pb0&#8594;Fe(CO)4 complex 4 turned out to be relatively stable and bottleable. However, solutions of 4 decompose readily to elemental Pb and {[SiII(Xant)SiII]Fe(CO)3} 5 at 80&#8201;&#176;C. Reaction of 4 with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 leads to the formation of the unusual dimeric [(OC)2RhPb(Cl)Fe(CO)4] complex 6 with trimetallic Rh&#8722;Pb&#8722;Fe bonds. The molecular and electronic structures of 3 and 4 were established by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Constructing Interfacial Boron&#8208;Nitrogen Moieties in Turbostratic Carbon for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations is fabricated by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid, which is directly applied for HO2&#8722; synthesis in alkaline media through an O2 reduction reaction. Based on the combined spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical measurements, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established.







Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) provides a green route for decentralized H2O2 synthesis, where a structure&#8211;selectivity relationship is pivotal for the control of a highly selective and active two&#8208;electron pathway. Here, we report the fabrication of a boron and nitrogen co&#8208;doped turbostratic carbon catalyst with tunable B&#8722;N&#8722;C configurations (CNB&#8208;ZIL) by the assistance of a zwitterionic liquid (ZIL) for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production. Combined spectroscopic analysis reveals a fine tailored B&#8722;N moiety in CNB&#8208;ZIL, where interfacial B&#8722;N species in a homogeneous distribution tend to segregate into hexagonal boron nitride domains at higher pyrolysis temperatures. Based on the experimental observations, a correlation between the interfacial B&#8722;N moieties and HO2&#8722; selectivity is established. The CNB&#8208;ZIL electrocatalysts with optimal interfacial B&#8722;N moieties exhibit a high HO2&#8722; selectivity with small overpotentials in alkaline media, giving a HO2&#8722; yield of &#8776;1787&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.

         <title>A Cathode Interface Layer Based on 4,5,9,10&#8208;Pyrene Diimide for Highly Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three novel self&#8208;doped molecules named t&#8208;PyDIN, t&#8208;PyDINO and t&#8208;PyDINBr are developed as cathode interfacial materials for OSCs. The devices based on t&#8208;PyDINBr and t&#8208;PyDINO exhibit PCEs of 17.24&#8201;% and 17.56&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the device based on t&#8208;PyDIN even reached a PCE of 18.25&#8201;%, which is improved by 51.3&#8201;% compared with that of the device without a cathode interfacial layer. This result is among the best efficiencies reported to date.







Abstract
Efficient cathode interfacial layers (CILs) are becoming essential elements for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the absorption of commonly used cathode interfacial materials (CIMs) is either too weak or overlaps too much with that of photoactive materials, hindering their contribution to the light absorption. In this work, we demonstrate the construction of highly efficient CIMs based on 2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;pyrene diimide (t&#8208;PyDI) framework. By introducing amino, amino N&#8208;oxide and quaternary ammonium bromide as functional groups, three novel self&#8208;doped CIMs named t&#8208;PyDIN, t&#8208;PyDINO and t&#8208;PyDINBr are synthesized. These CIMs are capable of boosting the device performances by broadening the absorption, forming ohmic contact at the interface of active layer and electrode, as well as facilitating electron collection. Notably, the device based on t&#8208;PyDIN achieved a power conversion efficiency of 18.25&#8201;%, which is among the top efficiencies reported to date in binary OSCs.

         <title>Periphery&#8208;Core Strategy to Access a Bowl&#8208;Shaped Molecule Bearing Multiple Heteroatoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bowl&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with up to four sulfur atoms and two embedded B&#8722;N bonds has been synthesized by a periphery&#8208;core strategy, whereby the bottom of the bowl is closed in the final step. The incorporation of sulfur and nitrogen atoms enriches the electronic density of the buckybowl and results in a strong intermolecular interaction with C60 fullerene.







Abstract
Most of the bowl&#8208;shaped molecules are synthesized via a core&#8208;periphery strategy with the bowl rim closed at the final stage. However, the construction of heteroatom&#8208;doped buckybowls by the periphery&#8208;core method with the bowl bottom sealed by inserting new atoms in the last step is quite limited. Herein we report the synthesis of a bowl&#8208;shaped compound containing four sulfur atoms and two embedded N&#8722;B bonds with the ratio of carbon atom and heteroatom as low as four through a periphery&#8208;core strategy. Crystallographic analysis confirms the formation of a bowl&#8208;shaped structure. The multiple heteroatoms alter the molecular electronic structure, thus resulting in the distinct aromaticity when compared with its all&#8208;carbon congener. The electron&#8208;rich buckybowl shows a strong interaction with the electron&#8208;deficient fullerene C60 by forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex in toluene.

         <title>A Ratiometric Photoacoustic Probe with a Reversible Response to Hydrogen Sulfide and Hydroxyl Radicals for Dynamic Imaging of Liver Inflammation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe is designed, which shows a reversible switch in the PA ratio (PA690/PA825) in response to the redox cycle between &#8901;OH and H2S. The probe allows the non&#8208;invasive and dynamic imaging of the redox fluctuation in mice during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation and the subsequent N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;inflammation process.







Abstract
Reversible imaging probes that allow for the dynamic visualization of the redox cycle between hydroxyl radical (&#8901;OH) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are vital to probe the redox imbalance&#8208;involved pathological process in vivo. Herein, we report a reversible ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) imaging nanoprobe (1&#8208;PAIN) for the real&#8208;time imaging of &#8901;OH/H2S redox cycle in vivo. 1&#8208;PAIN displays a low PA ratio between 690 and 825&#8197;nm (PA690/PA825), which significantly increases by &#8776;5&#8208;fold upon oxidation by &#8901;OH, and is switched back to the initially low PA690/PA825 value upon reduction by H2S. 1&#8208;PAIN could dynamically report on the hepatic &#8901;OH production in mice during the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced liver inflammation process, and visualize hepatic H2S generation during the N&#8208;acetyl cysteine (NAC)&#8208;induced anti&#8208;inflammation process. 1&#8208;PAIN can act as a useful tool to probe the redox state in living biology, beneficial for the study of redox imbalance&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>3D Printed CO2&#8208;Based Triblock Copolymers and Post&#8208;Printing Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable CO2&#8208;based triblock polycarbonates with tailored thermal and mechanical properties were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy. By dispersing NaCl particles in polymer solutions, thixotropic inks can be formulated and 3D printed. Subsequent removal of the filler yields porous structures. The alkene pendant groups on the polymer backbone can be further modified via UV&#8208; induced thiol&#8208;ene surface functionalization and crosslinking.







Abstract
We report the facile synthesis and 3D printing of a series of triblock copolymers consisting of soft and hard blocks and demonstrate that alkene pendant groups of the hard block can be covalently modified. The polymers are prepared using a salenCo(III)TFA/PPNTFA binary catalyst system and 1,2&#8208;propanediol as a chain transfer agent, providing an efficient one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy to tailor polymer thermal and mechanical properties. Thixotropic inks suitable for direct ink write printing were formulated by dissolving the block copolymers in organic solvent and dispersing NaCl particles. After printing, porous structures were produced by removing solvent and NaCl with water to give printed structures with surfaces that could be modified via UV&#8208;initiated thiol&#8208;ene click reactions. Alternatively, a tetra&#8208;thiol could be incorporated into the ink and used for cross&#8208;linking to give objects with high solvent resistance and selective degradability.

         <title>A Desilylative Approach to Alkyl Substituted C(1)&#8208;Ammonium Enolates: Application in Enantioselective [2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic generation of unsubstituted and alkyl substituted C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted carboxylic acids using the isothiourea HyperBTM has been developed and applied in enantioselective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions.







Abstract
The catalytic generation of C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates from the corresponding &#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted carboxylic acids using the isothiourea HyperBTM is reported. This desilylative approach grants access to &#945;&#8208;unsubstituted and &#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted C(1)&#8208;ammonium enolates, which are typically difficult to access through traditional methods reliant upon deprotonation. The scope and limitations of this process is established in enantioselective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition processes with perfluoroalkylketones (31 examples, up to 96&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er), as well as selective [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition with trifluoromethyl enones (4 examples, up to 75&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er). Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate this process proceeds through an initial kinetic resolution of an in situ prepared (&#177;)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;silyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;alkyl substituted anhydride, while the reaction process exhibits overall pseudo zero&#8208;order kinetics.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable templated polymerization is reported by Bas&#8197;G.&#8197;P. van&#8197;Ravensteijn, Ilja&#8197;K. Voets et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202206780), as illustrated in the cover picture. The green and grey sections represent the high (green) and low (grey) pH conditions under which the template is switched OFF and ON, respectively. In the OFF state, monomers and growing polymers are not attracted to the template, preventing any monomer conversion. In the ON state, monomers are drawn to the template, facilitating their polymerization. The forming polymers and templates assemble into micellar structures, of which one is highlighted in the middle of the cover.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstonlarsine A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;alstonlarsine A (1), a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid possessing a unique pentacyclic skeleton as well as a rare biological activity, is achieved. The key step is an efficient domino sequence, comprising enamine formation followed by an inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand intramolecular dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition for the construction of 9&#8208;azatricyclo[4.3.1.03,8]decane core. The key intermediate for this domino sequence was synthesized by a newly developed methodology, relying on indole C(2)&#8208;H bond functionalization, combined with intramolecular Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons reaction. This tactical combination offers a new general entry into other (privileged) tricyclic frameworks possessing indole ring fused to 6&#8208;, 7&#8208; or 8&#8208;membered rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Autonomous Chiral Microswimmers with Self&#8208;mixing Capabilities for Highly Efficient Enantioselective Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chiral catalysts plays a very important role in various areas of chemical science. Heterogeneous catalysts have the general advantage of allowing a more straightforward separation from the products. One specific case of heterogeneous catalysis is electrocatalysis, being potentially a green chemistry approach. However, a typical drawback is that the redox conversion of molecules occurs only at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and not in the bulk of the electrolyte. The second limitation is that the electrodes have to be physically connected to a power supply to induce the desired reactions. To circumvent these problems, we propose here a complementary approach by replacing macroscopic electrodes with an ensemble of self&#8208;propelled redox active microswimmers. They move autonomously in solution while transforming simultaneously a prochiral starting compound into a specific enantiomer with a very high enantiomeric excess, accompanied by a significantly increased production rate of the favorite enantiomer.</dc:description>

         <title>Atropopeptides are a Novel Family of Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally Modified Peptides with a Complex Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomacromolecules are known to feature complex three&#8208;dimensional shapes that are essential for their function. Among natural products, ambiguous molecular shapes are a rare phenomenon. The hexapeptide tryptorubin A can adopt one of two unusual atropisomeric configurations. Initially hypothesized to be a non&#8208;ribosomal peptide, we show that tryptorubin A is the first characterized member of a new family of ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs) that we named atropopeptides. The sole modifying enzyme encoded in the gene cluster, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, is responsible for the atropospecific formation of one carbon&#8211;carbon and two carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds. The characterization of two additional atropopeptide biosynthetic pathways revealed a two&#8208;step maturation process. Atropopeptides promote pro&#8208;angiogenic cell functions as indicated by an increase in endothelial cell proliferation and undirected migration. Our study expands the biochemical space of RiPP&#8208;modifying enzymes and paves the way towards the chemoenzymatic utilization of atropopeptide&#8208;modifying P450s.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Conjugation Refining Carbon Nitride for Non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 Photosynthesis and Hypoxic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial photocatalysis offers a clean approach for producing H2O2. However, the poor selectivity and activity of H2O2 production hamper traditional industrial applications and emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Here, we report a C5N2 photocatalyst with a conjugated C=N linkage for selective and efficient non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 production both in normoxic and hypoxic systems. The strengthened delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers in C5N2 downshifted the band position, thermodynamically eliminating the side H2 evolution and kinetically promoting the water oxidation. As a result, C5N2 had a competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55% in overall H2O2 production and exhibited by far the highest activity in hypoxic conditions (698 &#956;M/h). C5N2 was further applied to hypoxic PDT/CDT with outstanding performance in apparent cancer cell death and synchronous bioimaging. It sheds light on carbon nitrides in photosynthesizing H2O2 for health.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Arene Trifluoromethylation Enabled by a High&#8208;Valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF3 Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arenes and heteroarenes poses an important synthetic challenge that is highly desirable. High&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compounds have often been invoked in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation reactions, but the fundamental reactivity toward arenes is elusive. Herein, direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of arenes/heteroarenes by a high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compound is disclosed for the first time. The Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compound serves CF  3  radical and a Cu(II) oxidant by homolytic cleavage of a Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  bond, which engage synergistically in a S  E  Ar type reaction with arenes. The presence of K  2  S  2  O  8  co&#8208;oxidant can significantly improve the reaction yields. This reaction shows good efficiency, broad functional group tolerance, and the potential in late&#8208;stage functionalization. The reactivity of high&#8208;valent Cu(III)&#8208;CF  3  compounds disclosed in this study represents an important progress in organofluorine and Cu(III) chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>A Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage&#8211;Based Prodrug Activation Strategy Applied to &#946;&#8208;Lapachone for Cancer&#8208;Specific Targeting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs are one of the most common strategies for the design of targeted anticancer agents. However, their application is often hampered by the modifiable groups available on parent drugs. Herein, a carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bond cleavage&#8211;based prodrug activation strategy is reported, which was successfully used to design prodrugs of &#946;&#8208;lapachone (&#946;&#8208;lap), an  ortho  &#8208;quinone natural product without traditional modifiable groups for the construction of C&#8208;N/C&#8208;O bond cleavage&#8211;based prodrugs. The designed &#946;&#8208;lap prodrug with a reactive oxygen species&#8211;specific trigger was quickly activated, releasing &#946;&#8208;lap. It exerted anticancer efficacy via NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)&#8208;mediated futile redox cycling, resulting in potent cytotoxicity that was highly selective for NQO1&#8208;rich cancer cells over normal cells both  in vitro  and  in vivo  . This significantly amplified the therapeutic window of &#946;&#8208;lap. This study provides a practical strategy for the design of prodrugs for parent drugs that do not contain traditional modifiable groups.</dc:description>

Here, we develop a ready&#8208;to&#8208;use and multimodal detection based on a rebuilding&#8208;free, ultrasensitive and selective strategy named dual hairpin ligation&#8208;induced isothermal amplification pro (DHLApro). Taking influenza A, influenza B, MERS&#8208;CoV, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as model targets, we demonstrate DHLApro provides ~zM level ultra&#8208;sensitivity, being equaling to 0.45 copy/&#181;L in original sample. By simply changing the recognition module, a set of DHLApro components can be applied to a new target without performance loss. Moreover, DHLApro innovatively allows flexible logic/multiplex assay using one set of primer, for example, the &#8220;N pathogens&#8208;in&#8208;1&#8221;OR gate screening and accurate multi&#8208;channel multiplex assay. Compared with traditional methods, the cost of this logic/multiplex assay has been largely reduced and the cross&#8208;interference between the multiple primer sets is also avoided.</dc:description>

         <title>Olefin&#8211;Borane Interactions in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Fluorophores that Undergo Frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;Pair&#8208;Type Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Olefin&#8211;borane &#960;&#8208;complexes have been postulated as intermediates for the addition of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) to olefins. In the present study, we have employed this weak interaction to modulate the electronic properties of boron&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;electron materials. A series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) fluorophores that contain an alkenyl&#8208;bridged diarylboryl group is synthesized. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the olefin and boron moieties are held in close proximity. Upon addition of a Lewis base to a solution of these D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A fluorophores, an FLP&#8208;type addition occurs with concurrent significant changes in the absorption and emission properties. The FLP&#8208;type reaction shifts the reaction site from the Lewis&#8208;acidic boron atom to a carbocationic center, and thereby even facilitates a reaction with bulky Lewis bases. For example, a tricyclohexylphosphine adduct thus generated exhibits temperature&#8208;dependent reversible dissociation/association behavior. These results provide a design strategy for stimuli&#8208;responsive emissive boron&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Operando Quantified Lithium Plating Determination Enabled by Dynamic Capacitance Measurement in Working Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The access to full performance of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is hindered by the mysterious lithium plating behavior. A rapid quantified lithium plating determination method compatible with actual working conditions is an urgent necessity for safe working LIBs. In this contribution, the relationship between electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance and electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) of graphite anodes during the Li&#8208;ion intercalation and Li plating processes is unveiled. We propose an operando lithium plating determination method based on the dynamic capacitance measurement (DCM) test. Reasonable selection of alternating current (AC) frequency protects the anodic responses from the interference of cathodic responses, which allows DCM to be applied in practical LIBs. The onset of lithium plating can be quantitatively traced, demonstrating the promise for real&#8208;time operando determination for lithium plating in a working battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Hydrogen Evolution and Zinc Ion Flux in Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zn&#8208;based aqueous batteries have attracted much attention because of their high theoretical&#8208;capacity, safety, and low&#8208;cost, yet the H2&#8208;evolution, qualification or inhibition mechanism investigations that are closely related to the dendrite&#8208;growth are rare and challenging. Herein, a series of zincophilic metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (e.g., Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF, Zn&#8208;DAAQ&#8208;COF, and Zn&#8208;DAA&#8208;COF) have been explored as model&#8208;platforms to manipulate the H2&#8208;evolution and Zn2+ flux. Best of them, Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF based cell only produces 0.002 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 H2, which is &gt; 2 orders of magnitude lower than bare Zn. Noteworthy, it affords high stability for 3000 cycles (overpotential, &lt; 79.1 mV) at 20 mA cm&#8208;2 in symmetric&#8208;cell and enhanced cycling&#8208;stability up to 6000 cycles at 2000 mA g&#8208;1 in the assembled full&#8208;battery. Besides, mechanistic characterizations show that Zn&#8208;AAn&#8208;COF can enhance the energy&#8208;barrier of H2&#8208;evolution and homogenize the ion&#8208;distribution or electric&#8208;filed to achieve high performance.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation ordering in ABX  3  perovskites is important to structural, physical and chemical properties. Here we report discovery of CaCuFeReO  6  with the tetragonal AA&#8217;BB&#8217;O  6  double double perovskite structure that was previously only reported for A&#8217; = Mn compositions. CaCuFeReO  6  occurs in the same phase field as CaCu  3  Fe  2  Re  2  O  12  demonstrating that different A&#8208;cation ordered peroskites may be obtained in the same chemical system. CaCuFeReO  6  has ferrimagnetic order of Fe, Re and Cu spins below  T  C  = 567 K, in contrast to Mn analogues where the Mn spins order separately at much lower temperatures. The magnetoresistance of CaCuFeReO  6  displays low&#8208;field &#8216;butterfly&#8217; hysteresis with an unusual change from negative to positive values as field increases. Many more AA&#8217;BB&#8217;O  6  double double perovskites may be accessible for A&#8217; = Cu and other divalent transition metals at high pressure, so the presently known phases likely represent only the &#8216;tip of the iceberg&#8217; for this family.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Electrochemical Reductive Splitting of Dinitrogen with a Molybdenum Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen reduction in mild conditions (room T and atmospheric P), using a non&#8208;fossil source of hydrogen remains a challenge. Molecular metal complexes, notably Mo based, have recently shown to be active for such nitrogen fixation. In this work, we report about the electrochemical N2 splitting with MoIII triphosphino complex [(PPP)MoI3], at room temperature and a moderately negative potential. A MoIV nitride species was generated, which was confirmed by electrochemistry and NMR studies. The reaction goes through two successive one electron reduction of the starting Mo species, coordination of an N2 molecule, and further splitting to a MoIV nitride complex. Preliminary DFT investigation supports the formation of a bridging MoIN2MoI dinitrogen dimer evolving to the Mo nitride via a low energy transition state. This example joins a short list of molecular complexes for N2 electrochemical reductive cleavage. It opens a door to electrochemical PCET conversion studies of N2 to NH3</dc:description>

         <title>pH&#8208;induced Symmetry Conversion of DNA Origami Lattices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology has provided credible approaches for assembly of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) lattices with complex patterns. However, the symmetries are strictly dependent on their initial configurations and difficult to alter via non&#8208;thermal treatments. While switchable nucleic acid structures have been employed to construct deformable DNA motifs, it remains challenging to arrange them anisotropically in 3D lattices to trigger directed collective shape transition and dynamic symmetry conversion. In this work, we used octahedral DNA origami frames to synthesize four DNA origami lattices by placing the pH&#8208;reactive i&#8208;motif sequences in the desired dimensions. Thereinto, lattices with an anisotropic design can switch between simple cubic (  SC  ) and simple tetragonal (  ST  ) upon pH change. Small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) results reveals the feasibility of obtaining 3D lattices with sensitive responses to external stimuli, expanding the way to obtain low&#8208;symmetry lattices.</dc:description>

         <title>Successive Redox&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Triggered Interface Radical Polymerization for Growing Hydrogel Coatings on Diverse Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Growing lubricious hydrogel coatings in controllable manners on diverse material surfaces demonstrates promising applications. Here, a surface modification method is reported for in&#8208;situ growing hydrogel coatings onto surfaces of diverse substrates in the absence of UV assistance. It is performed by decorating substrates with a universal mussel&#8208;inspired synthetic adhesive with catechol groups. Upon being immersed in reaction solution, these groups can assist substrate bonding and in&#8208;situ capture and reduce Fe  3+  into Fe  2+  for decomposing S  2  O  8  2&#8208;  into SO  4  &#8208;  &#8226; catalytically at the interface to initiate interface polymerization of monomers. As a result, hydrogel coatings with controllable thickness could be grown on surfaces of arbitrary substrates to change their surface characteristics regardless of materials size, category, geometry and transparency, implying considerable potential in surface engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Lipid Mass Tags via Aziridination for Probing Unsaturated Lipid Isomers and Accurate Relative Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Knowing concentrations of lipids is essential for understanding their physiological functions and discovering new disease biomarkers. However, it is highly challenging to accurately quantify lipids due to structural diversity and multiple isomeric forms of lipids. To address these critical gaps, we develop a novel aziridine&#8208;based isobaric tag labeling strategy that allows (i) determination of lipid double&#8208;bond positional isomers, (ii) accurate relative quantification of unsaturated lipids, and (iii) improvement of ionization efficiencies of nonpolar lipids. The power of this method is demonstrated in characterization and quantification of various categories of lipids such as fatty acids, phosphoglycerol lipids, cholesteryl esters (CE), and glycerides. 17 CE lipid isomers were identified and quantified simultaneously from Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse serum without using lipid standards. Among them, 6 CE isomers showed significant changes in concentrations in AD serum.</dc:description>

         <title>Directly Imaging Dynamic Electronic Coupling during Electrochemical Oxidation of Single Silver Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic coupling between a metal electrode and single nano&#8208;entities is of unfading significance which impacts the heterogeneous electron transfer. Herein, we demonstrated a simple optical technique for directly imaging the transient interfacial electronic coupling events during electrochemical oxidation of single Ag nanoparticles on Au electrode. The electronic coupling brings out a dramatic dip behavior of bright field imaging traces, and is conductive to cross the energy barrier of oxidation for single silver nanoparticles. This dip behavior is further verified by in situ vis&#8208;transmission spectroscopy, and the heterogeneity of the Au&#8208;Ag electronic coupling down to single&#8208;nanoparticle level is uncovered by unifying the morphology and size of individual silver nanoparticles. These results suggest the interfacial electronic coupling facilitates electron transfer of single nanoparticles, and provide important insight into understanding detailed mechanism of nanoelectrochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;C Interactions&#8208;supported Robust TADF Gold(I) Complex for OLEDs with Extremely Small Efficiency Roll&#8208;off and Good Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The practical use of luminescent mononuclear gold(I) complexes as optoelectronic materials has been limited by their inferior stability. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to improve the stability of gold(I) complexes with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) characteristic. A highly rigid and groove&#8208;like &#963;&#8208;donating aryl ligand has been used to evoke dual Au&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;C hydrogen bonds. The secondary metal&#8208;ligand interactions have been authenticated by single&#8208;crystal structure, NMR spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The TADF Au(I) complex exhibits appealing emission property (photoluminescence quantum yield = 76%; delayed fluorescence lifetime = 1.2 &#956;s) and much improved thermal and photo&#8208;stability. Vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) show promising electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 23% and negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off even at 10000 cd m  &#8208;2  . An estimated LT  50  longer than 77000 h with initial luminance at 100 cd m  &#8208;2  reveals good operational stability. This work suggests a way for design of stable luminescence gold(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;temperature Water&#8208;gas Shift Reaction Enhanced by Oxygen Vacancies in Pt&#8208;loaded Porous Single&#8208;crystalline Oxide Monoliths</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction at low temperature plays an important role in hydrogen production from fossil fuels and hydrogen purification for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. However, the activation of H2O is a critical reaction step that greatly limits the overall performance during WGS reaction. Here we fabricate porous single&#8208;crystalline (PSC) MoO3  monoliths at 1 cm scale and deposit atomic&#8208;layered Pt clusters at the lattice surface to create the interfacial system toward the low&#8208;temperature WGS reaction. The single&#8208;crystalline nature stabilizes the oxygen vacancies (VO  ) at lattice and facilitates the effective activation of H2O at the interface. We show the highest Pt&#8208;normalized activity of 0.86 mol  CO  mol  Pt&#8211;1  s&#8208;1  for the ultra&#8208;low temperature WGS reaction at 120 &#176;C. The single&#8208;crystalline features with enhanced fluxion in porous architectures lead to outstanding performance without visible degradation even after continuous operation for 100 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Driven Photoredox Catalysis by Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Complex Nanodots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing light&#8208;harvesting materials with broad spectral response is of fundamental importance in full&#8208;spectrum solar energy conversion. We found that, when a series of earth&#8208;abundant metal (Cu, Co, Ni and Fe) salts are dissolved in coordinating solvents uniformly dispersed nanodots (NDs) are formed rather than fully dissolving as molecular species. The previously unrecognized formation of this condensed state is ascribed to spontaneous aggregation of molecular transition metal complexes (TMCs) via weak intermolecular interactions, which results in redshifted and broadened absorption into the NIR region (200&#8208;1100 nm). Typical photoredox reactions, such as carbonylation and oxidative dehydrogenation, well demonstrate the feasibility of efficient utilization of NIR light (&#955;&gt;780 nm) by TMCs NDs. Our finding provides a conceptually new strategy for extending the absorption towards low energy photons in solar energy harvesting and conversion via photoredox transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Intramolecular Stacking of Rigid Heteroaromatic&#160;Compounds&#160; for High&#8208;Efficiency Deep&#8208;blue Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of ultrapure&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters featuring through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) were constructed via close stacking between donor and acceptor in rigid heteroaromatic compounds. The obviously accelerated radiative transition of singlet excitons, the diminished vibrionic relaxation of ground and excited states, consequently the reduced Stokes shift and the narrow emission&#160;can be found. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on AC&#8208;BO realize the best performance among all deep&#8208;blue TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters with an external quantum efficiency (EQE  max  ) of 19.3%. Meanwhile, the OLEDs based on QAC&#8208;BO display an EQE  max  of 15.8%, which achieve the first high&#8208;efficiency ultrapure&#8208;blue TSCT&#8208;TADF material with an excellent Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinate (CIE) of (0.145, 0.076) which perfectly match the ultrapure&#8208;blue requirements of CIE (0.14, 0.08) defined by the National Television System Committee.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Urea Electrolysis: From Nitrite and Cyanate as Major Products to Nitrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to N  2  represents an efficient route to simultaneous nitrogen removal from N&#8208;enriched waste and production of renewable fuels at the cathode. However, the overoxidation of urea to NO  x  &#175; usually dominates over its oxidation to N  2  at Ni(OH)  2  &#8208;based anodes. Furthermore, detailed reaction mechanisms of UOR remain unclear, hindering the rational catalyst design. We found that UOR to NO  x  &#175; on Ni(OH)  2  is accompanied by the formation of near stoichiometric amount of cyanate (NCO&#175;), which enabled the elucidation of UOR mechanisms. Based on our experimental and computational findings, we show that the formation of NO  x  &#175; and N  2  follows two distinct vacancy&#8208;dependent pathways. We also demonstrate that the reaction selectivity can be steered towards N  2  formation by altering the composition of the catalyst, e.g., doping the catalyst with copper (Ni  0.8  Cu  0.2  (OH)  2  ) increases the faradaic efficiency of N  2  from 30% to 55%.</dc:description>

         <title>Homogeneous Synthesis of Monodisperse Sequence&#8208;Defined Conjugated Oligomers by Temperature Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;defined synthetic oligomers and polymers provide unprecedented opportunities for polymer chemists to finely control properties such as chain folding, self&#8208;assembly, and optoelectronic performance of materials. However, absolute control over both chain&#8208;length and monomer sequence has been a long&#8208;standing &#8220;grand challenge&#8221; for decades. Herein, we report a novel strategy to synthesize monodisperse sequence&#8208;defined conjugated oligomers in a homogeneous manner by temperature cycling, thereby achieving single&#8208;monomer precision in conjugated polyheterocycles. A series of sequence&#8208;defined oligomers with up to twelve repeating units, four different monomers, and various sequences were successfully synthesized. Monomer sequence was also proved to affect optical properties. We believe this strategy not only exhibits general applicability to the synthesis of group 16 conjugated oligomers and polymers, but also has far&#8208;reaching potential for other polymer systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrating Light&#8208;Harvesting Ruthenium(II)&#8208;based Units into Three&#8208;Dimensional Metal Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three metal covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), namely RuCOF&#8208;ETTA, RuCOF&#8208;TPB and RuCOF&#8208;ETTBA, were synthesized by incorporating the photosensitive Ru(II) tris(2,2'&#8208;bipyridine) unit into the skeleton. Interestingly, each RuCOF contains three isostructural covalent organic frameworks that interlock&#160;together with the Ru(II) centers serving as point of registry. The covalently linked network coupling with uniformly distributed Ru(II) units allowed the RuCOFs to exhibit superior chemical stability, strong light&#8208;harvesting ability, and high photocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution (20308 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ). This work illustrates the potential of developing versatile MCOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts from functionalized metal complex building unit and further enriches the MCOFs family.</dc:description>

         <title>Emissive Metallacage&#8208;Cored Polyurethanes with Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structures of the crosslinks in supramolecular polymer networks play an important role on their properties and functions. Herein, emissive metallacages are used as crosslinks to prepare metallacage&#8208;cored polyurethanes. The mechanical properties including storage modulus, toughness, Young&#8217;s modulus and breaking strength of polymers are greatly enhanced with the increase of crosslinking densities. Moreover, such polymers not only exhibit good fluorescence in the solid state, but also show self&#8208;healing and shape memory properties owing to the dynamic reversible non&#8208;covalent bonds in their structures. This study not only offers a convenient strategy to prepare metallacage&#8208;crosslinked networks, but also explores their applications as self&#8208;healing and shape memory materials, which will promote the study of metallacage&#8208;cored supramolecular networks as smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Hydrophilicity and Stability of a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification for Water Vapor Sorption/Desorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With increasing demands for high&#8208;performance water sorption materials, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained considerable attention due to their high maximum uptake capacities. In many cases, however, high overall capacity is not necessarily accomplishing high working capacity under operating conditions, due to insufficient hydrophilicity and/or water stability. Herein, we present a post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of MOF&#8208;808, with di&#8208;sulfonic acids enhancing simultaneously its hydrophilicity and water stability without sacrificing its uptake capacity of ~30 mmol g  &#8208;1  . Di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM enabled a shift of the relative humidity (RH) associated with a sharp step in water vapor sorption from 35 &#8211; 40 % RH in MOF&#8208;808 to below 25 % RH. While MOF&#8208;808 lost uptake capacity and crystallinity over multiple sorption/desorption cycles, the di&#8208;sulfonic acid PSM MOF&#8208;808 retained &gt; 80 % of the original capacity. PSM MOF&#8208;808 exhibited good hydrothermal stability up to 60  o  C and high swing capacity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modular Construction of a Tessellated Octahedron and its Hierarchical Spherical Aggregate Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has led to the formation of various aesthetical polyhedrons and advanced functions. Compared to plentiful reported two&#8208;dimensional supramolecules with complex and giant skeletons, the constructions of polyhedrons are limited by using basic polygons as the panels. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of the tessellated triangle and tessellated octahedron with metal&#8208;organic module as the panel via template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These architectures possess diameters on the order of 10.9 nm and molecular weights greater than 84 kDa. Interestingly, fiber and spherical&#8208;like nanostructures could be formed by tessellated triangles and octahedrons through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly, respectively. In addition, the supramolecules exhibit evident electrochemical reduction activity for CO  2  to CO with the hybridization of carbon nanotubes.</dc:description>

         <title>Topochemical Synthesis of Ca3CrN3H Involving a Rotational Structural Transformation for Catalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Topochemical reactions have led to great progress in the discovery of new metastable compounds with novel chemical and physical properties. With these reactions, the overall crystal structure of the host material is generally maintained. Here we report a topochemical synthesis of a hexagonal nitride hydride, h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H, by heating an orthorhombic nitride, o&#8208;Ca3CrN3, under hydrogen at 673 K, accompanied by a rotational structural transformation. The hydrogen intercalation modifies the Ca&#8208;N rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like atomic packing in o&#8208;Ca3CrN3 to a face&#8208;sharing octahedral chain in h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H, mimicking a &#8216;hinged tessellation&#8217; movement. In addition, the h&#8208;Ca3CrN3H exhibited stable ammonia synthesis activity when used as a catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Excited Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Silyl&#8208;Radical&#8208;Mediated Direct Activation of Carbamoyl Chlorides To Access (Hetero)aryl Car&#8208;bamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide bonds are incredibly important fundamental entity which connect the amino acids in proteins and exist as a prevalent structural motif in biomolecules. Herein, we have exploited the concept of cross&#8208;electrophile coupling by merging the photo&#8208;redox and transition metal catalysis to construct carbamides from superabundant (hetero)aryl halides along with commercially feasible carbamoyl chlorides. The success of this protocol relies on the prior formation of NiII&#8208;aryl halide intermediate, which involves in a photoexcited Ni&#8722;halide homolysis event by energy transfer from aryl bromide and single electron transfer from aryl chloride to assist in generation of the vital carbamoyl radical. The breadth of application of this technique is significantly demonstrated both in inter&#8208; as well as intramolecular fashion for the synthesis of a plethora of (hetero)aryl carbamides with diverse functionalities, and biologically important benzolactams.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Encoded Bead&#8208;Based Immunoassay with Tunable Detection Range for COVID&#8208;19 Serum Evaluation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed strategy for chip&#8208;based sandwich immunoassays integrated with color/size dual&#8208;barcoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) is presented. RCA based on beads of various sizes allows for a tunable detection range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1.







Abstract
Serological assay for coronavirus 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) patients including asymptomatic cases can inform on disease progression and prognosis. A detection method taking into account multiplex, high sensitivity, and a wider detection range will help to identify and treat COVID&#8208;19. Here we integrated color&#8208;size dual&#8208;encoded beads and rolling circle amplification (RCA) into a bead&#8208;based fluorescence immunoassay implemented in a size sorting chip to achieve high&#8208;throughput and sensitive detection. We used the assay for quantifying COVID&#8208;19 antibodies against spike S1, nucleocapsid, the receptor binding domain antigens. It also detected inflammatory biomarkers including interleukin&#8208;6, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, procalcitonin, C&#8208;reactive protein whose concentrations range from pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 to &#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1. Use of different size beads integrating with RCA results in a tunable detection range. The assay can be readily modified to simultaneously measure more COVID&#8208;19 serological molecules differing by orders of magnitude.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;linker scissoring&#8221; strategy to control the shape of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles from nanoplate to nanorod by surface conformational pairing is reported by Hong&#8208;Cai Zhou, Zhi&#8208;Yuan Gu and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202207786). Both structure and shape influence the separation ability of MOF stationary phases in gas chromatography by affecting the thermodynamic and kinetic diffusion factors.

Intra&#8208;assembly chirality transfer&#160;from a helicene onto a non&#8208;chiral, emissive fluorenone ligand leads to circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in a heteroleptic coordination cage. The Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202205725) by Guido Clever et&#8197;al. shows that guest addition shifts and enhances the CPL effect, providing a modular platform for supramolecular materials with tunable chiroptical properties. The background, showing the &#8220;North America&#8221; emission nebula (NGC 7000) in the constellation Cygnus, was shot in the night sky over Dortmund using an apochromatic refractor telescope.

         <title>HXV2O5 Nanocatalysts Combined with Ultrasound for Triple Amplification of Oxidative Stress to Enhance Cancer Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple amplification of tumor oxidative stress has been demonstrated as efficient strategy to enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. Herein, vanadium&#8208;based nanocatalysts, hydrogen vanadium bronzes (HXV2O5  , for short HVO), were constructed and employed as novel biocatalysts for amplifying tumor oxidative stress and enhancing cancer catalytic therapy. Such HVO nanocatalysts harboring multivalent V element possessed multi&#8208;functional catalytic activity in decomposing H2O2  into &#8226;OH and depleting endogenous glutathione (GSH) to dually amplify tumor oxidative stress. Meanwhile, HVO nanocatalysts could also be activated by ultrasound to further triply amplify oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS caused mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further realizing cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition. Collectively, HVO nanocatalysts highlight the remarkable value of ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Observation of Li&#8208;Ion Transport Heterogeneity Induced by Nanoscale Phase Separation&#160;in Li&#8208;rich Cathodes of Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode materials with high specific capacities could significantly enhance the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the specific practical capacities of LLO materials in ASSLBs are extremely low due to poor initial activation. Here, scanning transmission electron microscopy with in&#8208;situ differential phase contrast imaging was first used to study the initial activation mechanism of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2. Li&#8208;ion transport heterogeneity was observed in LLO grains and across the LLO/Li6PS5Cl interface, due to the coexistence of the nanoscale Li2MnO3 and LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 phases. Consequently, the severely constrained activation of Li2MnO3 during the first charging could be attributed to a nanoscale phase separation in LLO, hindering Li&#8208;ion transport through its particles, and causing high impedance in the Li2MnO3 domain/Li6PS5Cl interface. This study could facilitate interface design of high&#8208;performance LLO&#8208;based ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;based Supramolecular Plastics Mediated by Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are one of the most widely used polymeric materials. However, they are often undegradable and non&#8208;recyclable due to the very stable covalent bonds of macromolecules, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Here, we report that liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS)&#160;could drive the formation of robust, stable, and sustainable plastics using small molecules. The LLPS process could sequester and concentrate solutes, strengthen the non&#8208;covalent association between molecules and produce a bulk material whose property was highly related to the encapsulated water amounts. It was a robust plastic with a remarkable Young&#8217;s modulus of 139.5 MPa when the water content was low while became adhesive and could instantly self&#8208;heal with more absorbed water. Finally, responsiveness enabled the material highly recyclable. This work allowed us to understand the LLPS at the molecular level and demonstrated that LLPS is a promising approach to exploring eco&#8208;friendly supramolecular plastics that are potential substitutes for conventional polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Membrane manipulation of giant unilamellar polymer vesicles with a temperature&#8208;responsive polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the complex behavior and dynamics of cellular membranes is integral to gain insight into cellular division and fusion processes. Bottom&#8208;up synthetic cells are as a platform for replicating and probing cellular behavior. Giant polymer vesicles are more robust than liposomal counterparts, as well as having a broad range of chemical functionalities. However, the stability of the membrane can prohibit dynamic processes such as membrane phase separation and division. Here, we present a method for manipulating the membrane of giant polymersomes using a temperature responsive polymer. Upon elevation of temperature deformation and phase separation of the membrane was observed. Upon cooling, the membrane relaxed and became homogenous again, with infrequent division of the synthetic cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent CO2 Activation by Tuning the Lewis Acid in Iron&#8208;Based Bimetallic Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimetallic motifs mediate the selective activation and functionalization of CO  2  in metalloenzymes and some recent synthetic systems. In this work, we build on the nascent concept of bimetallic frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to investigate the activation and reduction of CO  2  . Using the Fe(0) fragment [(depe)  2  Fe] (depe = 1,2&#8208;bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) as base, we modify the nature of the partner Lewis acid to accomplish a divergent and highly chemoselective reactivity towards CO  2  . [Au(PMe  2  Ar)]  +  irreversibly dissociates CO  2  , Zn(C  6  F  5  )  2  and B(C  6  F  5  )  3  yield different CO  2  adducts stabilized by push&#8208;pull interactions, while Al(C  6  F  5  )  3  leads to a rare heterobimetallic C&#8722;O bond cleavage, and thus to contrasting reduced products after exposure to dihydrogen. Computational investigations provide a rationale for the divergent reactivity, while Energy Decomposition Analysis&#8208;Natural Orbital for Chemical Valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) method substantiates the heterobimetallic bonding situation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ketenes in the Induction of the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ketene (CH2=C=O) has been postulated as a key intermediate for the first olefin production in the zeolite&#8208;catalyzed C1 chemistry of methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) and syngas&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (STO) processes. The reaction mechanism remains elusive, because the short&#8208;lived ethenone ketene and its derivatives are difficult to detect, which is further complicated by the low expected ketene concentration. We report on the experimental detection of methylketene (CH3&#8211;CH=C=O) formed by the methylation of ketene on HZSM&#8208;5 via operando synchrotron photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy, in which ketene is produced in situ from methyl acetate. The observation of methylketene as the ethylene precursor evidences a computationally predicted ketene&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene route proceeding via a methylketene intermediate followed by decarbonylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Energy Transfer Chemiluminescent Spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;Dioxetane Probes for Bioanalyte Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiluminescence imaging of bioanalytes using spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes has gained significant attention due to improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and imaging depth compared to excitation&#8208;based probes, as well as their modifiable scaffolds that offer analyte&#8208;specific responses and tunable emissive properties. Among several strategies employed to amplify signals under aqueous conditions and to shift the emission into the bio&#8208;relevant red region, energy transfer to an adjacent fluorophore is a popular and effective method. This minireview highlights spiroadamantane 1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;based probes that operate via an energy transfer mechanism to detect bioanalytes both in vitro and in vivo. Probes that display both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions with fluorophores, as well as their applications in imaging specific analytes will be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Jamming by Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembled Polymers: A Robust Route for Ultrahigh Efficient Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of cargo phase&#8211;transfer is of interest for many applications in science and technology. Here, we report a simple, versatile and robust method to block the phase&#8211;transfer of cargo colloids by interfacial self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic polymer molecules. After simply increasing the concentration of amphiphilic polymers, the orientation of interfacial polymer molecules changed from flat to upright direction, forming a thick three&#8211;dimensional polymer layer at the oil&#8211;water surface. Even under fierce external force, this thick interfacial layer robustly jammed the phase&#8211;transfer of cargo colloids, resulting in an ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency (up to 97.1%) for proteins and peptides. One single injection of high insulin&#8211;loaded microcomposites (58.3 wt%) persisted the blood glucose level within normoglycemic state for 10 days in type 1 diabetic rats. The mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889 times smaller than that of microcomposites prepared with non&#8211;amphiphilic ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Promoted by a Ru1Cu Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) was achieved over a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires. Single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF to afford DHMF. This work offers a catalyst design model for highly efficient ECH of biomass via single&#8208;atom alloying.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) represents an elegant route toward sustainable value&#8208;added chemicals production that circumvents the use of fossil fuel and hydrogen. However, the reaction efficiency is hampered by the high voltage and low activity of electrodes (Cu, Bi, Pb). Herein, we report a Ru1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst with isolated Ru atoms on Cu nanowires that exhibits an electrochemical reduction of HMF to 2,5&#8208;dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF) with promoted productivity (0.47 vs. 0.08&#8197;mmol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) and faradic efficiency (FE) (85.6 vs. 71.3&#8201;%) at &#8722;0.3&#8197;V (vs. RHE) compared with Cu counterpart. More importantly, the FE (87.5&#8201;%) is largely retained at high HMF concentration (100&#8197;mM). Kinetic studies by using combined electrochemical techniques suggest disparate mechanisms over Ru1Cu and Cu, revealing that single&#8208;atom Ru promotes the dissociation of water to produce H* species that effectively react with HMF via an electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) mechanism.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Dependent Oxidative Addition and Reductive Elimination of H2 Across a Gallium&#8208;Zinc Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydrogen reversibly adds across the Ga&#8722;Zn bond of a heterobimetallic cation. Oxidative addition is favoured in THF solution where the hydrogenation products are stabilized, but in fluorobenzene, reductive elimination of H2 is promoted by the Lewis&#8208;acidic zinc hydride cation.







Abstract
H2 adds reversibly across the metal&#8208;metal bond of [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)(thf)][BAr4F] (BDI=[HC{C(CH3)N(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)}2]&#8722;, TMEDA=N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine, BAr4F&#8722;=[B(C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CF3)2)4]&#8722;). Due to the stabilising effect of solvent coordination, hydrogenation products [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(thf)][BAr4F] are favoured in THF solution, but THF&#8208;free mixtures of [(BDI)GaH2] and [(tmeda)ZnH(OEt2)][BAr4F] are predisposed towards entropically driven dehydrogenation to [(BDI)Ga(H)&#8722;Zn(tmeda)][BAr4F] in fluorobenzene solution.

         <title>A Plurizyme with Transaminase and Hydrolase Activity Catalyzes Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PluriZyme with transaminase and esterase activities was constructed by combining computational and laboratory design methods. The enzyme can perform cascade reactions in a single protein scaffold. Experimental evidence is presented for the catalytic efficiency of both the native transaminase and the artificial esterase active site and their synergistic action to transform &#946;&#8208;keto esters into enantiopure &#946;&#8208;amino acids.







Abstract
Engineering dual&#8208;function single polypeptide catalysts with two abiotic or biotic catalytic entities (or combinations of both) supporting cascade reactions is becoming an important area of enzyme engineering and catalysis. Herein we present the development of a PluriZyme, TR2E2, with efficient native transaminase (kcat: 69.49&#177;1.77&#8197;min&#8722;1) and artificial esterase (kcat: 3908&#8211;0.41&#8197;min&#8722;1) activities integrated into a single scaffold, and evaluate its utility in a cascade reaction. TR2E2 (pHopt: 8.0&#8211;9.5; Topt: 60&#8211;65&#8201;&#176;C) efficiently converts methyl 3&#8208;oxo&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoate into 3&#8208;(R)&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;(2,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid, a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs. The reaction proceeds through the conversion of the &#946;&#8208;keto ester into the &#946;&#8208;keto acid at the hydrolytic site and subsequently into the &#946;&#8208;amino acid (e.e. &gt;99&#8201;%) at the transaminase site. The catalytic power of the TR2E2 PluriZyme was proven with a set of &#946;&#8208;keto esters, demonstrating the potential of such designs to address bioinspired cascade reactions.

Herein we present the development of a &lt;i&gt;PluriZyme&lt;/i&gt;, TR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with efficient native transaminase (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;: 69.49&#177;1.77&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and artificial esterase (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;: 3908&#8211;0.41&#8197;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) activities integrated into a single scaffold, and evaluate its utility in a cascade reaction. TR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (pH&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;: 8.0&#8211;9.5; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;: 60&#8211;65&#8201;&#176;C) efficiently converts methyl 3-oxo-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoate into 3-(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-amino-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butanoic acid, a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of antidiabetic drugs. The reaction proceeds through the conversion of the &#946;-keto ester into the &#946;-keto acid at the hydrolytic site and subsequently into the &#946;-amino acid (e.e. &amp;gt;99&#8201;%) at the transaminase site. The catalytic power of the TR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;PluriZyme&lt;/i&gt; was proven with a set of &#946;-keto esters, demonstrating the potential of such designs to address bioinspired cascade reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multienzyme Redox System with Cofactor Regeneration for Cyclic Deracemization of Sulfoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multienzyme cyclic deracemization system with cofactor regeneration was established for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. Chiral sulfoxides were prepared in &gt;90&#8201;% yield with &gt;90&#8201;% ee through the cascade catalysis of methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr), styrene monooxygenase (SMO), and three other auxiliary enzymes (Trx, Trx&#8208;R, and GDH).







Abstract
Optically pure sulfoxides are noteworthy compounds applied in a wide range of industrial fields; however, the biocatalytic deracemization of racemic sulfoxides is challenging. Herein, a high&#8208;enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) was combined with a low&#8208;enantioselective styrene monooxygenase (SMO) for the cyclic deracemization of sulfoxides. Enantiopure sulfoxides were obtained in &gt;90&#8201;% yield and with &gt;90&#8201;% enantiomeric excess (ee) through dynamic &#8220;selective reduction and non&#8208;selective oxidation&#8221; cycles. The cofactors of MsrA and SMO were subsequently regenerated by the cascade catalysis of three auxiliary enzymes through the consumption of low&#8208;cost D&#8208;glucose. Moreover, this &#8220;one&#8208;pot, one&#8208;step&#8221; cyclic deracemization strategy exhibited a wide substrate scope toward various aromatic, heteroaromatic, alkyl and thio&#8208;alkyl sulfoxides. This system proposed an efficient strategy for the green synthesis of chiral sulfoxide.

         <title>Polystyrene&#8208;based Macromolecular Ammonium Halides for Tuning Color and Exchange Kinetics of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonium halide&#8208;containing polymers offer a convenient halide source for anion exchange with CsPbX3 nanocrystals (NCs), tuning their emission color from purple to red while simultaneously allowing formation of stable nanocomposite films. The polymer and its solvent&#8208;dependent aggregation state provide a handle to control inter&#8208;NC anion exchange kinetics, providing a simple solution&#8208;processable route to all&#8208;perovskite white emissive solutions and films.







Abstract
Post&#8208;synthesis anion exchange of all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbX3 NCs, where X=Cl, Br, and/or I) provides a rapid and simple means of tuning their band gap and photoluminescence emission wavelengths. Here we report color&#8208;shifting of CsPbX3 nanocrystals induced by a macromolecular source of halide ions, specifically using polystyrene with ammonium halides as pendent groups. This strategy for introducing new halides to the perovskite nanocrystals gave access to perovskite&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as solutions, thin films, or free&#8208;flowing powders. Spectroscopic measurements of the halide&#8208;exchanged nanocrystal products revealed high photoluminescence quantum yields across the visible spectrum, with exchange kinetics that were tunable based on the solution environment, suggesting an aggregation&#8208;inhibited exchange process that affords access to multi&#8208;colored solutions and films.

         <title>Direct and Selective Electrocarboxylation of Styrene Oxides with CO2 for Accessing &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly selective and direct electroreductive ring&#8208;opening carboxylation of epoxides with CO2 in an undivided cell to yield synthetically important &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids is described. CO2 functions not only as a carboxylative reagent in this reaction but also as a promoter to enable efficient and chemoselective transformation of epoxides under additive&#8208;free electrochemical conditions.







Abstract
Highly selective and direct electroreductive ring&#8208;opening carboxylation of epoxides with CO2 in an undivided cell is reported. This reaction shows broad substrate scopes within styrene oxides under mild conditions, providing practical and scalable access to important synthetic intermediate &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids. Mechanistic studies show that CO2 functions not only as a carboxylative reagent in this reaction but also as a promoter to enable efficient and chemoselective transformation of epoxides under additive&#8208;free electrochemical conditions. Cathodically generated &#945;&#8208;radical and &#945;&#8208;carbanion intermediates lead to the regioselective formation of &#945;&#8208;carboxylation products.

         <title>Capture, Storage, and Release of Oxygen by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MOFs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are emerging materials for oxygen capture and storage with significant benefits for the broader community. This Minireview assesses and discusses the fundamental chemistry for both selective and reversible MOFs for the role of oxygen capture from air. In addition, we describe the current state of play for oxygen storage by MOFs, as well as engineering solutions to aid in the release of oxygen once captured.







Abstract
Oxygen is a critical gas for medical and industrial settings. Much of today's global oxygen supply is via inefficient technologies such as cryogenic distillation, membranes or zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) promise a superior alternative for oxygen separation, as their fundamental chemistry can in principle be tailored for reversible and selective oxygen capture. We evaluate the characteristics for reversible and selective uptake of oxygen by MOFs, focussing on redox&#8208;active sites. Key characteristics for separation can also be seen in MOFs for oxygen storage roles. Engineering solutions to release adsorbed oxygen from the MOFs are discussed including Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) and the highly efficient Magnetic Induction Swing Adsorption (MISA). We conclude with the applications and outlooks for oxygen capture, storage and release, and the likely impacts the next generation of MOFs will have on industry and the broader community.

         <title>Discovery of the Biosynthetic Pathway of Beticolin 1 Reveals a Novel Non&#8208;Heme Iron&#8208;Dependent Oxygenase for Anthraquinone Ring Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 required for anthraquinone ring cleavage is discovered during elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, in which iron is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water based on its crystal structure. Moreover, Thr299 and His58 mediate Kcx377 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Thus, this work updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.







Abstract
This study used light&#8208;mediated comparative transcriptomics to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of beticolin 1 in Cercospora.

During elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, a novel non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 responsible for anthraquinone ring cleavage was discovered. More importantly, the discovery of non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase BTG13 is well supported by experimental evidence: (i)&#8197;crystal structure and the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that its reactive site is built by an atypical iron ion coordination, where the iron ion is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated&#8208;lysine (Kcx377) and water; (ii)&#8197;Kcx377 is mediated by His58 and Thr299 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Therefore, we believed this study updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.

&lt;p&gt;A novel non-heme iron oxygenase BTG13 required for anthraquinone ring cleavage is discovered during elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway of beticolin 1, in which iron is uncommonly coordinated by four histidine residues, an unusual carboxylated-lysine (Kcx377) and water based on its crystal structure. Moreover, Thr299 and His58 mediate Kcx377 to modulate the catalytic activity of BTG13. Thus, this work updates our knowledge of metalloenzymes.

&lt;p&gt;This study used light-mediated comparative transcriptomics to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster of beticolin 1 in &lt;i&gt;Cercospora&lt;/i&gt;. It contains an anthraquinone moiety and an unusual halogenated xanthone moiety connected by a bicyclo[3.2.2]nonane.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in a M&#246;bius Helicene Carbon Nanohoop
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#246;bius helicene nanohoop: A chiral helicene carbon nanohoop with M&#246;bius topology is obtained by integrating stereogenic [6]helicene unit with a planar &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation into radially&#8208;conjugated [7]cycloparaphenylene. The new carbon nanohoop preserves the favorable optoelectronic properties typical for cycloparaphenylenes while [6]helicene endows it with configurational stability and chiroptical properties, such as circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We present the first helicene carbon nanoohop that integrates a [6]helicene into [7]cycloparaphenylene. The [6]helicene endows the helicene carbon nanohoop with chiroptical properties and configurational stability typical for higher helicenes, while the radially conjugated seven para&#8208;phenylenes largely determine the optoelectronic properties. The structure of the helicene carbon nanoohop was unambiguously characterized by NMR, MS and X&#8208;ray analysis that revealed that it possesses a topology of a M&#246;bius strip in the solid state and in solution. The chirality transfers from the [6]helicene to the para&#8208;phenylenes and leads to a pronounced circular dichroism and bright circularly polarized luminescence, which is affected by the structural topology of the nanohoop.

         <title>Enantioselective Dearomative Cyclization Enabled by Asymmetric Cooperative Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold&#8208;ligand cooperation permits catalytic enantioselective dearomatization of 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. This work is facilitated by the development of a divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphine ligands. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are realized. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative nature of the catalysis and the observed stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dearomatization is achieved via metal&#8208;chiral ligand cooperation. A new and divergent synthesis of chiral bifunctional binaphthyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylphosphines is developed to allow rapid access to these ligands, which in turn facilitate the application of this chemistry to a broad substrate scope including 1&#8208;naphthols, 2&#8208;naphthols, and phenols. Enantiomeric excesses up to 98&#8201;% are achieved via selective acceleration of one enantiomer formation enabled by hydrogen bonding between substrate and ligand remote basic group. DFT calculations lend support to the cooperative catalysis and substantiate the reaction stereochemical outcomes.

         <title>Antineoplastic Enzyme as Drug Carrier with Activatable Catalytic Activity for Efficient Combined Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glucose oxidase (GOx) as drug carrier delivers anticancer drugs including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. These nanodrugs show acid&#8208;activatable enzyme activity of GOx, thus allowing relatively safe intravenous administration of GOx and effective combination of GOx&#8208;mediated cancer starvation&#8208;like therapy and chemotherapy/photothermal therapy/tumor ferroptosis against 4T1 breast tumors.







Abstract
The delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx) requires extra carriers, which suffers from early leakage and exposure of GOx. These issues will be of less concern if GOx itself acts as a drug carrier. However, the catalytic activity of GOx in the blood still needs to be inhibited. Herein, we found that GOx could self&#8208;assemble with hydrophobic molecules into uniform and stable nanoparticles (NPs), including sorafenib, 4&#8242;&#8208;(amino&#8208;methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine modified cyanin and paclitaxel. The catalytic activity of GOx in NPs was significantly inhibited due to the binding of small molecules with its hydrophobic pockets. After dissociation in the tumor acidic microenvironment, the enzyme activity of GOx could be largely recovered. This acidity&#8208;triggered &#8220;OFF&#8208;to&#8208;ON&#8221; process ensured safe intravenous administration of GOx&#8208;based NPs. In vivo experiments showed that the combined starvation therapy and ferroptosis/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy effectively inhibited 4T1 breast tumor growth.

         <title>Effect of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed and Intercalated (Oxy)anions on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Oxy)anions can surface&#8208;adsorb on and intercalate into oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. There, they can affect the catalyst's electronic properties and interlayer spacing, stabilizing OER intermediates and potentially breaking the *OH/*OOH scaling relations, as described in this Minireview. Thus, adding (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new OER design dimension.







Abstract
As the kinetically demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for the decarbonization of our society, a wide range of (pre)catalysts with various non&#8208;active&#8208;site elements (e.g., Mo, S, Se, N, P, C, Si&#8230;) have been investigated. Thermodynamics dictate that these elements oxidize during industrial operation. The formed oxyanions are water soluble and thus predominantly leach in a reconstruction process. Nevertheless, recently, it was unveiled that these thermodynamically stable (oxy)anions can adsorb on the surface or intercalate in the interlayer space of the active catalyst. There, they tune the electronic properties of the active sites and can interact with the reaction intermediates, changing the OER kinetics and potentially breaking the persisting OER *OH/*OOH scaling relations. Thus, the addition of (oxy)anions to the electrolyte opens a new design dimension for OER catalysis and the herein discussed observations deepen the understanding of the role of anions in the OER.

         <title>Gauging Radical Stabilization with Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical stabilization by carbenes is explored computationally. A donor/acceptor frontier orbital picture based on the allyl radical is presented, and allows one to understand and predict radical stabilization in organic radicals, carbene complexes of the transitions metals, as well as of s&#8208; and p&#8208;block elements.







Abstract
Carbenes, including N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, are used extensively to stabilize open&#8208;shell transition metal complexes and organic radicals. Yet, it remains unknown, which carbene stabilizes a radical well and, thus, how to design radical&#8208;stabilizing C&#8208;donor ligands.

     alt="Gauging Radical Stabilization with Carbenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical stabilization by carbenes is explored computationally. A donor/acceptor frontier orbital picture based on the allyl radical is presented, and allows one to understand and predict radical stabilization in organic radicals, carbene complexes of the transitions metals, as well as of s- and p-block elements.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbenes, including &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, are used extensively to stabilize open-shell transition metal complexes and organic radicals. Yet, it remains unknown, which carbene stabilizes a radical well and, thus, how to design radical-stabilizing C-donor ligands. With the large variety of C-donor ligands experimentally investigated and their electronic properties established, we report herein their radical-stabilizing effect. We show that radical stabilization can be understood by a captodative frontier orbital description involving &#960;-donation to- and &#960;-donation from the carbenes. This picture sheds a new perspective on NHC chemistry, where &#960;-donor effects usually are assumed to be negligible. Further, it allows for the intuitive prediction of the thermodynamic stability of covalent radicals of main group- and transition metal carbene complexes, and the quantification of redox non-innocence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Conversion of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids into &#945;&#8208;Amino Phosphonates by Decarboxylative Phosphorylation using Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The facile conversion of &#945;&#8208;amino acids to the respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates via their redox active esters using organophotoredox catalysis is reported. A novel photocatalytic phosphorylation combines radical&#8211;polar crossover with Arbuzov&#8208;type reactivity, providing an operationally simple, high yielding and general synthetic approach for the generation of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates.







Abstract
Amino phosphonates exhibit potent inhibitory activity for a wide range of biological processes due to their specific structural and electronic properties, making them important in a plethora of applications, including as enzyme inhibitors, herbicides, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal agents. While the traditional synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonates has relied on the multicomponent Kabachnik&#8208;Fields reaction, we herein describe a novel and facile conversion of activated derivatives of &#945;&#8208;amino acids directly to their respective &#945;&#8208;amino phosphonate counterparts via a decarboxylative radical&#8211;polar crossover process enabled by the use of visible&#8208;light organophotocatalysis. The novel method shows broad applicability across a range of natural and synthetic amino acids, operates under mild conditions, and has been demonstrated to successfully achieve the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules.

         <title>Optimize Lithium Deposition at Low Temperature by Weakly Solvating Power Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;  For lithium (Li) metal batteries, the decrease in operating temperature brings severe safety issues by more disordered Li deposition. Here, we demonstrate that the solvating power of solvent is closely related to the reversibility of the Li deposition/stripping process under low&#8208;temperature conditions. The electrolyte with weakly solvating power solvent shows lower desolvation energy, allowing for a uniform Li deposition morphology, as well as a high deposition/stripping efficiency (97.87% at &#8722;40 &#176;C). Based on a weakly solvating electrolyte, we further built a full cell by coupling the Li metal anode with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile electrode at a low anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio for steady cycling at &#8722;40 &#176;C. Our results clarified the relationship between solvating power of solvent and Li deposition behavior at low temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Multiply Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring Fused Porphyrins by Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed [5+2] Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed reaction of meso&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl Ni(II) porphyrins with internal alkynes proceeded smoothly to give singly, doubly, and quadruply seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring fused Ni(II) porphyrins as the first example of [5+2] annulation reaction for porphyrin substrates, where the meso&#8208;appended pyrrole unit serves as a directing group. These reactions are operationally quite simple and easy. A plausible reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of the isolation of a key intermediate. The structures of the representative products have been revealed to be considerably bent owing to the implemented seven&#8208;membered rings. Doubly fused Zn(II) and Ni(II) porphyrins possessing an unsubstituted meso&#8208;position were dimerized to meso&#8208;meso linked dimers by aerobic oxidation with Zn(OAc)2&#183;2H2O and electrochemical oxidation, respectively. The optical and electrochemical highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) &#8208; lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps, as well as the aromatic characters of the fused porphyrins decrease as the fusion parts increases.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Delivery of Glutathione Peroxidase Degrader Induces Ferroptosis In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>F erroptosis is a new form of&#160; regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic &#160;cell death driven by iron&#8208;dependent phospholipid peroxidation. Its&#160; therapeutic potential &#160;is however, greatly limited by the&#160; low&#160; efficiency&#160; of &#160;regulating&#160; cell&#160; ferroptosis in vivo. Herein, we report a PROTAC&#8208;based protein degrader that depletes endogenous glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)&#160; and&#160; induces cancer cell ferroptosis. We demonstrate that a rationally designed GPX 4 &#160;degrader, dGPX4, can deplete tumor cell GPX4 via proteasomal protein degradation, showing a five&#8208;fold enhancement of ferroptosis induction efficiency compared to that of GPX4 inhibition &#160;using ML162. &#160;Moreover, we show that the intracellular delivery of dGPX4 using biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12) induces cell&#8208;selective ferroptosis by targeting cancer cell microenvironment. The in vivo administration of dGPX4@401&#8208;TK&#8208;12 effectively suppresses tumor growth without appreciable side effects. We anticipate the&#160; protein degradation &#160;strategy described herein could be easily expanded to other essential regulatory proteins of ferroptosis for developing targeted cancer therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Hexachloro Sulfate(iv) Dianion Enabled by Polychloride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation and structural characterization of [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ] is described, which is the first example of a [SCl  6  ]  2&#8211;  dianion and of a halosulfate anion of the type [S  x  X  y  ]  z  &#8211;  in general. This dianion belongs to the group of 14&#8208;valence electron AB  6  E systems and forms an octahedral structure in the solid&#8208;state. Interestingly, co&#8208;crystallization with CH  2  Cl  2  affords [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ]&#8729;4CH  2  Cl  2  containing [SCl  6  ]  2&#8211;  dianions with  C  4v  symmetry. As suggested by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the distortion of the structure is not caused by a stereochemically active lone pair but by enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions with CH  2  Cl  2  . At elevated temperatures, [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ] decomposes to various sulfur chlorine compounds as shown by Raman spectroscopy. Cooling back to room temperature results in the selective formation of [NEt  3  Me]  2  [SCl  6  ] which is comparable to the well&#8208;studied SCl  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction or Photoredox Organic Transformation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have been explored as photocatalysts for CO  2  reductions. Here find that perovskite photocatalytic CO  2  reduction in organic solvents is likely problematic. Instead, the detected products,  i.e.  CO, likely result from a photoredox organic transformation involving the solvent. Our observations have been validated using isotopic labeling experiments, band energy analysis and new control experiments. We designed a typical perovskite photocatalytic setup in organic solvents that led to CO production up to ~1000 &#956;mol/g/h. CO  2  reduction in organic solvents must be studied with extra care, because photoredox organic transformations can produce orders of magnitude higher rate of CO or CH  4  than is typical for CO  2  reduction routes. Though CO  2  reduction is not likely to occur,  in&#8208;situ  CO generation is extremely fast. Hence a suitable system can be established for challenging organic reactions that use CO as a feedstock, but exploit the solvent as a CO surrogate</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stibenium: Lewis Superacidity by Antimony(III)&#8208;Antimony(V) Electromerism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis superacids enable the activation of highly inert substrates. However, the permanent presence of a Lewis superacidic center comes along with a constantly increased intolerance toward functional groups or ambient conditions. Herein, we describe a strategy to unleash Lewis superacidity by electromerism. Experimental and computational results indicate that coordinating a Lewis base to &#916;&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato&#8208;antimony(III) triggers a ligand redox&#8208;noninnocent coupled transfer into a antimony(V)&#8208;state that exhibits Lewis superacidic features. Lewis acidity by electromerism establishes a concept of potential generality for powerful yet robust reagents and on&#8208;site substrate activation approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobicity Graded Gas Diffusion Layer for Stable Electrochemical Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To mitigate flooding associated with the gas diffusion layer (GDL) during electroreduction of CO2, we report a hydrophobicity&#8208;graded hydrophobic GDL (HGGDL). Coating uniformly dispersed polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binders on the carbon fiber skeleton of a hydrophilic GDL uniformizes the hydrophobicity of the GDL and also alleviates the gas blockage of pore channels. Further adherence of the PTFE macroporous layer (PMPL) to one side of the hydrophobic carbon fiber skeleton was aided by sintering. The introduced PMPL shows an appropriate pore size and enhanced hydrophobicity. As a result, the HGGDL offers spatial control of the hydrophobicity and hence water and gas transport over the GDL. Using a nickel&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalyst, the resulting HGGDL electrode provided a CO faradaic efficiency of over 83% at a constant current density of 75 mA cm&#8208;2 for 103 h operation in a membrane electrode assembly, which is more than 16 times that achieved with a commercial GDL.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation and Reactivity of Tetrylene&#8208;Tetrylone&#8208;Iron Complexes Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine) Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>The germanium iron carbonyl complex  3  was prepared by the reaction of dimeric chloro(imino)germylene [IPrNGeCl]  2  (IPrN = bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;iminato) with one equivalent of Collman&#8217;s reagent (Na  2  Fe(CO)  4  ) at room temperature. Similarly, reaction of the chloro(imino)stannylene [IPrNSnCl]  2  with Na  2  Fe(CO)  4  (1 eq.) resulted in the Fe(CO)  4  &#8208;bridged bis(stannylene) complex  4  . We observed reversible manifestation of bis(tetrylene) and tetrylene&#8208;tetrylone character in complexes  3  vs.  5  and  4  vs.  6  , which was supported by DFT calculations. Moreover, the Li/Sn/Fe trimetallic complex  12  has been isolated from the reaction of [IPrNSnCl]  2  with cyclopentadienyl iron dicarbonyl anion. The computational analysis further rationalizes the reduction pathway from these chlorotetrylenes to the corresponding complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep cavitands, concave molecular containers, represent an important supramolecular host class that has been explored for a variety of applications ranging from sensing, switching, purification and adsorption to catalysis. A major limitation in the field has been the cavitand volume that is restricted by the size of the structural platform utilized (diameter approx. 7 &#197;). We here report the synthesis of a novel, unprecedentedly large structural platform, named acridane[4]arene (diameter approx. 14 &#197;), suitable for the construction of cavitands with volumes of up to 814 &#197;  3  . These megalo&#8208;cavitands serve as size&#8208;selective hosts for fullerenes with mM to sub&#8208;&#181;M&#160;binding affinity for C  60  and C  70  . Furthermore, the selective binding of fullerene C  70  in the presence of C  60  was demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Laser Based on Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Local Excited State Characteristics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatial separation between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) in thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecules leads to charge transfer (CT) states, which degrade the oscillator strength of emission transition and sacrifices high solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), together limiting its application in organic solid&#8208;state lasers (OSSLs). Here, we demonstrated organic microwire lasers from TADF emitters that combine aggregation induced emission (AIE) and local excited (LE) state characteristics. The unique AIE and LE feature lead to a PLQY approaching 50% and a high optical gain of 870 cm&#8208;1 for TADF microwires. The regenerated singlet excitons by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process are conducive to population inversion. As a result, we demonstrated microwire lasers around 465 nm with a low threshold of 3.74 &#956;J cm&#8208;2. Therefore, our work provides insight to design TADF materials for OSSLs.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spatial separation between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) in thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) molecules leads to charge transfer (CT) states, which degrade the oscillator strength of emission transition and sacrifices high solid-state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), together limiting its application in organic solid-state lasers (OSSLs). Here, we demonstrated organic microwire lasers from TADF emitters that combine aggregation induced emission (AIE) and local excited (LE) state characteristics. The unique AIE and LE feature lead to a PLQY approaching 50% and a high optical gain of 870 cm-1 for TADF microwires. The regenerated singlet excitons by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process are conducive to population inversion. As a result, we demonstrated microwire lasers around 465 nm with a low threshold of 3.74 &#956;J cm-2. Therefore, our work provides insight to design TADF materials for OSSLs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid and Economical Chemoselective Metabolomics Using Boronate Ester Formation on a Monolithic Substrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although chemoselective labeling strategy shows great potential in deep description on metabolomics, the long strategy&#160;time and expensive cost can limit its application in high&#8208;throughput and routine analysis. Herein, we report a fast and effective chemoselective labeling strategy based on multi&#8208;functionalized monolithic probes. A rapid pH&#8208;responsive boronate ester reaction was employed to immobilize and release probe molecules from substrate in 5 min. The mesoporous surface and hierarchically porous channels of substrate allowed for accelerated labeling reactions. Moreover, the&#160;discernible boron beacons allowed for recognition of labeled metabolites with no need of expensive isotopic encoding. This new strategy has been successfully used for submetabolome analysis of yeast cells, serum and feces samples, with improved sensitivity for short chain fatty acids up to 1,600 times compared with non&#8208;labeling LC&#8208;MS methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Bloom Syndrome Helicase Compresses Single&#8208;Stranded DNA into Phase&#8208;Separated Condensates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) is a conserved RecQ family helicase involved in the maintenance of genome stability. BLM has been widely recognized as a genome &#8216;caretaker&#8217; that processes structured DNA. In contrast, our knowledge of how BLM behaves on single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is still limited. Here, we demonstrate that BLM possesses the intrinsic ability for phase separation and can co&#8208;phase separate with ssDNA to form dynamically arrested protein/ssDNA co&#8208;condensates. The introduction of ATP potentiates the capability of BLM to condense on ssDNA, which further promotes the compression of ssDNA against a resistive force of up to 60 piconewtons. Moreover, BLM is also capable of condensing replication protein A (RPA)&#8208; or RAD51&#8208;coated ssDNA, before which it generates naked ssDNA by dismantling these SSB proteins. Overall, our findings identify an unexpected characteristic of a DNA helicase and provide a new angle of protein/ssDNA co&#8208;condensation for understanding the genomic instability caused by BLM overexpression under diseased conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Differential Dihydrofunctionalization: A Dual Catalytic Three&#8208;Component Coupling of Alkynes, Alkenyl Bromides, and Pinacolborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne.







Abstract
A new method for differential dihydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes enables the synthesis of allylic boronate esters through reductive three&#8208;component coupling of terminal alkynes, alkenyl bromides, and pinacolborane. The transformation is promoted by cooperative action of a copper/palladium catalyst system and results in hydrofunctionalization of both &#960;&#8208;bonds of an alkyne. The synthesis of allylic boronate esters can be accomplished in the presence of a wide range of functional groups, including, esters, nitriles, alkyl halides, sulfonyl esters, acetals, protected terminal alkynes, aryl halides, and silyl ethers. Mechanistic experiments reveal the importance of subtle ligand effects on the performance of the palladium co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Cytochrome P450Blt Enables Versatile Peptide Cyclisation to Generate Histidine&#8208; and Tyrosine&#8208;Containing Crosslinked Tripeptide Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytochrome&#8197;P450Blt generates A&#8722;N&#8722;B and A&#8722;O&#8722;B crosslinked tripeptides within MRYxH and MRYxW peptides. Removal of the minimal leader peptide allows isolation of these cyclic tripeptides, with sequences further varied by incorporation of a range of residues at the position within the cyclic tripeptide. Biarylitide P450s therefore show potential as biocatalysts for the generation of a diverse range of cyclic tripeptide building blocks.







Abstract
We report our investigation of the utility of peptide crosslinking cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzymes from biarylitide biosynthesis to generate a range of cyclic tripeptides from simple synthons. The crosslinked tripeptides produced by this P450 include both tyrosine&#8208;histidine (A&#8722;N&#8722;B) and tyrosine&#8208;tryptophan (A&#8722;O&#8722;B) crosslinked tripeptides, the latter a rare example of a phenolic crosslink to an indole moiety. Tripeptides are easily isolated following proteolytic removal of the leader peptide and can incorporate a wide range of amino acids in the residue inside the crosslinked tripeptide. Given the utility of peptide crosslinks in important natural products and the synthetic challenge that these can represent, P450 enzymes have the potential to play roles as important tools in the generation of high&#8208;value cyclic tripeptides for incorporation in synthesis, which can be yet further diversified using selective chemical techniques through specific handles contained within these tripeptides.

         <title>Sunk&#8208;Cost Bias and Knowing When to Terminate a Research Project</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An awareness of sunk&#8208;cost bias provides an antidote to the scientific optimism that exacerbates the tendency to continue research projects when the likelihood of success is minimal. A survey of academic and industrial practices, as summarized in the sunk&#8208;cost bias decision matrix, captures how implementing controls facilitates data&#8208;driven decisions to terminate or continue research while avoiding emotionally driven decisions that can sap resources.







Abstract
Scientific research is an open&#8208;ended quest where success usually triumphs over failure. The tremendous success of science obscures the tendency for the non&#8208;linear discovery process to take longer and cost more than expected. Perseverance through detours and past setbacks requires a significant commitment that is fueled by scientific optimism; the same optimism required to overcome challenges simultaneously exacerbates the very human tendency to continue a line of inquiry when the likelihood of success is minimal, the so&#8208;called sunk&#8208;cost bias. This Viewpoint Article shows how the psychological phenomenon of sunk&#8208;cost bias influences medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists by comparing how the respective industrial and academic practitioners approach sunk&#8208;cost bias; a series of interviews and illustrative quotes provide a rich trove of data to address this seldom discussed, yet potentially avoidable research cost. The concluding strategies recommended for mitigating against sunk&#8208;cost bias should benefit not only medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists but a wide array of chemistry practitioners.

Perseverance through detours and past setbacks requires a significant commitment that is fueled by scientific optimism; the same optimism required to overcome challenges simultaneously exacerbates the very human tendency to continue a line of inquiry when the likelihood of success is minimal, the so-called sunk-cost bias. This Viewpoint Article shows how the psychological phenomenon of sunk-cost bias influences medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists by comparing how the respective industrial and academic practitioners approach sunk-cost bias; a series of interviews and illustrative quotes provide a rich trove of data to address this seldom discussed, yet potentially avoidable research cost. The concluding strategies recommended for mitigating against sunk-cost bias should benefit not only medicinal, pharmaceutical, and organic chemists but a wide array of chemistry practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Specialized Polythioamide&#8208;Binding Protein Confers Antibiotic Self&#8208;Resistance in Anaerobic Bacteria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A central contributor to the self&#8208;resistance of an anaerobic antibiotic producer is identified. CtaZ, a new member of the GyrI&#8208;like superfamily, confines the gyrase inhibitor closthioamide in a ligand&#8208;optimized pocket. Genome mining uncovered CtaZ homologs encoded in the genomes of diverse bacteria, including numerous pathogens.







Abstract
Understanding antibiotic resistance mechanisms is central to the development of anti&#8208;infective therapies and genomics&#8208;based drug discovery. Yet, many knowledge gaps remain regarding the resistance strategies employed against novel types of antibiotics from less&#8208;explored producers such as anaerobic bacteria, among them the Clostridia. Through the use of genome editing and functional assays, we found that CtaZ confers self&#8208;resistance against the copper chelator and gyrase inhibitor closthioamide (CTA) in Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum. Bioinformatics, biochemical analyses, and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed CtaZ as a founding member of a new group of GyrI&#8208;like proteins. CtaZ is unique in binding a polythioamide scaffold in a ligand&#8208;optimized hydrophobic pocket, thereby confining CTA. By genome mining using CtaZ as a handle, we discovered previously overlooked homologs encoded by diverse members of the phylum Firmicutes, including many pathogens. In addition to characterizing both a new role for a GyrI&#8208;like domain in self&#8208;resistance and unprecedented thioamide binding, this work aids in uncovering related drug&#8208;resistance mechanisms.

         <title>Umpolung in a Pair of Cobalt(III) Terminal Imido/Imidyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to a CoIII terminal imidyl radical complex was provided by one&#8208;electron oxidation of a CoIII terminal imido precursor. Oxidation of the CoIII terminal imido to its imidyl redox isomer facilitates intramolecular migratory insertion reactions of the imido with an NHC ligand by a switch of mechanism through umpolung of the imido ligand.







Abstract
Reaction of the CoI complex [(TIMMNmes)CoI](PF6) (1) (TIMMNmes=tris&#8208;[2&#8208;(3&#8208;mesityl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;methyl]amine) with mesityl azide yields the CoIII imide [(TIMMNmes)CoIII(NMes)](PF6) (2). Oxidation of 2 with [FeCp2](PF6) provides access to a rare CoIII imidyl [(TIMMNmes)Co(NMes)](PF6)2 (3). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry and EPR spectroscopy confirm the molecular structure of 3 and its S=
 ground state. ENDOR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and computational analyses indicate a ligand&#8208;based oxidation; thus, an imidyl&#8208;radical electronic structure for 3. Migratory insertion of one ancillary NHC to the imido ligand in 2 gives the CoI N&#8208;heterocyclic imine (4) within 12&#8197;h. Conversely, it takes merely 0.5&#8197;h for 3 to transform to the CoII congener (5). The migratory insertion in 2 occurs via a nucleophilic attack of the imido ligand at the NHC to give 4, whereas in 3, a nucleophilic attack of the NHC at the electrophilic imidyl ligand yields 5. The reactivity shunt upon oxidation of 2 to 3 confirms an umpolung of the imido ligand.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Molybdenum&#8208;N3 Sites for Selective Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adsorption and hydrogenation of CO2 to CO is reported over single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety. Density functional theory studies and experimental studies provide additional evidence to support the observed activity. A high and stable conversion of CO2 is attained up to 30.4&#8201;% with a 100&#8201;% CO selectivity.







Abstract
The design of efficient non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to fuels and chemicals is desired yet remains a challenge. Herein, we report that single Mo atoms with a MoN3 (pyrrolic) moiety enable remarkable CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation to CO, as predicted by density functional theory studies and evidenced by a high and stable conversion of CO2 reaching about 30.4&#8201;% with a CO selectivity of almost 100&#8201;% at 500&#8201;&#176;C and very low H2 partial pressure. Atomically dispersed MoN3 is calculated to facilitate CO2 activation and reduces CO2 to CO* via the direct dissociation path. Furthermore, the highest transition state energy in CO formation is 0.82&#8197;eV, which is substantially lower than that of CH4 formation (2.16&#8197;eV) and accounts for the dominant yield of CO. The enhanced catalytic performances of Mo/NC originate from facile CO desorption with the help of dispersed Mo on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (Mo/NC), and in the absence of Mo nanoparticles. The resulting catalyst preserves good stability without degradation of CO2 conversion rate even after 68&#8197;hours of continuous reaction. This finding provides a promising route for the construction of highly active, selective, and robust single&#8208;atom non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing photoresponsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials is an essential step for biosensing and biomedical applications. However, fabricating CPL assemblies rooted in the chirality amplification and transmission of the molecular building blocks, which simultaneously show photo&#8208;controllable CPL signals, remains challenging. Herein, a molecular building block containing an overcrowded&#8208;alkene core and bis&#8208;  PBI  (  MPBI  ) was designed. Importantly, the enantiopure  MPBI  can self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;organized nanofibers via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions and enable the transmission of the intrinsic chirality, providing opposite CPL signals. The photoisomerization of  MPBI  induced a transformation from nanofibers to discrete nanospheres, accompanied by a gradually decreased CPL signal. The results demonstrated the development of photo&#8208;controllable CPL materials from the assembly of chiral  MPBI  , which provides an alternatively facile strategy to fabricate CPL&#8208;active materials and would offer opportunities for future biosensing and biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The Interaction of K and O2 on Au(111): Multiple Growth Modes of Potassium Oxide and Their Catalytic Activity for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In industrial catalysis, alkali cations are frequently used to promote activity or selectivity. Scanning tunneling microscopy, ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelecron spectroscopy, and density&#8208;functional calculations were used to study the structure and reactivity of potassium oxides in contact with the Au(111) surface. Three different types of oxides (K  2  O  2  , K  2  O and KO  y  with y &lt; 0.5) were observed on top of the gold substrate at 300&#8208;525 K. Initially, small aggregates of K  2  O  2  /K  2  O (1&#8208;2nm in size) were seen at the elbows of the herringbone structure. After increasing the K coverage (&gt; 0.15 ML), large islands of the oxide (20&#8208;40 nm in size) appeared. These islands contained a mixture of K  2  O and KO  y  (y &lt; 0.5). A key correlation was found involving the structure, oxidation state, and chemical activity of the alkali oxide. The small aggregates of potassium oxide had a very high catalytic activity for the oxidation of CO, being much more than plain promoters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Double&#8208;Helix Metal&#8208;Chain Metal&#8208;Organic Framework as a High&#8208;Output Triboelectric Nanogenerator Material for Self&#8208;Powered Anticorrosion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel metal organic framework (MOF) friction power generation materials with high stability is important. This paper reports the first example of a double helical metal chain organic framework with a network structure (ZUT&#8208;8). ZUT&#8208;8 shows high chemical stability, functional adjustability, and excellent output performance of friction power generation, which is superior to traditional coordination polymer materials. The cathodic protection system with ZUT&#8208;8 can prevent metal corrosion significantly. The output performance can be improved effectively by enhancing the conjugate effect of the linker. The theoretical calculation results showed that an increase in the degree of conjugation could significantly reduce the bandgap, thereby affecting the friction power output signal. This study opens the door to constructing MOF materials with a double&#8208;helix metal chain and will promote their potential applications in self&#8208;powered electrochemical cathodic protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H Functionalization of Alkyl Benzene Derivatives via Cooperative Catalysis of Gold/Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric para&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H bond functionalization of alkyl benzene derivatives was successfully developed via cooperative catalysis of gold and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA), leading to synthetically useful chiral 1,1&#8208;diaryl motifs. Chiral phosphoric acid, ligand, and molecular sieves were found crucial for enantioselectivity control of this transformation. The salient features of this protocol include mild conditions, high efficiency, commercially available starting materials, highly chemo&#8208; and site&#8208; as well as enantioselective aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization, broad substrate scope, and extensive applications of the chiral products. The mechanistic studies suggested that two CPAs might be involved in chiral induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale View of Protein&#8211;PEG Interactions that Redirect the Thermal Unfolding Pathway of PEGylated Human Galectin&#8208;3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PEGylation is one of the most promising approaches to address the central challenge of applying biologics: i.e. the lack of protein stability in the demanding environment of the human body.&#160; Wider application of PEGylation is hindered by the lack of atomic level understanding of protein&#8208;PEG interactions, preventing design of conjugates with predicted properties.&#160; We deployed an integrative structural and biophysical approach to address this critical challenge with the PEGylated carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin&#8208;3 (Gal3C), a lectin essential for cellular adhesion and potential biologic.&#160;&#160; PEGylation dramatically increased Gal3C thermal stability and redirected its unfolding pathway through forming a stable intermediate.&#160; Structural details of Gal3C&#8208;PEG revealed by NMR pointed to the important role of PEG localization, and we identified charged amino acids bordering the Gal3C&#8208;PEG interface that were especially important in controlling localization. &#160;Replacing these residues altered the protein&#8208;PEG interface and thermal unfolding behavior, providing a strategy for rationally designing conjugates while maintaining the benefits of PEGylation.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Membrane&#8208;Protein Binding Kinetics and Cell&#8211;Surface Adhesion Using Plasmonic Scattering Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM) is an excellent platform for in situ studying cell&#8208;substrate interactions. However, SPRM suffers from poor spatial resolution and small field of view. Herein, we demonstrate plasmonic scattering microscopy (PSM) by adding a dry objective on a popular prism&#8208;coupled surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system. PSM not only retains SPRM&#8217;s high sensitivity and real&#8208;time analysis capability, but also provides ~7 times higher spatial resolution and ~70 times larger field of view than the typical SPRM, thus providing more details about membrane protein response to ligand binding on over 100 cells simultaneously. In addition, PSM allows quantifying the target movements in the axial direction with a high spatial resolution, thus allowing mapping adhesion spring constants for quantitatively describing the mechanical properties of the cell&#8208;substrate contacts. This work may offer a powerful and cost&#8208;effective strategy for upgrading current SPR products.</dc:description>
