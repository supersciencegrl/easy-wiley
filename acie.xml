         <title>Recognition of the True and False Resonance Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong influence of electronic circular dichroism on the measurement of resonance Raman optical activity of colorful chiral compounds is reported for a series of vitamin B12 derivatives. Neglecting this effect can lead to misinterpretation of recorded spectra, and seriously erroneous conclusions about molecular structure and chirality.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) possesses all aspects of a sensitive tool for molecular detection, but its measurement remains challenging. We demonstrate that reliable recording of RROA of chiral colorful compounds is possible, but only after considering the effect of the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) on the ROA spectra induced by the dissolved chiral compound. We show RROA for a number of model vitamin B12 derivatives that are chemically similar but exhibit distinctively different spectroscopic behavior. The ECD/ROA effect is proportional to the concentration and dependent on the optical pathlength of the light propagating through the sample. It can severely alter relative band intensities and signs in the natural RROA spectra. The spectra analyses are supported by computational modeling based on density functional theory. Neglecting the ECD effect during ROA measurement can lead to misinterpretation of the recorded spectra and erroneous conclusions about the molecular structure.

         <title>Understanding and Calibration of Charge Storage Mechanism in Cyclic Voltammetry Curves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance, and diffusive capacity are achieved from the CV curves of typical electrode materials for metal&#8208;ion batteries after three successive treatments including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background as well as non&#8208;linear fitting calculation, offering a more rational and reliable method to calculate the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution.







Abstract
Noticeable pseudo&#8208;capacitance behavior out of charge storage mechanism (CSM) has attracted intensive studies because it can provide both high energy density and large output power. Although cyclic voltammetry is recognized as the feasible electrochemical technique to determine it quantitatively in the previous works, the results are inferior due to uncertainty in the definitions and application conditions. Herein, three successive treatments, including de&#8208;polarization, de&#8208;residual and de&#8208;background, as well as a non&#8208;linear fitting algorithm are employed for the first time to calibrate the different CSM contribution of three typical cathode materials, LiFePO4, LiMn2O4 and Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7, and achieve well&#8208;separated physical capacitance, pseudo&#8208;capacitance and diffusive contributions to the total capacity. This work can eliminate misunderstanding concepts and correct ambiguous results of the pseudo&#8208;capacitance contribution and recognize the essence of CSM in electrode materials.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Cobalt Diselenide with Cubic Phase Maintained for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When an electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) based on cubic CoSe2 was doped with the light element nitrogen, the electronic structure was modulated while the highly symmetric crystal structure phase was maintained. This nitrogen&#8208;doped CoSe2 shows enhanced alkaline HER electrocatalytic activity, while no structural reconstruction occurs during the HER process.







Abstract
The introduction of heteroatoms is one of the most important ways to modulate the intrinsic electronic structure of electrocatalysts to improve their catalytic activity. However, for transition metal chalcogenides with highly symmetric crystal structure (HS&#8208;TMC), the introduction of heteroatoms, especially those with large atomic radius, often induces large lattice distortion and vacancy defects, which may lead to structural phase transition of doped materials or structural phase reconstruction during the catalytic reaction. Such unpredictable situations will make it difficult to explore the connection between the intrinsic electronic structure of doped catalysts and catalytic activity. Herein, taking thermodynamically stable cubic CoSe2 phase as an example, we demonstrate that nitrogen incorporation can effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of HS&#8208;TMC with structural phase stability and thus promote its electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution activity (HER). In contrast, the introduction of phosphorus can lead to structural phase transition from cubic CoSe2 to orthorhombic phase, and the structural phase of phosphorus&#8208;doped CoSe2 is unstable for HER.

         <title>18.77% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Promoted by Aqueous Solution Processed Cobalt(II) Acetate Hole Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust hole transporting layer (HTL), using the cost&#8208;effective Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O) as the precursor, was simply processed from its aqueous solution followed by thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments. The TA treatment induced the loss of crystal water followed by oxidization of Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O precursor, which increased the work function. However, TA treatment differently realize a high work function and ideal morphology for charge extraction. The resulting problems could be circumvented easily by additional UVO treatment, which also enhanced the conductivity and lowered the resistance for charge transport. The optimal condition was found to be a low temperature TA (150  o  C) followed by simple UVO, where the crystal water in Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O was removed fully and the HTL surface was anchored by substantial hydroxy groups. Using PM6 as the polymer donor and L8&#8208;BO as the electron acceptor, a record high PCE of 18.77% was achieved, higher than the common PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based solar cell devices (18.02%).</dc:description>

         <title>Inside a Shell &#8211; Organometallic Catalysis Inside Encapsulin Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization of chemical reactions inside cells are a fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self&#8208;assembling protein&#8208;based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that present a highly attractive platform for intracellular compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using smFRET and 3D&#8208;MINFLUX analysis, we analyze fluorescently&#8208;labeled encapsulins on a single molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a synthetic ruthenium catalyst  via  covalent attachment to a non&#8208;native host protein, we are able to perform  in vitro  catalysis and go on to show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Molecularly Imprinted Enzyme Inhibitors: From Simple Activity Inhibition to Pathological Cell Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid&#8208;phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs which exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion&#8208;induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin&#8208;dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells.

However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid-phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs which exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion-induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin-dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells. Our work demonstrates the versatility of MIEIs for both enzyme inhibition and cell fate manipulation, showing their great potential as therapeutic drugs in biomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microporous Carbon Nitride (C3N5.4) with Tetrazine based Molecular Structure for Efficient Adsorption of CO2 and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new class of microporous carbon nitride with rich nitrogen moieties templated from zeolite shows periodic porosity with a unique CN framework and enhanced active sites that triggered high selective sensing owing to the high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen species.







Abstract
Mesoporous carbon nitrides with C3N5 and C3N6 stoichiometries created a new momentum in the field of organic metal&#8208;free semiconductors owing to their unique band structures and high basicity. Here, we report on the preparation of a novel graphitic microporous carbon nitride with a tetrazine based chemical structure and the composition of C3N5.4 using ultra&#8208;stable Y zeolite as the template and aminoguanidine hydrochloride, a high nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule, as the CN precursor. Spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the prepared material exhibits a new molecular structure, which comprises two tetrazines and one triazine rings in the unit cell and is thermodynamically stable. The resultant carbon nitride shows an outstanding surface area of 130.4&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and demonstrates excellent CO2 adsorption per unit surface area of 47.54&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is due to the existence of abundant free NH2 groups, basic sites and microporosity. The material also exhibits highly selective sensing over water molecules (151.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and aliphatic hydrocarbons due to its unique microporous structure with a high amount of hydrophilic nitrogen moieties and recognizing ability towards small molecules.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg Olefination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded alkenes are expeditiously prepared by the versatile Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination and have remarkable applications as functional molecules endowed by their unique stereochemical features. The induced stereodynamics thereby enable the controlled motion of molecular switches and motors while the high configurational stability prevents undesired isomeric scrambling that would impact their essential molecular topology. Bistricyclic aromatic enes are prototypical overcrowded alkenes with outstanding stereochemical properties, but their stereocontrolled preparation is challenging and was thus far only feasible in stereospecific reactions and by the use of chiral auxiliaries. Here, we now report that direct catalyst control is achieved by means of a stereoselective Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination with enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol in the preparation of various bistricyclic aromatic enes. Using Rh2(S&#8208;PTAD)4  as catalyst, several diazo compounds were selectively coupled with a thioketone to give one of the four  anti  &#8208;folded overcrowded alkene stereoisomers upon reduction. Moreover, complete stereodivergence was reached by catalyst control in combination with distinct thiirane reductions, providing access to all four stereoisomers with an e.r. of up to 99:1. We envision that the catalyst controlled synthesis of overcrowded alkenes and the possibility for stereodivergence in the Barton&#8211;Kellogg olefination will provide a direct and effective route for a broad range of topologically unique overcrowded alkenes for functional molecules, catalysis, energy&#8208; and electron transfer, or bioactive compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK&#8208;GSK215&#8208;VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in vitro pharmacology compared to VS&#8208;4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long&#8208;lasting effect on FAK levels (~96 h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK degradation biology in vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nonheme Mononuclear {FeNO}7 Complex that Produces N2O in the Absence of an Exogenous Reductant</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the first example of a nonheme, mononuclear {FeNO}7 complex that mediates the conversion of NO to N2O in the absence of an external reductant. A new mononuclear, 5&#8208;coordinate FeII complex is synthesized, which binds nitric oxide to form the {FeNO}7 complex. This complex exhibits a highly activated NO ligand as seen by RR spectroscopy, and generates N2O in THF upon addition of H2O.







Abstract
A new nonheme iron(II) complex, FeII(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (1), is reported. Reaction of 1 with NO(g) gives a stable mononitrosyl complex Fe(NO)(Me3TACN)((OSiPh2)2O) (2), which was characterized by M&#246;ssbauer (&#948;=0.52&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1, |&#916;EQ|=0.80&#8197;mm&#8201;s&#8722;1), EPR (S=3/2), resonance Raman (RR) and Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies. The data show that 2 is an {FeNO}7 complex with an S=3/2 spin ground state. The RR spectrum (&#955;exc=458&#8197;nm) of 2 combined with isotopic labeling (15N, 18O) reveals &#957;(N&#8208;O)=1680&#8197;cm&#8722;1, which is highly activated, and is a nearly identical match to that seen for the reactive mononitrosyl intermediate in the nonheme iron enzyme FDPnor (&#957;(NO)=1681&#8197;cm&#8722;1). Complex 2 reacts rapidly with H2O in THF to produce the N&#8208;N coupled product N2O, providing the first example of a mononuclear nonheme iron complex that is capable of converting NO to N2O in the absence of an exogenous reductant.

         <title>Mo2C/C Hierarchical Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow Spheres as Sulfur Host for Advanced Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo2C/C hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres with mesoporous thick inner shell and microporous thin outer shell are proposed as an ideal sulfur host for Li&#8208;S batteries. The double&#8208;shelled spheres demonstrate superior structual and compositional advantages when employed as cathode material in Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
One of the major challenges regarding the sulfur cathode of Li&#8208;S batteries is to achieve high sulfur loading, fast Li ions transfer, and the suppression of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling. This issue can be solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N&#8208;doped carbon hierarchical double&#8208;shelled hollow spheres (Mo2C/C HDS&#8208;HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS&#8208;HSs achieve high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double&#8208;shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation.

     alt="Mo2C/C Hierarchical Double-Shelled Hollow Spheres as Sulfur Host for Advanced Li-S Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C/C hierarchical double-shelled hollow spheres with mesoporous thick inner shell and microporous thin outer shell are proposed as an ideal sulfur host for Li-S batteries. The double-shelled spheres demonstrate superior structual and compositional advantages when employed as cathode material in Li-S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges regarding the sulfur cathode of Li-S batteries is to achieve high sulfur loading, fast Li ions transfer, and the suppression of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttling. This issue can be solved by the development of molybdenum carbide decorated N-doped carbon hierarchical double-shelled hollow spheres (Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C/C HDS-HSs). The mesoporous thick inner shell and the central void of the HDS-HSs achieve high sulfur loading, facilitate the ion/electrolyte penetration, and accelerate charge transfer. The microporous thin outer shell suppresses LiPSs shuttling and reduces the charge/mass diffusion distance. The double-shelled hollow structure accommodates the volume expansion during lithiation. Furthermore, Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C/C composition renders the HDS-HSs cathode with improved conductivity, enhanced affinity to LiPSs, and accelerated kinetics of LiPSs conversion. The structural and compositional advantages render the Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C/C/S HDS-HSs electrode with high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and ultra-long cycling stability in the composed Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Applying Machine Learning to Rechargeable Batteries: From the Microscale to the Macroscale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview focuses on applying machine learning methods to lithium batteries&#8212;from the microscale to the macroscale&#8212;in combination with multiscale simulations, characterization techniques, and electrochemical tests. Machine learning enables the development of advanced theoretical and experimental tools, the mining of valuable information from datasets, and acceleration of strategy optimization for the design and management of battery materials.







Abstract
Emerging machine learning (ML) methods are widely applied in chemistry and materials science studies and have led to a focus on data&#8208;driven research. This Minireview summarizes the application of ML to rechargeable batteries, from the microscale to the macroscale. Specifically, ML offers a strategy to explore new functionals for density functional theory calculations and new potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, which are expected to significantly enhance the challenging descriptions of interfaces and amorphous structures. ML also possesses a great potential to mine and unveil valuable information from both experimental and theoretical datasets. A quantitative &#8220;structure&#8211;function&#8221; correlation can thus be established, which can be used to predict the ionic conductivity of solids as well as the battery lifespan. ML also exhibits great advantages in strategy optimization, such as fast&#8208;charge procedures. The future combination of multiscale simulations, experiments, and ML is also discussed and the role of humans in data&#8208;driven research is highlighted.

         <title>Investigations of the Alignment Process of PBPMLG: 2H NMR Analysis reveals a thermoresponsive 90&#176; Flip of the Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterated isotopologues of a thermoresponsive, glutamate&#8208;based alignment medium have been synthesized and investigated by 2H&#8197;NMR&#8208;spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry and polarized optical microscopy. The measurements show a flip of the polymeric &#945;&#8208;helix in lyotropic liquid crystalline phase, providing further insights into the alignment process of the polymer inside the magnetic field.







Abstract
The application of anisotropic parameters in NMR&#8208;spectroscopy enables the acquisition of spatial and angular information, complementary to those from conventional isotropic NMR&#8208;measurements. The use of alignment media is a well&#8208;established method for inducing anisotropy. PBPMLG is a recently discovered polyglutamate&#8208;based alignment medium, exhibiting thermoresponsive behavior in the lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) phase, thus offering potential for deeper understanding of the alignment process. We present one approach for investigating the thermoresponsive behavior by synthesizing specifically deuterated PBPMLG&#8208;isotopologues and their subsequent analyses using 2H&#8197;NMR&#8208;spectroscopy. It was possible to relate the observed thermoresponsive behavior to a flip of the polymer with respect to the external magnetic field&#8212;an effect never observed before in glutamate&#8208;based polymeric alignment media. Furthermore, a solvent&#8208;induced temperature dependent gelation was verified in THF, which might provide yet another opportunity to manipulate the properties of this alignment medium in the future.

         <title>After 200 Years: The Structure of Bleach and Characterization of Hypohalite Ions by Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We fill a gap in fundamental and applied chemistry by providing the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structure characterization of hypohalite ions, including sodium hypochlorite: the active component of liquid bleach, in use as a bleaching agent and sanitizer for at least two centuries.







Abstract
We report the first X&#8208;ray single crystal structures of hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;) and hypobromite (BrO&#8722;) salts, including hydrated sodium hypochlorite, a staple of the chlorine industry and ubiquitous bleaching and disinfection agent for almost 200&#8197;years. The structures, supported by variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy on individual crystals and periodic density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide insight into solid&#8208;state geometry and supramolecular chemistry of hypohalite ions.

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Dithiane/Iodofluorobenzene Mixtures: A New Class of Hydrophobic Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While research into deep eutectic solvents (DESs) has expanded over the previous two decades, the focus has remained on the utilization of hydrogen bond donors in these systems. Additionally, the majority of the known DESs rely on at least one ionic component. Through the combination of 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), we report the first known DES based on halogen bonding. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic melting temperature of 13.7&#176;C over a range of 1,3&#8208;dithiane mole fraction (0.35 to 0.75). Additionally, cocrystals of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These data reveal a wide range of halogen bonding strengths (0.85 &lt; RXB &lt; 0.99; Rxb = normalized halogen bond distance parameter) and geometries about the sulfur atom. By including intermolecular interactions beyond hydrogen bonding, the scope of possible DES systems can be greatly expanded.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright luminescence in three phases &#8211; A combined synthetic, spectroscopic and theoretical approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combining phase&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurements and quantum chemical calculations is a powerful approach to help understand the influence of the molecular surroundings on the PL properties. In this work, a phosphine functionalized amidinate was used to synthesize a bimetallic gold complex, featuring an unusual charge separation. The latter was subsequently used as metalloligand to yield heterotetrametallic complexes with an Au&#8208;M&#8208;M&#8208;Au &#8216;molecular wire&#8217; arrangement (M = Cu, Ag, Au) featuring metallophilic interactions. All compounds show bright phosphorescence in the solid state, also at ambient temperature. The effect of the molecular environment on the PL was studied in detail for these tetrametallic complexes by comparative measurements in solution, solid state as well as gas phase and contrasted to time&#8208;dependent density functional theory computations.</dc:description>

Directed evolution was used to improve dirhodium metalloenzyme (ArM)&#8208;catalyzed diazo cross&#8208;coupling yield and selectivity. The ArM was then used in cascade reactions where the alkene product was reduced by an ene reductase, with the ArM scaffold controlling chemoselectivity in the reaction mixture. MD simulations show that the cofactor modulates the domain dynamics and favors a more closed, hydrophobic pocket conducive to selective catalysis.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs) are commonly used to control the stereoselectivity of catalytic reactions, but controlling chemoselectivity remains challenging. In this study, we engineer a dirhodium ArM to catalyze diazo cross&#8208;coupling to form an alkene that, in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction, is reduced to an alkane with high enantioselectivity (typically &gt;99&#8201;% ee) by an alkene reductase. The numerous protein and small molecule components required for the cascade reaction had minimal effect on ArM catalysis. Directed evolution of the ArM led to improved yields and E/Z selectivities for a variety of substrates, which translated to cascade reaction yields. MD simulations of ArM variants were used to understand the structural role of the cofactor on ArM conformational dynamics. These results highlight the ability of ArMs to control both catalyst stereoselectivity and chemoselectivity to enable reactions in complex media that would otherwise lead to undesired side reactions.

         <title>Reclaiming Inactive Lithium with a Triiodide/Iodide Redox Couple for Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium (Li) metal batteries suffer from a short lifespan owing to apparently ceaseless inactive Li accumulation, which is accompanied by the consumption of electrolyte and active Li reservoir, seriously deteriorating the cyclability of batteries. Herein, a triiodide/iodide (I  3  &#8211;  /I  &#8211;  ) redox couple initiated by stannic iodide (SnI  4  ) is demonstrated to reclaim inactive Li. The reduction of I  3  &#8211;  converts inactive Li into soluble LiI, which then diffuses to the cathode side. The oxidation of LiI by the delithiated cathode transforms cathode into the lithiation state and regenerates I  3  &#8211;  , reclaiming Li ion from inactive Li. The regenerated I  3  &#8211;  engages the further redox reactions. Furthermore, the formation of Sn mitigates the corrosion of I  3  &#8211;  on active Li reservoir sacrificially. In working Li | LiNi  0.5  Co  0.2  Mn  0.3  O  2  batteries, the accumulated inactive Li is significantly reclaimed by the reversible I  3  &#8211;  /I  &#8211;  redox couple, improving the lifespan of batteries by twice. This work initiates a creative solution to reclaim inactive Li for prolonging the lifespan of practical Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Arylated Amines via C&#8722;N Coupling of Chiral Amines with Aryl Bromides Promoted by Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stereoretentive C&#8722;N coupling of optically active amines and amino acid esters with aryl bromides is achieved by nickel catalysis under light irradiation, without the use of any external photosensitizers.







Abstract
The Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8208;N coupling reaction has found widespread applications in organic synthesis. Over the past two decades or so, many improved catalysts have been introduced, allowing various amines and aryl electrophiles to be readily used nowadays. However, there lacks a protocol that could be used to couple a wide range of chiral amines and aryl halides, without erosion of the enantiomeric excess (ee). Reported in this article is a method based on molecular Ni catalysis driven by light, which enables stereoretentive C&#8208;N coupling of optically active amines, amino alcohols, and amino acid esters with aryl bromides, with no need for any external photosensitizer. The method is effective for a wide variety of coupling partners, including those bearing functional groups sensitive to bases and nucleophiles, thus providing a viable alternative to accessing synthetically important chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids esters. Its viability is demonstrated by 92 examples with up to 99&#8201;% ee.

         <title>Interfacial Defect of Lithium Metal in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling studied the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolytes with a wide range of lattice mismatch, and discovered an interfacial disordered Li defect layer at the interfaces and their roles in leading to the interfacial failure during lithium cycling.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery with Li metal anode is a promising rechargeable battery technology with high energy density and improved safety. Currently, the application of Li metal anode is plagued by the failure at the interfaces between lithium metal and solid electrolyte (SE). However, little is known about the defects at Li&#8211;SE interfaces and their effects on Li cycling, impeding further improvement of Li metal anodes. Herein, by performing large&#8208;scale atomistic modeling of Li metal interfaces with common SEs, we discover that lithium metal forms an interfacial defect layer of nanometer&#8208;thin disordered lithium at the Li&#8211;SE interfaces. This interfacial defect Li layer is highly detrimental, leading to interfacial failure such as pore formation and contact loss during Li stripping. By systematically studying and comparing incoherent, coherent, and semi&#8208;coherent Li&#8211;SE interfaces, we find that the interface with good lattice coherence has reduced Li defects at the interface and has suppressed interfacial failure during Li cycling. Our finding discovered the critical roles of atomistic lithium defects at interfaces for the interfacial failure of Li metal anode, and motivates future atomistic&#8208;level interfacial engineering for Li metal anode in solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Need for speed: An efficient and fast photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow has been realized by combining decatungstate photocatalysis and nickel catalysis. The methodology shows great functional group tolerance and high regioselectivity, and can be used for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various biologically&#8208;relevant molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report a photocatalytic procedure that enables the acylation/arylation of unfunctionalized alkyl derivatives in flow. The method exploits the ability of the decatungstate anion to act as a hydrogen atom abstractor and produce nucleophilic carbon&#8208;centered radicals that are intercepted by a nickel catalyst to ultimately forge C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds. Owing to the intensified conditions in flow, the reaction time can be reduced from 12&#8211;48&#8197;hours to only 5&#8211;15&#8197;minutes. Finally, kinetic measurements highlight how the intensified conditions do not change the reaction mechanism but reliably speed up the overall process.

         <title>Direct NO Reduction by a Biomimetic Iron(II) Pyrazolate MOF</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel iron(II) metal&#8211;organic framework containing accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers facilitates the direct reduction of NO to N2O.







Abstract
A novel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) containing one&#8208;dimensional, Fe2+ chains bridged by dipyrazolate linkers and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) ligands has been synthesized. The unusual chain&#8208;type metal nodes feature accessible coordination sites on adjacent metal centers, resulting in motifs that are reminiscent of the active sites in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes. The MOF facilitates direct reduction of nitric oxide (NO), producing nearly quantitative yields of nitrous oxide (N2O) and emulating the reactivity of flavodiiron nitric oxide reductases (FNORs). The ferrous form of the MOF can be regenerated via a synthetic cycle involving reduction with cobaltocene (CoCp2) followed by reaction with trimethylsilyl triflate (TMSOTf).

         <title>P&#8208;Block Atomically Dispersed Antimony Catalyst for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;block atomically dispersed antimony with Sb&#8722;N4 configuration has been developed and used as highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst. The excellent ORR activity is credited to the p orbital interaction between Sb cation and O2, which facilitate the charge transfer and generate appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
Main&#8208;group (s&#8208; and p&#8208;block) metals are generally regarded as catalytically inactive due to the delocalized s/p&#8208;band. Herein, we successfully synthesized a p&#8208;block antimony single&#8208;atom catalyst (Sb SAC) with the Sb&#8722;N4 configuration for efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The obtained Sb SAC exhibits superior ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V and excellent stability, which outperforms most transition&#8208;metal (TM, d&#8208;block) based SACs and commercial Pt/C. In addition, it presents an excellent power density of 184.6&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a high specific capacity (803.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) in Zn&#8211;air battery. Both experiment and theoretical calculation manifest that the active catalytic sites are positively charged Sb&#8722;N4 single&#8208;metal sites, which have closed d shells. Density of states (DOS) results unveil the p orbital of the atomically dispersed Sb cation in Sb SAC can easily interact with O2&#8208;p orbital to form hybrid states, facilitating the charge transfer and generating appropriate adsorption strength for oxygen intermediates, lowering the energy barrier and modulating the rate&#8208;determining step. This work sheds light on the atomic&#8208;level preparing p&#8208;block Sb metal catalyst for highly active ORR, and further provides valuable guidelines for the rational design of other main&#8208;group&#8208;metal SACs.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Mannolide&#8197;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;mannolide&#8197;C, a highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid is reported. The synthetic strategy features efficient double ring&#8208;closing metathesis reactions for the formation of the highly strained bowl&#8208;shaped 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic system.







Abstract
(+)&#8208;Mannolide&#8197;C is a complex hexacyclic C20 cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoid featuring a highly strained 7/6/6/5 tetracyclic core containing eight consecutive stereocenters and two bridging lactones. The first asymmetric total synthesis of (+)&#8208;mannolide&#8197;C has been accomplished by lipase&#8208;mediated resolution, Ru&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed double ring&#8208;closing metathesis (RCM) reactions, NiII&#8208;catalyzed diastereoselective Michael addition, and MnIII&#8208;catalyzed allylic oxidation as the key transformations.

         <title>{BiW8O30} Exerts Antitumor Effect by Triggering Pyroptosis and Upregulating Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. {BiW8} suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MG63 cells. We identified POM&#8208;induced pyroptosis for the first time. Decreased GSH content and increased ROS levels were observed in {BiW8}&#8208;treated cells. {BiW8} executed multiple antitumor mechanisms, such as activation of pyroptosis, regulation of oxidative stress, and inhibition of DNA repair.







Abstract
We successfully synthesized {BiW8}, a 10&#8208;nuclear heteroatom cluster modified {BiW8O30}. At 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, the IC50 values of {BiW8} against HUVEC, MG63, RD, Hep3B, HepG2, and MCF7 cells were 895.8, 127.3, 344.3, 455.0, 781.3, and 206.3&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The IC50 value of {BiW8} on the MG63 cells was more than 2&#8208;fold lower than that of the other raw materials. Through morphological and functional features, we demonstrated pyroptosis as a newly identified mechanism of cell death induced by {BiW8}. {BiW8} increased 2&#8208;fold reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in MG63 cells at 24&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation. Compared with 0&#8197;h, the glutathione (GSH) content decreased by 59, 65, 75, 94, and 97&#8201;% at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48&#8197;h post&#8208;incubation, respectively. Furthermore, multiple antitumor mechanisms of {BiW8} were identified via transcriptome analysis and chemical simulation, including activation of pyroptosis, suppression of GSH generation, depletion of GSH, and inhibition of DNA repair.

         <title>Effective and Rapid Removal of Polar Organic Micropollutants from Water by Amide Naphthotube&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing the biomimetic macrocyclic hosts, amide naphthotubes, are able to effectively and rapidly adsorb polar organic micropollutants from water by employing host&#8211;guest binding. The polymers can be readily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH at room temperature.







Abstract
It is challenging to remove polar organic micropollutants from water through adsorption&#8208;mediated processes. Macrocycle&#8208;crosslinked polymers were recently shown to be effective adsorbents for nonpolar or charged organic micropollutants through specific host&#8211;guest binding, but are rarely used for the treatment of neutral and polar organic micropollutants. This is due to the challenge of recognizing polar molecules in water by macrocyclic hosts. In this research, we report two amide naphthotube&#8208;crosslinked polymers which can effectively and rapidly adsorb a wide scope of polar organic micropollutants from water through biomimetic molecular recognition. Amide naphthotubes possess hydrogen bonding sites in their deep hydrophobic cavities and can effectively bind polar organic micropollutants in water through the hydrophobic effects and shielded hydrogen bonds. The cross&#8208;linked polymers containing amide naphthotubes are even able to remove a complex mixture of organic micropollutants from water and the used materials can be easily regenerated through washing with MeOH or EtOH. This research provides a solution for the treatment of polar organic micropollutants by using biomimetic molecular recognition in water.

         <title>[Ag(NH3)2]2SO4: A Strategy for the Coordination of Cationic Moieties to Design Nonlinear Optical Materials**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties offers a new possibility for the rational design and property modification of functional ionic materials, particularly NLO materials. As demonstrated by [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 and Ag2SO4, the exceptional enhancements of the linear birefringence and nonlinear SHG properties are attributed to the unique [Ag(NH3)2]+ cation moiety.







Abstract
Over recent decades, guided by the anionic group theory of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, rational design strategies have been primarily focused on anionic moieties; consequently, structural modification and design of cationic moieties have long been neglected. Herein, we report a strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties that substantially enhances the optical properties of NLO materials. For an example with well&#8208;known crystal structure, [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4, we demonstrate that the coordination of the Ag+ cation by the neutral ligand drives the formation of a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal P
21c structure as a positive uniaxial crystal. The bending of the [Ag(NH3)2]+ cationic moiety parallel to the z&#8208;axis generates an anisotropic arrangement of the dipoles, i.e., a dipole of 0.12&#8197;D along the z&#8208;direction, yet zero dipole in the xy&#8208;plane, which interacts anisotropically with the incident light oscillating electromagnetic wave, leading to optical anisotropy with a large birefringence. The incident beam of 589.3&#8197;nm normal to the (110) crystal plane measures &#916;nobv.=0.08, and [Ag(NH3)2]2SO4 also exhibits a phase&#8208;matching NLO response 1.4 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) (obv. 1.4&#215;KDP @1064&#8197;nm; cal. d36=1.50&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1).

     alt="[Ag(NH3)2]2SO4: A Strategy for the Coordination of Cationic Moieties to Design Nonlinear Optical Materials**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties offers a new possibility for the rational design and property modification of functional ionic materials, particularly NLO materials. As demonstrated by [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the exceptional enhancements of the linear birefringence and nonlinear SHG properties are attributed to the unique [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation moiety.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over recent decades, guided by the anionic group theory of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, rational design strategies have been primarily focused on anionic moieties; consequently, structural modification and design of cationic moieties have long been neglected. Herein, we report a strategy for the coordination of cationic moieties that substantially enhances the optical properties of NLO materials. For an example with well-known crystal structure, [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, we demonstrate that the coordination of the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation by the neutral ligand drives the formation of a noncentrosymmetric tetragonal &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; structure as a positive uniaxial crystal. The bending of the [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cationic moiety parallel to the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-axis generates an anisotropic arrangement of the dipoles, i.e., a dipole of 0.12&#8197;D along the &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-direction, yet zero dipole in the &lt;i&gt;xy&lt;/i&gt;-plane, which interacts anisotropically with the incident light oscillating electromagnetic wave, leading to optical anisotropy with a large birefringence. The incident beam of 589.3&#8197;nm normal to the (110) crystal plane measures &#916;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>An Atomic Insight into the Chemical Origin and Variation of the Dielectric Constant in Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric constants of solutions at different temperatures and compositions are comprehensively probed by considering the significant role in regulating solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation structures of working liquid electrolytes.







Abstract
The dielectric constant is a crucial physicochemical property of liquids in tuning solute&#8211;solvent interactions and solvation microstructures. Herein the dielectric constant variation of liquid electrolytes regarding to temperatures and electrolyte compositions is probed by molecular dynamics simulations. Dielectric constants of solvents reduce as temperatures increase due to accelerated mobility of molecules. For solvent mixtures with different mixing ratios, their dielectric constants either follow a linear superposition rule or satisfy a polynomial function, depending on weak or strong intermolecular interactions. Dielectric constants of electrolytes exhibit a volcano trend with increasing salt concentrations, which can be attributed to dielectric contributions from salts and formation of solvation structures. This work affords an atomic insight into the dielectric constant variation and its chemical origin, which can deepen the fundamental understanding of solution chemistry.

         <title>A Color&#8208;Shifting Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescent Aptamer&#8211;Fluorophore Module for Live&#8208;Cell RNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;shifting, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent aptamer&#8211;fluorophore module based on benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin (BC) fluorophores for ratiometric RNA imaging is reported. Free BC is cyan fluorescent, however its fluorescence emission shifts to NIR upon complexation with the BC&#8208;binding aptamer (BeCA). This system enabled the visualization of mRNAs in the NIR region and the ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.







Abstract
Fluorescent light&#8208;up RNA aptamers (FLAPs) have become promising tools for visualizing RNAs in living cells. Specific binding of FLAPs to their non&#8208;fluorescent cognate ligands results in a dramatic fluorescence increase, thereby allowing RNA imaging. Here, we present a color&#8208;shifting aptamer&#8208;fluorophore system, where the free dye is cyan fluorescent and the aptamer&#8208;dye complex is near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent. Unlike other reported FLAPs, this system enables ratiometric RNA imaging. To design the color&#8208;shifting system, we synthesized a series of environmentally sensitive benzopyrylium&#8208;coumarin hybrid fluorophores which exist in equilibrium between a cyan fluorescent spirocyclic form and a NIR fluorescent zwitterionic form. As an RNA tag, we evolved a 38&#8208;nucleotide aptamer that selectively binds the zwitterionic forms with nanomolar affinity. We used this system as a light&#8208;up RNA marker to image mRNAs in the NIR region and demonstrated its utility in ratiometric analysis of target RNAs expressed at different levels in single cells.

         <title>Highly Efficient Oxidative Cyanation of Aldehydes to Nitriles over Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;Doped Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets (Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000) show high activity and selectivity for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes to synthesize organic nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource. Other oxidizable groups were tolerated, and no further reaction of the product was observed over Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000.







Abstract
Oxidative cyanation of aldehydes provides a promising strategy for the cyanide&#8208;free synthesis of organic nitriles. Design of robust and cost&#8208;effective catalysts is the key for this route. Herein, we designed a series of Se,S,N&#8208;tri&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets with a hierarchical porous structure (denoted as Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;x, x represents the pyrolysis temperature). It was found that the obtained Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 was very selective and efficient for oxidative cyanation of various aldehydes including those containing other oxidizable groups into the corresponding nitriles using ammonia as the nitrogen resource below 100&#8201;&#176;C. Detailed investigations revealed that the excellent performance of Se,S,N&#8208;CNs&#8208;1000 originated mainly from the graphitic&#8208;N species with lower electron density and synergistic effect between the Se, S, N, and C in the catalyst. Besides, the hierarchically porous structure could also promote the reaction. Notably, the unique feature of this metal&#8208;free catalyst is that it tolerated other oxidizable groups, and showed no activity on further reaction of the products, thereby resulting in high selectivity. As far as we know, this is the first work for the synthesis of nitriles via oxidative cyanation of aldehydes over heterogeneous metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Hydrogen Bonding of B3N6&#8208;[4]Triangulene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is isoelectronic to the trianion of [4]triangulene, represents a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride. The tert&#8208;butylated derivative of B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene is synthesized by threefold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation. Its fluorescence in solution is responsive to binding p&#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through H&#8208;bonds, and it forms DD&#8208;AA H&#8208;bond arrays with di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrenetetraone in the co&#8208;crystal.







Abstract
Replacement of the allylic C=C&#8722;C unit with a N&#8722;B&#8722;N unit at each of the three zigzag edges of [4]triangulene gives rise to B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene, which is envisioned to represent a key structural unit of a new hypothetical boron carbon nitride (BC4N). A tert&#8208;butylated B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three&#8208;fold nitrogen&#8208;directed borylation, and the X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;&#8208;electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8722;B&#8722;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen&#8208;bond donor, which forms H&#8208;bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD&#8208;AA hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays with 2,7&#8208;di(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone in the co&#8208;crystal. Moreover, the blue fluorescence of B3N6&#8208;[4]triangulene in solution is responsive to binding p&#8208;nitrobenzoate anion through hydrogen bonds.

A &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butylated B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-[4]triangulene has been successfully synthesized by three-fold nitrogen-directed borylation, and the X-ray crystallographic analysis indicates that its slightly bent triangular polycyclic framework can be viewed as a 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene connected by three 4&#960;-electron N&#8722;B&#8722;N units. The HN&#8722;B&#8722;NH moiety provides a dual hydrogen-bond donor, which forms H-bonds with halide or carboxylate anions in solution, and form DD-AA hydrogen-bond arrays with 2,7-di(&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl)-pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone in the co-crystal. Moreover, the blue fluorescence of B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-[4]triangulene in solution is responsive to binding &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzoate anion through hydrogen bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation of Racemic Diastereomers: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Michael&#8211;Henry Reactions to Afford Spirooxindoles Bearing Furan&#8208;Fused Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalytic Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions that occur through dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformations of racemic diastereomers having central and axial chiralities have been developed for the synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused ring systems. The products, with four new chiral carbon centers, were obtained as single diastereomers in high yields with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation (DYKAT) reactions of racemic diastereomer mixtures that afford the products as essentially single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities are described. We demonstrated the DYKAT in the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of spirooxindoles bearing furan&#8208;fused rings. The starting materials of the DYKAT, dihydrobenzofuranone derivatives, were synthesized in racemic diastereomer mixtures, and these were transformed to the spirooxindole derivatives in high yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities through Michael&#8211;Henry cascade reactions with nitrostyrenes under organocatalytic conditions. In the reactions, regardless the stereochemistry of the starting materials, all the four isomers were transformed to single diastereomers with high enantioselectivities, and four new chiral centers were created.

         <title>Biomimetic Iron Complex Achieves TET Enzyme Reactivity**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ serves as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and short oligonucleotide strands serve as substrates. The 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably and highly selectively by the complex.







Abstract
The epigenetic marker 5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine (5mdC) is the most prevalent modification to DNA. It is removed inter alia via an active demethylation pathway: oxidation by Ten&#8208;Eleven Translocation 5&#8208;methyl cytosine dioxygenase (TET) and subsequent removal via base excision repair or direct demodification. Recently, we have shown that the synthetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo complex [FeIV(O)(Py5Me2H)]2+ (1) can serve as a biomimetic model for TET by oxidizing the nucleobase 5&#8208;methyl cytosine (5mC) to its natural metabolites. In this work, we demonstrate that nucleosides and even short oligonucleotide strands can also serve as substrates, using a range of HPLC and MS techniques. We found that the 5&#8208;position of 5mC is oxidized preferably by 1, with side reactions occurring only at the strand ends of the used oligonucleotides. A detailed study of the reactivity of 1 towards nucleosides confirms our results; that oxidation of the anomeric center (1&#8242;) is the most common side reaction.

         <title>Radical 1,4&#8208;Aryl Migration Enabled Remote Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Bromo Acid Esters with Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay strategy combines radical rearrangement and cross&#8208;coupling via a C(sp3)&#8208;centred radical, to produce valuable phenylalanine derivatives that are otherwise challenging to access. An N&#8208;benzyl amino acid ester functions as a molecular scaffold for the aryl migration reaction. The synthetic method offers mild reaction conditions, high diastereoselectivity, and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
We report an unprecedented, efficient nickel&#8208;catalysed radical relay for the remote cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of &#946;&#8208;bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;benzylamino acid esters with aryl bromides via 1,4&#8208;aryl migration/arylation cascades. &#946;&#8208;Bromo&#8208;&#945;&#8208;benzylamino acid esters are considered as unique molecular scaffolds allowing for aryl migration reactions, which are conceptually novel variants for the radical Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement. This reaction enables the formation of two new C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds using a bench&#8208;stable Ni/bipyridine/Zn system featuring a broad substrate scope and excellent diastereoselectivity, which provides an effective platform for the remote aryl group migration and arylation of amino acid esters via redox&#8208;neutral C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bond cleavage. Mechanistically, this cascade reaction is accomplished by combining two powerful catalytic cycles consisting of a cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and radical 1,4&#8208;aryl migration through the generation of C(sp3)&#8208;centred radical intermediates from the homolysis of C(sp3)&#8722;Br bonds and the switching of the transient alkyl radical into a robust &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl radical.

         <title>A Borondifluoride&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Photothermal Agent with an 80&#8201;% Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Photothermal Therapy in the NIR&#8208;II Window</title>

         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II absorbing BF2 complex with high photothermal performance was designed. The complex achieves a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation. In vivo studies reveal the great potential of the complex in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.







Abstract
Small organic photothermal agents (SOPTAs) that absorb in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) window are highly desirable in photothermal therapy for their good biocompatibility and deeper tissue penetration. However, the design of NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs remains a great challenge. Herein, we report that molecular engineering of BF2 complex via strengthening the donor&#8208;acceptor conjugation and increasing the intramolecular motions is an efficient strategy to achieve NIR&#8208;II absorbing SOPTAs with high photothermal performance. Based on this strategy, a BF2 complex, BAF4, was designed and synthesized. BAF4 exhibits an intense absorption maximum at 1000&#8197;nm and negligible fluorescence. Notably, the nanoparticles of BAF4 achieve a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 80&#8201;% under 1064&#8197;nm laser irradiation (0.75&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In vitro and in vivo studies reveal the great potential of BAF4 nanoparticles in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in the NIR&#8208;II window.

         <title>Regulating Local Electron Density of Iron Single Sites by Introducing Nitrogen Vacancies for Efficient Photo&#8208;Fenton Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as electron trap sites, thus directing photoelectrons to accumulate at Fe single sites under light illumination. The formation of a highly concentrated electron density at the Fe sites significantly improves the H2O2 conversion efficiency.







Abstract
The activity of heterogeneous photocatalytic H2O2 activation in Fenton&#8208;like processes is closely related to the local electron density of reaction centre atoms.

&lt;p&gt;Engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as electron trap sites, thus directing photoelectrons to accumulate at Fe single sites under light illumination. The formation of a highly concentrated electron density at the Fe sites significantly improves the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity of heterogeneous photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation in Fenton-like processes is closely related to the local electron density of reaction centre atoms. However, the recombination of electron-hole pairs arising from random charge transfer greatly restricts the oriented electron delivery to active center. Here we show a defect engineered iron single atom photocatalyst (Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/CN, single Fe atoms dispersed on carbon nitride with abundant nitrogen vacancies) for the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under visible light irradiation. Based on DFT calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy results, the engineered nitrogen vacancies serve as the electron trap sites, which can directionally drive the electrons to concentrate on Fe atoms. The formation of highly concentrated electrons density at Fe sites significantly improves the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion efficiency. Therefore, the optimized single atom catalyst exhibiting a higher ciprofloxacin degradation activity, which was up to 18 times that of pristine CN.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The structure of cyclodecatriene collinolactone, its biosynthesis and semisynthetic analogues: Effects of&#160;monoastral phenotype&#160;and protection from intracellular oxidative stress</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently described rhizolutin and collinolactone share the same novel carbon scaffold. Analyses by NMR and X&#8208;Ray crystallography prove the structure of collinolactone isolated from  Streptomyces  G&#246; 40/10 and propose a revision of rhizolutin&#8217;s stereochemistry. Isotope&#8208;labelled precursor feeding indicate that collinolactone is biosynthesized via type&#8208;I polyketide synthase with Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation. CRISPR based genetic strategies led to the biosynthetic gene cluster and a high&#8208;production strain. Chemical semisyntheses yielded collinolactone analogues with inhibitory effects on L929 cell line. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that analogues monopolar spindles impairing cell division in mitosis. Inspired by the Alzheimer&#8208;protective activity of rhizolutin, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of collinolactone analogues on glutamate&#8208;sensitive cells (HT22) and indeed, natural collinolactone points to distinct neuroprotection from intracellular oxidative stress.</dc:description>

         <title>The Reaction of Carbon Dioxide CO2 with A Borylnitrene: Formation of an 3&#8208;Oxaziridinone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of a borylnitrene with carbon dioxide is studied under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions. Photogenerated CatBN (Cat = catecholato) reacts with CO  2  under formation of the cycloaddition product CatBNCO  2  , a 3&#8208;oxaziridinone derivative, after photoexcitation (&gt; 550 nm). The product shows Fermi resonances between the CO stretching and ring deformation modes causes unusual  13  C and  18  O isotopic shifts. A computational analysis of the 3&#8208;oxaziridinone shows this cyclic carbamate to be less strained than an &#945;&#8208;lactone or an &#945;&#8208;lactame.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Nitrene&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Oxaziridination/1,2&#8208;Alkyl Rearrangement of 1,3&#8208;Diketones toward Bicyclic Lactams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although copper&#8208;nitrene has been extensively studied as a versatile active species in various transformations, asymmetric reactions involving copper&#8208;nitrene have been limited to the aziridination of olefins. Herein, we report the novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric oxaziridination reaction of cyclic diketones with alkyl azides and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting highly active intermediate, which produces a synthetically challenging chiral bicyclic lactam containing a quaternary carbon center. This procedure not only enriches the copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions, but also provides an alternative strategy to address the inherent challenges of catalytic asymmetric Schmidt reactions. This unique reaction could inspire the investigation of novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations and their reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutrophil Selective Fluorescent Probe Development through Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;cell Distinction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human neutrophils are the most abundant leukocytes and have been considered as the first line of defence in the innate immune system. Selective imaging of live neutrophils will facilitate&#160;  in situ  &#160;study of neutrophils in infection or inflammation event as well as clinical diagnosis. However, the small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based probe is absent for the discrimination of live neutrophils among different granulocytes in human blood. Herein, we report the first fluorescent probe&#160;  NeutropG  &#160;for the specific distinction and imaging of active neutrophils. The selective staining mechanism of&#160;  NeutropG  &#160;is elucidated as Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Live&#8208;cell Distinction (MOLD) through lipid droplet biogenesis with the help of ACSL and DGAT. Finally,&#160;  NeutropG  &#160;is applied to accurately quantify neutrophil levels in fresh blood samples by showing a high correlation with the current clinical method.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic and Radical Heptafluoroisopropoxylation with Redox&#8208;Active Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The heptafluoroisopropyl group (CF(CF  3  )  2  ) is prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals. However, the heptafluoroisopropoxylated (OCF(CF  3  )  2  ) biologically interesting compounds remain largely underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient access to these compounds. Herein, we disclose the practical and efficient heptafluoroisopropoxylation reactions through the invention of a series of redox&#8208;active  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  reagents. These reagents were readily prepared from the oxidative heptafluoroisopropylation of hydroxylamines with AgCF(CF  3  )  2  . The substitutions on the nitrogen atom significantly affected the properties and reactivities of  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  reagents. Accordingly, two types of  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  reagents including  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  phthalimide  A  and  N  &#8722;OCF(CF  3  )  2  benzotriazolium salt  O&#8217;  were used as OCF(CF  3  )  2  anion and radical precursors, respectively. This protocol enables the direct heptafluoroisopropoxylation of a range of substrates, such as alkyl halides, alcohols, alkenes, and (hetero)arenes, delivering the corresponding heptafluoroisopropoxylated products in moderate to excellent yields. Furthermore, the late&#8208;stage heptafluoroisopropoxylation of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals was also demonstrated. The X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction analysis revealed that the dihedral angle of C  Ar  &#8722;O&#8722;CF(CF  3  )  2  and aromatic planes was around 80&#176; in aryl heptafluoroisopropyl ethers (ArOCF(CF  3  )  2  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Single Particle Nanoelectrochemistry Reveals the Catalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Co3O4 Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co  3  O  4  nanocubes are evaluated concerning their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by means of single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) provides data on the electrocatalytic OER activity from several individual measurement areas covering one Co  3  O  4  nanocube. We were able to evaluate a comparatively high number of individual particles with sufficient statistical reproducibility. Single&#8208;particle&#8208;on&#8208;nanoelectrode measurements performed with the same Co  3  O  4  nanocubes provide, on the one hand, an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5 A&#8729;cm  &#8208;2  , and on the other hand, allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8 x 10  4  s  &#8208;1  at 1.92 V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such current densities combined with identical&#8208;location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring structural changes during electrocatalysis, specifically the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer. Combining the information from two independent single&#8208;entity electrochemistry measurements provides the basis for elucidating structure&#8208;activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well&#8208;define surface structure.</dc:description>

Scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM) provides data on the electrocatalytic OER activity from several individual measurement areas covering one Co  3  O  4  nanocube. We were able to evaluate a comparatively high number of individual particles with sufficient statistical reproducibility. Single-particle-on-nanoelectrode measurements performed with the same Co  3  O  4  nanocubes provide, on the one hand, an accelerated stress test at highly alkaline conditions with current densities of up to 5.5 A&#8729;cm  -2  , and on the other hand, allows to derive TOF values of up to 2.8 x 10  4  s  -1  at 1.92 V vs. RHE for surface Co atoms of a single cubic nanoparticle. Obtaining such current densities combined with identical-location transmission electron microscopy allows monitoring structural changes during electrocatalysis, specifically the formation of an oxy(hydroxide) surface layer. Combining the information from two independent single-entity electrochemistry measurements provides the basis for elucidating structure-activity relations of single electrocatalyst nanoparticles with well-define surface structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Zwitterionic Heterobimetallic Au&#8211;Fe Complex Supported by Bis(N&#8208;Heterocyclic Imine)Silyliumylidene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of the first bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic imine&#8208;stabilized chlorosilyliumylidene 1 is reported. Remarkably, consecutive reaction of 1 with PPh3AuCl and K2Fe(CO)4 gives rise to the unique heterobimetallic complex 1,2&#8208;(MesNHI)2&#8208;C2H4&#8208;ClSiAuFe(CO)4 (4). The overall neutral complex 4 bears an unusual linear Si&#8211;Au&#8211;Fe structure and a rare anagostic interaction between the d10&#8208;configured gold atom and a CH bond of the mesityl ligand. According to the computational analysis and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, the formal Fe&#8208;oxidation state remains at &#8211;II. Thus, the electronic structure of 4 is best described as an overall neutral &#8211; yet zwitterionic &#8211; heterobimetallic &#8220;Si(II)+&#8211;Au(I)+&#8211;Fe(&#8208;II)2&#8211;&#8220;&#8208;silylium&#173;ylidene complex, derived from double anion exchange. The computational analysis indicates strong hyperconjugative back donation from the gold(I) atom to the silyliumylidene ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Multicompositional Onion&#8208;like Nanoparticles via RAFT Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles of diameters in the range 100&#8211;150 nm comprising well&#8208;defined multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core has been conducted using surfactant&#8208;free aqueous macroRAFT emulsion polymerization. The imposed constraints on chain mobility as well as chemical incompatibility between the blocks result in microphase separation, leading to formation of an onion&#8208;like multilayered particle morphology with individual layer thicknesses of approximately 20 nm. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers as well as the number of layers can be tailored as desired, offering more complex particle design compared to approaches relying on self&#8208;assembly of preformed diblock copolymers within particles. Interestingly, microphase separation can occur in these nanoparticle&#8208;based systems under conditions where the corresponding bulk system would not likely result in microphase separation as predicted by theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to its great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self&#8208;assembly, it remains much unknown that how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self&#8208;assembly  via  halogen bond, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co&#8208;assemble with an achiral 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (  F  4  DIB)  and well&#8208;ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometre scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Media&#8208;Driven Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction Cascades with 1,3&#8208;Diynamides Leading Selectively to Either Indoles or Quinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

In the absence of TBAF, 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;alkynylindoles were the sole products, while the presence of TBAF switched the product formation to 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;alkenylquinolines.

         <title>Interfacial linkage and carbon encapsulation enable full solution&#8208;printed perovskite photovoltaics with prolonged lifespan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have witnessed an overwhelming success in their skyrocketed power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) within a short period, but a fully solution&#8208;processed fabrication of PSC multilayer stack has not been achieved. Herein, we report to fabricate the simplified PSCs with perovskite layer sandwiched and encapsulated between carbon&#8208;based electron transport layer (ETL) and counter electrode (CE) via a fully blade&#8208;coated process. A self&#8208;assembled monolayer of amphiphilic silane (AS) molecules on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate appeals to the fullerene ETL deposition and preserves its integrity against the solvent damage induced by perovskite precursor. The AS serves as a&#8220;molecular glue&#8221;to strengthen the adhesion toughness at the TCO/ETL interface via robust chemical interaction and bonding, which remarkably facilitates the interfacial charge extraction, increases the PCEs by 77% and reduces the hysteresis.  A champion PCE of 18.64% has been achieved for the fully&#8208;printed devices, which is one of the highest reported values for the carbon&#8208;based PSCs.  AS&#8208;assisted interfacial linkage and carbon materials&#8208;assisted self&#8208;encapsulation remakably enhance the stability of the resultant PSCs, which did not experience any performance degradation when stored at ambient conditions for more than 3000 hours. This work provides a novel strategy to tackle the incompatibility issue of depositing each functional layer by using a full solution process and offers an additional promise of constructing efficient perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronics with prolonged lifespan in a low&#8208;cost manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Tailored Active Site Proximity for the Efficient Production of Pentanoic Biofuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofuel production can be a viable option for alleviating current heavy reliance on fossil resources and the related carbon dioxide emission issue. Hydrodeoxygenation refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, we show that well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru metal nanoclusters (~ 1 nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one&#8208;pot hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. Furthermore, we have established and extended an understanding of the &#8216;intimacy criterion&#8217; in catalytic biomass valorization. These findings bring fundamental new understanding of HDO reactions over confined proximity sites, and may facilitate a new application potential for the practical production of pentanoic biofuels in biomass conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cyanine&#8208;Mediated Self&#8208;Assembly System for the Construction of a Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Nanodrug</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine groups introduced into DNA could increase the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and multiple drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanospheres. Therefore, cyanine&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly system provides an adaptable approach to prepare a two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrug.







Abstract
The combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy provides a We developed a simple and versatile approach to prepare a series of two&#8208;in&#8208;one nanodrugs through direct self&#8208;assembly of cyanine&#8208;labeled single&#8208;stranded DNA (Cys&#8208;DNA) and different types of drug molecules. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that the Cys introduced into the DNA could enhance the noncovalent interaction between Cys&#8208;DNA and drug molecules. More drug molecules were incorporated into Cys&#8208;DNA, tending to spontaneously form hybrid Cys&#8208;DNA/drug nanosphere. Such nanospheres serve as both carriers and cargoes, excluding the extra use of nontherapeutic excipients and showing ultrahigh drug loading capacity. Following this approach, an antisense oligonucleotides/doxorubicin nanodrug model was constructed, demonstrating the significant synergistic anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. As a proof of the concept, our study establishes a simple and reproducible two&#8208;in&#8208;one nucleic acid&#8208;based drug formulation.

         <title>Combination of Pseudo&#8208;Natural Product Design and Formal Natural Product Ring Distortion Yields Stereochemically and Biologically Diverse Pseudo&#8208;Sesquiterpenoid Alkaloids</title>

The combination of the conceptually complementary formal ring distortion&#8208; and pseudo&#8208;natural product strategies yields novel natural product&#8208;inspired bioactive pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of a new natural product&#8208;inspired compound class obtained by combining the conceptually complementary pseudo&#8208;natural product (pseudo&#8208;NP) design strategy and a formal adaptation of the complexity&#8208;to&#8208;diversity ring distortion approach. Fragment&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;sesquiterpene lactones, whose scaffolds can formally be viewed as related to each other or are obtained by ring distortion, were combined with alkaloid&#8208;derived pyrrolidine fragments by means of highly selective stereocomplementary 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. The resulting pseudo&#8208;sesquiterpenoid alkaloids were found to be both chemically and biologically diverse, and their biological performance distinctly depends on both the structure of the sesquiterpene lactone&#8208;derived scaffolds and the stereochemistry of the pyrrolidine fragment. Biological investigation of the compound collection led to the discovery of a novel chemotype inhibiting Hedgehog&#8208;dependent osteoblast differentiation

         <title>Asymmetric Enamide&#8211;Imine Tautomerism in the Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;amido tertiary allyl alcohols through chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8211;imine tautomerism is reported. Both dialkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;alkyl&#8208;disubstituted allyl alcohols were compatible with this protocol, generating &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imines and enamides with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient protocol for kinetic resolution of tertiary alcohols has been developed through an unprecedented asymmetric enamide&#8208;imine tautomerism process enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A broad range of racemic 2&#8208;arylsulfonamido tertiary allyl alcohols could be kinetically resolved with excellent kinetic resolution performances (with s&#8208;factor up to &gt;200). This method is particularly effective for a series of 1,1&#8208;dialkyl substituted allyl alcohols, which produced chiral tertiary alcohols that would be difficult to access via other asymmetric methods. Facile and versatile transformations of the chiral &#945;&#8208;hydroxy imine and enamide products, especially the efficient stereodivergent synthesis of all four stereoisomers of &#946;&#8208;amino tertiary alcohols using one enantiomer of the catalyst, demonstrated the value of this kinetic resolution method.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Tracking and Sensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ with a Single SERS Probe in the Live Brain: Toward Understanding Why Copper Ions Were Increased upon Ischemia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel SERS sensor was created for biosensing extracellular concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ simultaneously in the live brain. Using our powerful tool, three routes were discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ during ischemia: Cu+ and Cu2+ were transported from neurons; Cu+ and Cu2+ were released from the destroyed copper&#8208;containing proteins; and Cu+ was converted into Cu2+.







Abstract
The imbalance of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the brain is closely related to neurodegenerative diseases. However, it still lacks of effective analytical methods for simultaneously determining the concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+. Herein, we created a novel SERS probe (CuSP) to real&#8208;time track and accurately quantify extracellular concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the live brain. The present CuSP probe demonstrated specific ability for recognition of Cu+ and Cu2+ in a dual&#8208;recognition mode. Then, a microarray consisting of 8 CuSP probes with high tempo&#8208;spatial resolution and good accuracy was constructed for tracking and simultaneously biosensing of Cu+ and Cu2+ in the cerebral cortex of living brain. Using our powerful tool, it was found that that the concentrations of Cu2+ and Cu+ were increased by &#8776;4.26 and &#8776;1.80 times upon ischemia, respectively. Three routes were first discovered for understanding the mechanisms of the increased concentrations of Cu+ and Cu2+ during ischemia.

         <title>MnO2 Electrocatalysts Coordinating Alcohol Oxidation for Ultra&#8208;Durable Hydrogen and Chemical Productions in Acidic Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a strategy of using a low&#8208;cost acidic aqueous solution of alcohols for efficient hydrogen/chemical co&#8208;production. The as&#8208;prepared non&#8208;precious metal MnO2/carbon paper electrocatalyst in combination with alcohol oxidation demonstrates a significantly decreased total energy input for hydrogen production and ultra&#8208;high durability in acidic electrolytes.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen production under acidic conditions is of great importance for industrialization in comparison to that in alkaline media, which, unfortunately, still remains challenging due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant, cost&#8208;effective and highly active anodic electrocatalysts that can be used durably under strongly acidic conditions. Here we report an unexpected finding that manganese oxide, a kind of common non&#8208;noble catalysts easily soluble in acidic solutions, can be applied as a highly efficient and extremely durable anodic electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from an acidic aqueous solution of alcohols. Particularly in a glycerol solution, a potential of as low as 1.36&#8197;V (vs. RHE) is needed at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is 270&#8197;mV lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), to oxidize glycerol into value&#8208;added chemicals such as formic acid, without oxygen production. To our surprise, the manganese oxide exhibits extremely high stability for electrocatalytic hydrogen production in coupling with glycerol oxidation for longer than 865 hours compared to shorter than 10&#8197;h for OER. Moreover, the effect of the addition of glycerol on the electrochemical durability has been probed via in&#8197;situ Raman spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work demonstrates that acid&#8208;unstable metal oxide electrocatalysts can be used robustly in acidic media under the presence of certain substances for electrochemical purposes, such as hydrogen production.

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Ketones Catalyzed by Engineered TrpB</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ketone&#8208;derived enolates can serve as nucleophiles for tryptophan synthase &#946;&#8208;subunit (TrpB) catalysed reactions. The transient nucleophilic enolate species is intercepted by TrpB, which facilitates selective C&#8722;C bond formation, resulting in the asymmetric alkylation of ketones such as propiophenone and 2&#8208;fluoroacetophenone. The products spontaneously cyclize to form highly substituted nitrogen heterocycles that can be reduced to form proline analogs.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;subunit of tryptophan synthase (TrpB) catalyzes a PLP&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;substitution reaction between indole and serine to form L&#8208;Trp. A succession of TrpB protein engineering campaigns to expand the enzyme's nucleophile substrate range has enabled the biocatalytic production of diverse non&#8208;canonical amino acids (ncAAs). Here, we show that ketone&#8208;derived enolates can serve as nucleophiles in the TrpB reaction to achieve the asymmetric alkylation of ketones, an outstanding challenge in synthetic chemistry. We engineered TrpB by directed evolution to catalyze the asymmetric alkylation of propiophenone and 2&#8208;fluoroacetophenone with a high degree of selectivity. In reactions with propiophenone, preference for the opposite product diastereomer emerges over the course of evolution, demonstrating that full control over the stereochemistry at the new chiral center can be achieved. The addition of this new reaction to the TrpB platform is a crucial first step toward the development of efficient methods to synthesize non&#8208;canonical prolines and other chirally dense nitrogen heterocycles.

         <title>Crystal&#8208;Size&#8208;Induced Band Gap Tuning in Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy levels of perovskite nanocrystallites depend on their size owing to quantum confinement and the concurrent yet distinct phenomenon of size&#8208;dependent structural changes where surface perturbations template the core. This effect can aid in the design of perovskite opto&#8208;electronic devices utilizing mesoporous layers to tailor the size of infiltrated nanocrystallites.







Abstract
A comprehensive picture explaining the effect of the crystal size in metal halide perovskite films on their opto&#8208;electronic characteristics is currently lacking. We report that perovskite nanocrystallites exhibit a wider band gap due to concurrent quantum confinement and size dependent structural effects, with the latter being remarkably distinct and attributed to the perturbation from the surface of the nanocrystallites affecting the structure of their core. This phenomenon might assist in the photo&#8208;induced charge separation within the perovskite in devices employing mesoporous layers as they restrict the size of nanocrystallites present in them. We demonstrate that the crystal size effect is widely applicable as it is ubiquitous in different compositions and deposition methods employed in the fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells. This effect is a convenient and effective way to tune the band gap of perovskites.

         <title>A General Synthesis Strategy for Hollow Metal Oxide Microspheres Enabled by Gel&#8208;Assisted Precipitation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;assisted precipitation (GAP) avoids synthesis challenges caused by the divergent properties of targeted metal and provides a simple and scalable method to build a large variety of hollow objects as demonstrated by more than 20 different kinds of HMMs as well as hollow structures of metal phosphate. The hollow and mesoporous Nb2O5 microspheres have favorable charge transport kinetics in a Li&#8208;ion intercalation pseudocapacitor.







Abstract
Hollow metal oxide microspheres (HMMs) have drawn enormous attention in different research fields. Reliable and scalable synthetic protocols applicable for a large variety of metal oxides are in emergent demand. Here we demonstrated that polymer hydrogel, such as the resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) one, existed as an efficient synthetic platform to build HMMs. Specifically, the RF gel forms stacked RF microspheres enlaced with its aqueous phase, where the following evaporation of the highly dispersed water leads to a gel&#8208;assisted precipitation (GAP) of the dissolved metal precursor onto the embedded polymeric solids suited for the creation of HMMs. By taking advantage of the structural features of hydrogel, this synthesis design avoids the delicate control on the usually necessitated coating process and provides a simple and effective synthetic process versatile for functional HMMs, particularly Nb2O5 as a high&#8208;performance electrode material in Li&#8208;ion intercalation pseudocapacitor.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiro&#8208;oxiranes: An Asymmetric Addition/Aldol/Spirocyclization Domino Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/aldol/spirocyclization domino cascade to generate spiro&#8208;oxiranes is reported. sp2&#8208; and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon nucleophiles are used to initiate the cascade to give arylated and alkynylated products.







Abstract
Enantioenriched spiro&#8208;oxiranes bearing three contiguous stereocenters were synthesized using a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric addition/aldol/spirocyclization sequence. Starting from a linear substrate, the cascade enabled the formation of a spirocyclic framework in a single step. sp2&#8208; and sp&#8208;hybridized carbon nucleophiles were found to be competent initiators for this cascade, giving arylated or alkynylated products, respectively. Derivatization studies demonstrated the synthetic versatility of both the epoxide and the alkyne moieties of the products. DFT calculations were used to reconcile spectroscopic discrepancies observed between the solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the products.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Tolerant Covalent Organic Framework Electrolyte with Holistically Oriented Channels for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries with Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible high&#8208;voltage&#8208;tolerant COF SSE films with a holistically oriented channel structure, high ionic conductivity, and remarkable mechanical strength enabled the development of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811; see picture). The batteries demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400&#8197;cycles as well as high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) and mechanical foldability.







Abstract
By introducing lithiophilic groups and electrochemically stable quinolyl aromatic ring linkages, we prepared covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibiting a large band gap with an ultralow HOMO value (&#8722;6.2&#8197;eV under vacuum) and oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (versus Li+/Li) as solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). The obtained flexible COF SSE thin films showed a holistically oriented arrangement along the (001) facet with remarkable ionic conductivity up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C and excellent mechanical strength with a high Young's modulus of 10.5&#8197;GPa. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that lithium ions are transmitted in this COF SSE by directional hopping paths with fast drift velocity. The COF SSE film was used to assemble all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes (NMC811). The batteries demonstrated stable cycling performance over 400&#8197;cycles, high coulombic efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%), and could also withstand abuse tests, such as folding.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Cyclization by Hydromagnesiation: A Modular Strategy Towards N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reductive cyclization to prepare a variety of  N&#8208;heterocycles, through the use of  ortho&#8208;vinylanilides, is reported. The reaction is catalyzed by an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable iron complex and generally occurs at ambient temperature. The transformation likely proceeds through hydromagnesiation of the vinyl group, and trapping of the  in situ  generated benzylic anion by an intramolecular electrophile to form the heterocycle. This iron&#8208;catalyzed strategy was shown to be broadly applicable and was utilized in the synthesis of substituted indoles, oxindoles and tetrahydrobenzoazepinoindolone derivatives. Mechanistic studies indicated that the reversibility of the hydride transfer step depends on the reactivity of the tethered electrophile. The synthetic utility of our approach was further demonstrated by the formal synthesis of a reported bioactive compound and a family of natural products.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this communication, we report muon spin rotation/resonance (&#181;SR) studies for understanding radical reactivity of 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene. Transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#181;SR) and muon avoided level&#8208;crossing resonance (&#181;LCR) measurements successfully visualized a paramagnetic species produced by regioselective addition of muonium (Mu) to the skeletal phosphorus atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two possible isomers. Whereas the most stable isomer including the envelope&#8208;type phosphorus heterocycle shows considerably different hyperfine coupling constants (hfcs) from those of the TF&#8208;&#181;SR and &#181;LCR, the metastable structure accompanying the almost planar tricyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton could simulate the experimentally determined hfcs. The metastable planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated paramagnetic tricyclic&#8208;fused skeleton is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to the light muon (&#181;  +  ), one ninth of the proton mass.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep learning for voltammetric sensing in living animal brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous neurochemicals have been implicated in the modulation of brain function, making them appealing analytes for sensors and diagnostics. However, it is a grand challenge to selectively measure multiple neurochemicals simultaneously  in vivo  because of their great variations in concentrations, dynamic nature, and composition. Here we present a deep learning&#8208;based voltammetric sensing platform for high selective and simultaneous analysis of three neurochemicals in living animal brain. The system features a carbon fiber electrode capable of capturing the mixed dynamics of a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, and ions. Then a powerful deep neural network is employed to resolve individual chemical and spatial&#8208;temporal information. With this, a single electrochemical measurement reveals an interplayed concentration change of dopamine, ascorbate, and ions in living rat brain, which is unobtainable with existing analytical methodologies. Our strategy provides a powerful means to expedite research in neuroscience and empower sensing&#8208;aided diagnostic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given the strong influence of surface structure on the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, understanding the mechanisms that control crystal morphology is an important component of designing catalytic materials with targeted shape and functionality. Herein, we employ density functional theory to examine the impact of growth media on NiO crystal faceting in line with experimental findings showing that molten salt synthesis in alkali chlorides (KCl, LiCl, and NaCl) imposes shape selectivity of NiO particles. We find that the production of NiO octahedra is attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H2O, whereas the formation of trapezohedral particles is associated with the control of the growth kinetics exerted by ordered salt structures on high&#8208;index facets. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that growth inhibition of metal oxide facets occurs by a localized ordering of molten salts at the crystal&#8208;solvent interface. These findings provide new molecular&#8208;level insight on kinetics and thermodynamics of molten salt synthesis as a predictive route to shape engineer metal oxide crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color Tuning of Narrowband Emissions in Multi&#8208;Resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescence Materials via Rational Imine/Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Establishing a simple and versatile design strategy to finely modulate emission colors while retaining high luminescence efficiencies and color purity remains an appealing yet challenging task for the development of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials. Here, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing imine and electron&#8208;donating amine moieties into a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton enables the systematic hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts of narrowband emissions, respectively. By this method, effective electroluminescence color tuning was accomplished over a wide visible range from deep&#8208;blue to yellow (461&#8211;571 nm), using the same MR molecular system, without compromising very narrow spectral features. Deep&#8208;blue to yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 19.0%&#8211;29.2% and superb color purity could be produced by adopting this family of color&#8208;tunable MR&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Strategy of Constructing Carbon Particles Modified Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework for Enhancing the Efficiency of CO2 Electroreduction into Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide by metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) catalysts has been widely investigated in recent years, but the poor conductivity strongly limits the application of most MOFs catalysts. In order to overcome the above obstacles, we tried to use a gentle strategy to uniformly introduce highly dispersed carbon nanoparticles into the framework to improve the catalytic activity. Herein, a porous 3D In&#8208;MOF {(Me2NH2)[In(BCP)]&#183;2DMF}n (V11) with good stability was constructed, and there are two types of large 1D channels with a diameter of 1.6 and 1.2 nm in the framework. Experimental results show that V11 exhibits a moderate catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction with 76.0% of Faradaic efficiency for formate. To improve the catalytic activity of V11, methylene blue molecules were introduced into the framework as a carbon source due to its suitable size and carbonization temperature. After calcination at an appropriate temperature, carbon nanoparticles (CPs) with an average diameter of 3.85 nm were anchored in V11 and the framework can keep stable during the synthesis process. The obtained catalyst CPs@V11 was also applied in the CO2 electroreduction, and the maximum Faradaic efficiency of formate increases from 76.0% to 90.1% and the current density increased by 2.2 times. Control experiments and catalytic characterizations demonstrate that the introduced carbon nanoparticles can serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in framework, and benefit to sufficiently expose active sites. Furthermore, this strategy can also work on other In&#8208;MOFs to improve the catalytic performance in selectivity and current density, demonstrating the good universality of this facile method and giving inspiration to construct more effective catalysts for electroreduction of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>A simple Gas&#8208;solid treatment for surface modification in Li&#8208;rich oxides cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with high capacity are expected to be the next generation of cathode materials. However, the irreversible and sluggish anionic redox reaction leads to the O  2  loss in the surface as well as the capacity and voltage fading. In the present study, a simple gas&#8208;solid treatment with ferrous oxalate has been proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancy and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O  2  release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion. In addition, the surface doping of Fe&#8208;ion can further stabilize the structure. Accordingly, the treated Feox&#8208;2% cathode exhibits superior capacity retention of 86.4% and 85.5% at 1C and 2C to that (75.3% and 75.0%) of the pristine sample after 300 cycles, respectively. Then, the voltage fading is significantly suppressed to 0.0011V per cycle at 2C especially. The encouraging results may play a significant role in paving the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides cathode</dc:description>

Accordingly, the treated Feox-2% cathode exhibits superior capacity retention of 86.4% and 85.5% at 1C and 2C to that (75.3% and 75.0%) of the pristine sample after 300 cycles, respectively. Then, the voltage fading is significantly suppressed to 0.0011V per cycle at 2C especially. The encouraging results may play a significant role in paving the practical application of Li-rich layered oxides cathode&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Li+ Repulsion&#8208;Enrichment Synergism Induced by &#8220;Core&#8208;Shell&#8221; Ionic Complexes to Enable High&#8208;Loading Li Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>Li metal with ultrahigh theoretical capacity and low electrochemical potential has the promise to become the next&#8208;generation anode material. However, uncontrollable dendrite growth correlated with irreversible Li loss and safety issue challenges the development of Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a novel &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; additive with anionic Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) cluster as &#8220;core&#8221; and N&#8208;containing cation of ionic liquid (IL) as &#8220;shell&#8221; is proposed to stabilize LMBs. The suspended POM derived complex in ether&#8208;based electrolyte is prone to be absorbed around the protuberances of anode and to trigger a lithiophobic repulsion mechanism for the homogenization of Li  +  redistribution. The gradually released POM &#8220;cores&#8221; with negative charge would then enrich Li  +  and co&#8208;assemble with Li mass. The Li  +  repulsion&#8208;enrichment synergism can compact Li deposition and reinforce solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). This sustained&#8208;release additive enables Li||Li symmetric cells with a long lifetime over 500 h and 300 h at high current densities of 3 and 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  respectively. The complex additive is also compatible with high&#8208;voltage Li||LiNi  0.8  Co  0.15  Al  0.05  O  2  (NCA) cells. Even with a NCA loading as high as ~ 20 mg cm  &#8208;2  , the additive contained Li||NCA cell can still cycle for over 100 cycles at 2.6 mA cm  &#8208;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Circular Dichroism and Circular Polarized Luminescence Intensities of Chiral 2D Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites through Halogenation of the Organic Ions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the incorporation of Cl&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the chiroptical properties of 2D chiral perovskites can be significantly enhanced. The observed circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence intensities are found to be associated with the d&#8208;spacing of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites and the strength of the halogen&#8211;halogen interaction within the system.







Abstract
Through the incorporation of various halogen&#8208;substituted chiral organic cations, the effects of chiral molecules on the chiroptical properties of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are investigated. Among them, the HOIP having a Cl&#8208;substituted chiral cation exhibits the highest circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) intensities, indicating the existence of the largest rotatory strength, whereas the F&#8208;substituted HIOP shows the weakest intensities. The observed modulation can be correlated to the varied magnetic transition dipole of HOIPs, which is sensitive to the d&#8208;spacing between inorganic layers and the halogen&#8211;halogen interaction between organic cations and the inorganic sheets. These counteracting effects meet the optimal CD and CPL intensity with chlorine substitution, rendering the rotatory strength of HOIPs arranged in the order of (ClMBA)2PbI4&gt;(BrMBA)2PbI4&gt;(IMBA)2PbI4&gt;(MBA)2PbI4&gt;(FMBA)2PbI4.

         <title>Surprising Condensation Reactions of the Azadithiolate Cofactor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azadithiolate (adt), key cofactor of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase machinery, rearranges readily via a novel condensation pathway. For FeFe azadithiolates, the condensation gives azatrithiolates, but the RuRu azadithiolates go farther, giving methyleneazadithiolates.







Abstract
Azadithiolate, a cofactor found in all [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenases, is shown to undergo acid&#8208;catalyzed rearrangement. Fe2[(SCH2)2NH](CO)6 self&#8208;condenses to give Fe6[(SCH2)3N]2(CO)17. The reaction, which is driven by loss of NH4+, illustrates the exchange of the amine group. X&#8208;ray crystallography reveals that three Fe2(SR)2(CO)x butterfly subunits interconnected by the aminotrithiolate [N(CH2S)3]3&#8722;. Mechanistic studies reveal that Fe2[(SCH2)2NR](CO)6 participate in a range of amine exchange reactions, enabling new methodologies for modifying the adt cofactor. Ru2[(SCH2)2NH](CO)6 also rearranges, but proceeds further to give derivatives with Ru&#8208;alkyl bonds Ru6[(SCH2)3N][(SCH2)2NCH2]S(CO)17 and [Ru2[(SCH2)2NCH2](CO)5]2S.

         <title>Nanomediator&#8211;Effector Cascade Systems for Amplified Protein Kinase Activity Imaging and Phosphorylation&#8208;Induced Drug Release In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a nanomediator&#8211;effector cascade system that can convert the subtle events of kinase&#8208;regulated phosphorylation to augmented fluorescence recovery and cargo release via the DNA amplification machinery. This kinase&#8208;specific sensing and treating modality allows kinase activity imaging and cellular signaling&#8208;responsive drug release in vivo.







Abstract
Protein kinases constitute a rich pool of biomarkers and therapeutic targets of tremendous diseases including cancer. However, sensing kinase activity in vivo while implementing treatments according to kinase hyperactivation remains challenging. Herein, we present a nanomediator&#8211;effector cascade system that can in situ magnify the subtle events of kinase&#8208;catalyzed phosphorylation via DNA amplification machinery to achieve kinase activity imaging and kinase&#8208;responsive drug release in vivo. In this cascade, the phosphorylation&#8208;mediated disassembly of DNA/peptide complex on the nanomediators initiated the detachment of fluorescent hairpin DNAs from the nanoeffectors via hybridization chain reaction (HCR), leading to fluorescence recovery and therapeutic cargo release. We demonstrated that this nanosystem simultaneously enabled trace protein kinase A (PKA) activity imaging and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for inhibition of tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo, affording a kinase&#8208;specific sense&#8208;and&#8208;treat paradigm for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Discovery and Characterization of Spike N&#8208;Terminal Domain&#8208;Binding Aptamers for Rapid SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid diagnostics are essential for early detection of COVID&#8208;19 and reduced disease spread. In this study, we discovered the DNA aptamer SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain binding aptamer 1), which binds with high affinity and specificity to SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein as well as UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.







Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (&lt;80&#8197;nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo&#8208;EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein N&#8208;terminal domain&#8208;binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N&#8208;terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV&#8208;inactivated SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 at concentrations as low as 5&#215;105&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&#8722;1. SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 diagnostics.

     alt="Discovery and Characterization of Spike N-Terminal Domain-Binding Aptamers for Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Detection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid diagnostics are essential for early detection of COVID-19 and reduced disease spread. In this study, we discovered the DNA aptamer SNAP1 (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain binding aptamer 1), which binds with high affinity and specificity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as well as UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has devastated families and disrupted healthcare, economies and societies across the globe. Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (&amp;lt;80&#8197;nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo-EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain-binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N-terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations as low as 5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;copies&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Ligand Ratio&#8208;dependent Chemodivergent Asymmetric Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio is an important variable in the field of asymmetric organometallic catalysis. An unsuitable metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio can reduce the catalytic activity and/or the asymmetric induction. Herein, we report a chemodivergent asymmetric synthesis achieved by tuning the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio in an organometallic catalytic system. Using N&#8208;(aroyloxy)phthalimide as the precursor of either an oxygen&#8208;centered aroyloxy radical or a nitrogen&#8208;centered phthalimidyl radical, enantioselective oxocyanation or aminocyanation of alkenes was achieved separately through a dual photoredox and copper catalysis. It was found that the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio can exert chemoselective control while retaining the high enantiopurity of divergent products. In addition to tolerating many functional groups and working well with a wide range of alkenes, both reactions proceed efficiently with catalyst loading as low as 0.2 mol% and can be performed on a gram scale without loss of chemoselectivity or enantioselectivity. Chemodivergent asymmetric 1,5&#8208;aminocyanation or 1,5&#8208;oxocyanation of vinylcyclopropane can also be realized by this protocol. Mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed to shed light on the stereochemical and chemodivergent results. The reactions deliver a diverse range of optically active compounds and also provide a new scenario which allows optimization of the reaction conditions in asymmetric organometallic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C Hydrogen Bonds as Design Principle in Gold(I) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational studies on PPh3 and PCy3&#8208;substituted ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines as well as on a biaryl and a cyclohexyl&#8208;aryl phosphine demonstrate that Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds can serve as secondary metal ligand interactions similar to gold&#8211;arene interactions often used in ligand design for the stabilization of catalytically active species. Remarkably short Au&#8722;H bonds are observed.







Abstract
Secondary ligand&#8211;metal interactions are decisive in many catalytic transformations. While arene&#8211;gold interactions have repeatedly been reported as critical structural feature in many high&#8208;performance gold catalysts, we herein report that these interactions can also be replaced by Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds without suffering any reduction in catalytic performance. Systematic experimental and computational studies on a series of ylide&#8208;substituted phosphines featuring either a PPh3 (PhYPhos) or PCy3 (CyYPhos) moiety showed that the arene&#8208;gold interaction in the aryl&#8208;substituted compounds is efficiently compensated by the formation of Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds. The strongest interaction is found with the C&#8722;H moiety next to the onium center, which due to the polarization results in remarkably strong interactions with the shortest Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds reported to date. Calorimetric studies on the formation of the gold complexes further confirmed that the PhYPhos and CyYPhos ligands form similarly stable complexes. Consequently, both ligands showed the same catalytic performance in the hydroamination, hydrophenoxylation and hydrocarboxylation of alkynes, thus demonstrating that Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds are equally suited for the generation of highly effective gold catalysts than gold&#8208;arene interactions. The generality of this observation was confirmed by a comparative study between a biaryl phosphine ligand and its cyclohexyl&#8208;substituted derivative, which again showed identical catalytic performance. These observations clearly support Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C hydrogen bonds as fundamental secondary interactions in gold catalysts, thus further increasing the number of design elements that can be used for future catalyst construction.

         <title>Designable Assembly of Aluminum Molecular Rings for Sequential Confinement of Iodine Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions, and conjugated carboxylate ligands act as adsorbents for the sequential confinement of iodine molecules. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8211;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.







Abstract
Although numerous adsorbent materials have been reported for the capture of radioactive iodine, there is still demand for new absorbents that are economically viable and can be prepared by reliable synthetic protocols. Herein, we report a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy towards adsorbents for the sequential confinement of iodine molecules. These adsorbents are versatile heterometallic frameworks constructed from aluminum molecular rings of varying size, flexible copper ions, and conjugated carboxylate ligands. Additionally, these materials can quickly remove iodine from cyclohexane solutions with a high removal rate (98.8&#8201;%) and considerable loading capacity (555.06&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1). These heterometallic frameworks provided distinct pore sizes and binding sites for iodine molecules, and the sequential confinement of iodine molecules was supported by crystallographic data. This work not only sets up a bridge between molecular rings and infinite porous networks but also reveals molecular details for the underlying host&#8211;guest binding interactions at crystallographic resolution.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Tungsten Disulfide Nanosheets for Alkali&#8208;Acid Electrocatalytic Sulfion Recycling and H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable low&#8208;temperature molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted method was developed for synthesis of WS2 nanosheets with high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;yield. The WS2 nanosheets show high electrocatalytic activity towards the alkaline sulfion (S2&#8722;) oxidation reaction and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hybrid alkali&#8208;acid electrochemical device was set up for electrolytic H2 generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion.







Abstract
WS2 nanosheets hold great promise for a variety of applications yet faces a grand challenge in terms of large&#8208;scale synthesis. We report a reliable, scalable, and high&#8208;yield (&gt;93&#8201;%) synthetic strategy to fabricate WS2 nanosheets, which exhibit highly desirable electrocatalytic properties toward both the alkaline sulfion (S2&#8722;) oxidation reaction (SOR) and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings prompted us to develop a hybrid alkali&#8208;acid electrochemical cell with the WS2 nanosheets as bifunctional electrode catalysts of alkaline anodic SOR and acidic cathodic HER. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device holds promise for self&#8208;power or low&#8208;electricity electrolytic H2 generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.

         <title>Unsymmetrical sp2&#8208;sp3 Disilenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented formation of a series of unsymmetrical disilenes was achieved by reacting amidinato hypersilylsilylene and chlorophosphines with &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms. The coordination number of the two doubly bound silicon atoms are different. Chlorophosphines without &#945;&#8208;hydrogen atoms led to phosphinosilylene and silanes.







Abstract
Disilenes with differently coordinated silicon atoms are not known. Here, we have shown the high yield synthesis of a range of disilenes (2&#8211;4 and 6) upon reaction of a hypersilyl silylene PhC(NtBu)2SiSi(SiMe3)3 (1) with aliphatic chlorophosphines. The most striking characteristic of these disilenes is the presence of two differently coordinated Si atoms (one is three&#8208;coordinated, the other four&#8208;coordinated). The analogous reaction with Ph2PCl did not afford the desired disilene, but, surprisingly, led to the first tetraphosphinosilane (8). DFT calculations were performed to understand the bonding in disilenes and differences in reactivity of the complexes.

         <title>Catalytic System&#8208;Controlled Divergent Reaction Strategies for the Construction of Diversified Spiropyrazolone Skeletons from Pyrazolidinones and Diazopyrazolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four types of novel and complicated spiropyrazolones from pyrazolidinones and diazopyrazolones were constructed via a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation route, especially a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade and a novel tandem C(sp2)&#8208;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, and diazopyrazolones acted as unexpected 1C synthons.







Abstract
A catalytic system&#8208;controlled divergent reaction strategy was here reported to construct four types of intriguing spiroheterocyclic skeletons from simple and readily available starting materials via a precise chemical bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade. The tetraazaspiroheterocyclic and trizazspiroheterocyclic scaffolds could be independently constructed by a selective N&#8722;N bond activation/[n+1] annulation cascade, a C(sp2)&#8208;H activation/[4+1] annulation and a novel tandem C(sp2)&#8208;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation/[4+1] annulation strategy, along with a broad scope of substrates, moderate to excellent yields and valuable transformations. More importantly, in these transformations, we are the first time to capture a N&#8722;N bond activation and a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation of pyrazolidinones under different catalytic system.

         <title>Deuterated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Significantly Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to improve luminescence performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is demonstrated by introducing an isotope effect, which is achieved through substitution of hydrogen in high&#8208;frequency oscillators X&#8208;H (X=O, N, C) by the heavier isotope deuterium. The first deuterated COF exhibits a 19&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield over the non&#8208;deuterated counterpart.







Abstract
Luminescent covalent organic frameworks (COFs) find promising applications in chemical sensing, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices, however, the majority of COFs are non or weakly emissive owing to the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) or the molecular thermal motion&#8208;based energy dissipation. Here, we report a previously unperceived approach to improve luminescence performance of COFs by introducing isotope effect, which is achieved through substitution of hydrogen from high&#8208;frequency oscillators X&#8208;H (X=O, N, C) by heavier isotope deuterium. Combining the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; and in situ deuteration methods generates the first deuterated COF, which exhibits an impressively 19&#8208;fold enhancement in quantum yield over that of the non&#8208;deuterated counterpart. These results are interpreted by theoretical calculations as the consequence of slower C/N&#8208;D and OD&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O vibrations that impede the nonradiative deactivation process. The proposed strategy is proved applicable to many other types of emissive COFs.

         <title>Efficient Inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Using Chimeric Antisense Oligonucleotides through RNase L Activation**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the strategy of nucleic acid hydrolysis targeting chimera, 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;poly(A)4&#8208;modified chimeric oligonucleotides were developed for enhanced degradation of the envelope or spike RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in vitro. The oligonucleotides can recognize specific viral RNA sequences and 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; poly(A)4 can activate RNase L to cleave them specifically.







Abstract
There is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs and alleviate the current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Herein we report the design and construction of chimeric oligonucleotides comprising a 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe&#8208;modified antisense oligonucleotide and a 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; poly(A)4 (4A2&#8208;5) to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The oligonucleotide was used for searching and recognizing target viral RNA sequence, and the conjugated 4A2&#8208;5 was used for guided RNase L activation to sequence&#8208;specifically degrade viral RNAs. Since RNase L can potently cleave single&#8208;stranded RNA during innate antiviral response, degradation efficiencies with these chimeras were twice as much as those with only antisense oligonucleotides for both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, chimera&#8208;S4 achieved potent and broad&#8208;spectrum inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its N501Y and/or &#916;H69/&#916;V70 mutants, indicating a promising antiviral agent based on the nucleic acid&#8208;hydrolysis targeting chimera (NATAC) strategy.

         <title>Fluorosulfuryl Isocyanate Enabled SuFEx Ligation of Alcohols and Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSI, FSO2&#8208;NCO) is established as a reliable bis&#8208;electrophilic linker for stepwise attachment of alcohol and amine bearing modules. In step&#8208;1, FSI's isocyanate fuses directly and quickly with alcohols and phenols, and aliphatic amines are attached through the sulfuryl carbamate transfer strategy, both with remarkable selectivity. In step&#8208;2, best yields of S&#8722;N linked products arise with a unique on water process. The scope of SuFEx ligation is greatly expanded in directions which would be especially interesting for drug discovery and chemical biology.







Abstract
Fluorosulfuryl isocyanate (FSI, FSO2NCO) is established as a reliable bis&#8208;electrophilic linker for stepwise attachment of an alcohol bearing module to an amine bearing module and thence a new module RO&#8208;C(=O)&#8208;NH&#8208;SO2&#8208;NR&#8242;R&#8242;&#8242; is created. FSI's isocyanate motif fuses directly and quickly with alcohols and phenols, affording fluorosulfuryl carbamates in nearly quantitative yield. A new reagent and process to deliver the FSI&#8208;derived fluorosulfuryl carbamate fragment to amines are also developed. The resulting SVI&#8722;F motifs from step&#8208;1 are remarkably stable, given the great structural complexities in diverse products. In the step&#8208;2 reaction with amines, the best yield of the S&#8722;N linked products arise with water alone. This &#8220;on water&#8221; interfacial reactivity phenomenon is crucial, revealing the latent reactivity of SVI&#8722;F probe for potential covalent capture of proteins in vivo which is important in today's drug discovery. The scope of the SuFEx chemistry is largely expanded thereby and the facile entry to these phosphate&#8208;like connections should prove useful to click chemistry across diverse fields.

         <title>Naphthodithiophene Diimide Based Chiral &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Nanopillar Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanopillar molecules based on naphthodithiophene diimide feature rigid pillar shapes along with a wealth of unique optical and chiral properties, which render them ideal building blocks for constructing important two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
The synthesis, structures, and properties of [4]cyclonaphthodithiophene diimides ([4]C&#8208;NDTIs) are described. NDTIs as important n&#8208;type building blocks were catenated in the &#945;&#8208;positions of thiophene rings via an unusual electrochemical&#8208;oxidation&#8208;promoted macrocyclization route. The thiophene&#8211;thiophene junction in [4]C&#8208;NDTIs results in an ideal pillar shape. This interesting topology, along with appealing electronic and optical properties inherited from the NDTI units, endows the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs with both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorptions, strong excitonic coupling, and tight encapsulation of C60. Stable orientations of the NDTI units in the nanopillars lead to stable inherent chirality, which enables detailed circular dichroism studies on the impact of isomeric structures on &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Remarkably, the [4]C&#8208;NDTIs maintain the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking abilities of NDTI units and thus adopt two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lattice arrays at the molecular level. These nanopillar molecules have great potential to mimic natural photosynthetic systems for the development of multifunctional organic materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis, structures, and properties of [4]cyclonaphthodithiophene diimides ([4]C-NDTIs) are described. NDTIs as important n-type building blocks were catenated in the &#945;-positions of thiophene rings via an unusual electrochemical-oxidation-promoted macrocyclization route. The thiophene&#8211;thiophene junction in [4]C-NDTIs results in an ideal pillar shape. This interesting topology, along with appealing electronic and optical properties inherited from the NDTI units, endows the [4]C-NDTIs with both near-infrared (NIR) light absorptions, strong excitonic coupling, and tight encapsulation of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. Stable orientations of the NDTI units in the nanopillars lead to stable inherent chirality, which enables detailed circular dichroism studies on the impact of isomeric structures on &#960;-conjugation. Remarkably, the [4]C-NDTIs maintain the strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking abilities of NDTI units and thus adopt two-dimensional (2D) lattice arrays at the molecular level. These nanopillar molecules have great potential to mimic natural photosynthetic systems for the development of multifunctional organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoinduced Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Three&#8208;Component Coupling of 1,3&#8208;Dienes: An Alternative to Kharasch&#8208;Sosnovsky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Kharasch&#8208;Sosnovsky reaction is one of the most powerful methods for allylic oxidation of alkenes. However, the inherent radical mechanism and use of peroxides as both oxidants and oxygen nucleophiles render dearth of universal catalytic systems for highly enantioselective variants and limited scope. Herein, an alternative to the asymmetric Kharasch&#8208;Sosnovsky reaction that utilized a chiral copper catalyst and purple&#8208;LED irradiation to enable the three&#8208;component coupling of 1,3&#8208;dienes, oxime esters, and carboxylic acids is reported. This protocol features mild conditions, remarkable scope and functional group tolerance as evidenced by &gt;80 examples and utility in the late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and natural products. Detailed mechanistic studies provide evidences for the radical&#8208;based reaction pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Surface&#8208;Defect Control via Designed Passivation for High&#8208;Efficiency Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold the promise to achieve high efficiency with excellent thermal stability. However, severe nonradiative charge recombination induced by traps causes photo&#8208;voltage loss, hence restraining the power conversion efficiency of PSCs from approaching the Shockley&#8722;Queisser (S&#8208;Q) limit. Our study using density functional theory reveals that the iodine vacancies (V  I  ) on the surface of all&#8208;inorganic metal&#8208;halide perovskite films are the predominant defects that trap free charge carriers. An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is designed to intentionally passivate the V  I  in the perovskite thin films. Theoretical study shows that HA bonds to the V  I  on the surface of the perovskite film via a Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;acid interaction, while an additional hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) strengthens such interaction due to the favorable molecular configuration of HA. Moreover, it is found that undercoordinated Pb  2+  and Pb clusters are passivated, leading to significantly reduced surface trap density and prolonged charge lifetime within the perovskite films. The HA passivation also induces an upward shift of the energy band edge of the perovskite layer, facilitating interfacial hole transfer. The combination of the above raises the solar cell efficiency from 19.5 to 20.8% as measured under 100 mW cm  &#8208;2  illumination, the highest efficiency so far for inorganic metal&#8208;halide PSCs. The strategy provides a rational design to effectively passivate all&#8208;inorganic perovskite to achieve high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic dehydrogenative cyanamidation of thioethers: A simple and sustainable synthesis to a broad scope of N&#8208;cyano&#8208;sulfilimines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel and very simple to perform electrochemical approach for the synthesis of several  N  &#8208;cyanosulfilimines in good to excellent yields was established. This method provides access to biologically relevant sulfoximines by consecutive oxidation using electro&#8208;generated periodate. The synthesis is applicable for dialkyl, alkyl&#8208;aryl and diaryl sulfides. This route can be easily scaled&#8208;up to gram quantities. The  S  ,  N  coupling is carried out at an inexpensive carbon anode by direct oxidation of sulfide in absence of electrochemical redox&#8208;mediators. Therefore, the designed process is atom economic and represents a new &#8220;green route&#8221; for the synthesis of sulfilimines and sulfoximines.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneously Enhanced Reverse Intersystem Crossing and Radiative Decay in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorophors with Multiple Through&#8208;space Charge Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with through&#8208;space charge transfers (CT) have attracted particularly interest recently. However, the slow reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and radiative decay always limit their electroluminescence performances. Herein, TADF molecules with ortho&#8208;linked multiple donors&#8208;acceptor (ortho&#8208;D  n  &#8208;A) motif are developed to create near&#8208;degenerate excited states for the reinforcement of spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The incorporation of both through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space CT enlarges oscillator strength. The optimal ortho&#8208;D  3  &#8208;A compound exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of ~100%, a high RISC rate of 2.57&#215;10  6  s  &#8208;1  and a high radiative decay rate of 1.00&#215;10  7  s  &#8208;1  simultaneously. With this compound as the sensitizer, a TADF&#8208;sensitized&#8208;fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.6% with an ultrapure green Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage y coordinate value of 0.69.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal coordination&#8208;directed biomolecule crosslinking in nature has been used for synthetic various biopolymers, including DNA, peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides.

         <title>Pt&#8208;modulated Redox Property and HMF Adsorption Kinetics of Ni(OH)2 for Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)  2  ) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)  2  is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)  2  electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)  2  electrode. Operando methods reveal that the introduction of Pt optimized the redox property of Ni(OH)  2  and accelerate the formation of Ni(OH)O during the catalytic process. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the enhanced Ni(OH)O formation kinetics originates from the reduced dehydrogenation energy of Ni(OH)  2  . The product analysis and transition state simulation prove that the Pt also reduces adsorption energy of HMF with optimized adsorption behavior as Pt can act as the adsorption site of HMF. Overall, this work here provides a strategy to design an efficient and universal nickel&#8208;based catalyst for HMF electro&#8208;oxidation, which can also be extended to other Ni&#8208;based catalysts such as Ni(HCO  3  )  2  and NiO.</dc:description>

         <title>Generation of &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals By H&#8226; Transfer and their Use in Cycloisomerizations</title>

         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;centered radicals can be stabilized by delocalization of their spin density into the vacant p orbital of a boron substituent. &#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular derivatives of pinacol (Bpin), are therefore excellent hydrogen atom acceptors, generating &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals from H  2  in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst. These radicals undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations onto appropriate double bonds, eventually furnishing densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance, and the resulting unsaturated boronates can be easily converted into other useful functionalities.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Massarinolin A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes condensed with a variety of synthetically challenging ring systems: a&#160;bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, an oxasipro[3.4]octane, and a dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (oxaspirolactone). Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of massarinolin A, purpurolides B, D, E, and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide C. Our synthesis and computational analysis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin A. The divergent approach features an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder reaction to install the first stereogenic center in high ee, a scalable&#160;flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8208;H oxidation, and a Myers&#8217; NBSH&#8208;promoted sigmatropic elimination to install the&#160;exo&#160;methylene group of massarinolin A.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Photoexcitation of EthynylBenziodoXolones: An Alternative to Photocatalysis for Alkynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>EthynylBenziodoXolones (EBXs) are commonly used as radical traps in photocatalytic alkynylations. Herein, we report that aryl&#8208;substituted EBX reagents can be directly activated by visible light irradiation. They act as both oxidants and radical traps, alleviating the need for a photocatalyst in several reported EBX&#8208;mediated processes, including decarboxylative and deboronative alkynylations, the oxyalkynylation of enamides and the C&#8208;H alkynylation of THF. In addition, the method could be applied to the synthesis of alkynylated quaternary centers from tertiary alcohols via stable oxalate salts and from tertiary amines via aryl imines. A photocatalytic process using 4CzIPN as an organic dye was also developed for the deoxyalkynylation of oxalates.</dc:description>

         <title>Distorted Sandwich a&#8208;Diimine Pd(II) Catalyst: Linear Polyethylene and Synthesis of&#160;Ethylene/Acrylate Elastomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of m&#8208;xylyl substituents to &#945;&#8208;diimine Pd(II) catalyst promotes living ethylene polymerization at room temperature and low pressure to yield high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) with low branching (&lt;17/1000C). m&#8208;Xylyl groups provide a highly effective blockage to the axial sites of the catalytic center and form a distorted sandwich geometry. The shielding prevents chain&#8208;transfer and easy accessibility of polar monomers, leading to a living polymerization. Conducting a light irradiation as part of the one&#8208;step metal&#8208;organic insertion light initiated radical (MILRad) process leads to diblock copolymers of ethylene and acrylates. Incorporation of different acrylate block sequences can significantly modify the mechanical and chemical properties of block copolymers which can be modulated to be a hard plastic, elastomer, or semi&#8208;amorphous polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial Matching Selectivity and Solution Structure of Organic&#8211;Metal Hybrid to Quadruplex&#8211;Duplex Hybrid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solution structure of quadruplex&#8208;lateral duplex hybrid (QLDH) MYT1L&#8208;L1Pt(dien) complex shows that L1Pt(dien) presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G4&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, displaying a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;dependent DNA secondary structures possess structure polymorphism. To date, studies on regulated ligands mainly focus on individual DNA secondary topologies, while lack focus on quadruplex&#8211;duplex hybrids (QDHs). Here, we design an organic&#8211;metal hybrid ligand L1Pt(dien), which matches and selectively binds one type of QDHs with lateral duplex stem&#8208;loop (QLDH) with high affinity, while shows poor affinity for other QDHs and individual G4 or duplex DNA. The solution structure of QLDH MYT1L&#8208;L1Pt(dien) complex was determined by NMR. The structure reveals that L1Pt(dien) presents a chair&#8208;type conformation, whose large aromatic &#8220;chair surface&#8221; intercalates into the G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and &#8220;backrest&#8221; platinum unit interacts with duplex region through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, showing a highly matched lock&#8208;key binding mode. Our work provided guidance for spatial matching design of selectively targeting ligands to QDH structures.

         <title>Aluminium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp)&#8722;H Borylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aluminium hydride catalyzed dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes is reported. By using a tethered&#8208;intramolecular&#8208;amine Lewis base as a ligand at the aluminium hydride centre the reactivity is controlled. Hydroalumination is switched off and selective reactions at the alkyne C&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond are enabled.







Abstract
Historically used in stoichiometric hydroalumination chemistry, recent advances have transformed aluminium hydrides into versatile catalysts for the hydroboration of unsaturated multiple bonds. This catalytic ability is founded on the defining reactivity of aluminium hydrides with alkynes and alkenes: 1,2&#8208;hydroalumination of the unsaturated &#960;&#8208;system. This manuscript reports the aluminium hydride catalyzed dehydroborylation of terminal alkynes. A tethered intramolecular amine ligand controls reactivity at the aluminium hydride centre, switching off hydroalumination and instead enabling selective reactions at the alkyne C&#8722;H &#963;&#8208;bond. Chemoselective C&#8722;H borylation was observed across a series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes (21 examples). On the basis of kinetic and density functional theory studies, a mechanism in which C&#8722;H borylation proceeds by &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis between pinacolborane (HBpin) and alkynyl aluminium intermediates is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;Historically used in stoichiometric hydroalumination chemistry, recent advances have transformed aluminium hydrides into versatile catalysts for the hydroboration of unsaturated multiple bonds.

         <title>Hypoxia&#8208;Responsive Gene Editing to Reduce Tumor Thermal Tolerance for Mild&#8208;Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;responsive nanocomposite composed of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 attached to gold nanorods delivers Cas9&#8208;sgHSP90&#945; to tumors. Gene editing reduces the thermal tolerance of the tumor cells and then mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is possible with near&#8208;IR light.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;triggered photothermal therapy (PTT) is usually associated with undesirable damage to healthy organs nearby due to the high temperatures (&gt;50&#8201;&#176;C) available for tumor ablation. Low&#8208;temperature PTT would therefore have tremendous value for clinical application. Here, we construct a hypoxia&#8208;responsive gold nanorods (AuNRs)&#8208;based nanocomposite of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 for mild&#8208;photothermal therapy via tumor&#8208;targeted gene editing. AuNRs are modified with azobenzene&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (p&#8208;AZO) to achieve on&#8208;demand release of CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 using hypoxia&#8208;responsive azo bonds. In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, the azo groups of the hypoxia&#8208;activated CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 nanosystem based on gold nanorods (APACPs) are selectively reduced by the overexpression of reductases, leading to the release of Cas9 and subsequent gene editing. Owing to the knockout of HSP90&#945; for reducing the thermal resistance of cancer cells, highly effective tumor ablation both in vitro and in vivo was achieved with APACPs under mild PTT.

         <title>In&#8208;Cell Characterization of the Stable Tyrosyl Radical in E. coli Ribonucleotide Reductase Using Advanced EPR Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
The in vivo structure of the redox&#8208;active tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase that catalyses the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks was explored using advanced EPR spectroscopic techniques. Furthermore, the radical form of a tyrosine derivative within the cells was generated. Our results mark the initial steps towards gaining unique insights into the redox reactions involving tyrosyl radicals under physiological conditions.







Abstract
The E. coli ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), a paradigm for class Ia enzymes including human RNR, catalyzes the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks and requires a di&#8208;iron tyrosyl radical (Y122.) cofactor for activity. The knowledge on the in vitro Y122. structure and its radical distribution within the &#946;2 subunit has accumulated over the years; yet little information exists on the in vivo Y122.. Here, we characterize this essential radical in whole cells. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR and electron&#8208;nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) demonstrate that the structure and electrostatic environment of Y122. are identical under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Pulsed dipolar EPR experiments shed light on a distinct in vivo Y122. per &#946;2 distribution, supporting the key role of Y. concentrations in regulating RNR activity. Additionally, we spectroscopically verify the generation of an unnatural amino acid radical, F3Y122., in whole cells, providing a crucial step towards unique insights into the RNR catalysis under physiological conditions.

         <title>Programmable Chromism and Photoluminescence of Spiropyran&#8208;Based Liquid Crystalline Polymer with Tunable Glass Transition Temperature</title>

A cross&#8208;linkable spiropyran&#8208;based molecule (SPBM) containing mesogenic units with switchable color, photoluminescence and mesomorphism is synthesized. Therefore, programmable chromism and photoluminescence can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs, which own a tunable glass transition temperature (Tg) by converting the configuration of the crosslinked SPBMs to change the molecular order degree.







Abstract
Spiropyran&#8208;based materials (SPBMs) can give responses to the stimulations induced by the light, heat, force, or pH, which have been used as triggers for many smart materials. Here, a cross&#8208;linkable SPBM containing mesogenic&#8208;units is synthesized, which is pale&#8208;colored, non&#8208;photoluminescent and non&#8208;mesogenic at a spiro form, but dark&#8208;colored, photoluminescent, and mesogenic at a merocyanine form. Moreover, the dynamic interconversion behavior of the form in the different chemical environments are distinct. Liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) containing the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via visible light, own a photoswitchable glass transition temperature (Tg) and retain the switchable property; however, the SPBMs cross&#8208;linked via UV light will be locked at the MC state, because the molecular movement was frozen at the room temperature lower than the given Tg of the LCP. Thus, programmable chromism and photoluminescence based on the tunable Tg can be endowed to the functional materials prepared from the SPBMs.

         <title>Structural Basis for Isomerization Reactions in Fungal Tetrahydroxanthone Biosynthesis and Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19458-19465, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel isomerase NsrQ from Aspergillus novofumigatus is a key enzyme for the structural diversification of the fungal tetrahydroxanthones. The crystal structures of NsrQ and its homologue Dcr3 in complex with substrate analogues provided a structural basis for the dual isomerization reactions. These findings will lead to mechanistic understanding of the diversification and the stereochemical control in tetrahydroxanthone biosynthesis.







Abstract
The novel isomerase NsrQ, from Aspergillus novofumigatus, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fungal tetrahydroxanthones and is responsible for dearomatizing cyclization to provide a tetrahydroxanthone scaffold. NsrQ catalyzes a two&#8208;step isomerization reaction, involving the isomerization of allylic alcohol and subsequent inversion of configuration at the methyl group. We report on the biochemical and structural characterizations of NsrQ, and its homologue Dcr3, from Diaporthe longicolla. The crystal structures of NsrQ and Dcr3 revealed their similar overall structures, with a cone&#8208;shaped &#945;+&#946; barrel fold, to those of the nuclear transport factor 2&#8208;like superfamily enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of Dcr3 and NsrQ variants complexed with substrate analogues and the site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies identified the catalytic residues and the important hydrophobic residues in shaping the active site pocket for substrate binding. These enzymes thus utilize Glu and His residues as acid&#8208;base catalysts. Based on these observations, we proposed a detailed reaction mechanism for NsrQ&#8208;catalyzed isomerization reactions.

     alt="Structural Basis for Isomerization Reactions in Fungal Tetrahydroxanthone Biosynthesis and Diversification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel isomerase NsrQ from &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus novofumigatus&lt;/i&gt; is a key enzyme for the structural diversification of the fungal tetrahydroxanthones. The crystal structures of NsrQ and its homologue Dcr3 in complex with substrate analogues provided a structural basis for the dual isomerization reactions. These findings will lead to mechanistic understanding of the diversification and the stereochemical control in tetrahydroxanthone biosynthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel isomerase NsrQ, from &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus novofumigatus&lt;/i&gt;, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of fungal tetrahydroxanthones and is responsible for dearomatizing cyclization to provide a tetrahydroxanthone scaffold. NsrQ catalyzes a two-step isomerization reaction, involving the isomerization of allylic alcohol and subsequent inversion of configuration at the methyl group. We report on the biochemical and structural characterizations of NsrQ, and its homologue Dcr3, from &lt;i&gt;Diaporthe longicolla&lt;/i&gt;. The crystal structures of NsrQ and Dcr3 revealed their similar overall structures, with a cone-shaped &#945;+&#946; barrel fold, to those of the nuclear transport factor 2-like superfamily enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of Dcr3 and NsrQ variants complexed with substrate analogues and the site-directed mutagenesis studies identified the catalytic residues and the important hydrophobic residues in shaping the active site pocket for substrate binding. These enzymes thus utilize Glu and His residues as acid-base catalysts. Based on these observations, we proposed a detailed reaction mechanism for NsrQ-catalyzed isomerization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Few&#8208;Unit&#8208;Cell MFI Zeolite Synthesized using a Simple Di&#8208;quaternary Ammonium Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>

A simple di&#8208;quaternary ammonium cation was used as structure&#8208;directing agent to prepare few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell (ca. 10&#8197;nm) MFI type zeolite catalysts and adsorbents with a wide range of composition (pure silica, aluminosilicate and stannosilicate). The SDA design was selected based on simple heuristic arguments regarding contributions of its structural elements to early crystal growth characteristics of MFI.







Abstract
Synthesis of a pentasil&#8208;type zeolite with ultra&#8208;small few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few&#8208;unit&#8208;cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis&#8208;1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di&#8208;quaternary ammonium SDA combines butyl ammonium, in place of the one commonly used for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and a five&#8208;carbon nitrogen&#8208;connecting chain, in place of the six&#8208;carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10&#8197;nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro&#8208;/meso&#8208;porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size up to ca. 5&#8197;&#956;m. Al and Sn can be incorporated into the FDP zeolite framework to produce active and selective methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon and glucose isomerization catalysts, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of a pentasil-type zeolite with ultra-small few-unit-cell crystalline domains, which we call FDP (few-unit-cell crystalline domain pentasil), is reported. FDP is made using bis-1,5(tributyl ammonium) pentamethylene cations as structure directing agent (SDA). This di-quaternary ammonium SDA combines butyl ammonium, in place of the one commonly used for MFI synthesis, propyl ammonium, and a five-carbon nitrogen-connecting chain, in place of the six-carbon connecting chain SDAs that are known to fit well within the MFI pores. X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy imaging of FDP indicate ca. 10&#8197;nm crystalline domains organized in hierarchical micro-/meso-porous aggregates exhibiting mesoscopic order with an aggregate particle size up to ca. 5&#8197;&#956;m.

A metabolite biosensor is developed by integrating an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive semiconducting polymer dot and a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme. Metabolite concentration can be measured ratiometrically with high sensitivity and specificity. Phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma is shown for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantitation of other disease&#8208;related metabolites, and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphone imaging.







Abstract
We introduce an NAD(P)H&#8208;sensitive polymer dot (Pdot) biosensor for point&#8208;of&#8208;care monitoring of metabolites. The Pdot is combined with a metabolite&#8208;specific NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the metabolite, generating NAD(P)H. Upon UV illumination, the NAD(P)H quenches the fluorescence emission of Pdot at 627&#8197;nm via electron transfer, and also fluoresces at 458&#8197;nm, resulting in a shift from red to blue emission at higher NAD(P)H concentrations. Metabolite concentration is quantified ratiometrically&#8208;based on the ratio of blue&#8208;to&#8208;red channel emission intensities, with a digital camera&#8208;with high sensitivity and specificity. We demonstrate phenylalanine biosensing in human plasma for a phenylketonuria screening test, quantifying several other disease&#8208;related metabolites (lactate, glucose, glutamate, and &#946;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate), and a paper&#8208;based assay with smartphore imaging for point&#8208;of&#8208;care use.

         <title>Chiral V&#8208;shaped Pyrenes: Hexagonal Packing, Superhelix, and Amplified Chiroptical Performance</title>

Symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes showed molecular&#8208;conformation&#8208;guided chiral hexagonal supramolecular packing and formed various helical nanoarchitectures, including unprecedented superhelices with molecular rigidity and assembly&#8208;boosted chiroptical performance.







Abstract
Here, we designed symmetric and dissymmetric chiral V&#8208;shaped pyrenes by linking achiral pyrenes to trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexane diamine scaffolds with varied spacers to investigate their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE). In molecular solution, the symmetric V&#8208;shaped molecules (P1, P2, P3) displayed spacer&#8208;dependent CD and CPEE originating from the intramolecular excimers while the dissymmetric V&#8208;shaped B was silent in CD and CPEE. Upon self&#8208;assembly, the chiral V&#8208;shaped conformation guided a helical hexagonal packing. Notably, P1 self&#8208;assembled into delicate superhelices with optimum chiroptical activities and the largest gCD for pyrene derivatives to date. The dissymmetric B formed two distinct hexagonal aggregates as twists and rectangular nanotubes with greatly amplified CPEE. This work demonstrates unprecedented hexagonal superhelices from chiral V&#8208;shaped scaffolds and provides a deep insight into the relationship between molecular conformation, supramolecular architectures, and their chiroptical performance.

Charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulators that can be specifically activated by acidic tumor microenvironment to release immunomodulator and enhance tumor penetration are developed for combinational photodynamic cancer immunotherapy.







Abstract
Nanomedicine can regulate the balance between cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and suppressive regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), which however has been rarely exploited for cancer immunotherapy. We report a charge&#8208;reversal polymer nano&#8208;modulator (SPDMCN) activated by tumor microenvironment (TME) for photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPDMCN is constructed by conjugating an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) to the side chains of a photodynamic polymer via an acid&#8208;liable linker. The negative charge of SPDMCN ensures its high stability in blood circulation and ideal tumor accumulation; exposure to acidic TME reverses its surface charge to positive, enhancing tumor penetration and locally releasing DMC. Upon near&#8208;infrared photoirradiation, SPDMCN generates singlet oxygen to ablate tumors and promote maturation of dendritic cells. Released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) activity and decreases Tregs differentiation. Such combinational action induces a sharp increase in CTL/Treg ratio in TME and effectively inhibits both primary and distant tumors in living mice.

We have designed an efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalyst of Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC with Fe&#8208;N4 and Pt&#8208;N4 dual atomic sites. The enhancement for the ORR activity is demonstrated by the modulation effect: Pt&#8208;N4 plays the role in modulating the Fe&#8208;N4 active center to optimize the ORR performance. The modulation effect is not effective for the enhancement of ORR performance in the systems of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC.







Abstract
The modulation effect has been widely investigated to tune the electronic state of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts to enhance the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the in&#8208;depth study of modulation effect is rarely reported for the isolated dual&#8208;atomic metal sites. Now, the catalytic activities of Fe&#8208;N4 moiety can be enhanced by the adjacent Pt&#8208;N4 moiety through the modulation effect, in which the Pt&#8208;N4 acts as the modulator to tune the 3d electronic orbitals of Fe&#8208;N4 active site and optimize ORR activity. Inspired by this principle, we design and synthesize the electrocatalyst that comprises isolated Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 moieties dispersed in the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (Fe&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4@NC) and exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.93&#8197;V vs. RHE and negligible activity degradation (&#916;E1/2=8&#8197;mV) after 10000 cycles in 0.1&#8197;M KOH. We also demonstrate that the modulation effect is not effective for optimizing the ORR performances of Co&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 and Mn&#8208;N4/Pt&#8208;N4 systems.

         <title>Porous 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Activity in Promoting Radical Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization</title>

2D and 3D N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are prepared and used as heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization (RROP) of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs). The 2D COFs had higher catalytic activity and showed dimensionality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%).







Abstract
Dimensionality is a fundamental parameter to modulate the properties of solid materials by tuning electronic structures. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a prominent class of porous crystalline materials, but the study of dimensional dependence on their physicochemical properties is still lacking. Herein we illustrate photocatalytic performances of N,N&#8208;diaryl dihydrophenazine (PN)&#8208;based COFs are heavily dependent on the structural dimensionality. Six isostructural imine&#8208;bonded 2D&#8208;PN COFs and one 3D&#8208;PN COF were prepared. All can be heterogeneous photocatalysts to promote radical ring&#8208;opening polymerization of vinylcyclopropanes (VCPs), which typically produces polymers with a combination of linear (l) and cyclic (c) repeat units. The 2D&#8208;PN COFs have much higher catalytic activity than the 3D&#8208;PN COF, allowing the efficient synthesis of poly(VCPs) with controlled molecular weight, low dispersity and high l/c selectivity (up to 97&#8201;%). The improved performance can be ascribed to the 2D structure which has a larger internal surface area, more catalytically active sites, higher photosensitizing ability and photoinduced electron transfer efficiency.

         <title>Beam Search for Automated Design and Scoring of Novel ROR Ligands with Machine Intelligence**
</title>

The beam search algorithm was employed for automated molecule design and scoring from a chemical language model (CLM). Prospective application of this model&#8208;intrinsic technique with a CLM trained on inverse ROR&#947; agonists yielded novel ligands of this nuclear receptor with the intended bioactivity. Beam search sampling overcomes the need for external scoring methods and extends the applicability of machine learning&#8208;driven molecular design.







Abstract
Chemical language models enable de&#8197;novo drug design without the requirement for explicit molecular construction rules. While such models have been applied to generate novel compounds with desired bioactivity, the actual prioritization and selection of the most promising computational designs remains challenging. Herein, we leveraged the probabilities learnt by chemical language models with the beam search algorithm as a model&#8208;intrinsic technique for automated molecule design and scoring. Prospective application of this method yielded novel inverse agonists of retinoic acid receptor&#8208;related orphan receptors (RORs). Each design was synthesizable in three reaction steps and presented low&#8208;micromolar to nanomolar potency towards ROR&#947;. This model&#8208;intrinsic sampling technique eliminates the strict need for external compound scoring functions, thereby further extending the applicability of generative artificial intelligence to data&#8208;driven drug discovery.

         <title>Enabling Cysteine&#8208;Free Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with a Ligation Auxiliary Capable of Base Catalysis</title>

The MPyE group is the first sulfur based auxiliary enabling peptide ligation at proline and &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids. The pyridine nitrogen probably acts as a base that catalyzes the S&#8594;N acyl transfer during native chemical ligation.







Abstract
Ligation auxiliaries are used in chemical protein synthesis to extend the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond cysteine. However, auxiliary&#8208;mediated ligations at sterically demanding junctions have been difficult. Often the thioester intermediate formed in the thiol exchange step of NCL accumulates because the subsequent S&#8594;N acyl transfer is extremely slow. Here we introduce the 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethyl (MPyE) group as the first auxiliary designed to aid the ligation reaction by catalysis. Notably, the MPyE auxiliary provides useful rates even for junctions containing proline or a &#946;&#8208;branched amino acid. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that the pyridine nitrogen acts as an intramolecular base in a rate&#8208;determining proton transfer step. The auxiliary is prepared in two steps and conveniently introduced by reductive alkylation. Auxiliary cleavage is induced upon treatment with TCEP/morpholine in presence of a MnII complex as radical starter. The synthesis of a de novo designed 99mer peptide and an 80 aa long MUC1 peptide demonstrates the usefulness of the MPyE auxiliary.

         <title>Photoinduced Self&#8208;Assembly of Carbon Nitride Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19413-19418, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline triazine&#8208;based carbon nitride quantum dots (c&#8208;CNQDs) with rich &#8208;COOH and &#8208;OH terminal groups are synthesized in large scale. Under proper irradiation, c&#8208;CNQDs undergo a unique gradual self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization process, initiated by photocatalytic cross&#8208;linking effect between &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2 edge groups of neighboring QDs. Addition of electron scavengers can effectively suppress the assembling behavior.







Abstract
The study of nanocrystal self&#8208;assembly into superlattices or superstructures is of great significance in nanoscience. Carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs), being a promising new group of nanomaterials, however, have hardly been explored in their self&#8208;organizing behavior. Here we report of a unique irradiation&#8208;triggered self&#8208;assembly and recrystallization phenomenon of crystalline CNQDs (c&#8208;CNQDs) terminated by abundant oxygen&#8208;containing groups. Unlike the conventional self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into ordered superstructures, the photoinduced self&#8208;assembly of c&#8208;CNQDs resembles a &#8220;click reaction&#8221; process of macromolecules, in which the activated &#8208;OH and &#8208;NH2 functional groups along the perimeters initiate cross&#8208;linking of adjacent QDs through a photocatalytic effect. Our findings unveil fundamental physiochemical features of CNQDs and open up new possibilities of manipulating carbon nitride nanomaterials via controlled assembly. Prospects for potential applications are discussed as well.

&lt;p&gt;Highly crystalline triazine-based carbon nitride quantum dots (c-CNQDs) with rich -COOH and -OH terminal groups are synthesized in large scale. Under proper irradiation, c-CNQDs undergo a unique gradual self-assembly and recrystallization process, initiated by photocatalytic cross-linking effect between -OH and -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; edge groups of neighboring QDs. Addition of electron scavengers can effectively suppress the assembling behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Chemiluminescent Tetraaryl Diborane(4) Tetraanion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19397-19405, August 23, 2021. </description>

Combination of boron doping with an antiaromaticity/aromaticity switch allowed the preparation of a unique diborane(4) tetraanion. Air oxidation leads to blue chemiluminescence, while controlled two&#8208;electron oxidation furnishes a dianionic diborene. The reactivities of the compounds are characterized by boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity, C&#8722;H activation, single electron transfers, and Stone&#8211;Wales&#8208;type rearrangements.







Abstract
Two subvalent, redox&#8208;active diborane(4) anions, [3]4&#8722; and [3]2&#8722;, carrying exceptionally high negative charge densities are reported: Reduction of 9&#8208;methoxy&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene with Li granules without stirring leads to the crystallization of the B(sp3)&#8722;B(sp2) diborane(5) anion salt Li[5]. [5]&#8722; contains a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl&#8208;bridged B&#8722;B core, a chelating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyldiyl moiety, and a MeO substituent. Reduction of Li[5] with Na metal gives the Na+ salt of the tetraanion [3]4&#8722; in which two doubly reduced 9&#8208;borafluorenyl fragments are linked via a B&#8722;B single bond. Comproportionation of Li[5] and Na4[3] quantitatively furnishes the diborane(4) dianion salt Na2[3], the doubly boron&#8208;doped congener of 9,9&#8242;&#8208;bis(fluorenylidene). Under acid catalysis, Na2[3] undergoes a formal Stone&#8211;Wales rearrangement to yield a dibenzo[g,p]chrysene derivative with B=B core. Na2[3] shows boron&#8208;centered nucleophilicity toward n&#8208;butyl chloride. Na4[3] produces bright blue chemiluminescence when exposed to air.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Iridium(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocarbonation of Alkenes: A Versatile Approach to Heterocyclic Systems Bearing Quaternary Stereocenters</title>

We report an enantioselective Ir&#8208;catalyzed hydrocarbonation towards pyrrole and indole polycyclic scaffolds featuring five&#8208;, six&#8208; or seven&#8208;membered rings, with tertiary and all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters. The process can be coupled with the desymmetrization of prochiral centers to obtain pyrrole&#8208; and indole&#8208;fused scaffolds with either vicinal or skipped stereocenters. DFT studies shed light on the mechanism and key stereodetermining factors.







Abstract
We report a versatile, highly enantioselective intramolecular hydrocarbonation reaction that provides a direct access to heteropolycyclic systems bearing chiral quaternary carbon stereocenters. The method, which relies on an iridium(I)/bisphosphine chiral catalyst, is particularly efficient for the synthesis of five&#8208;, six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered fused indole and pyrrole products, bearing one and two stereocenters, with enantiomeric excesses of up to &gt;99&#8201;%. DFT computational studies allowed to obtain a detailed mechanistic profile and identify a cluster of weak non&#8208;covalent interactions as key factors to control the enantioselectivity.

         <title>Integration of Bimetallic Electronic Synergy with Oxide Site Isolation Improves the Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19324-19330, August 23, 2021. </description>

A Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalyst improves the ethylene selectivity compared with a coated Pd monometallic catalyst. The intrinsic activity is preserved and is approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloy catalysts.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene to ethylene is an important process to purify ethylene streams in industry. However, among current approaches reported in the literature, high ethylene selectivity has been generally achieved at the expense of activity. Herein, we show that a Ga2O3 coating of Ag@Pd core&#8211;shell bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, allows improvement of the ethylene selectivity to a much greater extent than the coating of monometallic Pd nanoparticles, while preserving a remarkable intrinsic activity, approximately 50 times higher than the benchmark catalyst of Pd1Ag single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs). Importantly, the resulting catalyst also shows excellent long&#8208;term stability, by suppressing coke formation efficiently. Spectroscopic characterization reveals that weakened ethylene adsorption by bimetallic electronic synergy, and oxide site isolation are both essential for the high ethylene selectivity and high&#8208;coking resistance. H&#8208;D exchange measurements further show that the Ga2O3&#8208;coated Ag@Pd catalyst possesses a much higher activity of H2 activation than that of Pd1Ag SAAs, thus boosting the hydrogenation activity at the same time.

         <title>Materials Engineering of Violin Soundboards by Stradivari and Guarneri</title>

ICP&#8208;MS is used to identify the unique mineral recipe used by Antonio Stradivari to treat his spruce wood, the material for the violin top plate. Chemical manipulation led to hemicellulose fragmentation and cellulose rearrangement. Incorporating engineered wood may contribute to the unique tonal qualities of these acclaimed instruments.







Abstract
We investigated the material properties of Cremonese soundboards using a wide range of spectroscopic, microscopic, and chemical techniques. We found similar types of spruce in Cremonese soundboards as in modern instruments, but Cremonese spruces exhibit unnatural elemental compositions and oxidation patterns that suggest artificial manipulation. Combining analytical data and historical information, we may deduce the minerals being added and their potential functions&#8212;borax and metal sulfates for fungal suppression, table salt for moisture control, alum for molecular crosslinking, and potash or quicklime for alkaline treatment. The overall purpose may have been wood preservation or acoustic tuning. Hemicellulose fragmentation and altered cellulose nanostructures are observed in heavily treated Stradivari specimens, which show diminished second&#8208;harmonic generation signals. Guarneri's practice of crosslinking wood fibers via aluminum coordination may also affect mechanical and acoustic properties. Our data suggest that old masters undertook materials engineering experiments to produce soundboards with unique properties.

         <title>Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19183-19190, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical challenge toward realizing Li metal anode has been the lack of stable SEI between Li and the electrolyte. We report an approach of using oxygen to induce unique decompositions of organic phosphate solvent, where simple reactions favor the formation of a stable SEI. This method permits repeated Li stripping/plating on Li metal in a flame retardant electrolyte. The results promise safe operations of Li in next generation batteries.







Abstract
Lithium metal anode holds great promises for next&#8208;generation battery technologies but is notoriously difficult to work with. The key to solving this challenge is believed to lie in the ability of forming stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. To further address potential safety issues, it is critical to achieve this goal in nonflammable electrolytes. Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li3PO4 and poly&#8208;phosphates. Importantly, the reaction was self&#8208;limiting, and the resulting material regulated Li plating by limiting dendrite formation. In effect, we obtained a functional SEI on Li metal in a nonflammable electrolyte. When tested in a symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell, more than 300&#8197;cycles of stripping/plating were measured at a current density of 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Prototypical Li&#8208;O2 and Li&#8208;ion batteries were also fabricated and tested to further support the effectiveness of this strategy. The mechanism by which the SEI forms was studied by density functional theory (DFT), and the predictions were corroborated by the successful detection of the intermediates and products.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Tetraphenylethene Anion Receptors: Anion&#8208;Induced Emissive Aggregates and Photoswitchable Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19442-19450, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding (XB) tetraphenylethene (TPE) based anion receptors are reported. The receptors exhibit a remarkable anion&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on luminescence response, in which halogen bonding anion interactions drive the formation of emissive nanoscale aggregates. Disubstituted XB TPE derivatives function as photoswitchable anion receptors, in which modulation of photostationary states is intimately related to anion affinity.







Abstract
A series of tetraphenylethene (TPE) derivatives functionalized with highly potent electron&#8208;deficient perfluoroaryl iodo&#8208;triazole halogen bond (XB) donors for anion recognition are reported. 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments, fluorescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering measurements, TEM imaging and X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis reveal that the tetra&#8208;substituted halogen bonding receptor forms luminescent nanoscale aggregates, the formation of which is driven by XB&#8208;mediated anion coordination. This anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced aggregation effect serves as a powerful sensory mechanism, capable of luminescence chloride sensing at parts per billion concentration. Furthermore, the doubly substituted geometric isomers act as unprecedented photoswitchable XB donor anion receptors, where the composition of the photostationary state can be modulated by the presence of a coordinating halide anion.

         <title>Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Complex N&#8208;Glycans of the Parasite S. mansoni to Examine the Importance of Epitope Presentation on DC&#8208;SIGN recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19287-19296, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular recognition of chemoenzymatically synthesized glycans derived from the parasitic worm S. mansoni by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN was investigated by a combination of NMR, computational and electron microscopy. It uncovered the importance of glycan complexity for lectin recognition including the influence of glycan valency, core xylosylation and length of oligo&#8208;LacNAc residues.







Abstract
The importance of multivalency for N&#8208;glycan&#8208;protein interactions has primarily been studied by attachment of minimal epitopes to artificial multivalent scaffold and not in the context of multi&#8208;antennary glycans. N&#8208;glycans can be modified by bisecting GlcNAc, core xylosides and fucosides, and extended N&#8208;acetyl lactosamine moieties. The impact of such modifications on glycan recognition are also not well understood. We describe here a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide N&#8208;glycans expressed by the parasitic worm S. mansoni having unique epitopes at each antenna and containing core xyloside. NMR, computational and electron microscopy were employed to investigate recognition of the glycans by the human lectin DC&#8208;SIGN. It revealed that core xyloside does not influence terminal epitope recognition. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans bound with higher affinity to DC&#8208;SIGN compared to mono&#8208;valent counterparts, which was attributed to proximity&#8208;induced effective concentration. The multi&#8208;antennary glycans cross&#8208;linked DC&#8208;SIGN into a dense network, which likely is relevant for antigen uptake and intracellular routing.

A nanohybrid UCMB&#8208;LYZ&#8208;HP was designed with features of intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive release of lysozyme and NIR&#8208;triggered high production of 1O2. By synergistically combining the enzymatic and photodynamic effect, the nanohybrid exhibited an extraordinary antibacterial capacity both in vitro and in vivo, providing a promising strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue infections caused by resistant bacteria.







Abstract
The rapid emergence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has raised a great social concern together with the impetus for exploring advanced antibacterial ways. NIR&#8208;triggered antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT) by lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNP) as energy donor exhibits the advantages of high tissue penetration, broad antibacterial spectrum and less acquired resistance, but is still limited by its low efficacy. Now we designed a bio&#8208;inorganic nanohybrid and combined lysozyme (LYZ) with UCNP&#8208;PDT system to enhance the efficiency against resistant bacteria. Benefiting from the rapid adhesion to bacteria, intelligently bacteria&#8208;responsive LYZ release and synergistic LYZ&#8208;PDT effect, the nanoplatform achieves an exceptionally strong bactericidal capacity and conspicuous bacteriostasis on methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus. These findings pave the way for designing efficiently antibacterial nanomaterials and provide a new strategy for combating deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection.

tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks divergent reactivity embedded in nitrostilbenes to construct N&#8208;hydroxyindoles or oxindoles depending on whether sodium or potassium is the counterion.







Abstract
tert&#8208;Butoxide unlocks new reactivity patterns embedded in nitroarenes. Exposure of nitrostilbenes to sodium tert&#8208;butoxide was found to produce N&#8208;hydroxyindoles at room temperature without an additive. Changing the counterion to potassium changed the reaction outcome to yield solely oxindoles through an unprecedented dioxygen&#8208;transfer reaction followed by a 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. Mechanistic experiments established that these reactions proceed via radical intermediates and suggest that counterion coordination controls whether an oxindole or N&#8208;hydroxyindole product is formed.

         <title>Regulation of SEI Formation by Anion Receptors to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

A small amount of TMSB molecules are found to effectively optimize SEI via EDL structure regulation. Their preferable adsorption on the Li&#8208;metal surface and their attraction to PF6&#8722; ions result in a high&#8208;local ion concentration in the EDL region, thus forming an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and demonstrating superior performance.







Abstract
Despite high specific capacity (3860&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), the utilization of Li&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable batteries are still hampered due to their insufficient cyclability. Herein, we report an anion&#8208;receptor&#8208;mediated carbonate electrolyte with improved performance and can ameliorate the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) composition comparing to the blank electrolyte. It demonstrates a high average Coulombic efficiency (97.94&#8201;%) over 500 cycles in the Li/Cu cell at a capacity of 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Raman spectrum and molecular modelling further clarify the screening effects of the anion receptor on the Li+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion coupling that results in the enhanced ion dynamics. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) distinguishes the disparities in the SEI components of the developed electrolyte and the blank one, which is rationalized by the molecular insights of the Li&#8208;metal/electrolyte interface. Thus, we prepare a 2.5&#8197;Ah prototype pouch cell, exhibiting a high energy density (357&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) with 90.90&#8201;% capacity retention over 50 cycles.

         <title>Site&#8208; and Enantioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Desymmetric Mono&#8208;Hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19428-19434, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient site&#8208;selective desymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of 1,4&#8208;dienes is reported. This protocol allows rapid access to a wide range of chiral allylic alcohols and amides bearing two vicinal chiral centers adjacent to the alkene. The utility of this method is further highlighted by the synthesis of the alkyl side chain of zaragozic acid&#8197;A and the formal total synthesis of (+)&#8208;invictolide.







Abstract
The control of site selectivity in asymmetric mono&#8208;hydrogenation of dienes or polyenes remains largely underdeveloped. Herein, we present a highly efficient desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;dienes via iridium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208; and enantioselective hydrogenation. This methodology demonstrates the first iridium&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenative desymmetriation of meso dienes and provides a concise approach to the installation of two vicinal stereogenic centers adjacent to an alkene. High isolated yields (up to 96&#8201;%) and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to 99:1&#8197;d.r. and 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) were obtained for a series of divinyl carbinol and divinyl carbinamide substrates. DFT calculations reveal that an interaction between the hydroxy oxygen and the reacting hydride is responsible for the stereoselectivity of the desymmetrization of the divinyl carbinol. Based on the calculated energy profiles, a model that simulates product distribution over time was applied to show an intuitive kinetics of this process. The usefulness of the methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of the key intermediates of natural products zaragozic acid&#8197;A and (+)&#8208;invictolide.

         <title>Switching from Single to Simultaneous Free&#8208;Radical and Anionic Polymerization with Enamine&#8208;Based Organic Electron Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19389-19396, August 23, 2021. </description>

Organic electron donors (OEDs) act as dual&#8208;mode activators priming concomitant radical and anionic polymerizations to prepare interpenetrating polymer networks. OEDs can simultaneously reduce an oxidant to initiate a radical propagation and reduce a monomer to initiate an anionic propagation. These light&#8208;, metal&#8208;, and peroxide&#8208;free redox systems open new horizons for the development of macromolecular architectures through dual chain&#8208;growth modes.







Abstract
Although most monomers can polymerize through different propagation pathways, polymerization&#8208;initiating systems that can switch from one mode to another are rare. In this study, we demonstrate that enamine&#8208;based organic electron donors (OEDs) constitute the first systems able to initiate either free&#8208;radical or anionic polymerization under simple, mild, and safe conditions. While direct electron&#8208;transfer reduction of monomers by OEDs results in the initiation of anionic chain&#8208;growth polymerization, introduction of a competing oxidant with a higher reduction potential than the monomer switches the former anionic propagation to a clean radical&#8208;propagation process. The benefit of this dual&#8208;mode activator is highlighted in the synthesis of an interpenetrating polymer network through simultaneous initiation of radical and anionic propagation processes.

We integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. This system is used to monitor the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. We observed the parallel activities of urease, catalase, and glucose oxidase by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
Compartmentalized chemical reactions at the microscale are important in biotechnology, yet monitoring the molecular content at these small scales is challenging. To address this challenge, we integrate a compact, reconfigurable reaction cell featuring electrochemical functionality with high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy. We demonstrate the operation of this system by monitoring the activity of enzymes immobilized in chemically distinct layers within a multi&#8208;layered chitosan hydrogel assembly. As a benchmark, we observed the parallel activities of urease (Urs), catalase (Cat), and glucose oxidase (GOx) by monitoring reagent and product concentrations in real&#8208;time. Simultaneous monitoring of an independent enzymatic process (Urs) together with a cooperative process (GOx + Cat) was achieved, with chemical conversion modulation of the GOx + Cat process demonstrated by varying the order in which the hydrogel was assembled.

         <dc:description>
Versatile one&#8208;pot synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires breaks through the limitation of nanoelectrode materials to facilely construct high&#8208;performance single nanowire electrodes. Concurrently with excellent electrochemical, mechanical, and antifouling properties, the nanowire electrodes show great superiority in real&#8208;time monitoring of biological molecules and unraveling the relevant signaling pathway inside single living cells.







Abstract
A strategy for one&#8208;pot and large&#8208;scale synthesis of functionalized core&#8211;shell nanowires (NWs) to high&#8208;efficiently construct single nanowire electrodes is proposed. Based on the polymerization reaction between 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and noble metal cations, manifold noble metal nanoparticles&#8208;polyEDOT (PEDOT) nanocomposites can be uniformly modified on the surface of any nonconductive NWs. This provides a facile and versatile approach to produce massive number of core&#8211;shell NWs with excellent conductivity, adjustable size, and well&#8208;designed properties. Nanoelectrodes manufactured with such core&#8211;shell NWs exhibit excellent electrochemical performance and mechanical stability as well as favorable antifouling properties, which are demonstrated by in situ intracellular monitoring of biological molecules (nitric oxide) and unraveling its relevant unclear signaling pathway inside single living cells.

The expansion of TBPZ acceptor plane well&#8208;controlled the excited states involving 1CT, 3CT and 3LE states, which enhances the kRISC by remarkably shortening &#964;d and induced a completely horizontal orientation of the TDM. Consequently, PQ3 displayed an orange red EL max at 586&#8197;nm, PLQY of ca. 83&#8201;%, kRISC of 8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1, &#964;d of 2.7&#8197;&#956;s, S values of &#8722;0.49, and deliver high EQE of 27.4&#8201;%.







Abstract
Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules, namely PQ1, PQ2, and PQ3, are composed of electron&#8208;accepting (A) tetrabenzo[a,c]phenazine (TBPZ) and electron&#8208;donating (D) phenoxazine (PXZ) units are designed and characterized. The combined effects of planar acceptor manipulation and high steric hindrance between D and A units endow high molecular rigidity that suppresses nonradiative decay of the excitons with improved photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). Particularly, the well&#8208;aligned excited states involving a singlet and a triplet charge&#8208;transfer excited states and a localized excited triplet state in PQ3 enhances the reverse intersystem crossing rate constant (kRISC) with a short delay lifetime (&#964;d). The orange&#8211;red OLED based on PQ3 displays a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.4&#8201;% with a well&#8208;suppressed EL efficiency roll&#8208;off owing to a completely horizontal orientation of the transition dipole moment in the film state.

         <title>From Kinase Inhibitors to Multitarget Ligands as Powerful Drug Leads for Alzheimer's Disease using Protein&#8208;Templated Synthesis</title>

Using different small molecules targeting protein kinases and BACE1 templated synthesis, we have obtained well&#8208;balanced multitarget compounds. They have three different biological activities and may be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of complex diseases such as AD.







Abstract
Multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) are arising as promising tools to tackle complex diseases. The main goal of this work is to create powerful modulating agents for neurodegenerative disorders. To achieve this aim, we have combined fragments that inhibit key protein kinases involved in the main pathomolecular pathways of Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as tau aggregation, neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis, whilst looking for a third action in beta&#8208;secretase (BACE1), responsible of &#946;&#8208;amyloid production. We obtained well&#8208;balanced MTDLs with in vitro activity in three different relevant targets and efficacy in two cellular models of AD. Furthermore, computational studies confirmed how these compounds accommodate adequately into the long and rather narrow BACE1 catalytic site. Finally, we employed in situ click chemistry using BACE1 as protein template as a versatile synthetic tool that allowed us to obtain further MTDLs.

         <title>Heteroaromatic Hyperbranched Polyelectrolytes: Multicomponent Polyannulation and Photodynamic Biopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19222-19231, August 23, 2021. </description>

A multicomponent polymerization for the efficient synthesis of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes was developed. These hyperbranched polymers showed excellent solubility, high quantum yields, tunable emission, and strong ROS generation ability, allowing for their widespread applications in highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning, efficient bacterial killing, and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms.







Abstract
We reported an efficient multicomponent polyannulation for in situ generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and low&#8208;cost, commercially available arylnitriles, NaSbF6, and H2O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;%) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011&#215;106) and low polydispersity indices. The resulting polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields with tunable emission in the solid state, making them ideal materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning. These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which allowed their applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms in a simple and cost&#8208;effective way.

         <title>Precise Control of Both Dispersity and Molecular Weight Distribution Shape by Polymer Blending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19383-19388, August 23, 2021. </description>

Tuning dispersity and molecular weight distribution shape significantly impacts polymer properties. Herein, we report a straight&#8208;forward approach, wherein blending just two polymers allows for unrivalled precision in tuning molecular weight distributions.







Abstract
The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high &#272; and one of low &#272;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and makes them accessible to all researchers.

&lt;p&gt;The breadth and the shape of molecular weight distributions can significantly influence fundamental polymer properties that are critical for various applications. However, current approaches require the extensive synthesis of multiple polymers, are limited in dispersity precision and are typically incapable of simultaneously controlling both the dispersity and the shape of molecular weight distributions. Here we report a simplified approach, whereby on mixing two polymers (one of high &lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt; and one of low &lt;i&gt;&#272;&lt;/i&gt;), any intermediate dispersity value can be obtained (e.g. from 1.08 to 1.84). Unrivalled precision is achieved, with dispersity values obtained to even the nearest 0.01 (e.g. 1.37&#8594;1.38&#8594;1.39&#8594;1.40&#8594;1.41&#8594;1.42&#8594;1.43&#8594;1.44&#8594;1.45), while maintaining fairly monomodal molecular weight distributions. This approach was also employed to control the shape of molecular weight distributions and to obtain diblock copolymers with high dispersity accuracy. The straightforward nature of our methodology alongside its compatibility with a wide range of polymerisation protocols (e.g. ATRP, RAFT), significantly expands the toolbox of tailored polymeric materials and makes them accessible to all researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergetic Metal Defect and Surface Chemical Reconstruction into NiCo2S4/ZnS Heterojunction to Achieve Outstanding Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19435-19441, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrid catalyst with abundant Zn defects exhibits an outstanding OER performance, demonstrated by an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. DFT calculations reveal that the built&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defects can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improving the intrinsic catalytic performance. This study provides a simple strategy for the construction of heterojunctions with defects.







Abstract
Defect and interface engineering are recognized as effective strategies to regulate electronic structure and improve activity of metal sulfide. However, the practical application of sulfide is restricted by their low conductivity and rapid decline in activity derived from large volume fluctuation during electrocatalysis process. More importantly, the determination of exact active site of sulfide is complicated due to the inevitable electrochemical reconstruction. Herein, ZnS nanoparticles with Zn defect are anchored onto the surface of NiCo2S4 nanosheet to construct NiCo2S4/ZnS hybrids, which exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution performance with an ultralow overpotential of 140&#8197;mV. The anchoring of defective ZnS nanoparticles inhibit the volume expansion of NiCo2S4 nanosheet during the cycling process. Density&#8208;functional theory reveals that the build&#8208;in interfacial potential and Zn defect can facilitate the thermodynamic formation of *O to *OOH, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

         <title>Record Productivity and Unprecedented Molecular Weight for Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerization of Epoxides and Cyclic Anhydrides Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>

Ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of epoxides and cyclic anhydrides by organoboron catalysts is presented. In view of their facile preparation and unprecedented performance (thermostability, reactivity, and productivity), the catalysts provided here hold promise in pushing ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to the industry line.







Abstract
Producing polyesters with high molecular weight (Mn) through ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides remains a major challenge. Herein, we communicate a metal&#8208;free, highly active, and high thermoresistance system for the ROCOP of epoxides with cyclic anhydrides to prepare polyesters (13 examples). The organoboron catalysts can endure a reaction temperature as high as 180&#8201;&#176;C for the ROCOP of cyclohexane oxide (CHO) with phthalic anhydride (PA) without the observation of any side reactions. The average Mn of the produced poly(CHO&#8208;alt&#8208;PA) climbed to 94.5&#8197;kDa with low polydispersity (&#208;=1.19). Furthermore, an unprecedented turnover number of 9900, equivalent to an efficiency of 7.4&#8197;kg of polyester/g of catalyst, was achieved at a feed ratio of CHO/PA/catalyst=20000:10000:1 at 150&#8201;&#176;C. Kinetic studies, crystal structure analysis, 11B&#8197;NMR spectra, and DFT calculations provided mechanistic justification for the effectiveness of the catalyst system.

         <title>Editing Light Emission with Stable Crystalline Covalent Organic Frameworks via Wall Surface Perturbation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19419-19427, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topology&#8208;directed polymerization enables the construction of highly emissive stable covalent organic frameworks linked by hydrazone bond. Perturbation of pore wall surface site can tune the emission to achieve three primary colors of light, rendering the materials able to edit various emission colors by organizing different surface sites onto the pore wall.







Abstract
The ordered &#960; skeletons of covalent organic frameworks make them viable light&#8208;emitting materials but their limited tunability has precluded further implementation. Here we report the synthesis of hydrazone&#8208;linked frameworks which are stable in water, acid, and base, and demonstrate their utility as a platform for light emission. The polygonal backbone is designed to be luminescent and partially &#960; conjugated while the pore wall is docked with single atom or unit to induce resonance, hyperconjugation, and tautomerization effects. These effects can be transmitted to the backbone, so that the framework can emit three primary colors of light. The wall can be perturbated with multiple surface sites, rendering the material able to edit diverse emission colors in a predesignable and digital way. The systems show high activity, stability, tunability, and sensibility: a set of features attractive for light&#8208;emitting and sensing applications.

         <title>Insight into the Alkaline Stability of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Ammonium Groups for Anion&#8208;Exchange Polyelectrolytes</title>

This work systematically explores the alkaline stability and degradation mechanism of 24 representative N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium groups and poly(aryl piperidinium)&#8208;based polyelectrolytes for anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), providing a clear guideline for design of highly stable anion&#8208;exchange membranes and ionomers. The structure&#8211;durability relationship between ammonium groups, anion&#8208;exchange polyelectrolytes, and AEMFCs was revealed.







Abstract
The alkaline stability of N&#8208;heterocyclic ammonium (NHA) groups is a critical topic in anion&#8208;exchange membranes (AEMs) and AEM fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, we report a systematic study on the alkaline stability of 24 representative NHA groups at different hydration numbers (&#955;) at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The results elucidate that &#947;&#8208;substituted NHAs containing electron&#8208;donating groups display superior alkaline stability, while electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents are detrimental to durable NHAs. Density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations and experimental results suggest that nucleophilic substitution is the dominant degradation pathway in NHAs, while Hofmann elimination is the primary degradation pathway for NHA&#8208;based AEMs. Different degradation pathways determine the alkaline stability of NHAs or NHA&#8208;based AEMs. AEMFC durability (from 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 to 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) suggests that NHA&#8208;based AEMs are mainly subjected to Hofmann elimination under 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 current density for 1000&#8197;h, providing insights into the relationship between current density, &#955; value, and durability of NHA&#8208;based AEMs.

The RNA genome of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains 15 independently folded regulatory RNA elements. By NMR&#8208;based fragment screening, the RNA target space for small molecule binding, functional mapping and inhibition is defined.







Abstract
SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 contains a positive single&#8208;stranded RNA genome of approximately 30&#8201;000 nucleotides. Within this genome, 15 RNA elements were identified as conserved between SARS&#8208;CoV and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. By nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we previously determined that these elements fold independently, in line with data from in vivo and ex&#8208;vivo structural probing experiments. These elements contain non&#8208;base&#8208;paired regions that potentially harbor ligand&#8208;binding pockets. Here, we performed an NMR&#8208;based screening of a poised fragment library of 768 compounds for binding to these RNAs, employing three different 1H&#8208;based 1D NMR binding assays. The screening identified common as well as RNA&#8208;element specific hits. The results allow selection of the most promising of the 15 RNA elements as putative drug targets. Based on the identified hits, we derive key functional units and groups in ligands for effective targeting of the RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Multicatalytic Transformation of (Meth)acrylic Acids: a One&#8208;Pot Approach to Biobased Poly(meth)acrylates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19374-19382, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a multicatalytic approach for the one&#8208;pot production of (meth)acrylate monomers, allowing the formation of the corresponding (co)polymers from renewable feedstocks. This highly efficient strategy allowed us to perform multiple catalytic transformations in one pot, while bypassing several purification steps. This procedure can therefore minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practicalities.







Abstract
Shifting from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources can address some of the environmental issues associated with petrochemical extraction and make plastics production sustainable. Therefore, there is a growing interest in selective methods for transforming abundant renewable feedstocks into monomers suitable for polymer production. Reported herein are one&#8208;pot catalytic systems, that are active, productive, and selective under mild conditions for the synthesis of copolymers from renewable materials. Each system allows for anhydride formation, alcohol acylation and/or acid esterification, as well as polymerization of the formed (meth)acrylates, providing direct access to a new library of unique poly(meth)acrylates.

         <title>Current&#8208;Density Regulating Lithium Metal Directional Deposition for Long Cycle&#8208;Life Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19306-19313, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of Li metal anode was designed, in which the CCA layer working as charge organizer was placed between the current collector and the anode. It makes the main Li depositional interface transfer to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface, which effectively protects the separate. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode in half and full cells was significantly improved.







Abstract
Uncontrolled dendrite formation in the high energy density of lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) may pose serious safety risks. While numerous studies have attempted to protect separators, these proposed methods fail to effectively inhibit upward dendrite growth that punctures through the separator. Here, we introduce a novel &#8220;orientated&#8208;growth&#8221; strategy that transfers the main depositional interface to the anode/current collector interface from the anode/separator interface. We placed a layer of cellulose/graphene carbon composite aerogel (CCA) between the current collector and the anode (LCL&#8208;bottom). This layer works as a charge organizer that induces a high current density and encourages Li to deposit at the anode/current collector interface. Both in situ and ex situ images of the electrode demonstrate that the anode part of the cell has been flipped; with the newly deposited particles facing the current collector and the smooth surface facing the separator. The electrode in half and full cells showed outstanding cyclic stability and rate capability, with the LCL&#8208;bottom/LFP full cell capable of maintaining 94&#8201;% of its initial capacity after 1000&#8197;cycles.

Aldoxime dehydratases are able to enantioselectively dehydrate E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes to give the opposite enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile. This stereochemical phenomenon has been rationalized by means of molecular modelling. When calculated enzyme mutants with modified active sites were prepared and used in biotransformations, they showed the theoretically predicted change in enantioselectivity in these nitrile syntheses.







Abstract
In this contribution, the unique and unprecedented stereochemical phenomenon of an aldoxime dehydratase&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective dehydration of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes with selective formation of both enantiomeric forms of a chiral nitrile is rationalized by means of molecular modelling, comprising in silico mutations and docking studies. This theoretical investigation gave detailed insight into why with the same enzyme the use of racemic E&#8208; and Z&#8208;aldoximes leads to opposite forms of the chiral nitrile. The calculated mutants with a larger or smaller cavity in the active site were then prepared and used in biotransformations, showing the theoretically predicted decrease and increase of the enantioselectivities in these nitrile syntheses. This validated model also enabled the rational design of mutants with a smaller cavity, which gave superior enantioselectivities compared to the known wild&#8208;type enzyme, with excellent E&#8208;values of up to E&gt;200 when the mutant OxdRE&#8208;Leu145Phe was utilized.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ladder&#8208;Type Heteroheptacene&#8208;Based Nonfullerene Acceptors Enabled by Asymmetric Cores with Enhanced Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19314-19323, August 23, 2021. </description>

Selenophene end&#8208;capped asymmetric heteroheptacene core is used to construct an efficient nonfullerene acceptor (MQ6) which shows increased carrier transport due to the enhanced O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se intramolecular noncovalent interaction as well as the increased dipole moment. MQ6 exhibits an outstanding efficiency of 16.39&#8201;% when blended with a wide band gap copolymer.







Abstract
Nonfullerene acceptors (MQ3, MQ5, MQ6) are synthesized using asymmetric and symmetric ladder&#8208;type heteroheptacene cores with selenophene heterocycles. Although MQ3 and MQ5 are constructed with the same number of selenophene heterocycles, the heteroheptacene core of MQ5 is end&#8208;capped with selenophene rings while that of MQ3 is flanked with thiophene rings. With the enhanced noncovalent interaction of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Se compared to that of O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S, MQ5 shows a bathochromically shifted absorption band and greatly improved carrier transport, leading to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.64&#8201;% compared to MQ3, which shows a PCE of 13.51&#8201;%. Based on the asymmetric heteroheptacene core, MQ6 shows an improved carrier transport induced by the reduced &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, related with the increased dipole moment in comparison with the nonfullerene acceptors based on symmetric cores. MQ6 exhibits a PCE of 16.39&#8201;% with a VOC of 0.88&#8197;V, a FF of 75.66&#8201;%, and a JSC of 24.62&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.88&#8197;V, a FF of 75.66&#8201;%, and a &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt; of 24.62&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

A dissymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was employed to synthesize dissymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A NF&#8208;SMAs. Their detailed single&#8208;crystal packing were revealed successfully. The dissymmetric A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl:PM6 device presented an impressive PCE of 17.51&#8201;%, which is the highest values for selenophene&#8208;based and the dissymmetric NF&#8208;SMAs in binary PSCs.







Abstract
A dissymmetric backbone and selenophene substitution on the central core was used for the synthesis of symmetric or dissymmetric A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A type non&#8208;fullerene small molecular acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) with different numbers of selenophene. From S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl to A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and to S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl, a gradually red&#8208;shifted absorption and a gradually larger electron mobility and crystallinity in neat thin film was observed. A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl and S&#8208;WSeSe&#8208;Cl exhibit stronger and tighter intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, extra S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N non&#8208;covalent intermolecular interactions from central benzothiadiazole, better ordered 3D interpenetrating charge&#8208;transfer networks in comparison with thiophene&#8208;based S&#8208;YSS&#8208;Cl. The dissymmetric A&#8208;WSSe&#8208;Cl&#8208;based device has a PCE of 17.51&#8201;%, which is the highest value for selenophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs in binary polymer solar cells. The combination of dissymmetric core and precise replacement of selenophene on the central core is effective to improve Jsc and FF without sacrificing Voc.

         <title>Identifying Structure&#8211;Selectivity Correlations in the Electrochemical Reduction of CO2: A Comparison of Well&#8208;Ordered Atomically Clean and Chemically Etched Copper Single&#8208;Crystal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19169-19175, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces affect their CO2RR selectivity. Clean, flat, atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; but these actually favor production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, significant amounts of hydrocarbons are generated. Structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.







Abstract
The identification of the active sites for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to specific chemical products is elusive, owing in part to insufficient data gathered on clean and atomically well&#8208;ordered electrode surfaces. Here, ultrahigh vacuum based preparation methods and surface science characterization techniques are used with gas chromatography to demonstrate that subtle changes in the preparation of well&#8208;oriented Cu(100) and Cu(111) single&#8208;crystal surfaces drastically affect their CO2RR selectivity. Copper single crystals with clean, flat, and atomically ordered surfaces are predicted to yield hydrocarbons; however, these were found experimentally to favor the production of H2. Only when roughness and defects are introduced, for example by electrochemical etching or a plasma treatment, are significant amounts of hydrocarbons generated. These results show that structural and morphological effects are the key factors determining the catalytic selectivity of CO2RR.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis with Telluronium Cations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19281-19286, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
New telluronium salts exhibit enhanced properties due to the presence of 3 &#963;&#8208;holes. This is highlighted in solution by Ph3PO&#8208;binding studies through 17O, 31P, and 125Te NMR as well as mass spectrometry and NOESY NMR. The enhanced chalcogen&#8208;bonding properties translated into high catalytic performance, with low loadings (0.5&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;%), short reaction times (5&#8197;min&#8211;2&#8197;h), and high yields.







Abstract
Chalcogen bonding results from non&#8208;covalent interactions occurring between electrodeficient chalcogen atoms and Lewis bases. Among the chalcogens, tellurium is the strongest Lewis acid, but Te&#8208;based compounds are scarcely used as organocatalysts. For the first time, telluronium cations demonstrated impressive catalytic properties at low loadings in three benchmark reactions: the Friedel&#8211;Crafts bromination of anisole, the bromolactonization of &#969;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids and the aza&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder between Danishefsky's diene and imines. The ability of telluronium cations to interact with a Lewis base through chalcogen bonding was demonstrated on the basis of multi&#8208;nuclear (17O, 31P, and 125Te) NMR analysis and DFT calculations.

         <title>Inside Cover: Enabling Lithium Metal Anode in Nonflammable Phosphate Electrolyte with Electrochemically Induced Chemical Reactions (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 35/2021)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 18894-18894, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An important challenge in the direct utilization of Li metal as an anode material for next&#8208;generation batteries is the lack of stable solid electrolyte interphase layers. The problem is even more acute when non&#8208;flammable electrolytes, such as organic phosphates, are used. In their Research Article on page&#8197;19183, Dunwei Wang and co&#8208;workers report a new strategy that helps solve this issue. By introducing oxygen, the authors were able to induce unique chemical reactions that lead to safe operations of Li metal batteries that are flame&#8208;resistant.

         <dc:description>
The structure and regulation of the tyrosyl radical in ribonucleotide reductase in whole E.&#8197;coli cells was investigated by using advanced EPR spectroscopy. This radical starts the biosynthesis of DNA building blocks, and is thus involved in essential processes in life. The observations reported by M&#252;ge Kasanmascheff et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;19155 were surprising and exciting because the findings indicated a distinct radical distribution within the cells, pointing to a complex regulation mechanism of this fundamental enzyme in its native environment.

Mobilization upon cooling Adsorbed on a copper surface, dimolybdenum tetraacetate molecules form an ordered structure of upright&#8208;standing molecules at room temperature. Upon cooling down to 220&#8197;K, the molecules become mobile on the surface. This counterintuitive phase transition from an ordered structure at high temperatures to a mobile phase at low temperatures can be explained by a smaller molar entropy in the mobile phase as compared to the ordered phase, as reported by Angelika K&#252;hnle and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;19117.

         <title>Nanoscale Advancement Continues&#8212;From Catalysts and Reagents to Restructuring of Reaction Media</title>

In the highlighted article, the effect of alkane and water additives on the structure of several ionic liquids was used to increase the acidity of liquid reaction media and to accelerate the acid&#8208;catalyzed transformations. A possible connection between the appearance of a pronounced microstructure of the obtained systems and their performance in catalytic processes was proposed on the basis of microscopy and spectroscopy measurements.







Abstract
Comprehensive studies dedicated to the search for specific properties of matter at the micro&#8208; and nanoscales have greatly enriched the fields of chemistry and materials science. From the point of view of synthetic chemistry, discoveries in the field of nanoscale catalysis, in which the size effects of active centers are used to accelerate the reactions, are of particular importance. However, another approach for the promotion of chemical transformations based on the micro&#8208; or nanoconfinement of reacting molecules or even on the structuring of the reaction media as a whole is gaining interest as a highly valuable tool. Herein, we highlight the example of an increase in the efficiency of phenol alkylation and tert&#8208;butylation of benzyl alcohol in reaction media based on ionic liquids by the creation of acidic microdomains in the presence of small molecule additives.

This Minireview focuses on the developments of adsorbents for the separation and purification of hydrocarbons from, for example, methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, and propene/propane mixtures as well as for the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers).







Abstract
This Minireview focuses on the developments of the adsorptive separation of methane/nitrogen, ethene/ethane, propene/propane mixtures as well as on the separation of C8 aromatics (i.e. xylene isomers) with a wide variety of materials, including carbonaceous materials, zeolites, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and porous organic frameworks. Some recent important developments for these adsorptive separations are also highlighted. The advantages and disadvantages of each material category are discussed and guidelines for the design of improved materials are proposed. Furthermore, challenges and future developments of each material type and separation processes are discussed.

Photo&#8208;mediated fixation of carbon&#8208;based gas molecules: C&#8722;C bond formation utilizing carbon&#8208;based small gas molecules, including CO, CO2, acetylene, ethylene, ethane and methane, as feedstocks is attractive but challenging. The emergence of photoredox chemistry and the development of engineered flow technology have provided vast opportunities for gas conversions, which has gained tremendous momentum over the past decade.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based gas molecules are readily available feedstocks and are widely used in industry as building blocks or fuels. However, their application in the synthesis of fine chemicals has been hampered due to operational complexity, poor reaction efficiency and selectivity. Recent development of photoredox&#8208;promoted transformations using such gaseous reagents has received considerable attention from the synthetic community. In this review, efforts in developing light&#8208;promoted organic transformations using carbon&#8208;based natural gases as C1 or C2 feedstocks and to overcome the associated challenges are briefly summarized.

This review brings out the key advancements made in the field of alkaline HER with metal hydroxides and their heterostructures and also provides a detailed and critical analysis of strategies and perspectives used with highlights on future prospects at the end.







Abstract
Transition metal hydroxides (M&#8208;OH) and their heterostructures (X|M&#8208;OH, where X can be a metal, metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, metal phosphide, etc.) have recently emerged as highly active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of alkaline water electrolysis. Lattice hydroxide anions in metal hydroxides are primarily responsible for observing such an enhanced HER activity in alkali that facilitate water dissociation and assist the first step, the hydrogen adsorption. Unfortunately, their poor electronic conductivity had been an issue of concern that significantly lowered its activity. Interesting advancements were made when heterostructured hydroxide materials with a metallic and or a semiconducting phase were found to overcome this pitfall. However, in the midst of recently evolving metal chalcogenide and phosphide based HER catalysts, significant developments made in the field of metal hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed alkaline HER and their superiority have unfortunately been given negligible attention. This review, unlike others, begins with the question of why alkaline HER is difficult and will take the reader through evaluation perspectives, trends in metals hydroxides and their heterostructures catalysed HER, an understanding of how alkaline HER works on different interfaces, what must be the research directions of this field in near future, and eventually summarizes why metal hydroxides and their heterostructures are inevitable for energy&#8208;efficient alkaline HER.

In vitro selected deoxyribozymes respond to the presence of methylcytidines m3C, m4C and m5C in RNA with either enhanced or strongly diminished cleavage rates, and thereby directly reveal the presence of the modified cytidines in target RNA.







Abstract
Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification&#8208;specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA&#8208;cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3&#8208;methylcytidine (m3C), N4&#8208;methylcytidine (m4C), and 5&#8208;methylcytidine (m5C), respectively. Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold accelerated cleavage of their target m3C&#8208;, m4C&#8208; or m5C&#8208;modified RNA. An additional deoxyribozyme is strongly inhibited by any of the three methylcytidines, but effectively cleaves unmodified RNA. The mXC&#8208;detecting deoxyribozymes are programmable for the interrogation of natural RNAs of interest, as demonstrated for human mitochondrial tRNAs containing known m3C and m5C sites. The results underline the potential of synthetic functional DNA to shape highly selective active sites.

&lt;p&gt;Deoxyribozymes are emerging as modification-specific endonucleases for the analysis of epigenetic RNA modifications. Here, we report RNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes that differentially respond to the presence of natural methylated cytidines, 3-methylcytidine (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;C), &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;

Using in vitro selection, we found several DNA catalysts, which are selectively activated by only one of the three cytidine isomers, and display 10- to 30-fold accelerated cleavage of their target m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;C-, m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;C- or m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;C-modified RNA.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Sweat&#8208;Based Tracking of L&#8208;Dopa Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following an Oral Tablet Administration</title>

Non&#8208;invasive touch&#8208;based sweat measurements are used for tracking the pharmacokinetic profiles of levodopa following a single&#8208;dose oral tablet administration.







Abstract
Levodopa (L&#8208;Dopa) is the &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; medication for symptomatic therapy of Parkinson disease (PD). However, L&#8208;Dopa long&#8208;term use is associated with the development of motor and non&#8208;motor complications, primarily due to its fluctuating plasma levels in combination with the disease progression. Herein, we present the first example of individualized therapeutic drug monitoring for subjects upon intake of standard L&#8208;Dopa oral pill, centered on dynamic tracking of the drug concentration in naturally secreted fingertip sweat. The touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive detection method relies on instantaneous collection of fingertip sweat on a highly permeable hydrogel that transports the sweat to a biocatalytic tyrosinase&#8208;modified electrode, where sweat L&#8208;Dopa is measured by reduction of the dopaquinone enzymatic product. Personalized dose&#8208;response relationship is demonstrated within a group of human subjects, along with close pharmacokinetic correlation between the finger touch&#8208;based fingertip sweat and capillary blood samples.

         <title>The Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction Directing the Design of Single Atomic Site Catalysts: Achieving High Efficiency Towards Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19085-19091, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) is closely related to the electronic structure of active sites, which determines the catalytic activity. We put forward a method of designing the EMSI of single&#8208;atomic site catalysts (SACs) to achieve high efficiency. The SACs achieve a lower overpotential and higher mass activity than any other SACs towards hydrogen evolution reaction, demonstrating the benefits of this method.







Abstract
It is still of great difficulty to develop the non&#8208;platinum catalyst with high catalytic efficiency towards hydrogen evolution reaction via the strategies till now. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the new methods of catalyst designing. Here, we put forward the catalyst designed by the electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI), which is demonstrated to be a reliable strategy to find out the high&#8208;efficiency catalyst. We carried out the density functional theory calculation first to design the proper EMSI of the catalyst. We applied the model of M1&#8208;M2&#8208;X (X=C, N, O) during the calculation. Among the catalysts we chose, the EMSI of Rh1TiC, with the active sites of Rh1&#8208;Ti2C2, is found to be the most proper one for HER. The electrochemical experiment further demonstrated the feasibility of the EMSI strategy. The single atomic site catalyst of Rh1&#8208;TiC exhibits higher catalytic efficiency than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt/C. It achieves a small overpotential of 22&#8197;mV and 86&#8197;mV at the at the current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid media, with a Tafel slope of 25&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 and a mass activity of 54403.9&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgRh&#8722;1 (vs. 192.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 of Pt/C). Besides, it also shows appealing advantage in energy saving compared with Pt/C (&#8776;20&#8201;% electricity consuming decrease at 2&#8197;kA&#8201;m&#8722;2) Therefore, we believe that the strategy of regulating EMSI can act as a possible way for achieving the high catalytic efficiency on the next step of SACs.

         <title>Manipulations of Chiroptical Properties in Belt&#8208;Persistent Cycloarylenes via Desymmetrization with Heteroatom Doping</title>

Desymmetrization of chiral cylindrical cycloarylenes ought to be beneficial to maximize the dissymmetry factor g via reduction of the electric dipole moment &#956;. An ideal D2 molecule has been synthesized by cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization of two different arylene panels. Twists in biaryl linkages, however, enlarged an orthogonal component of &#956;, and the inclined and enlarged &#956; moment resulted in a much smaller g than expected.







Abstract
A desymmetrization strategy has been devised in the design of molecular cylinders to maximize the dissymmetry factor relevant to circularly polarized light. Although the highest dissymmetry factor of organic molecules was previously achieved with a chiral belt&#8208;persistent cycloarylene having magnetic and electric transition dipole moments in parallel, we noticed that an unbalanced magnitude of two moments was detrimental for higher dissymmetry factors. In this study, a molecular cylinder was desymmetrized by arraying doped and undoped panels via stereoselective cross&#8208;coupling macrocyclization. The desymmetrization succeeded in balancing two moments by reducing the electric transition moment at the global minimum but failed to maximize the dissymmetry factor. Structural studies revealed that the dissymmetry factor is sensitive to subtle structural fluctuations, while the rotatory strength is not affected. This study is important for the development of chiroptical materials.

         <title>Mobilization upon Cooling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19117-19122, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We all know that ice becomes liquid upon heating. In contrast, melting upon cooling is an unusual behavior. A system of molecules adsorbed to a surface, which become mobile upon cooling, was developed. The key for understanding these counterintuitive phase transitions lies in the fact that the high temperature ordered phase possesses more degrees of freedom leading to a larger entropy than the low&#8208;temperature unordered phase.







Abstract
Phase transitions between different aggregate states are omnipresent in nature and technology. Conventionally, a crystalline phase melts upon heating as we use ice to cool a drink. Already in 1903, Gustav Tammann speculated about the opposite process, namely melting upon cooling. So far, evidence for such &#8220;inverse&#8221; transitions in real materials is rare and limited to few systems or extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate an inverse phase transition for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Molybdenum tetraacetate on copper(111) forms an ordered structure at room temperature, which dissolves upon cooling. This transition is mediated by molecules becoming mobile, i.e., by mobilization upon cooling. This unexpected phenomenon is ascribed to the larger number of internal degrees of freedom in the ordered phase compared to the mobile phase at low temperatures.

So far, evidence for such &#8220;inverse&#8221; transitions in real materials is rare and limited to few systems or extreme conditions. Here, we demonstrate an inverse phase transition for molecules adsorbed on a surface. Molybdenum tetraacetate on copper(111) forms an ordered structure at room temperature, which dissolves upon cooling. This transition is mediated by molecules becoming mobile, i.e., by mobilization upon cooling. This unexpected phenomenon is ascribed to the larger number of internal degrees of freedom in the ordered phase compared to the mobile phase at low temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Hydrates of TEMPO: Water Vibrations Reveal Radical Microsolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19013-19017, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mono&#8208; and dihydrates of the persistent TEMPO radical are vibrationally characterized at low temperature without environment, also by analogy to the closed shell ketone analogue from which it is formally obtained by replacing the C by an N atom.







Abstract
An organic radical monohydrate complex is detected in vacuum isolation at low temperature by FTIR supersonic jet spectroscopy for the first time. It is shown to exhibit a rich conformational and vibrational coupling dynamics, which can be drastically reduced by appropriate isotope substitution. Its detection with a new gas recycling infrared spectrometer demonstrates the thermal metastability of the gaseous TEMPO radical even under humid gas conditions. Compared to its almost isoelectronic and isostructural, closed shell ketone analogue, the hydrogen bond of the solvating water is found to be less directional, but stronger and more strongly downshifting the bonded water OH stretch vibration. A second solvent water directs the first one into a metastable hydrogen bond position to solvate the nitrogen center and the first water at the same time.

         <title>Oligonucleotide Phosphorothioates Enter Cells by Thiol&#8208;Mediated Uptake</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19102-19106, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing one oxygen by one sulfur per monomer converts native oligonucleotides that cannot enter cells into cell&#8208;penetrating oligophosphorothioates. The reason for this is thiol&#8208;mediated uptake: dynamic covalent exchange with cellular thiols and disulfides that can be inhibited and activated according to the principles of dynamic covalent chemistry.







Abstract
Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS) are DNA or RNA mimics where one phosphate oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom. They have been shown to enter mammalian cells much more efficiently than non&#8208;modified DNA. Thus, solving one of the key challenges with oligonucleotide technology, OPS became very useful in practice, with several FDA&#8208;approved drugs on the market or in late clinical trials. However, the mechanism accounting for this facile cellular uptake is unknown. Here, we show that OPS enter cells by thiol&#8208;mediated uptake. The transient adaptive network produced by dynamic covalent pseudo&#8208;disulfide exchange is characterized in action. Inhibitors with nanomolar efficiency are provided, together with activators that reduce endosomal capture for efficient delivery of OPS into the cytosol, the site of action.

         <title>Efficient Electroconversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate by a Reconstructed Amino&#8208;Functionalized Indium&#8211;Organic Framework Electrocatalyst</title>

The amino&#8208;functionalized reconstructed indium&#8208;organic framework electrocatalyst demonstrates a high activity for carbon dioxide electroconversion to formate in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.







Abstract
We report an amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;organic framework for efficient CO2 reduction to formate. The immobilized amino groups strengthen the absorption and activation of CO2 and stabilize the active intermediates, which endow an enhanced catalytic conversion to formate despite the inevitable reduction and reconstruction of the functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst during electrocatalysis. The reconstructed amino&#8208;functionalized indium&#8208;based catalyst demonstrates a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.4&#8201;% and a partial current density of 108&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1&#8197;V vs. RHE in a liquid&#8208;phase flow cell, and also delivers an enhanced current density of ca. 800&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 3.4&#8197;V for the formate production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell configuration. This work not only provides a molecular functionalization and assembling concept of hybrid electrocatalysts but also offers valuable understandings in electrocatalyst evolution and reactor optimization for CO2 electrocatalysis and beyond.

         <title>Selective Bond Cleavage in RAFT Agents Promoted by Low&#8208;Energy Electron Attachment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19128-19132, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron attachment leads to the efficient dissociation of carbonothioylsulfanyl molecules which are relevant for Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization. We show that the preferred C&#8722;S bond cleavage can be initiated by an electron with almost no kinetic energy, in contrast to other dissociation reactions. This feature leads to a pronounced control of bond dissociation upon electron attachment.







Abstract
Radical polymerization with reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT polymerization) has been successfully applied to generate polymers of well&#8208;defined architecture. For RAFT polymerization a source of radicals is required. Recent work has demonstrated that for minimal side&#8208;reactions and high spatio&#8208;temporal control these should be formed directly from the RAFT agent or macroRAFT agent (usually carbonothiosulfanyl compounds) thermally, photochemically or by electrochemical reduction. In this work, we investigated low&#8208;energy electron attachment to a common RAFT agent (cyanomethyl benzodithioate), and, for comparison, a simple carbonothioylsulfanyl compound (dimethyl trithiocarbonate, DMTTC) in the gas phase by means of mass spectrometry as well as quantum chemical calculations. We observe for both compounds that specific cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond is induced upon low&#8208;energy electron attachment at electron energies close to zero eV. This applies even in the case of a poor homolytic leaving group (.CH3 in DMTTC). All other dissociation reactions found at higher electron energies are much less abundant. The present results show a high control of the chemical reactions induced by electron attachment.

A Ni&#8208;catalyzed highly selective C1&#8722;C8 bond cleavage of BCBs with the insertion of alkynes was achieved by the assistance of a removable blocking group. This method provided an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical approach to structurally important 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediols under pH&#8208;neutral conditions.







Abstract
Controlling the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation remains a great challenge. The transformations of benzocyclobutenones (BCBs) usually involve the cleavage of C1&#8722;C2 bond. In this work, an unprecedented highly selective cleavage of C1&#8722;C8 bond with the insertion of alkynes is achieved by using blocking strategy via Ni catalysis, providing an efficient method for synthesis of 1,8&#8208;disubstituted naphthalenes. Notably, the blocking group could be readily removed after the transformation.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Reactivity of Acid&#8208;Free Neutral Oxoborane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19008-19012, August 23, 2021. </description>

A new type of acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane has been prepared via a serendipitous discovery, from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf in which the shortest B=O distance observed so far has been measured, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analyses.







Abstract
An efficient synthesis of an acid&#8208;free neutral oxoborane of the type carboranyl&#8208;B(carbene)=O has been developed via a serendipitous discovery from the reaction of 1,2&#8208;[BBr(carbene)]&#8208;o&#8208;carborane with AgOTf. This represents a new type of oxoborane. The stabilization of this oxoborane may be attributed to 1)&#8197;kinetic stabilization provided by a bulky 3D carboranyl ligand and 2)&#8197;thermodynamic stabilization offered by a carbene ligand. Crystallographic analyses support the presence of the shortest terminal B=O double bond ever reported thus far. Its reactivity has also been examined.

         <title>Chiral Mesostructured BiOBr Films with Circularly Polarized Colour Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19024-19029, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a chiral mesostructured BiOBr film exhibiting a chirality&#8208;dependent circularly polarized colour response due to the structural&#8208;handedness matching and synergistic effect of multiple optical activities.







Abstract
Achieving strong and broadband circularly polarized colour responses in chiral inorganic materials is challenging. Here, we fabricated chiral mesostructured bismuth oxybromide (BiOBr) films (CMBFs) via hydrothermal growth using chiral sugar alcohols as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. The layered slabs of BiOBr crystals with weak van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals interactions are prone to mismatching due to the chiral driving force, resulting in hierarchically chiral arrangements of fine size. Three levels of chirality exist in the CMBFs: primary, helical distortion crystal lattices of a nanoflake, secondary, helical stacking of nanoflakes to form nanoplates, and tertiary, chiral vortexes arranged by nanoplates. The CMBFs displayed optical activities (OAs) over a wide wavelength range of 350&#8211;2500&#8197;nm with an anisotropic factor of up to 0.99, which led to a significant chirality&#8208;dependent colour response to circularly polarized light. The high selectivity can be considered as the result of enhanced resonance due to structural&#8208;handedness matching and the synergistic effect of multiple OAs.

         <title>Engineering Platinum&#8211;Cobalt Nano&#8208;alloys in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanotubes for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

Ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles confined on the inner and outer surfaces of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (Pt&#8208;Co@NCNT) have been synthesized through a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach. With the structural and compositional merits, the Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst presents superior activity and stability in both acidic and alkaline media for the hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Highly efficient electrocatalysts are essential for the production of green hydrogen from water electrolysis. Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;reorganization approach is developed to obtain ultrafine Pt&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm) attached on the inner and outer shells of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) with closed ends. During the thermal reorganization, the migration of Pt&#8208;Co nano&#8208;alloys to both surfaces ensures the maximized exposure of active sites while maintaining the robust attachment to the porous carbon matrix. Density functional theory calculations suggest a nearly thermodynamically&#8208;neutral free energy of adsorption for hydrogen intermediates and diversified active sites induced by alloying, thus resulting in a great promotion in intrinsic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the delicate structural design and compositional modulation, the optimized Pt3Co@NCNT electrocatalyst manifests outstanding HER activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline media.

         <title>Single&#8208;Phase Covalent Organic Framework Staggered Stacking Nanosheet Membrane for CO2&#8208;Selective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19047-19052, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three kinds of lamellar COFs were exfoliated into discrete nanosheets with large aspect&#8208;ratios. The nanosheets were assembled into ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional membranes with staggered stacking patterns, respectively. Taking advantage of narrowed pore size and CO2&#8208;philic adsorption, these single&#8208;phase COF nanosheet membranes were characterized by superior CO2/H2 separation performances.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are considered as potential candidates for gas separation membranes, benefiting from permanent porosity, light&#8208;weight skeletons, excellent stability and facilely&#8208;tailored functionalities. However, their pore sizes are generally larger than the kinetic diameters of common gas molecules. One great challenge is the fabrication of single&#8208;phase COF membranes to realize precise gas separations. Herein, three kinds of high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;type COF nanosheets with different pore sizes were developed and aggregated to ultrathin nanosheet membranes with distinctive staggered stacking patterns. The narrowed pore sizes derived from the micro&#8208;structures and selective adsorption capacities synergistically endowed the COF membranes with intriguing CO2&#8208;philic separation performances, among which TpPa&#8208;2 with medium pore size exhibited an optimal CO2/H2 separation factor of 22 and a CO2 permeance of 328 gas permeation units at 298&#8197;K. This membrane performance reached the target with commercial feasibility for syngas separations.

         <title>Revision of the Unstable Picrotoxinin Hydrolysis Product</title>

The hydrolysis of picrotoxinin (PXN), which is a plant metabolite that is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling, in weakly alkaline media gives an unstable hydrolysis intermediate that was initially assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. This assignment however has been shown to be in error on the basis of the spectroscopic characterization of the hydrolysis product in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.







Abstract
The plant metabolite picrotoxinin (PXN) is a widely used tool in neuroscience for the identification of GABAergic signaling. Its hydrolysis in weakly alkaline media has been observed for over a century and the structure of the unstable hydrolysis intermediate was assigned by analogy to the degradation product picrotoxic acid. Here we show this assignment to be in error and we revise the structure of the hydrolysis product by spectroscopic characterization in situ. Counterintuitively, hydrolysis occurs at a lactone that remains closed in the major isolable degradation product, which accounts for the longstanding mistake in the literature.

A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes integrated with perylene diimide is developed. The macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and degenerated LUMO levels. The porous supramolecular structures display micropore characteristics and charge transporting properties.







Abstract
A novel kind of monocyclic and dicyclic dehydro[20]annulenes exhibiting specific sizes and topologies from regioselective unilateral ortho&#8208;diethynyl PDI, is developed by Cu&#8208;catalyzed Glaser&#8211;Hay homo&#8208;coupling and cross&#8208;coupling. Through the integration of electron&#8208;deficient PDI chromophores into the dehydroannulene scaffolding, these macrocycles exhibit intense and characteristic absorption properties and the degenerated LUMO levels. The single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously revealed unique porous supramolecular structures, which display micropore characteristics with surface area of 120.74&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. A moderate electron mobility of 0.05&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for chlorine&#8208;free dehydro[20]annulene based on micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline transistors was witnessed. The porous and yet semiconducting features signify the prospects of PDI&#8208;integrated dehydroannulenes in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regioselective Alkenylarylation of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;Alkenyl Ketones via Carbonyl Coordination</title>

         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed alkenylarylation reaction of &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenylketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters is described. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base, and works with cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.







Abstract
We disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reaction, which enabled us to difunctionalize unactivated &#947;,&#948;&#8208;alkenes in ketones with alkenyl triflates and arylboronic esters. The reaction was made feasible by the use of 5&#8208;chloro&#8208;8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline as a ligand along with NiBr2&#8901;DME as a catalyst and LiOtBu as base. The reaction proceeded with a wide range of cyclic, acyclic, endocyclic and exocyclic alkenyl ketones, and electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arylboronate esters. The reaction also worked with both cyclic and acyclic alkenyl triflates. Control experiments indicate that carbonyl coordination is required for the reaction to proceed.

         <title>The Mechanism of Dehydrating Bimodules in trans&#8208;Acyltransferase Polyketide Biosynthesis: A Showcase Study on Hepatoprotective Hangtaimycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19139-19143, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hangtaimycin biosynthesis proceeds through a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery that contains distinctive dehydrating bimodules. Here we present detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules that are generally involved in the biosynthesis of polyketides with Z double bonds. This work lays the foundations for future structural modifications by protein engineering.







Abstract
A bioassay&#8208;guided fractionation led to the isolation of hangtaimycin (HTM) from Streptomyces spectabilis CCTCC M2017417 and the discovery of its hepatoprotective properties. Structure elucidation by NMR suggested the need for a structural revision. A putative HTM degradation product was also isolated and its structure was confirmed by total synthesis. The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified and resembles a hybrid trans&#8208;AT PKS/NRPS biosynthetic machinery whose first PKS enzyme contains an internal dehydrating bimodule, which is usually found split in other trans&#8208;AT PKSs. The mechanisms of such dehydrating bimodules have often been proposed, but have never been deeply investigated. Here we present in vivo mutations and in vitro enzymatic experiments that give first and detailed mechanistic insights into catalysis by dehydrating bimodules.

SiNcTI&#8208;Br with strong self&#8208;doping property, high conductivity, and high electron mobility is an excellent cathode interlayer material. The interlayer boosts the power conversion efficiency of PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs to 16.71&#8201;%. It is the first naphthalocyanine derivative used as interlayer material in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Naphthalocyanine derivatives (SiNcTI&#8208;N and SiNcTI&#8208;Br) were firstly used as excellent cathode interlayer materials (CIMs) in organic solar cells, via introducing four electron&#8208;withdrawing imide groups and two hydrophilic alkyls. Both of them showed deep LUMO energy levels (below &#8722;3.90&#8197;eV), good thermal stability (Td &gt;210&#8201;&#176;C), and strong self&#8208;doping property. The SiNcTI&#8208;Br CIM displayed high conductivity (4.5&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility (7.81&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), which could boost the efficiencies of the PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs over a wide range of CIM layer thicknesses (4&#8211;25&#8197;nm), with maximum efficiency of 16.71&#8201;%.

         <title>Chemoselective &#947;&#8208;Oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Amides with TEMPO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19123-19127, August 23, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. This regioselective reaction with TEMPO proceeds under mild conditions, tolerant of other carbonyl functionality. A rare example of regioselective amide activation of unsaturated substrates; it results in products carrying oxyaminated substitution ripe for remarkably selective radical cyclisation reactions.







Abstract
A chemoselective and robust protocol for the &#947;&#8208;oxidation of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated amides is reported. In this method, electrophilic amide activation, in a rare application to unsaturated amides, enables a regioselective reaction with TEMPO resulting in the title products. Radical cyclisation reactions and oxidation of the synthesised products highlight the synthetic utility of the products obtained.

&lt;p&gt;A direct &#947;-oxidation of &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated amides is reported. This regioselective reaction with TEMPO proceeds under mild conditions, tolerant of other carbonyl functionality. A rare example of regioselective amide activation of unsaturated substrates; it results in products carrying oxyaminated substitution ripe for remarkably selective radical cyclisation reactions.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemoselective and robust protocol for the &#947;-oxidation of &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated amides is reported. In this method, electrophilic amide activation, in a rare application to unsaturated amides, enables a regioselective reaction with TEMPO resulting in the title products. Radical cyclisation reactions and oxidation of the synthesised products highlight the synthetic utility of the products obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Imaging of Supported Lipid Monolayers using Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 35, Page 19041-19046, August 23, 2021. </description>

Label&#8208;free and non&#8208;destructive chemical and structural imaging of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111) is demonstrated with a spatial resolution of &#8776;20&#8197;nm using tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) for the first time. Ultra&#8208;high sensitivity and spatial resolution of TERS allows reproducible hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder within DPPC monolayers.







Abstract
Visualizing the molecular organization of lipid membranes is essential to comprehend their biological functions. However, current analytical techniques fail to provide a non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free characterization of lipid films under ambient conditions at nanometer length scales. In this work, we demonstrate the capability of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to probe the molecular organization of supported DPPC monolayers on Au (111), prepared using the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett (LB) technique. High&#8208;quality TERS spectra were obtained, that permitted a direct correlation of the topography of the lipid monolayer with its TERS image for the first time. Furthermore, hyperspectral TERS imaging revealed the presence of nanometer&#8208;sized holes within a continuous DPPC monolayer structure. This shows that a homogeneously transferred LB monolayer is heterogeneous at the nanoscale. Finally, the high sensitivity and spatial resolution down to 20&#8197;nm of TERS imaging enabled reproducible, hyperspectral visualization of molecular disorder in the DPPC monolayers, demonstrating that TERS is a promising nanoanalytical tool to investigate the molecular organization of lipid membranes.

We report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using the Langlois reagent. Arylcarbamates, including the bioactive compound chlorzoxazone, vorinostat precursor, chlorpropham, and teriflunomide precursors, were suitable for this reaction, leading to the formation of the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
The direct incorporation of a trifluoromethyl group on an aromatic ring using a radical pathway has been extensively investigated. However, the direct highly para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a class of arenes has not been achieved. In this study, we report a light&#8208;promoted 4,5&#8208;dichlorofluorescein (DCFS)&#8208;enabled para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of arylcarbamates using Langlois reagent. The preliminary mechanistic study revealed that the activated organic photocatalyst coordinated with the arylcarbamate led to para&#8208;selective C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation. Ten&#8208;gram scale reaction performs well highlighting the synthetic importance of this new protocol.

         <title>Cationic Carbene Analogues: Donor&#8208;Free Phosphenium and Arsenium Ions</title>

Donor&#8208;free, kinetically stabilized diarylphosphenium and arsenium ions were obtained using a combination of bulky rigid aryl substituents and a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Carbenes and their analogues have constantly enthralled chemists with their intriguing reactivity of ambiphilic character stemming from their electronic structures. Phosphenium and arsenium ions are fiercely reactive cationic species, the stabilization of which has been so far achieved in the condensed phase by dispersing the positive charge through electromeric conjugation with at least one electron&#8208;rich substituent (frequently amido groups). Although observed in the gas phase, the isolation of dicoordinate phosphenium and arsenium ions lacking such stabilizing ligands has eluded chemists for decades. Herein we show that by judicious choice of aromatic substituents, dicoordinate, donor&#8208;free, Lewis&#8208;superacidic phosphenium and arsenium ions can be kinetically stabilized. They feature singlet electronic ground states possessing a vacant p&#8208;orbital and an electron lone pair with predominantly s&#8208;character.

         <title>Low&#8208;Density 2D Superlattices Assembled via Directional DNA Bonding</title>

Cubic, octahedral, and rhombic&#8208;dodecahedral (RD) nanoparticle (NP) films are assembled on substrates using DNA. Octahedral and RD films rearrange into novel low&#8208;density 2D structures, which are difficult to access using other methods for assembling NPs into superlattices.







Abstract
It is critical to assemble nanoparticles (NPs) into superlattices with controlled symmetries and spacings on substrates for metamaterials applications, where such structural parameters dictate their properties. Here, we use DNA to assemble anisotropic NPs of three shapes&#8212;cubes, octahedra, and rhombic dodecahedra&#8212;on substrates and investigate their thermally induced reorganization into two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline films. We report two new low&#8208;density 2D structures, including a honeycomb lattice based on octahedral NPs. The low&#8208;density lattices favored here are not usually seen when particles are crystallized via other bottom&#8208;up assembly techniques. Furthermore, we show that, consistent with the complementary contact model, a primary driving force for crystallization is the formation of directional, face&#8208;to&#8208;face DNA bonds between neighboring NPs and between NPs and the substrate. Our results can be used to deliberately prepare crystalline NP films with novel morphologies.

         <title>Wiggling Mesopores Kinetically Amplify the Adsorptive Separation of Propylene/Propane</title>

Wiggling mesopores in monolithic carbon adsorbents lead to synergistic kinetic and equilibrium effects, allowing highly selective C3H6/C3H8 separation under practical dynamic conditions.







Abstract
Adsorptive separation is an appealing technology for propylene and propane separation; however, the challenge lies in the design of efficient adsorbents which can distinguish the two molecules having very similar properties. Here we report a kinetically amplified separation by creating wiggling mesopores in structurally robust carbon monoliths. The wiggling mesopores with alternating wide and narrow segments afford a surface area of 413&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a tri&#8208;modal pore size distribution centered at 1.5, 4.2 and 6.6&#8197;nm, respectively. The synergistically kinetic and equilibrium effects were observed and quantitatively assessed, which together ensured a remarkable propylene/propane selectivity up to 39. This selectivity outperformed not only the available carbon adsorbents but also highly competitive among the dominated crystalline porous adsorbents. In addition, the wiggling mesoporous carbon adsorbent showed excellent dynamical separation stability, which ensured its great potential in practical molecular separations.

Here we report a kinetically amplified separation by creating wiggling mesopores in structurally robust carbon monoliths. The wiggling mesopores with alternating wide and narrow segments afford a surface area of 413&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a tri-modal pore size distribution centered at 1.5, 4.2 and 6.6&#8197;nm, respectively. The synergistically kinetic and equilibrium effects were observed and quantitatively assessed, which together ensured a remarkable propylene/propane selectivity up to 39. This selectivity outperformed not only the available carbon adsorbents but also highly competitive among the dominated crystalline porous adsorbents. In addition, the wiggling mesoporous carbon adsorbent showed excellent dynamical separation stability, which ensured its great potential in practical molecular separations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Compressive Strain Modulation of Single Iron Sites on Helical Carbon Support Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high&#8208;curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self&#8208;assembled chiral surfactants. The high&#8208;curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8208;N4  sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8208;N4 sites with 1.5% compressed Fe&#8208;N bonds exhibit downshifted d&#8208;band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922 mA/cm2  at 0.9 V  vs.  RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8208;N4 sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three&#8208;dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine and Its Discrete &#960;&#8208;Stacked Homochiral Dimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this communication, we demonstrate a novel approach to prepare a discrete dimer of chiral phthalocyanine (Pc) by exploiting the flexible molecular geometry of helicenes, which enables structural interlocking and strong aggregation tendency of Pcs. Synthesized [7]helicene&#8211;Pc hybrid molecular structure, zinc&#8208;[7]helicenocyanine (Zn&#8208;7HPc), &#160;exclusively forms a stable dimeric pair consisting of two homochiral molecules. The dimerization constants were estimated to be as high as 8.96 &#215; 10  6  M  &#8211;1  and 3.42 &#215; 10  7  M  &#8211;1  in THF and DMSO, respectively, indicating remarkable stability of dimer. In addition, Zn&#8208;7HPc exhibited chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior, which resulted in preferential formation of a homochiral dimer also in the racemic sample. Two phthalocyanine subunits in the dimeric form strongly communicate with each other as revealed by a large comproportionation constant and observation of an IV&#8208;CT band for the thermodynamically stable mixed&#8208;valence state.</dc:description>

         <title>Development and Mechanistic Studies of the Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Alkenylation of Enamides with Vinyl Acetates: A Versatile Approach for Ketone Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H alkenylation of enamides with vinyl acetate has been developed as a versatile approach to diverse ketone functionalization (see scheme). The method exhibits broad substrate scope and high chemoselectivity. It also features a reaction pathway involving 1,2&#8208;Ir&#8208;C migratory insertion and syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination.







Abstract
Ketone functionalization is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Herein, we describe the development of an intermolecular C&#8722;H alkenylation of enamides with the feedstock chemical vinyl acetate to access diverse functionalized ketones. Enamides derived from various cyclic and acyclic ketones reacted efficiently, and a number of sensitive functional groups were tolerated. In this iridium&#8208;catalyzed transformation, two structurally and electronically similar alkenes&#8212;enamide and vinyl acetate&#8212;underwent selective cross&#8208;coupling through C&#8722;H activation. No reaction partner was used in large excess. The reaction is also pH&#8208; and redox&#8208;neutral with HOAc as the only stoichiometric by&#8208;product. Detailed experimental and computational studies revealed a reaction mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;Ir&#8208;C migratory insertion followed by syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;acetoxy elimination, which is different from that of previous vinyl acetate mediated C&#8722;H activation reactions. Finally, the alkenylation product can serve as a versatile intermediate to deliver a variety of structurally modified ketones.

         <title>Electro&#8208;mediated PhotoRedox Catalysis for Selective C(sp3)&#8211;O Cleavages of Phosphinated Alcohols to Carbanions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond C(sp2)&#8211;X cleavage: We report reductive cleavages of C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions by electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. Deoxygenations as well as E&#8208; or Z&#8208;selective olefinations are reported. Surprisingly, reactions tolerate C(sp2)&#8211;X cleavages such as aryl halides. Radical ion catalyst&#8208;substrate preassembly is key in enabling reactivity and overturning conventional redox chemoselectivity.







Abstract
We report a novel example of electro&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis (e&#8208;PRC) in the reductive cleavage of C(sp3)&#8722;O bonds of phosphinated alcohols to alkyl carbanions. As well as deoxygenations, olefinations are reported which are E&#8208;selective and can be made Z&#8208;selective in a tandem reduction/photosensitization process where both steps are photoelectrochemically promoted. Spectroscopy, computation, and catalyst structural variations reveal that our new naphthalene monoimide&#8208;type catalyst allows for an intimate dispersive precomplexation of its radical anion form with the phosphinate substrate, facilitating a reactivity&#8208;determining C(sp3)&#8722;O cleavage. Surprisingly and in contrast to previously reported photoexcited radical anion chemistries, our conditions tolerate aryl chlorides/bromides and do not give rise to Birch&#8208;type reductions.

         <title>Molecular Electrostatic Potential and Noncovalent Interactions in Derivatives of Group 8 Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#963;&#8208;hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group&#8197;8 elements are reported. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N&#8208;oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques including computational tools. We propose the term &#8220;osme bond&#8221; (OmB, Om=Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group&#8197;8 elements have the role of the electrophile.







Abstract
This communication reports experimental and theoretical evidences of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions in adducts between nitrogen or oxygen nucleophiles and tetroxides of osmium or other group&#8197;8 elements. Cocrystals between pyridine or pyridine N&#8208;oxide derivatives and osmium tetroxide are characterized through various techniques and rationalized as &#963;&#8208;hole interactions using DFT calculations and several other computational tools. We propose the term &#8220;osme bond&#8221; (OmB, Om=Fe, Ru, Os, (Hs)) for naming the noncovalent interactions wherein group&#8197;8 elements have the role of the electrophile. The word osme is the transcription of &#8000;&#963;&#956;&#942;, the ancient Greek word for smell that was used to name the heaviest group&#8197;8 element in relation to the smoky odor of its tetroxide.

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of an n/p&#8208;type Phenothiazine Organic Scaffold for Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) is explored as the cathode of aqueous Zn batteries, which contains both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties and exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (i.e., n/p&#8208;type at low potential + p&#8208;type at high potential). With the benefit of the hybrid charge storage mode, the full cells exhibit high average voltage and capacity, and achieve long&#8208;life and supercapacitor&#8208;like high power.







Abstract
The p&#8208;type or n&#8208;type redox reactions of organics are being used as the reversible electrodes to build the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with sustainable and tunable characteristics. However, the n&#8208;type organics that store cations generally exhibit low potential (&lt;0.8&#8197;V vs. Zn/Zn2+), while the p&#8208;type organics that store anions suffer from limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). Herein, we demonstrate that bis(phenylamino)phenothiazin&#8208;5&#8208;ium iodide (PTD&#8208;1) containing both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type redox moieties exhibits a hybrid charge storage mechanism (n/p&#8208;type at low potential, p&#8208;type at high potential). Such a hybrid mechanism combines the advantages of n&#8208; and p&#8208;type reactions and compensates for the associated drawbacks of each. Accordingly, the aqueous Zn//PTD&#8208;1 full cell shows a high voltage (1.8&#8197;Vmaximum or 1.1&#8197;Vaverage), a high capacity 188.24&#8197;mAh&#8201;gPTD&#8208;1&#8722;1 (achieved at 40&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), a long&#8208;life and a supercapacitor&#8208;like high power. These results shed new light on the design of advanced organic electrodes.

         <title>Crystalline Phase Recognition induced Domino Phase Transition and Luminescent Switching for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, a new mechanism, namely crystalline phase recognition (CPR), is proposed for the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transition of metal halides. Chiral  &#946;  &#8208;[Bmmim]  2  SbCl  5  (  2  , Bmmim = 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;methylimidazolium) can recognize achiral  &#945;  &#8208;[Bmmim]  2  SbCl  5  (  1  ) with a key&#8208;lock feature through inter&#8208;contacting of their single crystals, resulting in a domino phase transition (DPT). The concomitant photoluminescent (PL) switching is beneficial for us to observe the DPT  in&#8208;situ  . Liquid eutectic interface, stress&#8208;strain transfer and feasible thermodynamics are key issues for the CPR. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and PL measurements reveal that the optical absorption and emission for title isomers mainly originate from [SbCl  5  ]  2&#8208;  anions. The structural effects (  e.g.  , supramolecular interactions and [SbCl  5  ]  2&#8208;  distortion) on the optical emission (  e.g.  , photoluminescent quantum yield and peak shift) are clarified. As a novel manner of stimuli&#8208;response, the CPR induced DPT and luminescent switching exhibit potential application in advanced time&#8208;resolved information encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Exchange Induced Metal and Alloy Dual&#8208;exsolution in Perovskite Ferrite Oxides Boosting the Performance of Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exsolution is an effective method to in&#8208;situ construct metal or alloy decorated perovskite oxides with tunable properties in energy storage and conversion systems. However, precise control of the exsolved structure and compositions remains challenging. Herein, a temperature&#8208;controlled cation&#8208;exchange approach is introduced to achieve a unique dual&#8208;exsolution in perovskite La0.8Fe0.9Co0.1O3&#8208;&#948;  &#160;where both CoFe&#8208;alloy and Co metal are simultaneously exsolved from the parent perovskite, forming an alloy and metal co&#8208;decorated perovskite oxide. Mossbauer spectra proves that cation exchange of Fe atoms in CoFe alloy and Co cations in the perovskite is the key to the co&#8208;existence of Co metal and CoFe alloy. The obtained composite exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity as Li&#8208;O2  &#160;battery cathode catalysts with a specific discharge capacity of 6549.7 mAh g&#8208;1  &#160;and a cycling performance of 215 cycles without noticeable degradation. Theoretical calculation proves that the combination of decorated CoFe&#8208;alloy and Co&#8208;metal synergistically modulated the discharge reaction pathway that improves the performance of Li&#8208;O2  &#160;battery, which should pave the way for the application of high performance ferrite&#8208;based Li&#8208;O2  &#160;battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Carboxylation Reaction of 1,1&#8208;Diarylethylenes via Hydrorhodation&#8208;Rhodium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We achieved a  meta  &#8208;selective C&#8211;H carboxylation reaction of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives with CO  2  using a rhodium catalyst with NaO  i  Pr as a stoichiometric reductant. Together with hydrogenation of the ethylene moiety, a carboxyl group was introduced to the  meta&#8208;  position on the aryl ring with high selectivity over the  ortho  &#8208;positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that this carboxylation reaction proceeds via hydrorhodation on the ethylene moiety, followed by 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration and successive 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration on the aryl ring. The use of a bulky phosphine ligand seems to be the key to this unusual aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium shift.</dc:description>

         <title>Segmented Polyurethanes and Thermoplastic Elastomers from Elemental Sulfur with Enhanced Thermomechanical Properties and Flame Retardancy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of elemental sulfur from petroleum refining has created a technological opportunity to increase the valorization of elemental sulfur by the creation of high performance sulfur based plastics with improved thermomechanical properties, elasticity and flame retardancy. We report on a synthetic polymerization methodology to prepare the first example of sulfur based segmented multi&#8208;block polyurethanes (SPUs) and thermoplastic elastomers that incorporate an appreciable amount of sulfur into the final target material. This approach applied both the inverse vulcanization of S  8  with olefinic alcohols and dynamic covalent polymerizations with dienes to prepare sulfur polyols and terpolyols that were used in polymerizations with aromatic diisocyanates and short chain diols. Using these methods a new class of high molecular weight, soluble block copolymer polyurethanes were prepared as confirmed by Size Exclusion Chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, thermal analysis and microscopic imaging. These sulfur based polyurethanes were readily solution processed into large area free standing films where both the tensile strength and elasticity of these materials were controlled by variation of the sulfur polyol composition. SPUs with both high tensile strength (13&#8208;23 MPa) and ductility (348% strain at break) were prepared, along with SPU thermoplastic elastomers (578% strain at break) which are comparable values to classical thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs). The incorporation of sulfur into these polyurethanes, we observe enhanced flame retardancy in comparison to classical TPUs, which points to the opportunity to impart new properties to polymeric materials as a consequence of using elemental sulfur.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydrogen Activation by Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Aluminyls</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To date, aluminyl anions have been exclusively isolated as their potassium salts. We report herein the synthesis of the lithium and sodium aluminyls,  M2[Al(NONDipp)]2  (M  = Li, Na. NONDipp  = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;  ; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Both compounds crystallize from non&#8208;coordinating solvent as 'slipped' contacted dimeric pairs with strong  M  &#183;&#183;&#183;p(aryl) interactions. Isolation from Et2O solution affords the monomeric ion pairs (NONDipp)Al&#8211;M(Et2O)2, which contain discrete Al&#8211;Li and Al&#8211;Na bonds. The ability of the full series of Li, Na and K aluminyls to activate dihydrogen is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton Traffic Jam: Effect of Nanoconfinement and Acid Concentration on Proton Hopping Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The properties of the water network in concentrated HCl acid pools in nanometer&#8208;sized reverse non&#8208;ionic micelles were probed with TeraHertz absorption, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, and reactive force field simulations capable of describing proton hopping mechanisms. We identify that only at a critical micelle size of W0=9 do solvated proton complexes form in the water pool, accompanied by a change in mechanism from Grotthuss forward shuttling to one that favors local oscillatory hopping. This is due to a preference for H+ and Cl&#8211; ions to adsorb to the micelle interface, together with an acid concentration effect that causes a &#8220;traffic jam&#8221; in which the short&#8208;circuiting of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding motif of the hydronium ion decreases the forward hopping rate throughout the water interior even as the micelle size increases. These findings have implications for atmospheric chemistry, biochemical and biophysical environments, and energy materials, as transport of protons vital to these processes can be suppressed due to confinement, aggregation, and/or concentration.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching for a connection between the two&#8208;electron redox behavior of group 14 elements and their possible use as platforms for the photoreductive elimination of chlorine, we have studied the photochemistry of [(o&#8208;(Ph  2  P)C  6  H  4  )  2  Ge  IV  Cl  2  ]Pt  II  Cl  2  and [(o&#8208;(Ph  2  P)C  6  H  4  )  2  ClGe  III  ]Pt  III  Cl  3  , two newly isolated isomeric complexes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have designed, synthesized and crystallized 36 compounds, each containing an azide group and an oxygen atom separated by three bonds. Crystal structure analysis revealed that each of these molecules adopts a conformation in which the azide and oxygen groups orient syn to each other with a short O &#183;&#183;&#183; N  b  &#160;contact. Geometry&#8208;optimized structures [using&#160; M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311G(d,p) level of theory ] also showed the syn conformation in all 36 of these cases, suggesting that this not merely a crystal packing effect. Quantum topological analysis using Bader&#8217;s Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory revealed bond paths and bond critical points (BCP) in these structures suggesting its nature and energetics to be similar to weak hydrogen bonding. The NCI&#8208;RDG plot clearly revealed the attractive interaction consisting of electrostatic or dispersive components in all the 36 systems. NBO analysis suggested a weak orbital&#8208;relaxation (charge&#8208;transfer) contribution of energy for a few&#160;  (sp2)  O&#8208;donor systems. Natural population analysis (NPA) and molecular electrostatic potential mapping (MESP) of these crystal structures further revealed the existence of favorable azide&#8208;oxygen interaction. &#160; A CSD search indicated the frequent and consistent occurrence of this interaction and its role dictating the syn conformation of azide and oxygen in molecules where these groups are separated by 2&#8208;4 bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Anion&#8208;Derived Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Regulating the Electrolyte Structure of Anions in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Sustainable Pd(OAc)2 Hydroquinone Cocatalyst System for Cis&#8208;Selective Dibenzoyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 1,4&#8208;diacyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing  cis  &#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO  2  , which limit process sustainability and large&#8208;scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with  tert&#8208;  butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from  trans  to  cis  diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high  cis  selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large scale applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Garsubellin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Garsubellin A is a meroterpene capable of enhancing the enzyme choline acetyltransferase whose decreased level is believed to play a central role in the symptoms of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Due to the potentially useful biological activity together with the novel bridged and fused cyclic molecular architecture, garsubellin A has garnered substantial synthetic interest, but its absolute stereostructure has been undetermined. We report here the first enantioselective total synthesis of (+)&#8208;garsubellin A. Our synthesis relies on stereoselective fashioning of a cyclohexanone framework and double conjugate addition of 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol that promotes aldol cyclization to build the bicyclic [3.3.1] skeleton. The twelve&#8208;step, protecting group&#8208;free synthetic route has enabled the syntheses of both the natural (&#8211;)&#8208;garsubellin A and its unnatural (+)&#8208;antipode for biological evaluations.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deracemization of racemic chiral compounds is an attractive approach in asymmetric synthesis, but its development has been hindered by energetic and kinetic challenges. Here we describe a catalytic deracemization method for secondary benzylic alcohols which are important synthetic intermediates and end products for many industries. Driven by visible light only, this method is based on sequential photochemical dehydrogenation followed by enantioselective thermal hydrogenation. The combination of a heterogeneous dehydrogenation photocatalyst and a chiral molecular hydrogenation catalyst is essential to ensure two distinct pathways for the forward and reverse reactions. These reactions convert a large number of racemic aryl alkyl alcohols into their enantiomerically enriched forms in good yields and enantioselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic C3&#8208;Indole Methylation &#8211; A Useful Tool for Natural Product Inspired Stereoselective Synthesis of Pyrroloindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds bearing a pyrroloindole framework is often laborious. In contrast, there are several  S  &#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM) dependent methyl transferases known for stereo&#8208; and regioselective methylation at the C3 position of various indoles, directly leading to the formation of the desired pyrroloindole moiety. Herein, the SAM dependent methyl transferase PsmD from  Streptomyces griseofuscus  , a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, is characterized in detail. The biochemical properties of PsmD and its substrate scope was demonstrated. Preparative scale enzymatic methylation including SAM regeneration was achieved for three selected substrates after a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiment optimization.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#947;&#8208;Hydroxyasparagine: a Multifunctional Unnatural Amino Acid That is a Good P1 Substrate of Asparaginyl Peptide Ligases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptidyl Asparaginyl Ligases (PALs) are powerful tools for peptide macrocyclization. Herein, we report that a derivative of Asn, namely  N  &#947;  &#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;asparagine or Asn(OH), is an unnatural P1 substrate of PALs. Using Asn(OH)&#8208;mediated cyclization, we prepared cyclic peptides as new matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) inhibitors displaying the hydroxamic acid moiety of Asn(OH) as the key pharmacophore. Cyclic peptide  17  , the most potent of these (K  i  = 2.8 &#177; 0.5 nM), was built on the hyper&#8208;stable tetracyclic scaffold of rhesus theta defensin&#8208;1. The Asn(OH) residue in the cyclized peptides can also be readily oxidized to Asp. Using this approach, we synthesized several bioactive Asp&#8208;containing cyclic peptides (MCoTI&#8208;II, kB2, SFTI, and integrin&#8208;targeting RGD peptides) that are otherwise difficult targets for PAL&#8208;catalyzed cyclization due to unfavorable kinetics of the P1&#8208;Asp substrates. This study demonstrates that substrate engineering is a useful strategy to expand the application of PAL ligation in the synthesis of therapeutic cyclic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective, Scalable Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalytic O&#8208;Arylation of Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly chemoselective O&#8208;arylation was achieved by electrochemically&#8208;driven nickel catalysis. This method exhibits broad substrate scope comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd, Cu and photochemically facilitated Ni catalysis. This e&#8208;etherification forged ether bonds in demanding settings where other methods failed. With its excellent scalability, this work represents a modular, mild, and simple ether bond formation for contemporary medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The formation of aryl&#8208;alkyl ether bonds through cross coupling of alcohols with aryl halides represents a useful strategic departure from classical SN2 methods. Numerous tactics relying on Pd&#8208;, Cu&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;based catalytic systems have emerged over the past several years. Herein we disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemically driven protocol to achieve this useful transformation with a broad substrate scope in an operationally simple way. This electrochemical method does not require strong base, exogenous expensive transition metal catalysts (e.g., Ir, Ru), and can easily be scaled up in either a batch or flow setting. Interestingly, e&#8208;etherification exhibits an enhanced substrate scope over the mechanistically related photochemical variant as it tolerates tertiary amine functional groups in the alcohol nucleophile.

         <title>Optimizing Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases and Li&#8208;Ion Flux/Solvation for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with Qua&#8208;Functional Heptafluorobutyric Anhydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) is proposed as qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize anode(cathode)/electrolyte interphases and Li&#8208;ion flux/solvation. The reduction/oxidation decomposition and high fluorine content of HFA facilitate the formation of a uniform inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for depositing Li evenly, to form a compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) to reduce the dissolution of transition metal ions.







Abstract
The safety and electrochemical performance of rechargeable lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are primarily influenced by the additives in the organic liquid electrolytes. However, multi&#8208;functional additives are still rarely reported. Herein, we proposed heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFA) as a qua&#8208;functional additive to optimize the composition and structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The reduction/oxidation decomposition of the fluorine&#8208;rich HFA facilitate uniform inorganic&#8208;rich SEI and compact cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation, which enables stable lithium plating during charge and suppresses the dissolution of transition&#8208;metal ions. Moreover, HFA optimizes the Li&#8208;ion solvation for stable Li plating/stripping and serves as the surfactant to enhance the wettability of the separator by the electrolyte to increase Li&#8208;ion flux. The symmetric Li&#8741;Li cell with 1.0&#8197;wt&#8201;% HFA electrolyte had an excellent cycling performance over 340&#8197;h at 1.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 0.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 while the Li&#8741;NCM622 cell maintained high capacity retention after 250&#8197;cycles and outstanding rate performance even at 15&#8197;C.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valence Zn&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) Single&#8208;Atom Material as Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction represents a promising approach to sustainably produce carbon&#8208;based chemicals and fuels but has been experiencing challenges in developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;atom catalyst containing low&#8208;valence zinc atoms (Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC) is reported. It is revealed that Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC contains a mixture of saturated four&#8208;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N4) and unsaturated three&#8209;coordinate (Zn&#8208;N3) sites. The latter makes Zn a low&#8209;valence state, as deduced from X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and density functional theory (DFT) simulation. As a result, Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC catalyzes electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with near&#8208;unity selectivity in water at an overpotential as low as 310 mV. Importantly, a record&#8208;high current density up to 1 A cm&#8208;2 can be achieved together with high CO selectivity of &gt;95% using Zn&#948;+&#8208;NC in a flow cell reactor. DFT calculations suggest that the unsaturated Zn&#8208;N3 site could dramatically reduce the energy barrier by stabilizing the COOH* (* represents active sites) intermediate due to the electron&#8208;rich environment of Zn. This work not only sheds light on the relationship among coordination number, valence state, and catalytic performance of Zn single&#8209;atom sites, but also succeeds in achieving high current densities relevant for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Extremes of Covalency in M&#8211;Al bonds: Lithium and Zinc Aluminyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic routes to lithium, magnesium and zinc aluminyl complexes are reported, allowing for the first structural character&#8208;ization of a lithium&#8208;aluminium bond. Structural and quantum chemical studies are consistent with the presence of a highly polar Li&#8211;Al interaction, characterized by a low bond order and relatively little charge transfer from Al to Li. Comparison with the magnesium and zinc systems reveals changes to both the M&#8211;Al bond and the (NON)Al fragment consistent with greater covalent character, with the latter complex being shown to react with CO  2  &#160;via a pathway that implies that the&#160;  zinc  &#160;centre acts as the nucleophilic partner.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Frequency Fingerprint for Ion Interaction Networks in a Confined Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transport of molecules and ions through biological nanopores are governed by the interaction networks among the restricted ions, transported molecules and residue moieties at pore walls. However, identification of such weak ion fluctuations from only few tens of ions inside nanopore confinement is hardly to achieve due to measurement limitations. Here, we developed an advanced frequency method to achieve qualitative and spectral analysis of the ion interaction networks in a nanopore. Results demonstrated that the peak frequency  f  m  reveals the dissociation rate between nanopore and ions, while  a  m  depicts the number of combined ions with nanopore after an interaction equilibrium. We further established a mathematical model for single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint, which achieved prediction of interaction characteristics for mutant nanopores. This single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint is important for classification, characterization and prediction of synergetic interaction networks inside nanoconfinement, which holds a promise for high accurate nanopore DNA/protein sequencing.</dc:description>
