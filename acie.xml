         <title>Bioorthogonal Lanthanide Molecular Probes for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Mass Spectrometry Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we developed clickable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling. In combination with metabolic labeling, these NIR Ln (Ln=Yb, Er) complexes enabled NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of proteins, glycans, and nucleic acids in cells. Furthermore, they were applied for multicolor imaging and NIR click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM). By combining these Ln probes with time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), we achieved the first dual&#8208;modal NIRF&#8208;SIMS imaging.







Abstract
We report here the development of clickable and highly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent lanthanide (Ln) complexes for bioorthogonal labeling of biomolecules. These azide&#8208; or alkyne&#8208;functionalized Ln complexes are hydrophilic and fluorogenic, exhibiting a strong increase of NIR fluorescence upon conjugation with biomolecules. Metabolic labeling of biomolecules with azide or alkyne, followed by click labeling with the Ln complexes, enables NIR fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of DNA, RNA, proteins, and glycans in cells. Furthermore, multicolor imaging is performed by combining click&#8208;labeling with the Ln complexes and immunostaining. In addition, the Ln complexes is compatible with click&#8208;expansion microscopy (click&#8208;ExM), which enables high&#8208;resolution NIRF imaging of cellular glycoproteins. Finally, the Ln complexes can be used for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) imaging, thus achieving the first example of dual&#8208;modal imaging combining NIRF and SIMS microscopies.

         <title>One and Two&#8208;Photon Excited Fluorescence Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Symmetry&#8208;Reduced AIEgen&#8208;Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;reduced TPE&#8208;cored ligand was applied for the construction of MOFs with dense packing structures, which are beneficial to the improvement of one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescent properties, achieving high TPA cross&#8208;sections of &#8776;3000&#8197;GM.







Abstract
By designing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based AIEgen&#8208;ligand with reduced symmetry, we obtained two alkaline&#8208;earth metal&#8208;based MOFs (LIFM&#8208;102 and LIFM&#8208;103) with dense packing structures and low porosity as proved by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and CO2 sorption data. Excitingly, the desolvated MOFs with rigid environment and reduced lattice free solvent exhibit high quantum yields (QY, 64.9&#8201;% and 79.4&#8201;%) and excellent two&#8208;photon excited photoluminescence (TPA cross&#8208;sections, 2946.6&#8197;GM and 2899.0&#8197;GM), while maintaining the external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties suitable for anticounterfeit fields. The effect of ligand conformation was validated by comparing the structure and fluorescence properties of the samples before and after desolvation and further verified by theoretical calculations. This work expands the study on TPE&#8208;cored materials to symmetry&#8208;reduced ligand and might bring forward novel structures and excellent photoluminescent properties in the future.

         <title>Simultaneous Photoactivation of cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway and Pyroptosis by Platinum(II) Triphenylamine Complexes for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first small molecule that can activate cGAS&#8208;STING in a photocontrollable way is reported. Upon irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 can damage mitochondrial DNA, the nuclear envelope and nuclear DNA sequentially, which effectively releases DNA into cytoplasm to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Activation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway is a potent anticancer immunotherapeutic strategy, and the induction of pyroptosis is a feasible way to stimulate the anticancer immune responses. Herein, two PtII complexes (Pt1 and Pt2) were designed as photoactivators of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In response to light irradiation, Pt1 and Pt2 could damage mitochondrial/nuclear DNA and the nuclear envelope to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, and concurrently induce pyroptosis in cancer cells, which evoked an intense anticancer immune response in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Overall, we present the first photoactivator of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, which may provide an innovative design strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Surface Diffusion Aided by a Chirality Change of Self&#8208;Assembled Oligomers under 2D Confinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a new functional molecular system with a combination of several advanced features, including a self&#8208;assembled oligomer, surface chirality, chirality switching, and finally their motion on the surface. Our results suggest that nonchiral molecules may be designed to induce switchable enantiomeric surface assemblies, relevant for heterogeneous catalysts.







Abstract
Chirality switching of self&#8208;assembled molecular structures is of potential interest for designing functional materials but is restricted by the strong interaction between the embedded molecules. Here, we report on an unusual approach based on reversible chirality changes of self&#8208;assembled oligomers using variable&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy supported by quantum mechanical calculations. Six functionalized diazomethanes each self&#8208;assemble into chiral wheel&#8208;shaped oligomers on Ag(111). At 130&#8197;K, a temperature far lower than expected, the oligomers change their chirality even though the molecules reside in an embedded self&#8208;assembled structure. Each chirality change is accompanied by a slight center&#8208;of&#8208;mass shift. We show how the identical activation energies of the two processes result from the interplay of the chirality change with surface diffusion, findings that open the possibility of implementing various functional materials from self&#8208;assembled supramolecular structures.

         <title>Quantifying the Solution Structure of Metal Nanoclusters Using Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) can directly quantify the overall structure parameters of nanoclusters in solution without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization. A series of silver and gold nanoclusters were studied with SANS demonstrating good agreement with crystallographic data in both the shape, size and the molecular weight information.







Abstract
Metal nanoclusters are a unique class of synthetic material, as their crystal structures can be resolved using X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their chemical formula can be precisely determinated from mass spectroscopy. However, a complete structure characterization by these two techniques is often a challenging task. Here, we utilize small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) to directly quantify the key structure parameters of a series of silver and gold nanoclusters in solution. The results not only correlate well to their crystallographic structures, but also allow the quantification of the counterions layer surrounding charged nanoclusters in solution. Furthermore, when combining with X&#8208;ray scattering, it is possible to estimate the molecular weight of both the metal core and the ligand shell of nanoclusters. This work offers an alternative characterization tool for nanoclusters without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization.

&lt;p&gt;Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) can directly quantify the overall structure parameters of nanoclusters in solution without the requirement of crystallization or gas phase ionization. A series of silver and gold nanoclusters were studied with SANS demonstrating good agreement with crystallographic data in both the shape, size and the molecular weight information.

         <title>Greatly Enhanced Accessibility and Reproducibility of Worm&#8208;like Micelles by In Situ Crosslinking Polymerization&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greatly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles (W) is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA), leading to significantly improved reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles. The reliability of the methodology has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems with different formulations of monomers, macro RAFT agents, crosslinkers, solvents, and polymerization temperatures.







Abstract
Worm&#8208;like micelles have attracted great interest due to their anisotropic structures. However, the experimental conditions for obtaining worm&#8208;like micelles are very restricted, which usually causes seriously poor reproducibility. In this work, significantly enhanced accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is realized by in situ crosslinking polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). The reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is greatly improved due to the significantly enlarged experimental windows of worm&#8208;like micelles in the morphology diagram. Moreover, the reliability of the methodology to enhance the accessibility of worm&#8208;like micelles has been demonstrated in various in situ crosslinking PISA systems. The greatly enhanced accessibility and reproducibility of worm&#8208;like micelles is undoubtedly cost&#8208;effective especially in scale&#8208;up production, which paves the way for further application of worm&#8208;like micelles with various compositions and functionalities.

         <title>Colloidal Jamming by Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembled Polymers: A Robust Route for Ultrahigh Efficient Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic polymers blocks the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids giving an efficient protein and peptide encapsulation. Profiting from the high mass fraction of therapeutics (58.3&#8197;wt%), the mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times lower than that with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones. One injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites held the blood glucose level within normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
The control of cargo phase&#8208;transfer is of interest for many applications in science and technology. Herein, we report a simple, versatile and robust method to block the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids by interfacial self&#8208;assembled amphiphilic polymer molecules. After simply increasing the concentration of amphiphilic polymers, the orientation of interfacial polymer molecules changed from flat to upright, forming a thick three&#8208;dimensional polymer layer at the oil&#8208;water interface. Even under fierce external force, this thick interfacial layer robustly prevented the phase&#8208;transfer of cargo colloids, resulting in an ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency (up to 97.1&#8201;%) for proteins and peptides. One single injection of high insulin&#8208;loaded microcomposites (58.3&#8197;wt%) kept the blood glucose level within the normoglycemic state for 10&#8197;days in type&#8197;1 diabetic rats. The mass of administrated amphiphilic polymers was 1889&#8197;times smaller than that of microcomposites prepared with non&#8208;amphiphilic ones.

         <title>Anticancer Approach Inspired by the Hepatotoxic Mechanism of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids with Glycosylated Artificial Metalloenzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. We developed a therapeutic approach, in which a precursor is transformed into a synthetic DHP via 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization catalyzed by a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM). In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a glycosylated ArM suppressed cell growth of targeted cancer cells.







Abstract
Metabolic oxidation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) from herbal and dietary supplements by cytochrome P450 produces dehydro&#8208;PAs (DHPs), which leads to toxicities. A highly reactive cation species generated from the active pyrrole ring of DHPs readily reacts with various cellular components, causing hepatotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Inspired by PA&#8208;induced hepatic damage, we developed a therapeutic approach based on a cyclization precursor that can be transformed into a synthetic DHP under physiological conditions through gold&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization using a gold&#8208;based artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) instead of through metabolic oxidation by cytochrome P450. In cell&#8208;based assays, the synthesis of the DHP by a cancer&#8208;targeting glycosylated gold&#8208;based ArM substantially suppressed cell growth of the targeted cancer cells without causing cytotoxicity to untargeted cells, highlighting the potential of the strategy to be used therapeutically in vivo.

         <title>Torsional Strain&#8208;Independent Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides is reported. Under auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, both tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls were obtained in high yields and enantioselectivities. These products could be converted to bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies provided key insights into the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.







Abstract
Catalytic asymmetric dynamic kinetic resolution of configurationally labile bridged biaryls is emerging as a powerful strategy for atropisomer synthesis. However, the reported examples suffer from an inherent challenge as the reactivity is highly dependent on the torsional strain of the biaryl substrates, which significantly narrows down the scope and hampers the application. Herein, we report our discovery and development of a torsional strain&#8208;independent reaction between biaryl thionolactones and activated isocyanides. By employing auto&#8208;tandem silver catalysis, a universal synthesis of both tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted thiazole&#8208;containing biaryls was realized in high yields with high enantioselectivities. In addition, these products could be facilely converted to a novel type of bridged biaryls bearing an eight&#8208;membered lactone. Mechanistic studies were carried out to elucidate the cause of this unusual torsional strain&#8208;independent reactivity.

         <title>[8]Cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine as a Super&#8208;Cyclooctatetraene: Dynamic Behavior, Global Aromaticity, and Open&#8208;Shell Diradical Character in the Neutral and Dicationic States</title>

A super&#8208;cyclooctatetraene, one new core&#8208;expanded analogue of cyclooctatetraene, has been synthesized by insertion of a benzenoid/quinoid C6H4 unit into each C&#8722;C bond. The neutral molecule shows three dynamic processes on the NMR time scale and non&#8208;aromatic character, whereas its dication exhibits enhanced planarity, global aromatic, and open&#8208;shell diradical character.







Abstract
An [8]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylmethine derivative ([8]CPPM&#8208;Mes) was synthesized. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed a tub&#8208;shaped geometry similar to the cyclooctatetraene, with alternating benzenoid/quinoid structure. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR measurements disclosed a slow valence tautomerization process with an interconversion energy barrier of about 11.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at coalescence temperature (273&#8197;K), and two more lower&#8208;barrier dynamic processes involving flipping of the 1,4&#8208;phenyl rings on the backbone and rotation of the mesityl substituents. Its dication ([8]CPPM&#8208;Mes2+) adopts a bowl&#8208;like geometry with a smaller depth of the cavity, and a slow bowl inversion process was observed by dynamic NMR. The bond lengths of the benzenoid/quinoid rings are more averaged via electron delocalization and the molecule shows global aromaticity, which was further validated by NMR and theoretical analysis. [8]CPPM&#8208;Mes2+ exhibits open&#8208;shell diradical character with a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8722;1.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1).

         <title>Boosting Bismuth(III) Complexation for Targeted &#945;&#8208;Therapy (TAT) Applications with the Mesocyclic Chelating Agent AAZTA
</title>

[Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; and derivatives have been comprehensively characterized. Fast formation, remarkable stability, and strong accumulation in AR42J tumour make 213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; an outstanding candidate for TAT.







Abstract
Targeted &#945; therapy (TAT) is a promising tool in the therapy of cancer. The radionuclide 213BiIII shows favourable physical properties for this application, but the fast and stable chelation of this metal ion remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the mesocyclic chelator AAZTA quickly coordinates BiIII at room temperature, leading to a robust complex. A comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of [Bi(AAZTA)]&#8722; is reported, along with bifunctional [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;COO&#8722;)]2&#8722; and the targeted agent [Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;, which incorporates the SSR agonist Tyr3&#8208;octreotate. An unexpected increase in the stability and kinetic inertness of the metal chelate was observed for the bifunctional derivative and was maintained for the peptide conjugate. A cyclotron&#8208;produced 205/206Bi mixture was used as a model of 213Bi in labelling, stability, and biodistribution experiments, allowing the efficiency of [213Bi(AAZTA&#8208;C4&#8208;TATE)]&#8722; to be estimated. High accumulation in AR42J tumours and reduced kidney uptake were observed with respect to the macrocyclic chelate [213Bi(DOTA&#8208;TATE)]&#8722;.

         <title>The Growth Mechanism of a Conductive MOF Thin Film in Spray&#8208;based Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer Liquid Phase Epitaxy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limited and self&#8208;repairing growth mechanism was demonstrated for the preparation of LBL&#8208;LPE thin films. The method provides a high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientation at its bottom part.







Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer liquid&#8208;phase epitaxy (LBL&#8208;LPE) method is widely used in preparing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) thin films with the merits of controlling thickness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation for superior performances in applications. The LBL&#8208;LPE growth mechanism related to the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation is critical but very challenging to study. In this work, a novel &#8220;in&#8208;plane self&#8208;limiting and self&#8208;repairing&#8221; thin&#8208;film growth mechanism is demonstrated by the combination study of the grain boundary, structure defect, and orientation of Cu3(HHTP)2&#8208;xC thin film via microscopic analysis techniques and electrical measurements. This mechanism results a desired high&#8208;quality MOF thin film with preferred in&#8208;plane orientations at its bottom for the first time and is very helpful for optimizing the LBL&#8208;LPE method, understanding the growth cycle&#8208;dependent properties of MOF thin film, and inspiring the investigations of the biomimetic self&#8208;repairing materials.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Layer Metal Clusters on 2D Ordered Mesoporous TiO2 Nanosheets</title>

         <dc:description>
Fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets have been synthesized by a universal sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy. The resultant catalyst shows unique chemical state and nanostructures, enabling a high catalytic activity, selectivity, poison tolerance and stability for the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene.







Abstract
A sulfhydryl monomicelles interfacial assembly strategy is presented for the synthesis of fully exposed single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt clusters on 2D mesoporous TiO2 (SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2) nanosheets. This synthesis features the introduction of the sulfhydryl group in monomicelles to finely realize the controllable co&#8208;assembly process of Pt precursors within ordered mesostructures. The resultant SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows uniform SAL Pt clusters (&#8776;1.2&#8197;nm) anchored in ultrathin 2D nanosheets (&#8776;7&#8197;nm) with a high surface area (139&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1), a large pore size (&#8776;25&#8197;nm) and a high dispersion (&#8776;99&#8201;%). Moreover, this strategy is universal for the synthesis of other SAL metal clusters (Pd and Au) on 2D mTiO2 with high exposure and accessibility. When used as a catalyst for hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrostyrene, the SAL&#8208;Pt@mTiO2 shows a high catalytic activity (TOF up to 2424&#8197;h&#8722;1), 100&#8201;% selectivity for 4&#8208;aminostyrene, good stability, and anti&#8208;resistance to thiourea poisoning under relatively mild conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 10&#8197;bar).

         <title>Modulating Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Interactions in the Solid State using Compressible Macrocyclic Hosts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cavity compressing strategy is proposed to modulate the macrocyclic host&#8211;guest charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions. The solid&#8208;state CT affinities of perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene toward various electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form.







Abstract
Modulating intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) interactions between specific donor and acceptor species in host&#8211;guest systems is a big challenge and full of research value in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work, a strategy to modulate the supramolecular ICT interactions in the solid state is developed by compressing the binding cavity of a macrocyclic host named perethylated leaning pillar[6]arene (p&#8208;EtLP6). The solid&#8208;state ICT affinities of p&#8208;EtLP6 toward multi&#8208;types of electron&#8208;deficient planar guests could be significantly enhanced by transforming the macrocyclic backbone from the original para&#8208;bridged mode into a hybrid para&#8208; and meta&#8208;bridged isomeric form (m&#8208;EtLP6). X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural analyses incorporating theoretical calculation demonstrate that the improved ICT affinities are mainly attributed to the superior host&#8211;guest size fit arising from the compressed binding cavity in m&#8208;EtLP6 as compared with p&#8208;EtLP6.

         <title>Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Tubular Conjugated Polymer 2D Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with tubular channels were prepared by self&#8208;assembly followed by UV irradiation of amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes in aqueous solution. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling and colorimetric DNA sensing was demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets.







Abstract
Creation of new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) architectures has attracted significant attention in the field of self&#8208;assembly for structural diversity and new functionalization. Although numerous 2D polymer nanosheets have been reported, 2D nanosheets with tubular channels have been unexplored. Herein, we describe a new strategy for the fabrication of stimulus&#8208;responsive conjugated polymer 2D nanosheets with hollow cavities. Amphiphilic macrocyclic diacetylenes self&#8208;assembled in an aqueous solution in a columnar manner to afford bilayered 2D nanosheets with intrinsically tubular nanochannels. UV&#8208;induced polymerization resulted in the generation of blue&#8208;colored tubular conjugated polydiacetylene 2D nanosheets. Immobilization of gold nanoparticles, fluorescence labeling with FRET phenomenon and colorimetric DNA sensing were demonstrated with these new 2D nanosheets. In addition, the free NH2 containing polymerized 2D nanosheet was utilized for conductivity behavior and grafting on graphene oxide (GO).

         <title>Understanding the Nature and Strength of Noncovalent Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new series of fullerene&#8208;based molecular torsion balances and examined their folding equilibrium to understand the nature and strength of noncovalent face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8722;fullerene interactions. The contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions were experimentally quantified by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.







Abstract
Face&#8208;to&#8208;face noncovalent arene&#8722;fullerene interactions are important in several research fields such as synthetic chemistry, materials chemistry, and medicinal chemistry; however, their nature and strength are still poorly understood. In this study, we prepare a fullerene&#8208;based torsion balance containing thioanisole, phenol, naphthalene, azulene, and pyrene moieties as a unimolecular model system. Moreover, we compare the folding free energies between the folded and the unfolded conformers of a series of the molecular torsion balances to quantify noncovalent interactions between arenes and the fullerene surface. This work demonstrates that the contributions of polarizabilities, anionic charges, electronic dipole moments, and the number of arene rings to the interactions can be experimentally measured by analyzing the folding equilibrium of the molecular torsion balances.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Regulated Perovskite Vertical Growth for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene nanosheets introduced to SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells maximize the interface matching between SnO2 and perovskite and induce vertically aligned crystal growth. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved by 15&#8201;%, reaching 23.07&#8201;%, and the short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, an unencapsulated device maintains 90&#8201;% of its initial PCE after 500&#8197;h of storage in ambient air.







Abstract
Defects at the interfaces of perovskite (PVK) thin films are the main factors responsible for instability and low photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PVK solar cells (PSCs). Here, a SnO2&#8208;MXene composite electron transport layer (ETL) is used in PSCs to improve interfacial contact and passivate defects at the SnO2/perovskite interface. The introduced MXene regulates SnO2 dispersion and induces a vertical growth of PVK. The lattice matching of MXene and perovskite suppresses the concentration of interfacial stress, thereby obtaining a perovskite film with low defects. Compared with SnO2&#8208;based device, the PCE of SnO2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based device is improved by 15&#8201;% and its short&#8208;circuit current is up to 25.07&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, unencapsulated device maintained about 90&#8201;% of its initial efficiency even after 500&#8197;h of storage at 30&#8211;40&#8201;% relative humidity in ambient air. The composite ETL strategy provides a route to engineer interfacial passivation between metal halide perovskites and ETLs.

         <title>Orthogonal Charge Transfer by Precise Positioning of Silver Single Atoms and Clusters on Carbon Nitride for Efficient Piezocatalytic Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;C2N2 single&#8208;sites and Ag clusters are co&#8208;confined on carbon nitride (CN). The enhanced in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization by Ag single atoms and rapid out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transfer between Ag clusters and CN collectively contribute to the excellent piezocatalytic pure water splitting.







Abstract
Developing efficient piezocatalytic systems for two&#8208;electron water splitting (TEWS) with producing H2 and H2O2 shows great promise to meet the industrial demand. Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co&#8208;anchored on carbon nitride (AgSA+C&#8722;CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in&#8208;plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, AgSA+C&#8722;CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain. Consequently, a superior H2 and H2O2 evolution rate of 7.90&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 5.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 is delivered by AgSA+C&#8722;CN, respectively, far exceeding that of the previously reported piezocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Ag&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single-sites and Ag clusters are co-confined on carbon nitride (CN). The enhanced in-plane piezoelectric polarization by Ag single atoms and rapid out-of-plane charge transfer between Ag clusters and CN collectively contribute to the excellent piezocatalytic pure water splitting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing efficient piezocatalytic systems for two-electron water splitting (TEWS) with producing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows great promise to meet the industrial demand. Herein, Ag single atoms (SAs) and clusters are co-anchored on carbon nitride (Ag&lt;sub&gt;SA+C&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CN) to serve as the multifunctional sites for efficient TEWS. The Ag SAs enhance the in-plane piezoelectric polarization of CN that is intimately modulated by the atomic coordination induced charge redistribution, and Ag clusters afford strong interfacial electric field to remarkably promote the out-of-plane migration of piezoelectrons from CN. Moreover, Ag&lt;sub&gt;SA+C&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CN yields a larger piezoresistive effect that elevates carrier mobility under strain. Consequently, a superior H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of 7.90&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is delivered by Ag&lt;sub&gt;SA+C&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;CN, respectively, far exceeding that of the previously reported piezocatalysts. This work not only presents the SAs decoration as an available polarization enhancement strategy, but also sheds light on the superiority of multi-sites engineering in piezocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Two imine&#8208;based COFs, TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF and TPB&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF, were constructed. They served as heterogeneous catalysts for photo&#8208;induced PET&#8208;RCMP under visible light irradiation, realizing efficient polymerization in both oil and aqueous solvent, producing polymers with low molecular weight dispersity and high chain&#8208;end fidelity.







Abstract
Two imine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalysts with different building units, TPB&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF and TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF, for photo&#8208;induced energy transfer reversible complexation&#8208;mediated radical polymerization (PET&#8208;RCMP) were developed and investigated, producing ideal polymers with accurate molecular weight and moderate dispersity under visible light irradiation. The chain extension and spatiotemporal control experiments revealed the high chain&#8208;end fidelity of polymers and the compatibility of RCMP processes in both bulk and aqueous system. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that heteroatom&#8208;doped TAT&#8208;DMTA&#8208;COF exhibits higher activities for weakening C&#8722;I bond energy barrier, which promotes PET&#8208;RCMP polymerization performance. This work demonstrates that rational adjustment of building block for constructing COF heterogeneous photocatalyst can enhance the catalytic performance of PET&#8208;RCMP, providing a design methodology for the development of polymeric organic photoelectric semiconductor catalysts to mediate RCMP.

         <title>An Atypical Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Enables Efficient Biosynthesis of Extender Units for Engineering a Polyketide Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase (ACS, UkaQ) with broad substrate specificity and an unusual catalytic mode was identified. Its stability and catalytic activity were remarkably improved by protein engineering, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs. In combination with permissive carboxylases, diverse extender units were synthesized and used to engineer the polyketide carbon scaffold of antimycin.







Abstract
Acyl&#8208;CoAs are key precursors of primary and secondary metabolism. Their efficient biosynthesis is often impeded by the limited substrate specificity and low in vivo activity of acyl&#8208;CoA synthetases (ACSs) due to regulatory acylation of the catalytically important lysine residue in motif A10 (Lys&#8208;A10). In this study, we identified an unusual ACS (UkaQ) from the UK&#8208;2A biosynthetic pathway that naturally lacks the Lys&#8208;A10 residue and exhibits extraordinarily broad substrate specificity. Protein engineering significantly improved its stability and catalytic activity, enabling it to synthesize a large variety of acyl&#8208;CoAs with highly robust activity. By combining it with permissive carboxylases, we produced a large array of polyketide extender units and obtained six novel halobenzyl&#8208;containing antimycin analogues through an engineered biosynthetic pathway. This study significantly expands the catalytic mode of ACSs and provides a potent tool for the biosynthesis of acyl&#8208;CoA&#8208;derived natural products.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Alkoxycarbonylation of Alkyl Bromides via a Two&#8208;Electron Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A distinct alkoxycarbonylation pattern via an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; catalyst is reported. This low&#8208;valent iron catalyst activates alkyl halides via a two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, unlike previous reports where alkyl halides underwent a single electron transfer (SET). This reaction provides easy and efficient access to esters, and its mechanism will provide new ideas for the activation of alkyl halides in the field of carbonylation.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are some of the most widely used methods in organic synthesis. However, despite the obvious advantages of iron as an abundant and low toxicity transition metal catalyst, its practical application in carbonylation reaction remains largely unexplored. Here we report our recent study on Fe&#8208;catalyzed alkoxycarbonylation of alkyl halides. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is catalyzed by an in situ generated Fe2&#8722; complex. This low&#8208;valent iron species activates alkyl bromides via a distinctive two&#8208;electron transfer (TET) process, whereas it proceeds via a single electron transfer (SET) process for alkyl iodides which is consistent with literature.

         <title>Modular Construction of a Tessellated Octahedron, its Hierarchical Spherical Aggregate Behavior, and Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of a tessellated triangle T1 and the construction of a tessellated octahedron O1 containing metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels are demonstrated. O1 has a diameter on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and a molecular weight greater than 84&#8197;kDa. After hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly has led to the formation of various aesthetical polyhedrons and compounds with advanced functions. Whereas two&#8208;dimensional supramolecules with complex and giant skeletons are plentiful, the constructions of polyhedrons are limited by using basic polygons as the panels. Herein, we report the modular synthesis of a tessellated triangle and tessellated octahedron with metal&#8208;organic modules as the panels and formed via template&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly. These architectures have diameters on the order of 10.9&#8197;nm and molecular weights greater than 84&#8197;kDa. Interestingly, fiber and spherical&#8208;like nanostructures could be formed from the tessellated triangles and octahedrons, respectively, through hierarchical self&#8208;assembly. In addition, after hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the supramolecules exhibit electrochemical reduction activity for CO2 to CO.

         <title>Salt&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Reinforced Carbonate Electrolyte for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt strategy is proposed to boost LiNO3 solubility in carbonate electrolytes using multivalent salt carrier. The NO3&#8722;&#8208;containing anion complexes and multivalent cations as interphase adsorbing components promote the anion&#8208;derived SEI formation. The designed electrolyte presents a superior Li CE of 99.7&#8201;% and enables the NMC811 full cells with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
The instability of carbonate electrolyte with metallic Li greatly limits its application in high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Here, a &#8220;salt&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; strategy is applied to boost the LiNO3 solubility in the carbonate electrolyte with Mg(TFSI)2 carrier, which enables the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) for excellent Li metal anode performance and also maintains the cathode stability. In the designed electrolyte, both NO3&#8722; and PF6&#8722; anions participate in the Li+&#8208;solvent complexes, thus promoting the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Our designed electrolyte has achieved a superior Li CE of 99.7&#8201;%, enabling the high&#8208;loading NCM811||Li (4.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2) full cell with N/P ratio of 1.92 to achieve 84.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 200&#8197;cycles. The enhancement of LiNO3 solubility by divalent salts is universal, which will also inspire the electrolyte design for other metal batteries.

         <title>Bis(imidazolium)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diphosphete&#8208;diide: A Building Block for FeC2P2 Complexes and Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;imidazolium&#8208;diphosphete&#8208;diide, (IPr)2C2P2, acts as an electronically remarkably flexible ligand to iron carbonyl fragments, giving access to complexes of the general formula [Fe(CO)x{(IPr)2C2P2}]n+ (x=2, 3; n=0, +1, +2). Redox events involve either the metal ion or C2P2 ligand, as demonstrated by EPR, M&#246;ssbauer and computational analyses and characterize (IPr)2C2P2 as a redox active ligand.







Abstract
Reaction of the 6&#960;&#8208;electron aromatic four&#8208;membered heterocycle (IPr)2C2P2 (1) (IPr=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) with [Fe2CO9] gives the neutral iron tricarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)3&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}] (2). Oxidation with two equivalents of the ferrocenium salt, [Fe(Cp)2](BArF24), affords the dicationic tricarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)3&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}](BArF24)2 (4). The one&#8208;electron oxidation proceeds under concomitant loss of one CO ligand to give the paramagnetic dicarbonyl radical cation complex [Fe(CO)2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}](BArF24) (5). Reduction of 5 allows the preparation of the neutral dicarbonyl complex [Fe(CO)2&#8208;&#951;4&#8208;{(IPr)2C2P2}] (6). An analysis by various spectroscopic techniques (57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, EPR) combined with DFT calculations gives insight into differences of the electronic structure within the members of this unique series of iron carbonyl complexes, which can be either described as electron precise or Wade&#8211;Mingos clusters.

         <title>Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids and sulfinates provides a direct and modular access to sulfoxides by a photocatalytic process that has unveiled the unexplored chemoselective radicalophilic reactivity of intermediate sulfinyl sulfones and enabled the conjunctive coupling of two carboxylic acids, revealing broad new chemical space accessible by the merger of the two coupling partner classes of emergent synthetic importance.







Abstract
The intermediate oxidation state of sulfoxides is central to the plethora of their applications in chemistry and medicine, yet it presents challenges for an efficient synthetic access, limiting the structural diversity of currently available sulfoxides. Here, we report a data&#8208;guided development of direct decarboxylative sulfinylation that enables the previously inaccessible functional group interconversion of carboxylic acids to sulfoxides in a reaction with sulfinates. Given the broad availability of carboxylic acids and the growing synthetic potential of sulfinates, the direct decarboxylative sulfinylation is poised to improve the structural diversity of synthetically accessible sulfoxides. The reaction is facilitated by a kinetically favored sulfoxide formation from the intermediate sulfinyl sulfones, despite the strong thermodynamic preference for the sulfone formation, unveiling the previously unknown and chemoselective radicalophilic sulfinyl sulfone reactivity.

         <title>Diterpene Biosynthesis from Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate Analogues with Changed Reactivities Expands Skeletal Diversity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two analogues of geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bond were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases. The double bond shift causes a change of reactivity that results in the formation of many diterpenes with novel skeletons. A total number of 28 new diterpenes is reported and their mechanism of formation is discussed.







Abstract
Two analogues of the diterpene precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate with shifted double bonds, named iso&#8208;GGPP I and iso&#8208;GGPP II, were enzymatically converted with twelve diterpene synthases from bacteria, fungi and protists. The changed reactivity in the substrate analogues resulted in the formation of 28 new diterpenes, many of which exhibit novel skeletons.

Mechanistically, the reaction involves a PdII/PdIV catalytic cycle that begins with a directed oxypalladation step. The origin of regioselectivity is the preference for formation of a six&#8208;membered palladacycle intermediate, which is facilitated by an N,N&#8208;bidentate 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)isopropyl (PIP) amide directing group. Selectivity for C(alkenyl)&#8722;X versus &#8722;N (X=halide) reductive elimination from the PdIV center depends on the identity of the halide anion; bromide and iodide engage in C(alkenyl)&#8722;X formation, while intramolecular C(alkenyl)&#8722;N reductive elimination occurs with chloride to furnish a lactam product. DFT calculations shed light on the origins of this phenomenon.

&lt;p&gt;Palladium(II)-catalyzed regio- and stereoselective oxyhalogenation of unactivated internal alkynes is facilitated by a structurally tuned bidentate directing auxiliary, providing rapid access to tetrasubstituted alkenes that can be further diversified into valuable products.

Tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) was able to resolve the distribution of molecules in human pancreatic cancer cell membranes. TERS imaging revealed the arrangement of different cell membrane components with a spatial resolution down to 2.5&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Lack of appropriate tools for visualizing cell membrane molecules at the nanoscale in a non&#8208;invasive and label&#8208;free fashion limits our understanding of many vital cellular processes. Here, we use tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) to visualize the molecular distribution in pancreatic cancer cell (BxPC&#8208;3) membranes in ambient conditions without labelling, with a spatial resolution down to ca. 2.5&#8197;nm. TERS imaging reveals segregation of phenylalanine&#8208;, histidine&#8208;, phosphatidylcholine&#8208;, protein&#8208;, and cholesterol&#8208;rich BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane domains at the nm length&#8208;scale. TERS imaging also showed a cell membrane region where cholesterol is mixed with protein. Interestingly, the higher resolution TERS imaging revealed that the molecular domains observed on the BxPC&#8208;3 cell membrane are not chemically &#8220;pure&#8221; but also contain other biomolecules. These results demonstrate the potential of TERS for non&#8208;destructive and label&#8208;free imaging of cell membranes with nanoscale resolution.

         <title>Morphology and Light&#8208;Dependent Spatial Distribution of Spin Defects in Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radicals in carbon nitride are invoked as photocatalytically competent species. However, their structure and localisation is ill&#8208;defined. Here we provide a quantitative assessment of speciation, electronic structure, long&#8208;range distributions and photo&#8208;response of such radicals, as a function of carbon nitride morphology. This work paves the way to the engineering of the defective structure of carbon nitride and related 2D materials.







Abstract
Carbon nitride (CN) is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that combines good structural properties and a broad scope. The photocatalytic efficiency of CN is associated with the presence of defective and radical species. An accurate description of defective states&#8212;both at a local and extended level&#8212;is key to develop a thorough mechanistic understanding of the photophysics of CN. In turn, this will maximise the generation and usage of photogenerated charge carriers and minimise wasteful charge recombination. Here the influence of morphology and light&#8208;excitation on the number and chemical nature of radical defects is assessed. By exploiting the magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole coupling, the spatial distribution of native radicals in CN is derived with high precision. From the analysis an average distance in the range 1.99&#8211;2.34&#8197;nm is determined, which corresponds to pairs of radicals located approximately four tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units apart.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Assisted Reversible Migratory Coupling of Aminoborane at Magnesium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare case of dynamic migratory insertion of unsaturated species in normal valent s&#8208;block chemistry has been observed at magnesium bis(amidoboranes). The process is facilitated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, and is fundamentally a dynamic acid/base exchange between aminoborane (Me2N=BH2) and Lewis acidic magnesium species.







Abstract
A combined synthetic and theoretical investigation of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) adducts of magnesium amidoboranes is presented, which involves a rare example of reversible migratory insertion within a normal valent s&#8208;block element. The reaction of (NHC)Mg(N(SiMe3)2)2 (1) and dimethylamine borane yields the tris(amide) adduct (NHC&#8722;BN)Mg(NMe2BH3)(N(SiMe3)2) (2; NHC&#8722;BN = NHC&#8722;BH2NMe2). In addition to Me2N=BH2 capture at the NHCC&#8722;Mg bond, mechanistic investigations suggest the likelihood of aminoborane migratory insertion from an RMg(NMe2BH2NMe2BH3) intermediate. To elucidate these processes, the carbene complexes (NHC)Mg(NMe2BH3)2 (8) and (NHC)Mg(NMe2BH2NMe2BH3)2 (9) were synthesized, and a dynamic migration of Me2N=BH2 between Mg&#8722;N and NHCC&#8722;Mg bonds was observed in 9. This unusual reversible migratory insertion is presumably induced by dissimilar charge localization in the &#8722;{NMe2BH2NMe2BH3} anion, as well as the capacity of NHCs to reversibly capture Me2N=BH2 in the presence of Lewis acidic magnesium species.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of Sulfonamides with (Hetero)Aryl Chlorides/Bromides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamidation of (hetero)aryl halides proceeds with excellent reaction scope by using oxalamides or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides as the ligands. For bromides, only 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% CuI and oxalamides were required. For chlorides, increasing catalytic loadings to 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% Cu2O and ligands was needed. Direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs were achieved under these conditions.







Abstract
Direct N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides is a very attractive approach for preparing pharmaceutically important N&#8208;(hetero)aryl sulfonamides because it avoids the potential genotoxic problem resulting from the previous condensation method. Most known catalytic methods suffer from limited reaction scope and inconveniency on metal catalyst and ligand availability. Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for N&#8208;arylation of sulfonamides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper salts and oxalamides at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the catalysis of Cu2O and a 4&#8208;hydroxypicolinamide. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro&#8208;containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.

Here we described that the combination of copper and oxalamides (or 4-hydroxypicolinamides) offers a powerful catalytic system for &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylation of sulfonamides. A wide range of primary and secondary sulfonamides were able to couple with a series of (hetero)aryl bromides in the presence of 2&#8211;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% copper salts and oxalamides at 100&#8201;&#176;C. Coupling of primary sulfonamides with (hetero)aryl chlorides worked well under the catalysis of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and a 4-hydroxypicolinamide. The catalytic method enabled direct sulfonamidation of four chloro-containing marketed drugs and preparation of two sulfonamide drugs from the corresponding aryl halides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Anticancer Rhenium Tricarbonyl Targets Fe&#8722;S Cluster Biogenesis in Ovarian Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomic approach to inorganic drug discovery improves the prioritization of candidate drug targets and revealed the scaffold protein NUBP2 involved in Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis as a relevant target for the rhenium tricarbonyl TRIP. This approach efficiently deconvolutes the polypharmacology of metal&#8208;based drug candidates and may be generally applied.







Abstract
Target identification remains a critical challenge in inorganic drug discovery to deconvolute potential polypharmacology. Herein, we describe an improved approach to prioritize candidate protein targets based on a combination of dose&#8208;dependent chemoproteomics and treatment effects in living cancer cells for the rhenium tricarbonyl compound TRIP. Chemoproteomics revealed 89 distinct dose&#8208;dependent targets with concentrations of competitive saturation between 0.1 and 32&#8197;&#956;M despite the broad proteotoxic effects of TRIP. Target&#8208;response networks revealed two highly probable targets of which the Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis factor NUBP2 was competitively saturated by free TRIP at nanomolar concentrations. Importantly, TRIP treatment led to a down&#8208;regulation of Fe&#8722;S cluster containing proteins and upregulated ferritin. Fe&#8722;S cluster depletion was further verified by assessing mitochondrial bioenergetics. Consequently, TRIP emerges as a first&#8208;in&#8208;class modulator of the scaffold protein NUBP2, which disturbs Fe&#8722;S cluster biogenesis at sub&#8208;cytotoxic concentrations in ovarian cancer cells.

         <title>A Deprotection&#8208;free Method for High&#8208;yield Synthesis of Graphdiyne Powder with In Situ Formed CuO Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deprotection&#8208;free method was developed for the synthesis of GDY powder with 100&#8201;% yield. CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of &#8776;2.9&#8197;nm were in situ generated on GDY after the reaction. The as&#8208;prepared CuO/GDY was an excellent co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the start&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt cocatalyst. This work provides a straightforward deprotection&#8208;free approach, which will definitely expand the diverse applications of GDY.







Abstract
With a direct band gap, superior charge carrier mobility, and uniformly distributed pores, graphdiyne (GDY) has stimulated tremendous interest from the scientific community. However, its broad application is greatly limited by the complicated multistep synthesis process including complex deprotection of hexakis&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzene (HEB&#8208;TMS) and peeling of GDY from the substrates. Here, we describe a deprotection&#8208;free strategy to prepare GDY powder by directly using HEB&#8208;TMS as the monomer. When CuCl was used as the catalysts in DMF solvent, the yield of GDY powder reached &#8776;100&#8201;%. More interestingly, uniformly dispersed CuO nanoparticles with an average diameter of &#8776;2.9&#8197;nm were in situ formed on GDY after the reaction. The prepared CuO/GDY was demonstrated an excellent co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt co&#8208;catalyst. The deprotection&#8208;free approach will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.

         <title>Characterization of a Proposed Terminal Iron(III) Nitride Intermediate of Nitrogen Fixation Stabilized by a Trisphosphine&#8208;Borane Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation and low&#8208;temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl)borane), a plausible intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, is reported. EPR spectroscopy supported by DFT calculations define a 2A ground state electronic structure for this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride, placing an unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector.







Abstract
Terminal iron nitrides (Fe&#8801;N) have been proposed as intermediates of Fe&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation, and well&#8208;defined synthetic iron nitrides have been characterized in high oxidation states, including FeIV, FeV, and FeVI. This study reports the generation and low temperature characterization of a terminally bound iron(III) nitride, P3BFe(N) (P3B=tris(o&#8208;diisopropylphosphinophenyl)borane), which is a proposed intermediate of iron&#8208;mediated nitrogen fixation by the P3BFe&#8208;catalyst system. CW&#8208; and pulse EPR spectroscopy (HYSCORE and ENDOR), supported by DFT calculations, help to define a 2A ground state electronic structure of this C3&#8208;symmetric nitride species, placing the unpaired spin in a sigma orbital along the B&#8722;Fe&#8722;N vector; this electronic structure is distinct for an iron nitride. The unusual d5&#8208;configuration is stabilized by significant delocalization (&#8776;50&#8201;%) of the unpaired electron onto the axial boron and nitrogen ligands, with a majority of the spin residing on boron.

         <title>Photoexcitation&#8208;Based Supramolecular Access to Full&#8208;Scale Phase&#8208;Diagram Structures through in situ Phase&#8208;Volume Ratio Phototuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy was demonstrated based on the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules (persulfurated arenes) and block polymers through non&#8208;covalent interactions, leading to progressive and wide&#8208;ranging phase transitions across the phase diagram under different irradiation periods.







Abstract
Controlling phase separation and transition plays a core role in establishing and maintaining the function of diverse self&#8208;assembled systems. However, it remains challenging to achieve wide&#8208;range continuous phase transition for dynamically producing a variety of assembled structures. Here, we developed a far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium system, upon the integration of photoexcitation&#8208;induced aggregation molecules and block copolymers, to establish an in situ phase&#8208;volume ratio photocontrol strategy. Thus, full&#8208;scale phase&#8208;diagram structures, from lamellar structure to gyroidal, cylindrical, and finally to a spherical one, can be accessed under different irradiation periods. Moreover, the phase transition was accompanied by considerable aggregation&#8208;induced phosphorescence and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity change for building a functional surface. This strategy allows for a conceptual advance of accessing a wide range of distinct self&#8208;assembled structures and functions in real time.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Poly(Imine&#8208;Carbonate) Derived from Plastic Waste and Bio&#8208;based Resources</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling of polycarbonate (BPA&#8208;PC) with a bio&#8208;based vanillin derivative into novel dialdehyde monomer DVEC is shown. DVEC was further polymerized by using primary amines into high&#8208;performance poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s. These modular polymers are reprocessable and chemically recyclable under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions, thereby enabling a closed&#8208;loop recycling scheme.







Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop recycling of polymers represents the key technology to convert plastic waste in a sustainable fashion. Efficient chemical recycling and upcycling strategies are thus highly sought&#8208;after to establish a circular plastic economy. Here, we present the selective chemical depolymerization of polycarbonate by employing a vanillin derivative as bio&#8208;based feedstock. The resulting di&#8208;vanillin carbonate monomer was used in combination with various amines to construct a library of reprocessable poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s, which show tailor&#8208;made thermal and mechanical properties. These novel poly(imine&#8208;carbonate)s exhibit excellent recyclability under acidic and energy&#8208;efficient conditions. This allows the recovery of monomers in high yields and purity for immediate reuse, even when mixed with various commodity plastics. This work provides exciting new insights in the design of bio&#8208;based circular polymers produced by upcycling of plastic waste with minimal environmental impact.

         <title>Ultrasmall Copper Nanoclusters in Zirconium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for the Photoreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature synthetic strategy is reported for incorporation of ultrasmall Cu nanoclusters into a series of robust Zr&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The resultant core&#8211;shell composites mediate CO2 photoreduction selectively and outperform similar composites even with variable Cu spatial distribution.







Abstract
Encapsulating ultrasmall Cu nanoparticles inside Zr&#8208;MOFs to form core&#8211;shell architecture is very challenging but of interest for CO2 reduction. We report for the first time the incorporation of ultrasmall Cu NCs into a series of benchmark Zr&#8208;MOFs, without Cu NCs aggregation, via a scalable room temperature fabrication approach. The Cu NCs@MOFs core&#8211;shell composites show much enhanced reactivity in comparison to the Cu NCs confined in the pore of MOFs, regardless of their very similar intrinsic properties at the atomic level. Moreover, introducing polar groups on the MOF structure can further improve both the catalytic reactivity and selectivity. Mechanistic investigation reveals that the CuI sites located at the interface between Cu NCs and support serve as the active sites and efficiently catalyze CO2 photoreduction. This synergetic effect may pave the way for the design of low&#8208;cost and efficient catalysts for CO2 photoreduction into high&#8208;value chemical feedstock.

         <title>In Situ Imaging of Ion Motion in a Single Nanoparticle: Structural Transformations in Selenium Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle was achieved by dark&#8208;field microscopy and disclosed the transformation of amorphous SeNPs into polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2.







Abstract
Intraparticle ion motions are critical to the structure and properties of nanomaterials, but rarely disclosed. Herein, in situ visualization of ion motions in a single nanoparticle is presented by dark&#8208;field microscopy imaging, which shows HgCl2&#8208;induced structural transformation of amorphous selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) with the main composition of Se8. Owing to the high binding affinity with selenium and coulomb interactions, Hg2+ ions can permeate into the interior of SeNPs, making the amorphous Se8 turn to polycrystalline Hg3Se2Cl2. As a proof of concept, SeNPs then serve as a highly effective scavenger for selective removal of Hg2+ ions from solution. This new finding offers visual proof for the photophysical process involving intraparticle ion motion, demonstrating that tracking the ion motions is a novel strategy to comprehend the formation mechanism with the purpose of developing new nanostructures like nanoalloys and nano metal compounds.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustaining Fluorination of Active Methylene Compounds and High&#8208;Yielding Fluorination of Highly Basic Aryl and Alkenyl Lithium Species with a Sterically Hindered N&#8208;Fluorosulfonamide Reagent</title>

By developing a sterically hindered fluorinating agent, N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved an unprecedented high&#8208;yield fluorination of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species.







Abstract
Fluorination of carbanions is pivotal for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds, but the current N&#8208;F fluorinating agents have significant drawbacks due to many reactive locations that surround the reactive N&#8722;F site. By developing a sterically hindered N&#8208;fluorosulfonamide reagent, namely N&#8208;fluoro&#8208;N&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;tert&#8208;butanesulfonamide (NFBB), we discovered a conceptually novel base&#8208;catalyzed, self&#8208;sustaining fluorination of active methylene compounds and achieved the high&#8208;yielding fluorination of the hitherto difficult highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species. In the former, the mild and high yield fluorination of active methylene compounds exhibited wide functional group tolerance and its novel catalytic fluorination&#8208;deprotonation cycle mechanism was demonstrated by deuterium&#8208;tracing experiments. In the latter, NFBB reacted with a variety of highly basic (hetero)aryl and alkenyl lithium species to provide the desired fluoro (hetero)arenes and alkenes in unprecedented high or quantitative yields.

         <title>Management of Donor and Acceptor Building Blocks in Dopant&#8208;Free Polymer Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer design strategy was proposed by managing the donor and acceptor building blocks with longitudinal extended conjugation for dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs). The optimized device based on the polymer HTM constructed by longitudinal extended BDT&#8208;T and BDD units shows a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.04&#8201;% and greatly improved operational stability.







Abstract
The dominant hole transport material (HTM) in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which needs to be doped using hydrophilic dopants to improve its hole mobility and conductivity, resulting in inferior device stability. Here, we propose an effective molecular design strategy to construct dopant&#8208;free polymer HTMs by selecting four structurally related polymers and investigating their structure&#8211;property relationship. It is found that the donor and acceptor units with longitudinal conjugate extension, such as BDT&#8208;T and BDD, could not only enhance the planarity of the conjugated polymer backbone and tune the energy levels but also promote the face&#8208;on orientation, resulting in superior charge extraction and transport. The optimized device utilizing dopant&#8208;free polymer HTM shows a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19&#8197;V and a champion efficiency of 24.04&#8201;% with greatly improved operational stability, making it among the best performance PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [2+1] and [4+1] Annulations of Diynes with Ketones via Carbonyl Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal [2+1] and [4+1] annulation of diynes with ketones via carbonyl ylides is disclosed. This protocol enables the divergent, practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of chiral oxiranes and dihydrofurans in moderate to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities.







Abstract
Carbonyl ylides have proven to be powerful synthons for the efficient construction of various valuable O&#8208;heterocycles, and the formation of carbonyl ylides by the reaction of metal carbenes with carbonyls has attracted increasing attention over the past decades. However, a catalyst&#8208;controlled highly enantioselective reaction of carbonyl ylides from metal carbenes is extremely challenging. Herein, we report a novel copper&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric formal [2+1] and [4+1] annulations of diynes with ketones via carbonyl ylides. Importantly, this protocol not only represents the first example of successful asymmetric epoxidation via carbonyl ylides, but also constitutes the first reaction of vinyl cations with carbonyl compounds. This method leads to the divergent, practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of a range of chiral oxiranes and dihydrofurans in moderate to excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities via remote&#8208;stereocontrol strategy.

         <title>Enantioselective Biocascade Catalysis with a Single Multifunctional Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single multifunctional enzyme is reported that can promote biocatalytic cascades based on multiple stereoselective steps. Specifically, a 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme can form enamine and iminium ion intermediates from aldehydes and enals to promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic cascade processes offer direct access to complex chiral molecules from simple substrates and in a single step. In biocatalysis, cascades are generally designed by combining multiple enzymes, each catalyzing individual steps of a sequence. Herein, we report a different strategy for biocascades based on a single multifunctional enzyme that can promote multiple stereoselective steps of a domino process by mastering distinct catalytic mechanisms of substrate activation in a sequential way. Specifically, we have used an engineered 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) enzyme with the ability to form both enamines and iminium ions and combine their mechanisms of catalysis in a complex sequence. This approach allowed us to activate aldehydes and enals toward the synthesis of enantiopure cyclohexene carbaldehydes. The multifunctional 4&#8208;OT enzymes could promote both a two&#8208;component reaction and a triple cascade characterized by different mechanisms and activation sequences.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Shape Memory Hypercrosslinked Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra Polymers via Coordination Post&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers was prepared using soluble and well&#8208;defined MOPs as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks. The introduction of MOPs constructs a coordination dynamic network that not only enhances mechanical properties but also realizes multifunctionality including self&#8208;healing, shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. CHMOPs provide a novel platform for expansion of the smart soft materials.







Abstract
Coordination&#8208;driven crosslinking networks with reversible and dynamic characteristics are gaining increasing interest in diverse application fields. Herein, we use a coordination crosslinking approach using metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) as high&#8208;connectivity building blocks to post&#8208;assemble a class of coordination hypercrosslinked MOP (CHMOP) polymers. The introduction of 12&#8208;connected MOP nodes to the polymeric networks is critical to producing membranes that overcome the trade&#8208;off between mechanical properties and dynamic healing, and meanwhile possess multifunctionalities including shape memory, solution processability, and 3D printing. The CHMOPs can also be used for anticorrosion coating and achieve function couplings, e.g., shape memory&#8208;assisted self&#8208;healing (SMASH), which have not been achieved in the MOP&#8208;based hybrid materials yet. This work not only offers a feasible strategy to construct new multifunctional materials but also greatly expands the application scopes of MOPs.

         <title>Robust and Dynamic Polymer Networks Enabled by Woven Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Woven nodes, serving as dynamic crosslinks, afford a woven polymer network (WPN). The WPN exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue properties to those of covalent polymer networks (CPN), but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity, self&#8208;healing, and reprocessability, resembling those of supramolecular polymer networks (SPN).







Abstract
Crosslinking plays a crucial role in determining mechanical properties of polymer materials. Although various crosslinks based on covalent or noncovalent bonds have been adopted, it remains an enormous challenge to develop a crosslink which could endow corresponding polymer network with robust yet dynamic properties. Herein, we report a crosslink simultaneously having dynamic property and woven geometry, and the polymer network with woven crosslinks (WPN) could integrate the merits of covalent polymer network (CPN) and supramolecular polymer network (SPN). In specific, the WPN not only exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti&#8208;fatigue property to those of CPN, but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity and ductility, similar to those of SPN. Particularly, its toughness and puncture resistance are much superior to those of the others. Besides, the dynamicity of woven crosslink also imparts good performances of self&#8208;healing and processability to WPN.

&lt;p&gt;Woven nodes, serving as dynamic crosslinks, afford a woven polymer network (WPN). The WPN exhibits comparable stiffness, strength, elastic recovery, and anti-fatigue properties to those of covalent polymer networks (CPN), but also possesses decent mechanical adaptivity, self-healing, and reprocessability, resembling those of supramolecular polymer networks (SPN).

         <title>Terminal and Super&#8208;Basic Parent Imides of Hafnium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear parent hafnium imido complex prepared by reduction of the bisazide precursor, afforded a terminally bonded parent imide. DFT calculations revealed: Formation of parent imide proceeds via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido unit with a computed pKBH+ of ca. &#8764;57, followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of nearby benzyl group across the anionic Hf&#8801;N bond. Reactivity studies of the anionic HfNH moiety are also presented.







Abstract
A dinuclear hafnium complex containing the parent imido ligand [(PN)(PNC)Hf=NH{&#956;2&#8208;K}]2 (2) (PN&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2; PNC2&#8722;=(N&#8208;(2&#8208;PiPr2&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;CH2Me2C6H2), was prepared by reduction of the bisazide trans&#8208;[(PN)2Hf(N3)2] (1) with two equiv of KC8. Encapsulation of K+ in 2 with crown&#8208;ether or cryptand affords the first discrete salt [K(encap)][(PN)(PNC)Hf&#8801;NH] (encap=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6(THF)2, 3; 2,2,2&#8208;Kryptofix, 4), featuring a terminal parent imide and possessing some of the shortest Hf&#8722;N bond lengths known to date. DFT calculations revealed formation of 2 to proceed via an extremely basic monomeric nitrido, [(PN)2Hf&#8801;N]&#8722;(A), having a computed pKBH+ of &#8764;57 followed by heterolytic splitting of an inert 1,2&#8208;CH bond of a benzylic methyl group across the Hf&#8801;N triple bond in A. An electronic structure analysis reveals A to possess a covalent Hf&#8801;N triple bond and of super&#8208;basic character. We also showcase reactivity of the Hf&#8801;NH bond with various electrophiles.

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly of Edge Functionalized Top&#8208;Down Chiral Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral and fluorescent supramolecular assemblies of graphene quantum dots were built by means of amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The structural features of the resultant materials were studied by a range of analytical and spectroscopic techniques, namely FTIR, XPS, absorption and emission spectroscopy and TGA.







Abstract
The construction of supramolecular assemblies of heterogeneous materials at the nanoscale is an open challenge in science. Herein, new chiral graphene quantum dots (GQDs) prepared by amidation reaction introducing chiral amide groups and pyrene moieties into the periphery of GQDs are described. The analytical and spectroscopic data show an efficient chemical functionalization and the morphological study of the supramolecular ensembles using SEM and AFM microscopies reveals the presence of highly ordered fibers of several micrometers length. Fluorescence studies, using emission spectroscopy and confocal microscopy, reveal that the fibers stem from the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of both pyrenes and GQDs, together with the hydrogen bonding interactions of the amide groups. Circular dichroism analysis supports the chiral nature of the supramolecular aggregates.

         <title>Insight into the Overlooked Photochemical Decomposition of Atmospheric Surface Nitrates Triggered by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible light photocatalysis contributes significantly to the decomposition of surface nitrates. Monodentate nitrate (m&#8208;NO3&#8722;) can be gradually decomposed to NOx by photogenerated electrons starting from the weakly coordinated N&#8722;O bond. The presence of water vapor promotes the generation of gas&#8208;phase products because more stable bidentate nitrate (b&#8208;NO3&#8722;) will be converted into m&#8208;NO3&#8722; by the abundant surface hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding interactions.







Abstract
The nitrogen oxides (NOx) formed by photochemical reaction of surface nitrates raise significant concerns. However, little is known about the effect of visible light (&gt;380&#8197;nm) on nitrate decomposition and the reaction mechanism. Herein, the decomposition of surface nitrates is investigated under visible light. The results indicate that visible light photocatalysis contributes significantly to nitrate decomposition. Monodentate nitrate (m&#8208;NO3&#8722;) can be decomposed into NOx by photogenerated electrons starting from the weakly coordinated N&#8722;O bond. Water vapor promotes NOx generation because more stable bidentate nitrate (b&#8208;NO3&#8722;) will be converted into m&#8208;NO3&#8722; by surface hydroxyl groups through hydrogen bonding interactions. Alternatively, b&#8208;NO3&#8722; can be directly decomposed to NO2&#8722; by NO attack, but this process is subject to photocatalytic oxidation. This work brings a new focus on the atmospheric NOx sources and provides a more nuanced understanding of nitrates decomposition processes.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Doping Effect on Two&#8208;Photon Absorption and Luminescence of Atomically Precise Silver Ligated Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of single and multiple gold atom doping on optical properties of silver nanoclusters was analysed in linear and nonlinear regime experimentally and with TD&#8208;DFT simulations. Ag24Au1 nanocluster is a robust emitter, with strongly enhanced luminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness with respect to Ag25 parent nanocluster.







Abstract
Noble metal nanoclusters allow for the atomically&#8208;precise control of their composition. However, to create nanoclusters with pre&#8208;defined optical properties, comprehensive description of their structure&#8208;property relation is required. Here, we report the gold atom doping impact on one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) and luminescence properties of ligated silver nanoclusters via combined experimental studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory simulations (TD&#8208;DFT). We synthesized a series of Ag25&#8722;xAux(DMBT)18 nanoclusters where x=0, 1 and 5&#8211;10. For Ag24Au1(DMBT)18 we demonstrate that the presence of the central Au dopant strongly influences linear and non&#8208;linear optical properties, increasing photoluminescence quantum yield and two&#8208;photon brightness, with respect to undoped silver nanoclusters. With improved TPA and luminescence, atomically&#8208;precise AuAg alloys presented in our work can serve as robust luminescent probes e.g. for bioimaging in the second biological window.

Here, we report the gold atom doping impact on one-photon and two-photon absorption (TPA) and luminescence properties of ligated silver nanoclusters via combined experimental studies and time-dependent density functional theory simulations (TD-DFT). We synthesized a series of Ag&lt;sub&gt;25&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(DMBT)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters where &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=0, 1 and 5&#8211;10. For Ag&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(DMBT)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; we demonstrate that the presence of the central Au dopant strongly influences linear and non-linear optical properties, increasing photoluminescence quantum yield and two-photon brightness, with respect to undoped silver nanoclusters. With improved TPA and luminescence, atomically-precise AuAg alloys presented in our work can serve as robust luminescent probes e.g. for bioimaging in the second biological window.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hybrid Germanium Bromide Perovskites with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of non&#8208;centrosymmetric hybrid Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites are reported, showing second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. The largest SHG signal from CH3NH3GeBr3 is likely due to the perferable alignment of the polar cation with the lone pair electrons of Ge2+ along the [111] direction.







Abstract
Ge&#8208;based hybrid perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for second harmonic generation (SHG) due to the geometry and lone&#8208;pair induced non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures. Here, we report a new family of hybrid 3D Ge&#8208;based bromide perovskites AGeBr3, A=CH3NH3 (MA), CH(NH2)2 (FA), Cs and FAGe0.5Sn0.5Br3, crystallizing in polar space groups. These compounds exhibit tunable SHG responses, where MAGeBr3 shows the strongest SHG intensity (5&#215;potassium dihydrogen phosphate, KDP). Structural and theoretical analysis indicate the high SHG efficiency is attributed to the displacement of Ge2+ along [111] direction and the relatively strong interactions between lone pair electrons of Ge2+ and polar MA cations along the c&#8208;axis. This work provides new structural insights for designing and fine&#8208;tuning the SHG properties in hybrid metal halide materials.

         <title>Extended Conjugation Tuning Carbon Nitride for Non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 Photosynthesis and Hypoxic Tumor Therapy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers downshifted the band position in a new carbon nitride that promoted water oxidation kinetics while avoiding thermodynamic photoreduction of H2. The material showed competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% for overall H2O2 production under normoxic conditions and record high activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1) for high&#8208;performance hypoxic tumor therapy.







Abstract
Artificial photocatalysis offers a clean approach for producing H2O2. However, the poor selectivity and activity of H2O2 production hamper traditional industrial applications and emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we report a C5N2 photocatalyst with a conjugated C=N linkage for selective and efficient non&#8208;sacrificial H2O2 production in both normoxic and hypoxic systems. The strengthened delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons by linkers in C5N2 downshifted the band position, thermodynamically eliminating side H2 evolution reaction and kinetically promoting water oxidation. As a result, C5N2 had a competitive solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55&#8201;% in overall H2O2 production and exhibited by far the highest activity under hypoxic conditions (698&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1). C5N2 was further applied to hypoxic PDT/CDT with outstanding performance in apparent cancer cell death and synchronous bioimaging. The study sheds light on the photosynthesis of H2O2 by carbon nitrides for health applications.

         <title>Cover Picture: Decarboxylative Sulfinylation Enables a Direct, Metal&#8208;Free Access to Sulfoxides from Carboxylic Acids (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 43/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative sulfinylation is reported by Oleg&#8197;V. Larionov and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202210525), as illustrated in the cover picture. The reaction is enabled by radicalophilic reactivity of the sulfinyl sulfones shown in the top left that is distinct from the known dissociation and nucleophilic substitution pathways. Given the importance of carboxylic acids and sulfoxides for medicinal chemistry, agroscience, and organic synthesis, decarboxylative sulfination addresses the unmet need for a direct interconversion between the two functional groups and provides access to new sulfoxide chemical space.

A deprotection&#8208;free method was developed for the synthesis of graphdiyne (GDY) powder with in&#8208;situ formed CuO nanoparticles, as reported by Mohamed Nawfal Ghazzal, Li&#8208;Zhu Wu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202210242). The prepared CuO/GDY was demonstrated to be an excellent co&#8208;catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Pt cocatalyst. The work will widen the use of GDY and facilitate its scaling up to industrial level.

         <title>Sorbents for Atmospheric Water Harvesting: From Design Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) holds great promise in offering decentralized solutions for broad access to safe drinking water. This Review systematically discusses the moisture extraction mechanisms and related design rules of various sorbent materials. Device engineering and multifunctional applications are also discussed to present a comprehensive picture of sorbent&#8208;based AWH.







Abstract
Water scarcity caused by climate change and population growth poses a grave threat to human society. Of the different water purification technologies put forward, one presents a promising strategy that is spatially or temporally non&#8208;restricted&#8212;atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Here we review recent progress in the design and study of AWH sorbents, ranging from the innovative chemistries to the integration of sophisticated architectures and functional components, and clarify the structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship that governs the water capture and release processes. Features and limitations of each type of sorbents are summarized to elucidate the optimal working environments and modes. Progress in applications extending from water generation to thermal management and agriculture are discussed. Future developments regarding material modifications, performance measurements, and system optimizations are provided to overcome lingering barriers to sorbent design and implementation.

&lt;p&gt;Water scarcity caused by climate change and population growth poses a grave threat to human society. Of the different water purification technologies put forward, one presents a promising strategy that is spatially or temporally non-restricted&#8212;atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Here we review recent progress in the design and study of AWH sorbents, ranging from the innovative chemistries to the integration of sophisticated architectures and functional components, and clarify the structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship that governs the water capture and release processes. Features and limitations of each type of sorbents are summarized to elucidate the optimal working environments and modes. Progress in applications extending from water generation to thermal management and agriculture are discussed. Future developments regarding material modifications, performance measurements, and system optimizations are provided to overcome lingering barriers to sorbent design and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Schiff Base Mediated Dipeptide Assembly toward Nanoarchitectonics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview describes recent strategies that exploit dynamic Schiff base reactions in combination with supramolecular chemistry to mediate dipeptide assembly toward the formation of nanoarchitectonics. These strategies generate dipeptide assembled systems with diverse structures and new emergent properties, including bioactivity as well as optoelectronic and mechanical functions, making these systems suitable for applications ranging from drug delivery and waveguiding to biocatalysis.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is fascinating because of its dual nature. It perfectly combines the reversible nature of noncovalent bonds with the robustness of covalent bonds, effectively enhancing the stability of assemblies and meanwhile giving rise to unprecedented properties. Therefore, integration of DCC with supramolecular chemistry has emerged as a versatile and an extraordinarily useful approach in directing peptide assembly. This Minireview focuses on a recent strategy, which exploits dynamic Schiff base chemistry in combination with supramolecular chemistry, to mediate dipeptide assembly toward nanoarchitectonics. Diversified structures, new emergent properties, and their related applications are highlighted. Lastly, the opportunities and prospects in this exciting field are also introduced.

         <title>Chiral Nanozymes for Enantioselective Biological Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes are defined as nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. This Minireview provides an overview of recent developments in chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis, with an outlook on the opportunities and trends in this research area.







Abstract
As a neat combination of the characteristics of enzymatic activity and nanomaterials, nanozymes have attracted much attention. Although tremendous effort has been devoted to developing nanozymes with high catalytic activity, substrate selectivity is often overlooked in the construction of nanozymes. With their subtly evolving structures, natural enzymes generally possess high selectivity for chiral substrates which play important roles in biosynthesis and biomedical applications. However, the rational construction of nanozymes with high enantioselectivity remains a significant challenge. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of recent advances in strategies for the synthesis of chiral nanozymes and their enantioselective biological catalysis. We further focus on current challenges, potential solutions, and future developing trends of chiral nanozyme&#8208;based enantioselective biological catalysis. There is plenty of room to explore. This Minireview will provide new insights into the development of chiral nanozymes and their applications.

         <title>Catalytic Applications of Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Oxide Nanomaterials</title>

Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise of being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials with a small environmental footprint. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years, more complex oxides have emerged. This Review discusses different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis.







Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic nanoparticles hold the promise being abundant, low&#8208;cost materials having a small environmental footprint and excellent performance, albeit inferior to that of noble metal counterparts. Several materials have a long&#8208;standing history of success in photocatalysis, in particular titanium dioxide, and in recent years more complex oxides and added functionality have emerged with enhanced performance. We will discuss different approaches related to the use of non&#8208;centrosymmetric and polar oxide nanoparticles and how the bulk photovoltaic effect, piezoelectricity, and pyroelectricity add to photocatalysis and tribocatalysis. We pay special attention to discriminate between the role of free versus that of bound charges within the catalyst, which is crucial to disentangle the different contributions to the catalytic reaction for the benefit of the overall enhanced catalytic performance in e.g. wastewater treatment and ultimately water&#8208;splitting.

         <title>Unusual Quartet&#8208;Doublet Phosphorescence from the Phosphaethynyl Radical, CP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CP is generated by photolysis of phosphaethyne (HCP) isolated in solid argon. Phosphorescence of the radical, observed after the B2&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ photoexcitation, is assisted by an intersystem crossing from B2&#931;+ to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Intense, well&#8208;resolved vibronic progressions were traced for a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#928;i emission systems. Phosphorescence lifetime is on the order of 0.1&#8197;s.







Abstract
We report the first detection of phosphorescence from the phosphaethynyl radical. This rare instance of quartet&#8208;doublet emission, studied here in solid argon, is presumably promoted by efficient intersystem crossing from the originally photoexcited doublet (B2&#931;+) to the adjacent second quartet state, 14&#916;. Vibronic progressions were traced for the a4&#931;+&#8208;X2&#931;+ and a4&#931;+&#8208;A2&#1055;i systems from their origins up to (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=5) and (v&#8242;=0)&#8594;(v&#8242;&#8242;=2) bands, respectively. The measured phosphorescence lifetime is 108 &#177; 3&#8197;ms.

         <title>An Ultramicroporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Exhibiting High C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a suitable pore environment and complementary electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to acetylene (C2H2) molecule, the ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 exhibits extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is not only industrially important for acetylene purification but also great scientific challenge due to their very similar molecular size and physical properties. To address this difficulty, herein, we present an ultramicroporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1) from tetracyano bicarbazole to separate C2H2 from CO2 by taking advantage of differences in their electrostatic potential distribution. This material possesses a suitable pore environment and electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to C2H2, thus showing extra strong affinity to C2H2 (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C2H2/CO2 separation among the adsorbents reported. The single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the suitable pore environment in HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;1 provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and hydrogen&#8208;bonded interactions N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C with C2H2 molecules. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its outstanding separation performance to C2H2/CO2 mixtures.

&lt;p&gt;With a suitable pore environment and complementary electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecule, the ultramicroporous hydrogen-bonded organic framework HOF-FJU-1 exhibits extra strong affinity to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not only industrially important for acetylene purification but also great scientific challenge due to their very similar molecular size and physical properties. To address this difficulty, herein, we present an ultramicroporous hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF-FJU-1) from tetracyano bicarbazole to separate C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by taking advantage of differences in their electrostatic potential distribution. This material possesses a suitable pore environment and electrostatic potential distribution fitting well to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus showing extra strong affinity to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (46.73&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the highest IAST selectivity of 6675 for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation among the adsorbents reported. The single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that the suitable pore environment in HOF-FJU-1 provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and hydrogen-bonded interactions N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C with C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Dynamic breakthrough experiments demonstrate its outstanding separation performance to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Acquisition of the Gap Height of Biological Tissue&#8208;Electronic Chemical Sensor Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of nanopores was integrated at the electrochemical sensor plane and used to measure the ion conductance between them providing a versatile strategy to directly determine the gap height during exocytotic release from tissues. Direct cooperative measurement of the gap height and exocytotic release at the same sensor can be used to address the long&#8208;term question of the influence of diffusional filtering on the exocytotic spike.







Abstract
Interfacing biological tissues with electronic sensors offers the exciting opportunity to accurately investigate multiple biological processes. Accurate signal collection and application are the foundation of these measurements, but a long&#8208;term issue is the signal distortion resulting from the interface gap. The height of the gap is the key characteristic needed to evaluate or model the distortion, but it is difficult to measure. By integrating a pair of nanopores at the electronic sensor plane and measuring the ion conductance between them, we developed a versatile and straightforward strategy to realize the direct cooperative evaluation of the gap height during exocytotic release from adrenal gland tissues. The signaling distortion of this gap has been theoretically evaluated and shows almost no influence on the amperometric recording of exocytosis in a classic &#8220;semi&#8208;artificial synapse&#8221; configuration. This strategy should benefit research concerning various bio/chemical/machine interfaces.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Selective Recognition of Dicyanoaurate(I) by a Bambusuril Macrocycle in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bambusuril macrocycle is utilized for selective stripping of [Au(CN)2]&#8722; anion from activated carbon&#8212;a process relevant to industrial gold production. The efficient stripping is due to the complex of the macrocycle and [Au(CN)2]&#8722; formed at micromolar concentration in aqueous media.







Abstract
Dicyanoaurate(I) anion, [Au(CN)2]&#8722;, plays a central role in the current industrial production of gold, as its extraction from crude ore samples represents the most money&#8208;consuming step. Herein, we present the strongest host&#8211;guest recognition of dicyanoaurate anion using the bambusuril receptor in water, a highly competitive solvent. The micromolar stability of such a complex facilitated the up to date most efficient supramolecular stripping of dicyanoaurate from activated carbon at ambient temperature. Thermodynamic characteristics of bambusuril binding with [Au(CN)2]&#8722; differing from binding of other inorganic chaotropic anions are rationalized, as well as the bambusuril selectivity for [Au(CN)2]&#8722; over [Ag(CN)2]&#8722;.

         <title>Improving the Accuracy of Modelling CO2 Electroreduction on Copper Using Many&#8208;Body Perturbation Theory</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body perturbation theory within its random phase approximation is used to investigate the mechanism of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction on the Cu(100) facet, with special focus on the C&#8722;C coupling step. The formation of *OCCHO is proposed as the potential determining step, yielding onset potential and pH dependence matching well with experiments. RPA results also suggest that defective and stepped surfaces may be essential to understand the observed activity of Cu electrocatalysts for C&#8722;C bond formation.







Abstract
Copper (Cu) remains the most important metal catalyst for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) into C2 products. Due to limited evidence from in situ experiments, mechanistic studies are often performed in the framework of density functional theory (DFT), using functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level, which have fundamental difficulties to correctly describe CO adsorption and surface stability. We employ the adiabatic connection fluctuation dissipation theorem within the random phase approximation (RPA), in combination with the linearized Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation to describe solvation effects, to investigate the mechanism of CO2RR on the Cu(100) facet. Qualitatively different from the DFT&#8208;GGA results, RPA results propose the formation of *OCCHO as the potential determining step towards C2 products. The results suggest that it is important to use more accurate methods like RPA when modeling reactions involving multiple CO&#8208;related species like CO2RR.

         <title>Mild and Chemoselective Carboxylic Acid Reduction Promoted by Borane Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, chemoselective method for the reduction of carboxylic acids, in the presence of both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic functional groups is reported. Experiments and DFT calculations point to a mechanism driven by hidden borane catalysis.







Abstract
Although considerable advances have been made in developing chemoselective transformations of ubiquitous carboxylic acid groups, many challenges still exist. For instance, their selective reduction is problematic if both more nucleophilic and more electrophilic groups are present in the starting material. Here, we address this problem with a simple and mild protocol using bench&#8208;stable reagents at ambient temperatures. This platform is able to tolerate a diverse range of functionality, leaving ketones, esters, nitro&#8208;groups, olefins, nitriles and amides untouched. A combination of experimental and computational mechanistic experiments demonstrate that this reaction proceeds via hidden borane catalysis with small quantities of in situ generated BH3 playing a key role in the exquisite selectivity that is observed.

         <title>Introducing the Perfluorinated Cp* Ligand into Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perfluorinated Cp* analogue [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; resisted all coordination attempts for more than 40&#8197;years. Now its first transition metal complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] is reported. The exceptionally weak binding character of [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; is proved by DFT calculations and substitution reactions with arenes, allowing to switch between ligand and weakly coordinating anion.

The reaction of AgBF4 and [Rh(COD)Cl]2 (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene) in presence of [NEt4][C5(CF3)5] afforded the fluorocarbon soluble complex [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] by salt metathesis. This complex represents the first example for a successful coordination of the weakly basic [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand, since its first synthesis in 1980. In addition to [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)5)] also the byproduct [Rh(COD)(C5(CF3)4H)] was isolated and fully characterized. Accompanying DFT studies showed that the interaction energy of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand towards the 12&#8208;electron fragment [Rh(COD)]+ is &#8776;70&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 lower in comparison to [C5(CH3)5]&#8722; due to reduced electrostatic interactions and weaker &#960;&#8208;donor properties of the ligand. The quantitative but reversible substitution of the [C5(CF3)5]&#8722; ligand by toluene, converting it into a weakly coordinating anion, experimentally proved the extraordinary weak bonding interaction.

         <title>Heterocyclic Hemithioindigos: Highly Advantageous Properties as Molecular Photoswitches
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole, pyrrole, or indole substitution of heterocyclic hemithioindigo chromophores can deliver advanced photoswitching properties: combining full visible light responsiveness, high overall absorptions, pronounced absorption changes, up to quantitative isomer interconversions in both directions, tunable thermal isomerization speeds, and very high quantum yields. Precise geometry changes can be controlled by balancing isomer&#8208;specific chalcogen and hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
A survey of heterocyclic hemithioindigo photoswitches is presented identifying a number of structural motives with outstanding property profiles. The highly sought&#8208;after combination of pronounced color change, quantitative switching in both directions, exceptional high quantum yields, and tunable high thermal stability of metastable states can be realized with 4&#8208;imidazole, 2&#8208;pyrrole, and 3&#8208;indole&#8208;based derivatives. In the former, an unusual preorganization using isomer selective chalcogen&#8208; and hydrogen bonding allows to precisely control geometry changes and tautomerism upon switching. Heterocyclic hemithioindigos thus represent highly promising photoswitches with advanced capabilities that will be of great value to anyone interested in establishing defined and reversible control at the molecular level.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Analysis of Anionic Coordination Polymerizations by Electrospray&#8208;Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>

Negative&#8208;ion mode ESI mass spectrometry permits the direct observation of anionic polymers resulting from the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes with CoCl2 and organolithium reagents.







Abstract
Anionic coordination polymerizations proceed via highly reactive intermediates, whose in situ analysis has remained difficult. Here, we show that electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry is a promising method to obtain detailed information on the polymerization process. Focusing on polymerization reactions of 1,3&#8208;dienes initiated by CoCl2/RLi (R=Me, nBu, tBu, Ph), we directly observe the growing polymer chains and characterize the active anionic cobalt centers by gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments. On the basis of these results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for the polymerization reaction. Moreover, the ESI mass spectra permit the determination of molecular weight distributions, which are in good agreement with those derived from NMR&#8208;spectroscopic as well as MALDI mass&#8208;spectrometric measurements, and afford a wealth of kinetic data.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Triggered Mechanical Actuation in Polymer Composite Films Based on Crystalline Organic Cages</title>

A reversible and fast vapor&#8208;triggered mechanical response of an actuating composite film based on crystalline organic cages is reported.







Abstract
The fabrication of smart materials, which can efficiently mimic biological systems through the introduction of soft components, is of great importance in the emerging fields of sensors and actuators. Herein, a smart composite film that can mechanically respond to vapors trigger then readily restores its original shape upon the removal of the stimuli is reported. This actuating composite film was prepared by mixing the highly elastic poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer with the flexible and crystalline organic cages (Oba&#8208;cage) at variable concentrations. The mechanism of the mechanical response could be accurately recorded due to the ordered cage crystals. This work highlights the importance of designing smart materials at the molecular level to precisely control the response or reaction upon the introduction of different triggers, which can ultimately lead to a monumental leap in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Super Light&#8208;Sensitive Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Improved Photodynamic Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super light&#8208;sensitive photosensitizer nanoparticles are fabricated by the self&#8208;assembly of Rose Bengal and hemoglobin conjugates. The nanoparticles can increase the production of singlet oxygen upon irradiation with an exceptional ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). They can be easily internalized by cancers in deep tissues and exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy with negligible side effects.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective method for superficial cancer treatment. However, the limited light intensity in tissues, tumor hypoxia, and the low accumulation efficiency of photosensitizers (PSs) in tumors are still major challenges. Herein, we introduce super light&#8208;sensitive PS nanoparticles (designated HR NPs) that can increase singlet oxygen (1O2) production and improve PS accumulation in tumors. HR NPs have the ability to produce a large amount of 1O2 under ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) irradiation. More significantly, HR NPs have a long circulating time in tumor&#8208;bearing mice and can accumulate in tumors with high efficiency. When irradiated by light with a suitable wavelength, the nanoparticles exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy. This work will make it possible to cure solid tumors by PDT by enhancing the therapeutic effects.

&lt;p&gt;Super light-sensitive photosensitizer nanoparticles are fabricated by the self-assembly of Rose Bengal and hemoglobin conjugates. The nanoparticles can increase the production of singlet oxygen upon irradiation with an exceptional ultralow power density light (0.05&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). They can be easily internalized by cancers in deep tissues and exhibit excellent antitumor efficacy with negligible side effects.

&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective method for superficial cancer treatment.

         <title>Biocompatible and Selective Generation of Bicyclic Peptides
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic peptides are increasingly popular in drug discovery; however, only few strategies for their synthesis exist. Dicyanopyridine&#8208;featured amino acids provide a biocompatible, selective, and catalyst&#8208;free pathway to access bicyclic peptides, which are characterized by superior preorganization and high target affinity.







Abstract
Bicyclic peptides possess superior properties for drug discovery; however, their chemical synthesis is not straightforward and often neither biocompatible nor fully orthogonal to all canonical amino acids. The selective reaction between 1,2&#8208;aminothiols and 2,6&#8208;dicyanopyridine allows direct access to complex bicyclic peptides in high yield. The process can be fully automated using standard solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Bicyclization occurs in water at physiological pH within minutes and without the need for a catalyst. The use of various linkers allows tailored bicyclic peptides with qualities such as plasma stability, conformational preorganization, and high target affinity. We demonstrate this for a bicyclic inhibitor of the Zika virus protease NS2B&#8208;NS3 as well as for bicyclic versions of the &#945;&#8208;helical antimicrobial peptide aurein 1.2.

         <title>A Thioether&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction of Allyl Halides and Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic cross&#8208;coupling of allyl bromides and arylboronic acids was developed using a designer thioether catalyst. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested the involvement of a key sulfoxonium ylide that binds to the arylboronic acid and triggers 1,2&#8208;aryl migration.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) cross&#8208;coupling reactions are an indispensable tool for organic synthesis. In these reactions transition metals have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Herein, we report our recent discovery of a designer thioether as a highly active organocatalyst for reactions between an allyl bromide and an arylboronic acid. The cross&#8208;coupling event occurred readily under mild condition in the presence of a weak inorganic base. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested a sulfonium ylide mechanism.

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Self&#8208;folding of Helical Poly(fluorenevinylene) Derivatives in the Solid State Leading to Amplified Circular Dichroism and Circularly Polarized Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>

Optically active poly(fluorenevinylene) derivatives self&#8208;fold in the solid state into a non&#8208;uniform structure with sharp turns connecting stretched segments where the turns exhibit remarkable optical anisotropy in the ground state and in excited states.







Abstract
An unprecedented non&#8208;uniform self&#8208;folding of artificial polymer chains composed of turn moieties and stretched segments is presented through the design of a set of optically active poly(fluorene&#8208;2,7&#8208;diylethene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) (poly(fluorenevinylene)) derivatives bearing a neomenthyl group and a pentyl group attached at the 9&#8208;position of fluorene backbone at various ratios. The folded structure is formed and stabilized through inter&#8208;chain interactions in the solid state, leading to remarkably enhanced chiroptical properties (chirality amplification) in terms of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized light (CPL) emission. This phenomenon is rationalized by experimental and theoretical CD and CPL spectral analyses. The polymer arrangements in the solid state were further assessed through transmission electron microscopic observations combined with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations in the solid state revealing the thin film organizations.

         <title>Synthesis of a Hexachloro Sulfate(IV) Dianion Enabled by Polychloride Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 43, October 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first preparation and structural characterization of the hexachlorosulfate dianion, [NEt3Me]2[SCl6], is achieved. This synthesis is enabled by the Janus&#8208;faced trichloride reagent [NEt3Me][Cl3]. While the trichloride [Cl3]&#8722; is chlorinating and oxidizing elemental sulfur, the unique [NEt3Me]+ cation is stabilizing the unprecedented [SCl6]2&#8722; dianion.







Abstract
The preparation and structural characterization of [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] is described, which is the first example of a [SCl6]2&#8722; dianion and of a halosulfate anion of the type [SxXy]z&#8722; in general. This dianion belongs to the group of 14&#8208;valence electron AB6E systems and forms an octahedral structure in the solid&#8208;state. Interestingly, co&#8208;crystallization with CH2Cl2 affords [NEt3Me]2[SCl6]&#8901;4&#8201;CH2Cl2 containing [SCl6]2&#8722; dianions with C4v symmetry. As suggested by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, the distortion of the structure is not caused by a stereochemically active lone pair but by enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions with CH2Cl2. At elevated temperatures, [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] decomposes to various sulfur chlorine compounds as shown by Raman spectroscopy. Cooling back to room temperature results in the selective formation of [NEt3Me]2[SCl6] which is comparable to the well&#8208;studied SCl4.

         <title>Phase Transitions in Chemically Fueled, Multiphase Complex Coacervate Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling multiphase coacervate droplets to a chemical reaction cycle allows access to regimes inside the phase diagram not possible under thermodynamic control. Control over the stability, liquidity, and localization of the multiphases makes it a great synthetic platform to study the organization of membraneless organelles.







Abstract
Membraneless organelles are droplets in the cytosol that are regulated by chemical reactions. Increasing studies suggest that they are internally organized. However, how these subcompartments are regulated remains elusive. Herein, we describe a complex coacervate&#8208;based model composed of two polyanions and a short peptide. With a chemical reaction cycle, we control the affinity of the peptide for the polyelectrolytes leading to distinct regimes inside the phase diagram. We study the transitions from one regime to another and identify new transitions that can only occur under kinetic control. Finally, we show that the chemical reaction cycle controls the liquidity of the droplets offering insights into how active processes inside cells play an important role in tuning the liquid state of membraneless organelles. Our work demonstrates that not only thermodynamic properties but also kinetics should be considered in the organization of multiple phases in droplets.

         <title>Counter Electrode Reactions&#8212;Important Stumbling Blocks on the Way to a Working Electro&#8208;organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Every electrochemical synthesis is paired with conversion at the counter electrode. In electro&#8208;organic synthesis, often only the desired half reaction is described well, although good control over the counter reaction is essential. In this Review, the impact of the counter electrode reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted through a collection of common and unusual counter reactions.







Abstract
Over the past two decades, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has gained significant interest, both in technical and academic research as well as in terms of applications. The omission of stoichiometric oxidizers or reducing agents enables a more sustainable route for redox reactions in organic chemistry. Even if it is well&#8208;known that every electrochemical oxidation is only viable with an associated reduction reaction and vice versa, the relevance of the counter reaction is often less addressed. In this Review, the importance of the corresponding counter reaction in electro&#8208;organic synthesis is highlighted and how it can affect the performance and selectivity of the electrolytic conversion. A selection of common strategies and unique concepts to tackle this issue are surveyed to provide a guide to select appropriate counter reactions for electro&#8208;organic synthesis.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Transient Chirality Transfer and Atroposelective C&#8208;H Functionalization to Access Quaternary Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed via catalytic transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer strategy. More importantly, this annulation represents a rare example of construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary centers through tandem PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation process.







Abstract
Although palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H functionalization and Heck reactions represents one of the most important synthetic strategies for the construction of quaternary stereocenters, developing the enantioselective version of PdII&#8208;catalyzed carbopalladation&#8208;initiated cascade reactions still remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an unprecedent enantioselective [3+2] annulation of oxime ethers and alkynes has been developed, providing both spiro and nonspiro indenes bearing all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters in good yields (up to 98&#8201;%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). This annulation is accomplished by merging the PdII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective C&#8722;H activation/double carbopalladation and the transient axial&#8208;to&#8208;central chirality transfer process, constituting the first successful example of catalytic chirality transfer strategy involving axially chiral styrene intermediate.

         <title>Kinetic Co&#8208;assembly Pathway Induced Chirality Inversion Along with Morphology Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the self&#8208;assembly of L&#8208;phenylalanine (LPF) is insensitive to the pathway followed, the co&#8208;assembly of LPF with naphthylamine derivatives is pathway&#8208;dependent. The helical nanofibers of LPF transform into diverse kinetically trapped chiral structures with opposite chirality through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway (pathway B), while only thermodynamically stable nonhelical structures are formed by the thermodynamic pathway (pathway&#8197;A).







Abstract
Kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway induced chirality inversion along with morphology transition is of importance to understand biological processes, but still remains a challenge to realize in artificial systems. Herein, helical nanofibers consisting of phenylalanine&#8208;based enantiomers (L/DPF) successfully transform into kinetically trapped architectures with opposite helicity through a kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway. By contrast, the co&#8208;assemblies obtained by a thermodynamic pathway exhibit non&#8208;helical structures. The formation sequence of non&#8208;covalent interactions plays a crucial role in structural chirality of co&#8208;assemblies. For the kinetic pathway, the hydrogen bonding between D/LPF and naphthylamide derivatives forms before &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking to facilitate the formation of helical structures with inverse handedness. This study may provide an approach to explore chirality inversion accompanied by morphology transition by manipulating the kinetic co&#8208;assembly pathway.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylative sulfinylation is reported by Oleg&#8197;V. Larionov and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210525), as illustrated in the cover picture. The reaction is enabled by radicalophilic reactivity of sulfinyl sulfones shown in the top left that is distinct from the known dissociation and nucleophilic substitution pathways. Given the importance of carboxylic acids and sulfoxides for medicinal chemistry, agroscience, and organic synthesis, decarboxylative sulfination addresses the unmet need for a direct interconversion between the two functional groups and provides access to new sulfoxide chemical space.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Synergy and Antagonism between Allosteric and Active&#8208;Site Inhibitors of Abl Tyrosine Kinase&#8221;

Abstract
Soellner published on the interplay between allosteric and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;competitive inhibitors of ABL kinase, showing that the latter preferably binds to different conformational states of ABL compared to allosteric agents that specifically target the ABL myristate pocket (STAMP) and deducing that asciminib cannot bind to ABL simultaneously with ATP&#8208;competitive drugs. These results are to some extent in line with ours, although our analyses of dose&#8211;response matrices from combinations of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib, show neither synergy nor antagonism, but suggest additive antiproliferative effects on BCR&#8208;ABL&#8208;dependent KCL22 cells. Furthermore, our X&#8208;ray crystallographic, solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and isothermal titration calorimetry studies show that asciminib can bind ABL concomitantly with type&#8208;1 or &#8208;2 ATP&#8208;competitive inhibitors to form ternary complexes. Concomitant binding of asciminib with imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib might translate to benefit some chronic myeloid leukaemia patients.

         <title>A Photoelectrochemical Nanoreactor for Single&#8208;Cell Sampling and Near Zero&#8208;Background Faradaic Detection of Intracellular microRNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical nanoreactor was devised for single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background faradic detection of intracellular microRNA. This platform provided a new perspective for exploring light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay toward single&#8208;cell studies.







Abstract
Rational utilization of the rich light&#8208;bio&#8208;matter interplay taking place in single&#8208;cell analysis represents a new technological direction in the field. The light&#8208;fueled operation is expected to achieve advanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) single&#8208;cell analysis with unknown possibilities. Here, a PEC nanoreactor capable of single&#8208;cell sampling and near zero&#8208;background Faradaic detection of intracellular microRNA (miR) is devised by the construction of a small reaction chamber accommodating the target&#8208;triggered hybridization chain reaction for binding the metallointercalator of [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ as the signal reporter. Light stimulation of the dsDNA/metallointercalator adduct will induce the generation of photocurrents, underpinning a zero&#8208;biased and near zero&#8208;background PEC method toward Faradaic detection of non&#8208;electrogenic miR at the single&#8208;cell level. Using this nanotool, lower miR concentration in the near&#8208;nucleus region than that in the main cytosol was revealed.

         <title>A Synthetic Cycle for Heteroarene Synthesis by Nitride Insertion
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An osmium nitride is shown to insert nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. A synthetic cycle to regenerate the starting nitride is presented alongside mechanistic studies of each step.







Abstract
Recent interest in skeletal editing necessitates the continued development of reagent classes with the ability to transfer single atoms. Terminal transition metal nitrides hold immense promise for single&#8208;atom transfer, though their use in organic synthesis has so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a synthetic cycle with associated detailed mechanistic studies that primes the development of terminal transition metal nitrides as valuable single&#8208;atom transfer reagents. Specifically, we show [cis&#8208;terpyOsNCl2]PF6 inserts nitrogen into indenes to afford isoquinolines. Mechanistic studies for each step (insertion, aromatization, product release, and nitride regeneration) are reported, including crystallographic characterization of diverted intermediates, kinetics, and computational studies. The mechanistic foundation set by this synthetic cycle opens the door to the further development of nitrogen insertion heteroarene syntheses promoted by late transition metal nitrides.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Alcohols via Nickel Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyzed synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl alcohols B is presented by exploiting the condensation of iodoarenes and the redox active ether A via cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. A mechanistic study was conducted using a comprehensive computational investigation that was also supported by ad hoc control experiments and showed that the key 1,2&#8208;HAT (Hydrogen Atom Transfer) event results in the formation of a C&#8208;centered radical C&#8242; that mimics the reactivity of trifluoroacetaldehyde.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between the redox&#8208;active N&#8208;trifluoroethoxyphthalimide and iodoarenes is documented. The protocol reproduces a formal arylation of trifluoroacetaldehyde under mild conditions in high yields (up to 88&#8201;%) and with large functional group tolerance (30 examples). A combined computational and experimental investigation revealed a pivotal solvent assisted 1,2&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) process to generate a nucleophilic &#945;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl C&#8208;centered radical for the Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bond forming process.

         <title>Steric, Electronic and Conformational Synergistic Effects in the Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Tertiary Amines
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenging gold&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization of tertiary amine was achieved via the intermediacy of a reactive &#945;&#8208;imino gold carbene. The use of a malonate group exerting electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects was key to the success of the transformation. The tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products could be subsequently oxidized to access structural motifs found in bioactive natural products.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization is a useful strategy for the straightforward formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Heteroatom bonds. In the present work, a unique approach for the challenging electrophilic Au&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond functionalization of tertiary amines is presented. Electronic, steric and conformational synergistic effects exerted by the use of a malonate unit in the substrate were key to the success of this transformation. This new reactivity was applied to the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;carboline products which, under oxidative conditions, could be converted into valuable structural motifs found in bioactive alkaloid natural products.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Targeted Polypeptide Nanoantidotes Improve Chemotherapy Tolerance of Cisplatin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to the presence of disulfide bonds, nanoantidotes capture cisplatin (CDDP) through highly stable Pt&#8722;S bonds to form a series of non&#8208;toxic mononuclear/dinuclear complexes centered on Pt atoms. The pre&#8208;enriched nanoantidotes accelerate the metabolism of CDDP from normal organs, reduce the side effects of chemotherapy, and improve the therapeutic window of the free drug.







Abstract
The toxicity of drugs causes various adverse effects in patients. While antidotes that neutralize drug toxicity help reduce systemic damage during clinical therapy, these antidotes are generally accompanied by the loss of drug efficacy. Herein, the spatiotemporally targeted polycystine&#8208;based nanoantidotes were designed as a neutralizer of cisplatin (CDDP) to decrease its toxicity without affecting its anticancer efficacy. The nanoantidotes administered before CDDP selectively accumulated in the liver and kidney and then firmly bound to CDDP through the highly stable Pt&#8722;S bond during subsequent chemotherapy. This two&#8208;step administration strategy reduced the level of Pt in normal organs, shortened the half&#8208;life of CDDP in plasma, and increased the tolerance to CDDP. More importantly, the nanoantidotes maintained the anticancer efficacy of CDDP after reducing systemic toxicity, indicating its great potential in expanding the clinical application of CDDP.

         <title>Engineering Enzyme Substrate Scope Complementarity for Promiscuous Cascade Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Amino Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocatalytic cascades can be used for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. A substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach was implemented to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase and a decarboxylase. The matched substrate scope of the enzymes was leveraged to produce a variety of enantiomerically pure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides.







Abstract
Biocatalytic cascades are uniquely powerful for the efficient, asymmetric synthesis of bioactive compounds. However, high substrate specificity can hinder the scope of biocatalytic cascades because the constituent enzymes may have non&#8208;complementary activity. In this study, we implemented a substrate multiplexed screening (SUMS) based directed evolution approach to improve the substrate scope overlap between a transaldolase (ObiH) and a decarboxylase for the production of chiral 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols. To generate a promiscuous cascade, we engineered a tryptophan decarboxylase to act efficiently on &#946;&#8208;OH amino acids while avoiding activity on l&#8208;threonine, which is needed for ObiH activity. We leveraged this exquisite selectivity with matched substrate scope to produce a variety of enantiopure 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols in a one&#8208;pot cascade from aldehydes or styrene oxides. This demonstration shows how SUMS can be used to guide the development of promiscuous, C&#8722;C bond forming cascades.

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell ZnO@Microporous Organic Polymer Nanospheres as Enhanced Piezo&#8208;Triboelectric Energy Harvesting Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric ZnO core&#8208;triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP) shell nanoparticles showed enhanced small energy harvesting performance, compared with ZnO and MOP. The piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerator (PTENG) with the optimized 7&#8197;wt&#8201;% ZnO@MOP/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) film showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles with peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Core&#8208;shell nanospheres were prepared by the homogeneous coating of piezoelectric ZnO nanorod aggregates with triboelectric microporous organic polymer (MOP). The small energy harvesting performance of ZnO@MOP was significantly enhanced, compared with those of ZnO and MOP, due to the piezoelectrification&#8208;induced polarization of inner ZnO and the enhanced generation of tribopositive charges of MOP. Piezo&#8208;triboelectric nanogenerators (PTENGs) fabricated with ZnO@MOP showed peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak voltages of up to 534&#8197;V and a maximum power density of 1.19&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, the PTENGs showed excellent durability for 30&#8201;000 cycles, demonstrating as efficient power sources for charging electrolytic capacitors and for operating 200 green light emitting diode bulbs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Product Faradaic Efficiency for Electrocatalytic of CO2 to CO at Current Density Larger than 1.2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in Neutral Aqueous Solution by a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroreduction of CO2 to CO is a promising approach for the cycling use of CO2, while it still suffers from impractical current density and durability. A single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Ni&#8722;N5&#8722;C) that achieves industrial&#8208;scale performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is reported by Pei&#8208;Qin Liao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202210985). Compared with the planar Ni&#8722;N4 site, the square&#8208;pyramidal Ni&#8722;N5 site has significant differences in the d
 and dxz/yz orbital energy levels. Thus, the Ni&#8722;N5 catalytic site has superior properties in activating CO2 molecules and promoting CO desorption.

         <title>Thiolated, Reduced Palladium Nanoclusters with Resolved Structures for the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Oxygen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first atomically monodisperse thiolated Pd nanocluster is obtained. It has a +6 charged di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged &#956;&#8208;6 interstitial B atom The as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and the commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Although thiolated, reduced Group 11 metal nanoclusters with atomic monodispersity have been repeatedly reported in the past decade, their Pd analogues have not been reported thus far. In this work, we provide a resolution for the challenging synthesis and obtain for the first time an atomically monodisperse thiolated, reduced Pd (q=+0.75) nanocluster with a di&#8208;tetrahedron Pd8 kernel and a +3 charged interstitial B atom, as revealed by ESI&#8208;MS, SCXRD, etc. &#956;&#8208;6 B is found for the first time in Group 10 and 11 metal nanoclusters. More importantly, the as&#8208;obtained Pd nanoclusters show better catalytic activity compared to 1.4&#8197;nm Pd nanoparticles, Pd2 complexes and even a commercial Pt/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), having significant implications for the influence of the metal charge state and space structure on the catalytic activity.

         <title>A General Strategy for the Asymmetric Preparation of &#945;&#8208;Stereogenic Allyl Silanes, Germanes, and Boronate Esters via Dual Copper Hydride&#8208; and Palladium&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the enantioselective preparation of &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids (M=B, Si, Ge) with broad functional group compatibility has been developed. This protocol employs dual CuH&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis to access a variety of allyl metalloid species from readily accessible vinyl metalloids and enol triflates.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Stereogenic allyl metalloids are versatile synthetic intermediates which can undergo various stereocontrolled transformations. Most existing methods to prepare &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids involve multi&#8208;step sequences that curtail the number of compatible substrates and are limited to the synthesis of boronates. Here, we report a general method for the enantioselective preparation of &#945;&#8208;stereogenic allyl metalloids utilizing dual CuH&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalysis. This approach leverages a stereoretentive Cu&#8208;to&#8208;Pd transmetalation of an in situ generated alkyl copper species to allow access to enantioenriched allyl silanes, germanes, and boronate esters with broad functional group compatibility.

         <title>Cooperative Catalyst&#8208;Enabled Regio&#8208; and Stereodivergent Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Aldimine Esters with Racemic Allylic Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
The regio&#8208; and stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of aldimine esters with racemic allylic alcohols was enabled by cooperative catalysis. The Et3B additive plays a significant role in ionizing allylic alcohols to form electrophilic metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species and simultaneously promotes the formation of nucleophilic Cu&#8208;ylides. Computational mechanistic studies revealed the role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities.







Abstract
We describe cooperative bimetallic catalysis that enables regio&#8208;/stereodivergent asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylations of aldimine esters. By employing Et3B as the key activator, racemic allylic alcohols can be directly ionized to form Pd or Ir&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species in the presence of achiral Pd or chiral Ir complexes, respectively. The less or more substituted allylic termini of the metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;allyl species are amenable to nucleophilic attack by the chiral Cu&#8208;azomethine ylide, the formation of which is simultaneously facilitated by Et3B, affording &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino acids with high regioselectivity and excellent stereoselectivity. The use of readily available allylic alcohols as electrophilic precursors represents an improvement from an environmental and atom/step economy perspective. Computational mechanistic studies reveal the crucial role of the Et3B additive and the origins of stereo&#8208; and regioselectivities by analyzing steric effects, dispersion interactions, and frontier orbital population.

         <title>The Excited&#8208;State Creutz&#8211;Taube Ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Creutz&#8211;Taube ion was prepared as an excited state that includes a bridging pyrazine radical anion. It features an intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfer band, which allowed to directly address electronic delocalization and electronic coupling in the excited state. This species is competent for photoinduced electron transfer, illustrating the potential of photoinduced mixed valence species for photocatalysis.







Abstract
The excited&#8208;state version of the Creutz&#8211;Taube ion was prepared via visible light excitation of [(NH3)5RuII(&#956;&#8208;pz)RuII(NH3)5]4+. The resulting excited state is a mixed valence {RuIII&#8211;&#948;(&#956;&#8208;pz&#8901;&#8722;)RuII+&#948;} transient species, which was characterized using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with vis&#8208;NIR detection. Very intense photoinduced intervalence charge transfers were observed at 7500&#8197;cm&#8722;1, revealing an excited&#8208;state electronic coupling element HDA=3750&#8197;cm&#8722;1. DFT calculations confirm a strongly delocalized excited state. A notable consequence of strong electron delocalization is the nanosecond excited state lifetime, which was exploited in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept intermolecular electron transfer. The excited&#8208;state Creutz&#8211;Taube ion is established as a reference, and demonstrates that electron delocalization in the excited state can be leveraged for artificial photosynthesis or other photocatalytic schemes based on electron transfer chemistry.

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Assisted Click&#8208;Chemistry for Proximity&#8208;Driven, Site&#8208;Specific Acetylation of Histones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a proximity&#8208;driven, lysine&#8208;specific acetylation approach to construct precisely acetylated histone proteins. The approach is facilitated by a click reagent equipped with an acetate group donor to acetylate a nearby lysine in a sequence&#8208;controlled manner.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of histones are essential in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. Among these modifications, lysine acetylation is one of the most established. Earlier studies relied on the use of chromatin containing heterogeneous mixtures of histones acetylated at multiple sites. Differentiating the individual contribution of single acetylation events towards chromatin regulation is thus of great relevance. However, it is difficult to access homogeneous samples of histones, with a single acetylation, in sufficient quantities for such studies. By engineering histone H3 with a cysteine in proximity of the lysine of interest, we demonstrate that conjugation with maleimide&#8208;DBCO followed by a strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition reaction results in the acetylation of a single lysine in a controlled, site&#8208;specific manner. The chemical precision offered by our click&#8208;to&#8208;acetylate approach will facilitate access to and the study of acetylated histones.

         <dc:description>Catalytic carbonylations of aryl electrophiles via C(sp  2  )&#8211;N cleavage remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate an aminocarbonylation of aniline&#8208;derived trialkylammonium salts promoted by visible light with a simple cobalt catalyst. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization and is amenable to telescoped carbonylations directly from anilines. A range of alkylamines are successful partners, and alkoxycarbonylation is also demonstrated.

         <title>A Facile Structural Isomerization&#8208;Induced 3D Spatial D&#8208;A Interlocked Network for Achieving NIR&#8208;II Phototheranostic Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performances of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) organic phototheranostic agents (OPTAs) depend on both molecular structure and molecular packing when used as nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we proposed a facile structural isomerization&#8208;induced 3D spatial donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) interlocked network for achieving NIR&#8208;II OPTAs. Two isomers, 4MNVDPP and 6MNVDPP were synthesized and formulated into NPs. 6MNVDPP with larger electrostatic potential difference exhibits compact 3D spatial D&#8208;A interlocked network in crystal, while 4MNVDPP forms 2D D&#8208;D type J&#8208;aggregates. Thus, 6MNVDPP NPs show red&#8208;shifted NIR absorption and larger molar extinction coefficient than 4MNVDPP NPs. Thanks to the typical NIR&#8208;II emission, superior photothermal&#8208;stability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (89%) and reactive oxygen species production capacity, 6MNVDPP NPs exhibit outstanding NIR&#8208;II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti&#8208;cancer effect in vivo.</dc:description>

Thus, 6MNVDPP NPs show red-shifted NIR absorption and larger molar extinction coefficient than 4MNVDPP NPs. Thanks to the typical NIR-II emission, superior photothermal-stability, high photothermal conversion efficiency (89%) and reactive oxygen species production capacity, 6MNVDPP NPs exhibit outstanding NIR-II tiny capillary vasculature/tumor imaging ability and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic anti-cancer effect in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>o&#8208;Quinodimethane Atropisomers: Enantioselective Synthesis&#160;and Stereospecific Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>o&#8208;Quinodimethanes have remarkable utility as reactive inter&#173;mediates in Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, enabling significantly accelerated routes to complex polycyclic compounds. The discovery of different discrete pre&#173;cursors to thermally generate  o&#8208;quinodimethanes thereby greatly augmented their availability and versatility. However, due to the required high tem&#173;peratures and the immense reactivity of  o&#8208;quino&#173;di&#173;methanes, stereo&#173;selectivity to afford iso&#173;merically defined products still constitutes a critical challenge. Herein, we describe the accessibility of atropisomeric  o&#8208;quino&#173;dimethanes, the enantio&#173;selective synthesis of their precursors, their remarkable configurational stability and the stereo&#173;specific transformation by the benz&#173;annulation of dienophiles. A catalyst&#8208;stereo&#173;controlled [2+2+2] cyclo&#173;addition, the generation of  o&#8208;quino&#173;dimethane atrop&#173;isomers and ensuing stereo&#173;specific Diels&#8208;Alder reactions enabled enantio&#173;selectivities through these transient inter&#173;mediates with of up to 96:4 e.r.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Uranium Complexes with a Pendant Borane Lewis Acid and 1,2&#8208;Insertion of CO into a U&#8208;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we illustrate uranium complexes bearing a pendant borate (  i.e.  1  and  2  ) or a pendant borane (  i.e.  3  and  4  ) moiety via reaction of the highly strained uranacycle  I  with various 3&#8208;coordinate boranes. Complexes  3  and  4  represent the first examples of uranium complexes with a pendant borane Lewis acid. Moreover, complex  3  was capable of activation of CO, delivering a new CO activation mode, and an abnormal CO 1,2&#8208;insertion pathway into a U&#8208;N bond. The importance of the pendant borane moiety was confirmed by the controlled experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H Functionalizations: Divergent Synthesis of Indole[a]&#8208; and [b]&#8208;Fused Polycycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenyl azides substituted by an (alkylphenyl)ethynyl group facilitate benzylic sp3  (C&#8208;H) functionalization in the presence of a JohnPhosAu catalyst, resulting in indole&#8208;fused tetra&#8208; and pentacycles via divergent  N&#8208; or  C&#8208;cyclization. The chemoselectivity is influenced depending on the counter&#8208;anion, the electron density of the &#945;&#8208;imino gold(I) carbene, and the alkyl groups stabilizing the benzylic carbocation originating from a 1,5&#8208;hydride shift. An isotopic labeling experiment demonstrates the involvement of an indolylgold(I) species resulting from a tautomerization that is much faster than the deauration. The formation of a benzylic sp3  (C&#8208;H) functionalization leading to an indole&#8208;fused seven&#8208;membered ring is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Lessons Learned from the Grouping of Chemicals to Assess Risks to Human Health</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In analogy to the periodic system that groups elements by their similarity in structure and chemical properties, the hazard of chemicals can be assessed in groups of similar structures and similar toxicological properties. Here we review case studies of grouping strategies that supported the assessment of hazard, exposure, and risk to human health. By the EU&#8208;REACh and the US&#8208;TSCA New Chemicals Program, structural similarity is commonly used as the basis for grouping, but that criterion is not always adequate and sufficient. Based on the lessons learned, we derive ten principles for grouping, including: transparency of the purpose, criteria and boundaries of the group; adequacy of methods used to justify the group; inclusion or exclusion of substances in the group by toxicological properties. These principles apply to initial grouping to prioritize further actions as well as to definitive grouping to generate data for risk assessment. Both can expedite effective risk management.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonylative Cyclization of Alkenes with Alkyl Bromides via Radical Cascade Process</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we developed a new procedure on 1,2&#8208;dicarbonylative cyclization of 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;butenes with alkyl bromides. Using simple copper catalyst, two molecules of carbon monoxide were introduced into the double bond with the formation of four new C&#8208;C bonds and a new ring. Various &#945;&#8208;tetralones and 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones were formed in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Acidic Water Oxidation by Dynamic Migration of Oxygen Species at the Ir/Nb2O5&#8208;x Catalyst/Support Interfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst/support interaction plays a vital role in catalysis towards acidic oxygen evolution (OER), and the performance reinforcement is currently interpreted by either strain or electron donation effect. We herein report that these views are insufficient, where the dynamic evolution of the interface under potential bias must be considered. Taking Nb2O5&#8208;x supported iridium (Ir/Nb2O5&#8208;x) as a model catalyst, we uncovered the dynamic migration of oxygen species between IrOx and Nb2O5&#8208;x during OER. Direct spectroscopic evidence combined with theoretical computation suggests these migrations not only regulate the in&#8208;situ Ir structure towards boosted activity, but also suppress its over&#8208;oxidation via spontaneously delivering excessive oxygen from IrOx to Nb2O5&#8208;x. The optimized Ir/Nb2O5&#8208;x thus demonstrated exceptional performance in scalable water electrolyzers, i.e., only need 1.839 V to attain 3 A cm&#8208;2 (surpassing the DOE 2025 target), and no activity decay during a 2000 h test at 2 A cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Combination Cancer Treatment: Using Engineered DNAzyme Molecular Machines for Dynamic Inter&#8208; and Intracellular Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the promise of combination cancer therapy, it remains challenging to develop targeted strategies that are nontoxic to normal cells. Here we report a combination therapeutic strategy based on engineered DNAzyme molecular machines that can promote cancer apoptosis via dynamic inter&#8208; and intracellular regulation. To achieve external regulation of T&#8208;cell/cancer cell interactions, we designed a DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with an aptamer and an i&#8208;motif, as the MUC&#8208;1&#8208;selective aptamer allows the specific recognition of cancer cells, and the i&#8208;motif is folded under the tumor acidic microenvironment, shortening the intercellular distance. As a result, T&#8208;cells are released by metal ion activated DNAzyme cleavage. To achieve internal regulation of mitochondria, we delivered another DNAzyme&#8208;based molecular machine with mitochondria&#8208;targeted peptides into cancer cells to induce mitochondria aggregation. Our strategy achieved an enhanced killing effect in zinc deficient cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthesis to Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with spatially periodic networks demonstrate significant advantages compared with their 2D counterparts, including enhanced specific surface areas, interconnected channels, more sufficiently exposed active sites, etc. Nevertheless, these materials have met great bottlenecks due to serious crystallization problems, which must be solved before practical applications. In this Minireview, we firstly summarize some strategies for preparing functional 3D COFs, including crystallization techniques and functionalization methods. Hereafter, applications of these functional materials are presented, covering adsorption, separation, catalysis, fluorescence, sensing, batteries, and so on. Finally, the future challenges and perspectives for the development of 3D COFs are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Biosensors Operating Under Quasi&#8208;Equilibrium Conditions for Mitigating the Changes in Substrate Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Even after decades of research, implantable biosensors are facing challenges caused by the so&#8208;called foreign&#8208;body reaction regarding unstable calibration due to substrate diffusion variations, a slow adjustment of the steady&#8208;state response or effects of interferen&#173;ces. We present a conceptually new strategy using enzyme&#8208;based catalytic biosensors and a measuring sequence leading to minimum disturbance of the substrate equilibrium concentration. The concept is using a potentiostatic control of the sensor state between "on" and "off" combined with a short potentiometric data acquisition. For this, it is indispensably required that the enzyme activity can be completely switched off and no parasitic side reactions are allowing any substrate turnover. This is achieved by using an O  2  &#8208;independent FAD&#8208;GDH embedded within a crosslinked redox polymer. Within the first 100 ms after switching to the &#8220;on&#8221; state and hence charging the redox polymer film, the substrate concentration, i.e., glucose, can be reliably deter&#173;mined. The short measuring interval allows the glucose concentration equilibrium to be restored quickly within the active sensor compart&#173;ment which enables the catalytic biosensor to operate under quasi&#8208;equilibrium conditions. Hence, in the case of a fibrous encapsulation of the sensor one only must wait longer to attain equilibrium again.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Controlled Substrate Engineering Strategy for Site&#8208;Specific Enzymatic Fucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fucosylation is one of the most common modifications of oligo&#8208;N&#8208;acetyllactosamine (oligo&#8208;LacNAc) glycans. However, none of the known fucosyltransferases (FucTs) could install the a1,3&#8208;linked fucose to the oligo&#8208;LacNAc substrates in a site&#8208;specific manner. Here, we report a facile and general redox&#8208;controlled substrate engineering strategy for the site&#8208;specific a1,3&#8208;fucosylation of complex oligosaccharides containing multiple LacNAc units. This strategy takes advantage of an operationally simple oxidation enzyme module by using galactose oxidase (GOase) to convert the LacNAc unit into oxidized C6'&#8208;aldehyde LacNAc&#160;sequence. In contrast with LacNAc, the oxidized C6'&#8208;aldehyde LacNAc sequence is not a good substrate for recombinant a1,3&#8208;fucosyltransferase from Helicobacter pylori (Hpa1,3FucT), enabling the site&#8208;specific a1,3&#8208;fucosylation at intact LacNAc sites. The general applicability and robustness of this redox&#8208;controlled substrate engineering strategy was demonstrated by the synthesis of a variety of structurally well&#8208;defined fucosides of linear and branched O&#8208; and N&#8208;linked glycans</dc:description>

         <title>Discerning the Contributions of Gold Species in Butadiene Hydrogenation: From Single Atoms to Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Identify the roles of different active sites is vital for the rational catalyst design. Herein, we present a cutting&#8208;edge strategy to discriminate the contributions of different single&#8208;atom gold species and nanoparticles in 1,3&#8208;butadiene hydrogenation, through coupling advanced spectroscopic techniques, electron microscopy&#8208;based automated image analyses, and steady&#8208;state and kinetic studies. While all the carbon&#8208;hosted single gold atoms display negligible initial activity, the gold nanoparticles in situ evolved are highly active. Full&#8208;metal&#8208;species quantification is realized through combining electron&#8208;microscopy&#8208;based atom recognition statistics and deep learning&#8208;driven nanoparticle segmentation algorithm, allowing the establishment of the structure&#8208;activity correlations for the hybrid catalysts containing different Au architectures and pointing at the surface exposure density of Au nanoparticles, an electron microscopic&#8208;based statistics, as a new and reliable activity descriptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Algorithmic Explorations of Unimolecular and Bimolecular Reaction Spaces
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;low cost reaction exploration algorithm (Yet Another Reaction Program, v2.0) is used to predict reaction outcomes and characterize multiple unimolecular and bimolecular reaction networks. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.







Abstract
Algorithmic reaction exploration based on transition state searches has already made inroads into many niche applications, but its potential as a general&#8208;purpose tool is still largely unrealized. Computational cost and the absence of benchmark problems involving larger molecules remain obstacles to further progress. Here an ultra&#8208;low cost exploration algorithm is implemented and used to explore the reactivity of unimolecular and bimolecular reactants, comprising a total of 581 reactions involving 51 distinct reactants. The algorithm discovers all established reaction pathways, where such comparisons are possible, while also revealing a much richer reactivity landscape, including lower barrier reaction pathways and a strong dependence of reaction conformation in the apparent barriers of the reported reactions. The diversity of these benchmarks illustrate that reaction exploration algorithms are approaching general&#8208;purpose capability.

         <title>19F Barcoding Enables Multiplex Detection of Biomarkers Associated with Organ Injury and Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of molecular sensors with 19F barcodes enables multiplex detection of different biomarkers associated with organ injury and cancer. The barcoding strategy takes the advantage of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output and multiplex capacity.







Abstract
Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in complex environments is critical for the in&#8208;depth exploration of different biological processes, which is challenging for many current analytical methods due to various limitations. Herein, we report a strategy of 19F barcoding which takes the advantages of 19F's high magnetic resonance (MR) sensitivity, prompt signal response to environmental changes, negligible biological background, quantitative signal output, and multiplex capacity. A set of 19F&#8208;barcoded sensors responding to different biomarkers involved in organ injury and cancer are designed, synthesized, and characterized. With these sensors, we accomplish concurrent assessment of different biomarkers in the samples collected from the mice with drug&#8208;induced liver/kidney injury or tumor, illustrating the feasibility of this approach for multiplexed detection of different biomarkers in complex environments during various biological processes.

         <title>Narrowband Emissive TADF Conjugated Polymers towards Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processible OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emissions are developed by attaching multiple resonance emitting moiety as pendant onto the polycarbazole backbone, and the resulting OLEDs achieve a maximum EQE of 17.5&#8201;% with FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) conjugated polymers usually show broad emission spectra due to the large structure relaxation, which is not desirable for high&#8208;quality organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays. Herein, through attaching multiple resonance (MR) induced emitting moiety as pendant onto the polycarbazole backbone, TADF conjugated polymers with narrowband emission are demonstrated. The obtained conjugated polymers exhibit typical TADF characteristics with narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 33&#8211;43&#8197;nm. The solution&#8208;processed devices employing these polymers as emissive layers realize excellent performances with maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 17.5&#8201;%, emission peak at 496&#8197;nm and FWHM of 34&#8197;nm.

         <title>H+&#8722;H&#8722; Pairs in Partially Oxidized MAX Phases for Bifunctional Catalytic Conversion of Furfurals into Linear Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Lewis H+&#8722;H&#8722; pairs, generated in situ by hydrogen spillover on partially oxidized MAX phases, act as the hydrogenation sites for C=O hydrogenation and provide acid sites for ring opening. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites demonstrate unprecedented bifunctional catalytic performance for the conversion of furfurals.







Abstract
Currently, less favorable C=O hydrogenation and weak concerted acid catalysis cause unsatisfactory catalytic performance in the upgrading of biomass&#8208;derived furfurals (i.e., furfural, 5&#8208;methyl furfural, and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural) to ketones (i.e., cyclopentanone, 2,5&#8208;hexanedione, and 1&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;hexanedione). A series of partially oxidized MAX phase (i.e., Ti3AlC2, Ti2AlC, Ti3SiC2) supporting Pd catalysts were fabricated, which showed high catalytic activity; Pd/Ti3AlC2 in particular displayed high performance for conversion of furfurals into targeted ketones. Detailed studies of the catalytic mechanism confirm that in situ hydrogen spillover generates Frustrated Lewis H+&#8722;H&#8722; pairs, which not only act as the hydrogenation sites for selective C=O hydrogenation but also provide acid sites for ring opening. The close intimate hydrogenation and acid sites promote bifunctional catalytic reactions, substantially reducing the reported minimum reaction temperature of various furfurals by at least 30&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C.

An initially&#8208;envisioned intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder strategy guided the evolution of a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization approach that allowed for access to the carbocyclic core of 1.

The synthesis was initially envisioned as proceeding through an intramolecular isobenzofuran Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a strategy that eventually evolved into a Lewis acid&#8208;promoted spirocyclization. This highly diastereoselective transformation set the stage for trans&#8208;decalin formation and a late&#8208;stage Su&#225;rez oxidation that produced a [3.2.1] oxabicycle suited for conversion to 1. Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;mediated aromatization, followed by a series of carefully choreographed oxidations, allowed for rearrangement to a [2.2.2] oxabicycle poised for conversion to 4 and 5.

         <title>A Pyridine&#8208;Stabilized N&#8208;Phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Diboravinyl Cation: Boron Analogue of Vinyl Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;diboravinyl cation was obtained through the displacement reaction of the bromide substituent on a diborene derivative using pyridine. This newly formed species was shown to be a boron analogue of the vinyl cation which could be used for the activation of small molecules.







Abstract
A boron analogue of vinyl cation, pyridine&#8208;stabilized N&#8208;phosphinoamidinato N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;diboravinyl cation 2+, was synthesized by displacement of bromide in diborene 1 with excess pyridine. Experimental and computational studies showed that the positive charge is mainly at the B&#8722;B skeleton with delocalization to the pyridine ligand. One of the main modes of reactivity is through the B=B double bond alongside activation of the pyridine substituent, where the Bpyridine center is the predominant nucleophilic center and the predominant electrophilic center is either the activated pyridine para position or the BNHC center, illustrating the presence of diborene cation A, borylene&#8208;borenium cation B and diborene&#8208;pyridinium cation C resonance structures in cation 2+.

&lt;p&gt;A pyridine-stabilized &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phosphinoamidinato &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocyclic carbene-diboravinyl cation was obtained through the displacement reaction of the bromide substituent on a diborene derivative using pyridine. This newly formed species was shown to be a boron analogue of the vinyl cation which could be used for the activation of small molecules.

         <title>Regioisomer&#8208;Free Difluoro&#8208;Monochloro Terminal&#8208;based Hexa&#8208;Halogenated Acceptor with Optimized Crystal Packing for Efficient Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
New fluorine/chlorine regio&#8208;regular hetero&#8208;trihalogenated terminal was firstly synthesized and systematically employed to enhance single&#8208;crystal packing, improve film morphology, and boost device performance of the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.65&#8201;%, which is far better than that of Y&#8208;Cl and Y&#8208;FCl and is the highest efficiency for the hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs.







Abstract
Herein, we synthesized new hetero&#8208;halogenated end groups with well&#8208;determined fluorinated and chlorinated substitutions (o&#8208;FCl&#8208;IC and FClF&#8208;IC), and synthesized regioisomer&#8208;free small molecular acceptors (SMAs) Y&#8208;Cl, Y&#8208;FCl, and Y&#8208;FClF with distinct hetero&#8208;halogenated terminals, respectively. The single&#8208;crystal structures and theoretical calculations indicate that Y&#8208;FClF exhibits more compact three&#8208;dimensional network packing and more significant &#960;&#8208;&#960; electronic coupling compared to Y&#8208;FCl. From Y&#8208;Cl to Y&#8208;FCl to Y&#8208;FClF, the neat films exhibit a narrower optical band gap and gradually enhanced electron mobility and crystallinity. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF blend film exhibits the strongest crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on molecular packing, desirable fibrous morphology with suitable phase segregation, and the highest and balanced charge mobilities among three blend films. Overall, the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FClF organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver a remarkable efficiency of 17.65&#8201;%, outperforming the PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;FCl and PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y&#8208;Cl, which is the best PCE for reported hetero&#8208;halogens&#8208;based SMAs in binary OSCs. Our results demonstrate that difluoro&#8208;monochloro hetero&#8208;terminal is a superior regio&#8208;regular unit for enhancing the intermolecular crystal packing and photovoltaic performance of hetero&#8208;halogenated SMAs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Peapod&#8208;like Micrometer Tubes from a Planet&#8208;Satellite&#8208;type Supramolecular Megamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type amphiphilic supramolecular megamer is presented. It exhibits an unprecedented hierarchical self&#8208;assembly process in aqueous solution. The self&#8208;assembled structures formed by the megamer evolve from vesicles to vesosomes and eventually to a peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tubes as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside it as the peas.







Abstract
This study presents interesting self&#8208;assembly of peapod&#8208;like micrometer tubes from a planet&#8208;satellite&#8208;type supramolecular megamer, which was constructed through the specific host&#8211;guest molecular recognition between azobenzene (AZO)&#8208;functionalized hyperbranched poly(ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol)&#8208;star&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide) (HSP&#8208;AZO) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin(CD)&#8208;based hydrophilic hyperbranched polyglycerol (CD&#8208;g&#8208;HPG). A peapod&#8208;like structure with micrometer&#8208;sized tube as the pod and vesicles encapsulated inside as the peas was formed through sequential vesicle entosis, linear association, and fusion processes. Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations support the structural possibility of the supramolecular peapod formation and its mechanism. UV light irradiation could lead to the disassembly of the peapod&#8208;like structure. This study expands the family of supramolecular polymers and opens a new avenue to develop bioinspired complex hierarchical nanoarchitectures at the microscopic level.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
QM/MM modeling revealed that the C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation of L&#8208;PAPA in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires unprecedentedly through a traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation pathway. This novel O2 activation mode modulated by the L&#8208;PAPA substrate, which is associated with the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding, opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities in O2 activation by non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.







Abstract
Through QM/MM modeling, we discovered that C(sp3)&#8722;H &#946;&#8208;hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase CmlA transpires by traceless amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation. Different from the canonical diiron hydroxylase sMMO, this aliphatic&#8208;amine&#8208;assisted O2 activation avoids generating the high&#8208;valent diferryl FeIV2O2 species, but alternatively renders a diferric FeIII2O species as the reactive oxidant. From this unprecedented O2 activation mode, the derived C(sp3)&#8722;H hydroxylation mechanism in CmlA also differs drastically from the toluene aromatic C(sp2)&#8722;H hydroxylation in the diiron hydroxylase T4MO. This substrate&#8208;modulated O2 activation in CmlA has rich mechanistic implications for other diiron hydroxylases with an amine group adjacent to the C&#8722;H bond under hydroxylation in substrates, such as hDOHH. Furthermore, the adapted coordination environment of the diiron cofactor upon O2 binding in CmlA opens up more structural and mechanistic possibilities for O2 activation in non&#8208;heme diiron enzymes.

         <title>Tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane: An Isolable, Halogen&#8208;Free, Lewis Superacid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bottleable, halogen&#8208;free, neutral, single&#8208;site Lewis superacid, tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3) is synthesized in one pot from commercially available materials and its properties investigated. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane along with its lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO induces the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic C&#8722;F bond functionalization indicate that BoCb3 is a promising Lewis acid catalyst.







Abstract
The synthesis of tris(ortho&#8208;carboranyl)borane (BoCb3), a single site neutral Lewis superacid, in one pot from commercially available materials is achieved. The high fluoride ion affinity (FIA) confirms its classification as a Lewis superacid and the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method as well as adducts with Lewis bases indicate stronger Lewis acidity over the widely used fluorinated aryl boranes. The electron withdrawing effect of ortho&#8208;carborane and lack of pi&#8208;delocalization of the LUMO rationalize the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic studies indicate that BoCb3 is a superior catalyst for promoting C&#8722;F bond functionalization reactions than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of tris(&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-carboranyl)borane (B&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;Cb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), a single site neutral Lewis superacid, in one pot from commercially available materials is achieved. The high fluoride ion affinity (FIA) confirms its classification as a Lewis superacid and the Gutmann-Beckett method as well as adducts with Lewis bases indicate stronger Lewis acidity over the widely used fluorinated aryl boranes. The electron withdrawing effect of &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-carborane and lack of pi-delocalization of the LUMO rationalize the unusually high Lewis acidity. Catalytic studies indicate that B&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;Cb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a superior catalyst for promoting C&#8722;F bond functionalization reactions than tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Exhaustive Reduction of Oxo&#8208;Chemicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic system involving titanium used for the exhaustive reduction of carboxylic acid derivatives to the corresponding methyl&#8208; compounds is reported. The catalytic system also works with other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates while the products might be promising for bio&#8208;applications. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the in situ generated TiIII&#8722;H species was key for this transformation.







Abstract
Catalytic reduction of carboxylic acids and derivatives all the way to their corresponding methyl&#8208;compounds is very rare and still challenging for homogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, we report an unprecedented and general catalytic exhaustive reduction of carboxylic functional group straightforwardly to a methyl group. This reaction was achieved using earth&#8208;abundant and readily available titanium as a catalyst. Our system has broad functional group tolerance and works for various other types of oxo&#8208;chemicals such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, lactones, and carboxylates (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that the in situ&#8208;generated TiIII&#8722;H species was vital for this transformation.

         <title>An Unsaturated Bond Strategy to Regulate Active Centers of Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to modulate the charge distribution of active centers of organic catalysts by using unsaturated bonds (UBs) is reported. The UBs can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N group as active centers. The effect of UBs decoration on adsorption property of the catalysts is disclosed.







Abstract
Unsaturated environment is the key to affect catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Unveiling the effect of unsaturated sites toward ORR activity is of importance due to the vague unsaturated states. Reported here is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy on the evaluation of unsaturated bonds (UBs) on adjacent carbon environment by precisely developing two metal&#8208;free vinyl&#8208;/azo&#8208;decorated covalent organic frameworks (Vinyl&#8208;COF and Azo&#8208;COF) as catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared UB&#8208;COFs exhibit good performance than the control Py&#8208;COF and comparable to the most reported carbon catalysts. Supported by theory calculations and in situ Raman spectra&#8208;electrochemistry, it is revealed that the UBs in organic catalysts can produce para&#8208;activation, identifying the para C=N groups as active centers. Importantly, the intrinsic UBs can induce local charge redistribution, and make the molecular skeleton possess high isosurface map distribution, with an efficient affinity for oxygen intermediates.

         <title>Direct Observation &#8220;Elongated&#8221; Conformational States in &#945;&#8208;Synuclein upon Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing a modified cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive Pairing StatisticS), we unravel conformational changes of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein upon liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). The conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states in liquid droplets. During this early LLPS stage, &#945;&#8208;synuclein remains monomeric and highly flexible.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS), fibrillation, and forms insoluble intracellular Lewy bodies in neurons, which are the hallmark of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Neurotoxicity precedes the formation of aggregates and might be related to &#945;&#8208;syn LLPS. The molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of LLPS are still elusive. To obtain structural insights into &#945;&#8208;syn upon LLPS, we take advantage of cross&#8208;linking/mass spectrometry (XL&#8211;MS) and introduce an innovative approach, termed COMPASS (COMPetitive PAiring StatisticS). In this work, we show that the conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;syn shifts from a &#8220;hairpin&#8208;like&#8221; structure towards more &#8220;elongated&#8221; conformational states upon LLPS. We obtain insights into the critical initial stages of LLPS and establish a novel mass spectrometry&#8208;based approach that will aid to solve open questions in LLPS structural biology.

         <dc:description>
A novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is realized to produce polyester with tunable topologies by one&#8208;pot&#8208;one&#8208;step ring&#8208;opening copolymerization of a substituted &#948;&#8208;lactone derived from CO2 and 1,3&#8208;butadiene with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone mediated by sodium phenolate. The obtained transparent, non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable network presents great resilience and excellent elastic recovery properties for application as a polyester elastomer.







Abstract
It is significant and challenging to use CO2 to produce polymeric materials, especially with olefins. Here, a novel strategy named &#8220;scrambling polymerizations&#8221; is designed and performed for the copolymerization of a CO2&#8208;and&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;derived valerolactone, 3&#8208;ethylidene&#8208;6&#8208;vinyltetrahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyran&#8208;2&#8208;one (EVL), with &#1013;&#8208;caprolactone (CL) to prepare polyesters. Anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting in polyester P(CL&#8208;co&#8208;EVL) with a tunable topology and composition. The non&#8208;cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break of &gt;600&#8201;% can be used as an elastomer. We propose a method to provide polyester elastomers from CO2 and olefins for the first time, and expand the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.

Anionic ring-opening polymerization of CL and conjugated addition oligomerization of EVL take place individually to form PCL and EVL oligomers, respectively. Then EVL oligomers insert into PCL by transesterification resulting in polyester P(CL-co-EVL) with a tunable topology and composition. The non-cytotoxic and degradable polyester network with elongation at break of &amp;gt;600&#8201;% can be used as an elastomer. We propose a method to provide polyester elastomers from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and olefins for the first time, and expand the potential of transformation from sustainable feedstocks to polymeric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis, Characterization, and Properties of Multi&#8208;Element Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;element nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of five or more elements often exhibit superior properties, including catalysis, compared with conventional NPs. Therefore, a variety of synthesis methods have recently been studied. In this review, we focus on chemical synthesis of multi&#8208;element NPs based on solution reactions, and discuss synthesis techniques as well as NP characterization and properties.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;element nanoparticles (NPs) consisting of five or more elements have been increasingly studied in the past five years. Their emergence is taking materials science one step further because they exhibit superior properties to those of conventional NPs in a range of respects, including catalysis. This Review focuses on the recent progress in multi&#8208;element NPs regarding synthesis, especially with regard to chemical synthesis, characterization, and properties. We begin with a brief introduction of multi&#8208;element NPs and an overview of their synthesis methods. Then, we present representative examples of multi&#8208;element alloy NPs and ceramic NPs, including oxide NPs prepared by chemical syntheses. This Review intends to provide useful insights into the chemical methods that are used to synthesize multi&#8208;element NPs, and includes a discussion on the possibilities arising from their use in new functional materials.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Boroaminomethylation of Olefins to &#947;&#8208;Boryl Amines with CO as C1 Source</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as &#8722;CH2&#8208;source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond was described. In the present of CuCl and Xantphos as the catalyst, a variety of &#947;&#8208;boryl amines were obtained with broad functional groups tolerance. The new conversation aromatization and other transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrate their utility. Notably, 13C labeled product was produced with isotope&#8208;labeled 13CO.







Abstract
Boroaminomethylation of olefins is an efficient process to convert hydrocarbons directly into boron&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. Such chemicals are a good handle for obtaining more complexed amine derivatives through the various transformations of organoboron. However, using simple and easily available CO as the C1 feedstock to achieve boroaminomethylation is still elusive. Here we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed boroaminomethylation of olefins with CO as the C1 source via the mechanism of a carbene insertion into the N&#8722;H bond. This method affords valuable &#947;&#8208;boryl amines from four inexpensive readily chemicals. The wide synthetic transformations of the &#947;&#8208;boryl amines demonstrates their utility. Notably, 13C labeling studies revealed that the &#8722;CH2&#8208;building block was derived from one molecule of CO.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Based Engineering of the Active Pocket of D&#8208;Amino Acid Oxidase Leading to Highly Improved Specificity toward D&#8208;Glufosinate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophilicity&#8208;based triple&#8208;code site&#8208;directed mutagenesis (S&#8208;T&#8208;Q) was applied to the wild&#8208;type enzyme RgDAAO, leading to a mutant Zn7 with greater than 2000&#8208;fold improvement in specific activity toward the unnatural substrate D&#8208;glufosinate, which was converted into PPO, a precursor of an excellent herbicide, L&#8208;PPT. Computational analysis revealed that the higher activity was mainly caused by an extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity.







Abstract
Due to its stringent stereospecificity, D&#8208;amino acid oxidase (DAAO) has made it very easy to synthesize L&#8208;amino acids. However, the low activity of the wild&#8208;type enzyme toward unnatural substrates, such as D&#8208;glufosinate (D&#8208;PPT), restricts its application. In this study, DAAO from Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO) was directly evolved using a hydrophilicity&#8208;substitution saturation mutagenesis strategy, yielding a mutant with significantly increased catalytic activity against D&#8208;PPT. The mutant displays distinct catalytic properties toward hydrophilic substrates as compared to numerous WT&#8208;DAAOs. The analysis of homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulation suggest that the extended reaction pocket with greater hydrophilicity was the reason for the enhanced activity. The current study established an enzymatic synthetic route to L&#8208;PPT, an excellent herbicide, with high efficiency, and the proposed strategy provides a new viewpoint on enzyme engineering for the biosynthesis of unnatural amino acids.

         <title>Precise Control of Selenium Functionalization in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two region&#8208;specific selenium&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors flanking conjugated side chains are compared with their sulfur&#8208;based analogue. mPh4F&#8208;TS with selenium at the outer positions show the most rigid skeleton, red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS organic solar cells exhibit the lowest energetic disorders, the highest charge carrier mobility and the best photon response, affording a top&#8208;ranking efficiency of &gt;18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Central &#960;&#8208;core engineering of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) is effective in boosting the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Especially, selenium (Se) functionalization of NF&#8208;SMAs is considered a promising strategy but the structure&#8208;performance relationship remains unclear. Here, we synthesize two isomeric alkylphenyl&#8208;substituted selenopheno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based NF&#8208;SMAs named mPh4F&#8208;TS and mPh4F&#8208;ST with different substitution positions, and contrast them with the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;based analogue, mPh4F&#8208;TT. When placing Se atoms at the outer positions of the &#960;&#8208;core, mPh4F&#8208;TS shows the most red&#8208;shifted absorption and compact molecular stacking. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS devices exhibit excellent absorption, high charge carrier mobility, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;mPh4F&#8208;TS achieves more balanced photovoltaic parameters and yields an efficiency of 18.05&#8201;%, which highlights that precisely manipulating selenium functionalization is a practicable way toward high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Stable and Red&#8208;Emissive Radical Cation for Mutp53 Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive radical cation P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn was developed for mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of zinc ions to promote degradation of mutp53 in cancer cells via proteasome&#8208;dependent pathway and facilitate abrogation of various mutp53&#8208;conferred gain of function phenotypes.







Abstract
Compared with conventional closed&#8208;shell fluorophores, radical cations provide an opportunity for development of red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with small sizes and easy preparation. However, most radical cations reported in the literature suffer from poor stability in water solution and are almost non&#8208;emissive. To tackle this challenge, we herein develop a deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive and water&#8208;stable pyrrole radical cation P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn, which can be easily generated from P&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn by air oxidation. The deep&#8208;red&#8208;emissive P&#8901;+&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn can be used for imaging&#8208;guided mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery of Zn2+ into cancer cells to promote mutant p53 proteins degradation and abrogate mutp53&#8208;manifested gain of function, including reduced chemotherapy resistance, inhibited cancer cell migration, decreased tumor cell colony and sphere formation. The water&#8208;stable and deep&#8208;red emissive pyrrole radical cation is thus promising for cancer theranostic applications.

&lt;p&gt;A water-stable and deep-red-emissive radical cation P&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn was developed for mitochondria-targeted delivery of zinc ions to promote degradation of mutp53 in cancer cells via proteasome-dependent pathway and facilitate abrogation of various mutp53-conferred gain of function phenotypes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with conventional closed-shell fluorophores, radical cations provide an opportunity for development of red-to-NIR fluorophores with small sizes and easy preparation. However, most radical cations reported in the literature suffer from poor stability in water solution and are almost non-emissive. To tackle this challenge, we herein develop a deep-red-emissive and water-stable pyrrole radical cation P&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn, which can be easily generated from P&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn by air oxidation. The deep-red-emissive P&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;DPA&#8722;Zn can be used for imaging-guided mitochondria-targeted delivery of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into cancer cells to promote mutant p53 proteins degradation and abrogate mutp53-manifested gain of function, including reduced chemotherapy resistance, inhibited cancer cell migration, decreased tumor cell colony and sphere formation. The water-stable and deep-red emissive pyrrole radical cation is thus promising for cancer theranostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wide Bandgap Polymer Donors Functionalized with Unconventional Carbamate Side Chains for Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Side chain engineering with heteroatoms is not only effective in tuning frontier molecular orbitals, but also possible for forming secondary bonds which can be utilized to planarize the molecular backbone, hence, improving the photon absorption as well as charge transport abilities of polymer solar cell (PSC) materials. In this work, two types of unconventional side chains, namely carboxylate and carbamate, containing various heteroatoms are introduced to the thiophene bridges in high performance benzodithiophene (BDT) based donor polymers forming novel polymers PTzTz&#8208;C and PTzTz&#8208;N, respectively. In these polymers, non&#8208;covalent O&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;S and N&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;H interactions induces high aggregation tendency. In ternary blend PSC with PTzTz&#8208;N added into the high performance D18:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, complimentary absorption and improved thin film morphology were observed with a top power conversion efficiency of 18.76%, which is almost 5% improvement on the D18:BTP&#8208;eC9 binary blends.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Electrostatic Interaction via Strong Complexation for Highly Selective Reduction of CN&#8208; into N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the oxidation reaction of cations at the anode and the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system nearly cannot be achieved. This study proposes a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via strong complexation, realizing the electrocatalytic reduction of cyanide (CN&#8208;) at the cathode and then converting the generated reduction products into nitrogen (N2) at the anode. Theoretical calculations and experimental results confirm that the polarization of the transition metal oxide cathodes under the electric field causes the strong chemisorption between CN&#8208; and cathode, inducing the preferential enrichment of CN&#8208; to the cathode. CN&#8208; is hydrogenated by atomic hydrogen at the cathode to methylamine/ammonia, which are further oxidized into N2 by free chlorine derived from the anode. This paper provides a new idea for realizing the unconventional and unrealizable reactions in the electrocatalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Directed Biosynthesis of Quantum Dots via Spidroin Templating in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatially directed synthesis of quantum dots (QDs) is intriguing yet challenging in organisms, due to the dispersed feature of templating biomolecules and precursors. Whether this task could be accomplished by biomolecular condensates, an emerging type of membraneless compartments in cells remains unknown. Here we report synthetic protein condensates for templated synthesis of QDs in bacterium Escherichia coli. This was realized by overexpression of spider silk protein to bind precursor ions and recruit other necessary components, which induced the spidroin to form more &#946;&#8208;sheet structures for assembly and maturation of the protein condensates. This in turn enabled formation and co&#8208;localization of the fluorescent QDs to &#8220;light up&#8221; the condensates, and alleviated cytotoxicity of the precursor heavy metal ions and resulting QDs. Thus, our results suggest a new strategy for nanostructure synthesis and deposition in subcellular compartments with great potential for in situ applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Synthesis of Pyridyl Ethers by Bi(V)&#8208;Mediated O&#8209;Arylation of Pyridones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that O&#8208;selective arylation of 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;pyridones with arylboronic acids is affected by a modular, bismacycle&#8208;based system. The utility of this umpolung approach to pyridyl ethers, which is complementary to conventional methods based on S  N  Ar or cross&#8208;coupling, is demonstrated through the concise synthesis of Ki6783 and picolinafen, and the formal synthesis of cabozantib and golvatinib. Computational investigations reveal that arylation proceeds in a concerted fashion via a 5&#8208;membered transition state. The kinetically&#8208;controlled regioselectivity for O&#8208;arylation &#8211; which is reversed relative to previous Bi(V)&#8208;mediated pyridone arylations &#8211; is attributed primarily to the geometric constraints imposed by the bismacyclic scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Kinetic States of a [2]Rotaxane&#8208;Based Molecular Shuttle Controlled by Acid Concentrations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A [2]rotaxane&#8208;based molecular shuttle with an acid&#8208;responsive asymmetric macrocycle on a symmetric dumbbell axle was reported. Upon adding TFA, the macrocycle, namely the amine naphthotube, is protonated and translocates from the di(quaternary ammoniums) station to the triazole stations due to electrostatic repulsion and weakened binding. The shuttling kinetics is slow due to the steric hindrance caused by the ethyl group on the quaternary ammonium and can be followed by  1  H NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, it was found that the shuttling kinetics depends on the concentration of TFA. A kinetic intermediate was detected and can even be captured in the presence of high concentration of TFA. Extensive control experiments revealed that the shuttling kinetics and the capture of the kinetic intermediate are related to the different protonation states of the rotaxanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Facilitated Detection and Sequencing of 5&#8208;Formylcytidine RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>5&#8208;Formylcytidine f5C is one of the epigenetic nucleotides in tRNA. Despite the evident importance of f5C in gene expression regulation, little is known about its exact amount and position. To capture this information, we developed a modification&#8208;specific functionalization with a semi&#8208;stabilized ylide. The chemical labelling exhibited a high selectivity towards f5C and allowed distinction from similar 5&#8208;formyluridine. We realized a detection strategy based on the fluorescence signal of the cyclization product 4,5&#8208;pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;amine&#8208;cytidine paC, which exhibited a high quantum yield. The results clearly identified f5C with a limit of detectionat 0.58 nM. This method altered the hydrogen bonding activities of f5C and modulated of its reverse transcription signature in sequencing profile. We showed that f5C can be detected from tRNA segments with a single&#8208;base resolution. Taken together, this approach represents a sensitive, antibody&#8208;free and applicable detection and sequencing to f5C RNA.</dc:description>

Nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes with boronic acids is achieved triggered by C(sp3)&#8722;F bond activation, which provides an expedient access to 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkable high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.







Abstract
The introduction of fluorine&#8208;containing groups into organic molecules can significantly affect their physical and chemical properties and has long been used as an effective strategy for drug discovery and development. Consequently, the development of catalytic asymmetric methods for the synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing heterocycles is highly desirable and sought after. Herein, we describe a nickel&#8208;catalyzed defluorinative asymmetric cyclization of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted 1,6&#8208;enynes, providing an expedient access to synthetically attractive 4&#8208;fluorovinyl&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;pyrrolidones in good yields with remarkable high levels of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities (90&#8211;99&#8201;% ee,&gt;35 examples). This protocol features readily available starting materials and excellent functional group compatibility, and exhibits complementary regioselectivity. The utility of this strategy was demonstrated in the enantioselective synthesis of the antiepileptic drug Seletracetam.

         <title>A Universal Photoactivatable Tag Attached to Fluorophores Enables Their Use for Single&#8208;Molecule Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a general strategy for constructing photoactivatable probes by introducing a universal tag SO on fluorescent molecules. This strategy is applicable to most of the commercial fluorophores with various skeletal structures. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubules in fixed neurons.







Abstract
Single molecule localization microscopy based on photoactivation is a powerful tool for investigating the ultrastructure of cells. We developed a general strategy for photoactivatable fluorophores, using 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;oxathiine group (SO) as a tag to attach to various skeletal structures, including coumarin, BODIPY, rhodamine, and cyanine. The conjugation of SO resulted in a significant loss of fluorescence due to photoinduced electron transfer (PeT). Under the irradiation of excitation light, singlet oxygen generated by the fluorophores converted the SO moiety into its ester derivative, terminated the PeT process, and restored the fluorescence. Single molecule localization imaging was achieved using a dual functional illuminating beam in the visible, acting as both the activating and the exciting source. We successfully applied these photoactivatable probes for time&#8208;lapse super&#8208;resolution tracking in living cells and super&#8208;resolution imaging of microtubule structures in neurons.

         <title>Catalytic Multicomponent Synthesis of C&#8208;Acyl Glycosides by Consecutive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive nickel catalysis was leveraged to orchestrate the multicomponent union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and isobutyl chloroformate to assemble C&#8208;acyl glycosides in high anomeric selectivities. Computational studies provided insights that rationalize the origin of the high chemoselectivity. The method is applicable to the synthesis of complex C&#8208;linked disaccharides and late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of peptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Acyl glycosides are versatile intermediates to natural products and medicinally relevant entities. Conventional cross&#8208;coupling strategies to secure these molecules often relied on two&#8208;component manifolds in which a glycosyl precursor is coupled with an acyl donor (pre&#8208;synthesized or generated in situ) under transition metal or dual catalysis to forge a C&#8722;C bond. Here, we disclose a three&#8208;component Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive regime that facilitates the chemoselective union of glycosyl halides, organoiodides and commercially available isobutyl chloroformate as a CO surrogate. The method tolerates multiple functionalities and the resulting products are obtained in high diastereoselectivities. Theoretical calculations provide a mechanistic rationale for the unexpectedly high chemoselectivity of sequential cross&#8208;electrophile couplings. This approach enables the expeditious assembly of difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize C&#8208;acyl glycosides, as well as late&#8208;stage keto&#8208;glycosylation of oligopeptides.

         <title>Facilitating Molecular Activation and Proton Feeding by Dual Active Sites on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;site synergism of vacant and protonated pyridine N in polymeric C3N4 significantly polarized the inert CO2 molecules and eliminates the formation energy barrier of key *COOH intermediates, inducing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity enhancement (183 times) in CO production. Our atomic&#8208;precision strategy offers a promising way to overcome the technical challenges in molecular activation and rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer during CO2 photoreduction.







Abstract
Photoreduction of CO2 provides an appealing way to alleviate the energy crisis and manage the global carbon balance but is limited by the high activation energy and the rate&#8208;limiting proton transfer. We now develop a dual&#8208;site strategy for high&#8208;efficiency CO2 conversion through polarizing CO2 molecules at pyridine N vacancies and accelerating the intermediate protonation by protonated pyridine N adjacent to nitrogen vacancies on polymeric carbon nitride. Our photocatalysts with atomic&#8208;level engineered active sites manifest a high CO production rate of 1835&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, 183 times higher than the pristine bulk carbon nitride. Theoretical prediction and experimental studies confirm that such excellent performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between vacant and protonated pyridine N in decreasing the formation energy of the key *COOH intermediates and the efficient electron transfer relay facilitated by the defect&#8208;induced shallow trap state and homogeneous charge mediators.

Ynamide coupling reagents combine the advantages of conventional active esters and coupling reagents, while overcoming their disadvantages, and exhibit superiority in addressing the notorious racemization/epimerization issue.

Abstract
Ynamides, a class of novel coupling reagents for peptide synthesis, facilitated peptide bond formation in a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step manner with &#945;&#8208;acyloxyenamide active esters of amino acids as stable intermediates. Ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide synthesis proceeded by a reaction mechanism that is completely different from that of conventional coupling reagents and exhibited superiority in addressing the issue of racemization/epimerization during peptide bond formation. Herein, we present a systematic mechanistic analysis, including kinetics and Br&#248;nsted&#8208;type structure&#8211;reactivity studies and density functional theory calculations, providing unprecedented mechanistic insight into ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation. Based on these mechanistic studies, significant improvements were made, and the applicability of ynamide&#8208;mediated peptide bond formation was successfully expanded to peptide fragment condensation, head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclization and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new class of trimethine skeleton NIR&#8208;II fluorophores (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) with improved stability over traditional heptamethine NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and emission above 1000&#8197;nm. The NIR&#8208;II Cy3s can reversibly respond to HClO and reactive sulfur species (RSS) and can serve as an effective platform for the reversible monitoring of the HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox process in a pathophysiology environment. Finally, we applied NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 to the reversible assessment of the redox environment and dynamic effect of drug treatment in an acute inflammation model and of redox potential changes during liver injury and repair.

The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescent imaging shows great potential for deep tissue analysis at high resolution in living body owing to low background autofluorescence and photon scattering. However, reversible monitoring of redox homeostasis using NIR&#8208;II fluorescent imaging remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate probes. In this study, a series of stable and multifunctional NIR&#8208;II dyes (NIR&#8208;II Cy3s) were constructed based on trimethine skeleton. Significantly, introducing the 1,4&#8208;diethyl&#8208;decahydroquinoxaline group to the NIR&#8208;II Cy3s not only effectively increased the wavelength, but also served as an effective response site for HClO, which can be restored by reactive sulfur species (RSS). Based on this, NIR&#8208;II Cy3s were used for reversible monitoring of HClO/RSS&#8208;mediated redox processes in the pathophysiology environment. Finally, NIR&#8208;II Cy3&#8208;988 was successfully utilized for assessment of the redox environments and drug treatment effects in acute inflammation model.

&lt;p&gt;We report a new class of trimethine skeleton NIR-II fluorophores (NIR-II Cy3s) with improved stability over traditional heptamethine NIR-II fluorophores and emission above 1000&#8197;nm. The NIR-II Cy3s can reversibly respond to HClO and reactive sulfur species (RSS) and can serve as an effective platform for the reversible monitoring of the HClO/RSS-mediated redox process in a pathophysiology environment. Finally, we applied NIR-II Cy3-988 to the reversible assessment of the redox environment and dynamic effect of drug treatment in an acute inflammation model and of redox potential changes during liver injury and repair.

         <title>Arylboration of Enecarbamates for the Synthesis of Borylated Saturated N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated N&#8208;heterocycles are important motifs found in many biologically active molecules. In this work, difunctionalization of 4&#8211;7&#8208;membered enecarbamates is achieved using both Cu/Pd and Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good selectivity. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Two catalytic systems have been developed for the arylboration of endocyclic enecarbamates to deliver synthetically versatile borylated saturated N&#8208;heterocycles in good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities. A Cu/Pd dual catalytic reaction enables the synthesis of borylated, &#945;&#8208;arylated azetidines, while a Ni&#8208;catalysed arylboration reaction efficiently functionalizes 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;membered enecarbamates. In the case of the Cu/Pd&#8208;system, a remarkable additive effect was identified that allowed for broader scope. The products are synthetically useful, as demonstrated by manipulations of the boronic ester to access biologically active compounds.

         <title>2,2&#8242;&#8208;Biphenol&#8208;based Ultrathin Microporous Nanofilms for Highly Efficient Molecular Sieving Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;thin microporous polymer composite membranes with extraordinary perm&#8208;selectivity for organic solvent nanofiltration were fabricated by employing two novel 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives as IP monomers. The enhanced microporosity arisis from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Moreover, it can achieve precise separation of organic molecules with similar molecular weights on their charge and molecular size.







Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) is an emerging membrane separation technology, which urgently requires robust, easily processed, OSN membranes possessing high permeance and small solutes&#8208;selectivity to facilitate enhanced industrial uptake. Herein, we describe the use of two 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol (BIPOL) derivatives to fabricate hyper&#8208;crosslinked, microporous polymer nanofilms through IP. Ultra&#8208;thin, defect&#8208;free polyesteramide/polyester nanofilms (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) could be obtained readily due to the relatively large molecular size and ionized nature of the BIPOL monomers retarding the rate of the IP. The enhanced microporosity arises from the hyper&#8208;crosslinked network structure and monomer rigidity. Specifically, the amino&#8208;BIPOL/PAN membrane exhibits extraordinary permselectivity performances with molecular weight cut&#8208;off as low as 233&#8197;Da and MeOH permeance of &#8776;13&#8197;LMH/bar. Precise separation of small dye mixtures with similar M.W. based on both their charge and molecular size are achieved.

Abstract
PhI(OTf)2 and related ArI(OTf)2 species have been incorrectly invoked as intermediates in oxidation reactions for many years. We recently established that such compounds did not yet exist but remain an attractive target. Here we describe the synthesis, isolation, and structural characterization of NO2&#8208;PhI(OTf)2, which is resistant to decomposition and more reactive than PhI(OTf)(OAc), the species previously misidentified as PhI(OTf)2.

         <title>Perfectly Isotactic Polypropylene upon In Situ Activation of Ultrarigid meso Hafnocenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ activation, hafnocene meso&#8208;I yields isotactic polypropylene instead of atactic polypropylene of meso&#8208;I and rac&#8208;I. With our easy and convenient isomerization and polymerization protocol, productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers are accessible.







Abstract
For more than 40&#8197;years, the synthesis of C2&#8208;symmetric indenyl&#8208;based racemic metallocenes for the isoselective polymerization of propylene relied on a tedious separation of the produced rac and meso isomers. Status quo, latter are considered wasteful as they produce atactic polypropylene (aPP) rather than isotactic polypropylene (iPP) if activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO). Unexpectedly, the in situ activation of meso hafnocene I yielded perfectly isotactic polypropylene. We verified an isomerization of the meso compound to the corresponding racemic one upon triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) addition via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and established an easy and convenient polymerization protocol, enabling productivities comparable to pure rac&#8208;I if applied to pure meso&#8208;I or a mixture of both isomers. With this established isomerization protocol, the potential yield of iPP was enhanced by more than 400&#8201;%. This protocol was also shown to be applicable to other meso hafnocenes and some initial mechanistic insights were received.

         <title>Reversible Light&#8208;Controlled CO Adsorption via Tuning &#960;&#8208;Complexation of Cu+ Sites in Azobenzene&#8208;Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart adsorbents are fabricated by introducing Cu+ into azobenzene&#8208;decorated metal&#8208;organic frameworks, in which azobenzene acts as light&#8208;responsive motifs and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexing sites. Ultraviolet&#8208;/visible&#8208;light irradiation triggers the isomerization of azobenzene, causing the changes in electrostatic potential around Cu+. This exposure/shelter effect adjusts CO capture and release by shifting light.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive adsorbents capture significant attention due to their tailorable performance upon light irradiation. The modulation of such adsorbents is mainly based on weak (physical) interactions caused by steric hindrance while tuning strong interaction with target adsorbates is scarce. Here we report smart &#960;&#8208;complexation adsorbents, which can adjust the &#960;&#8208;complexation of active sites via light irradiation. A typical metal&#8208;organic framework, MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2, was decorated with azobenzene motifs, and Cu+ as &#960;&#8208;complexation active sites were introduced subsequently. The reversible light&#8208;induced isomerization of azobenzene regulates the surface electrostatic potentials around Cu+ from &#8722;0.038 to 0.008&#8197;eV, causing shielding and exposure effects. The alteration of CO uptake is achieved up to 54&#8201;% via changing light, while that on MIL&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 is negligible. This study provides a clue for designing target&#8208;specific smart materials to meet the practical stimuli&#8208;responsive adsorption demands.

&lt;p&gt;Smart adsorbents are fabricated by introducing Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into azobenzene-decorated metal-organic frameworks, in which azobenzene acts as light-responsive motifs and Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as &#960;-complexing sites. Ultraviolet-/visible-light irradiation triggers the isomerization of azobenzene, causing the changes in electrostatic potential around Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This exposure/shelter effect adjusts CO capture and release by shifting light.

         <title>Amorphous Aluminosilicate Nanosheets as Universal Precursors for the Synthesis of Diverse Zeolite Nanosheets for Polymer&#8208;Cracking Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method allows zeolite nanosheets (NSs) to be prepared from single&#8208;species amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs). The AAS&#8208;NSs were prepared by the two&#8208;dimensional reactor in amphiphilic phases (TRAP) method. Using this approach four zeolite types were prepared from single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs by the dry gel conversion (DGC) process with structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs).







Abstract
Zeolites catalyze some reactions in their molecular&#8208;sized pores, but large molecules can react only on their external surface. Zeolite&#8208;nanosheets (NSs) have been developed as catalysts for large molecules. The previously reported methods to synthesize zeolite&#8208;NSs are specialized for each zeolite type. Here we propose a new method to synthesize various zeolite&#8208;NSs from the same amorphous aluminosilicate NSs (AAS&#8208;NSs) as a universal precursor. We successfully synthesized the unprecedented AAS&#8208;NSs in the hydrophilic space of the stable hyperswollen lyotropic lamellar (HL) phase. The four zeolite types could be obtained from the single&#8208;species AAS&#8208;NSs. These results imply that this method enables us to synthesize almost all types of zeolite&#8208;NSs. Moreover, the synthesized CHA&#8208;NSs have great potential for various applications because of their thickness and large external surface area.

         <title>Sulfenofunctionalization of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Allylboronic Acids: Asymmetric Synthesis of SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Densely functionalized chiral allyl species, with an alkenyl CF3 group, were prepared with excellent selectivity by selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of allylboronic acids. The method can be used to access chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr compounds.







Abstract
We report herein a new method for the synthesis of densely functionalized chiral allyl SCF3, SCF2R, SCN and SAr species with a separate CF3 functionality. The synthetic approach is based on selenium&#8208;catalyzed sulfenofunctionalization of chiral &#945;&#8208;CF3 allylboronic acids. The reactions proceeded with remarkably high stereo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity, based on the formation of a stable thiiranium ion followed by rapid deborylative ring opening.

         <title>Synthesis and Physicochemical Properties of Cryptophazane&#8212;A Soluble and Functionalizable C1&#8208;Symmetrical Cryptophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryptophanes are molecular hosts of particular interest for the development of biosensors based on xenon magnetic resonance imaging as they bind xenon reversibly. To prepare such a biosensor, a reactive site on the cryptophane core, which is desirable for such applications but synthetically challenging, has now been introduced by replacing a crown methylene bridge by a nitrogen atom to form a cryptophazane.







Abstract
The first example of a cryptophazane, a cryptophane functionalized with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the methylene bridges, is obtained with a 28&#8201;% overall yield over 8 steps, through the preparation of a C1&#8208;symmetrical aza&#8208;cyclotriveratrylene (aza&#8208;CTV). Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of a nitrogen atom on this part of the cryptophane core enhances the solubility in organic media of both the cryptophane and the synthetic intermediates, while presenting the same conformation as known cryptophanes. Cryptophazane was prepared on a multigram scale and easily functionalized. We also investigated its ability to encapsulate xenon atoms using hyperpolarized 129Xe (HP 129Xe) NMR spectroscopy. We found that both its affinity and exchange kinetics were in the appropriate range for applications in 129Xe magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Combined with the wide range of possible functionalization, this makes cryptophazane an excellent candidate for targeted HP 129Xe MRI.

Black light irradiation of the simple combination of arene substrate, pyridine, acid (to generate a pyridinium acceptor in situ), and O2 (terminal oxidant) affords N&#8208;arylpyridinium products. This transformation proceeds without an exogenous photocatalyst, complementing prior photochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H amination methods.







Abstract
This report describes the development of a photochemical method for C(sp2)&#8722;H pyridination that leverages the photoexcitation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental and DFT studies show that black light (&#955;max&#8776;350&#8197;nm) irradiation of solutions of protonated pyridines (acceptors) and aromatic C&#8722;H substrates (donors) results in single electron transfer to form aryl radical cation intermediates that can be trapped with pyridine nucleophiles under aerobic conditions. With some modification of the reaction conditions, this EDA activation mode is also effective for promoting the oxidatively triggered SNAr pyridination of aryl halides. Overall, this report represents an inexpensive and atom&#8208;economical approach to photochemical pyridination reactions that eliminates the requirement of an exogenous photocatalyst.

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulation&#8208;Guided Design of a Thorium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient Radiotherapy&#8208;Radiodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After demonstrating the potential of Th&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (nMOF) as excellent radiosensitizer with Monte Carlo simulations, we designed Th&#8208;DBP nMOF with Th6 secondary building units and DBP photosensitizers for efficient radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy. Th&#8208;DBP greatly enhanced hydroxyl radical and 1O2 generation upon irradiation to kill cancer cells and regress colon and pancreatic cancers in mice models.







Abstract
High&#8208;Z metal&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) with photosensitizing ligands can enhance radiation damage to tumors via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy (RT&#8208;RDT) process. Here we report Monte Carlo (MC) simulation&#8208;guided design of a Th&#8208;based nMOF built from Th6&#8208;oxo secondary building units and 5,15&#8208;di(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (DBP) ligands, Th&#8208;DBP, for enhanced RT&#8208;RDT. MC simulations revealed that the Th&#8208;lattice outperformed the Hf&#8208;lattice in radiation dose enhancement owing to its higher mass attenuation coefficient. Upon X&#8208;ray or &#947;&#8208;ray radiation, Th&#8208;DBP enhanced energy deposition, generated more reactive oxygen species, and induced significantly higher cytotoxicity to cancer cells over the previously reported Hf&#8208;DBP nMOF. With low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, Th&#8208;DBP suppressed tumor growth by 88&#8201;% in a colon cancer and 97&#8201;% in a pancreatic cancer mouse model.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Gold&#8208;Gold Wettability for Programmable Plasmonic Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms. This oligo&#8208;A&#8208;based surface chemistry engineering method will enable controllable diffusion of adsorbed atoms on the nanoscopic surface to develop single&#8208;nanoparticle plasmonic devices for extreme nanophotonics and polariton chemistry.







Abstract
Controlling the deposition and diffusion of adsorbed atoms (adatoms) on the surface of a solid material is vital for engineering the shape and function of nanocrystals. Here, we report the use of single&#8208;stranded DNA (oligo&#8208;adenine, oligo&#8208;A) to encode the wettability of gold seeds by homogeneous gold adatoms to synthesize highly tunable plasmonic nanostructures. We find that the oligo&#8208;A attachment transforms the nanocrystal growth mode from the classical Frank&#8208;van der Merwe to the Volmer&#8208;Weber island growth. Finely tuning the oligo&#8208;A density can continuously change the gold&#8208;gold contact angle (&#952;) from 35.1&#177;3.6&#176; to 125.3&#177;8.0&#176;. We further demonstrate the versatility of this strategy for engineering nanoparticles with different curvature and dimensions. With this unconventional growth mode, we synthesize a sub&#8208;nanometer plasmonic cavity with a geometrical singularity when &#952;&gt;90&#176;. Superfocusing of light in this nanocavity produces a near&#8208;infrared intraparticle plasmonic coupling, which paves the way to surface engineering of single&#8208;particle plasmonic devices.

         <title>Spatial Well&#8208;defined Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers with Single&#8208;Layer Thickness for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites, and monolayer characteristic of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model oxygen evolution reaction catalysts can decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The experimental and density functional theory simulation shown that the relative position and local coordination environment has a significant effect on the cooperation between the metal centers.







Abstract
Innovative bimetallic materials provide more possibilities for further improving the performance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, it is still a great challenge to rationally design bimetallic catalysts because there is not a practical way to decouple the factors influencing the intrinsic activity of active sites from others, thus hindering in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism. Herein, we provide a rational design of bimetallic Ni, Co two&#8208;dimensional polymer model OER catalyst. The well&#8208;defined architecture, identical density of active sites and monolayer characteristic allow us to decouple the intrinsic activity of active sites from other factors. The results confirmed that the relative position and local coordination environment has significant effect on the synergistic effect of the bimetallic centres. The highest electrocatalytic activity with the turnover frequency value up to 26.19&#8197;s&#8722;1 was achieved at the overpotential of 500&#8197;mV.

         <title>Highly Selective Preparation and Depolymerization of Chemically Recyclable Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) Enabled by Organoboron Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first metal&#8208;free access to poly(cyclopentene carbonate) and its chemical recycling to monomer were achieved by using a dinuclear bifunctional organoboron catalyst, enriching the portfolio of the circular plastic economy.







Abstract
Poly(cyclopentene carbonate) (PCPC) produced by copolymerization of CO2 and cyclopentene oxide (CPO) is a promising but challenging chemical recyclable polymer that has high potential in minimizing plastic pollution and maximizing CO2 utilization. Currently, problems remain to be solved, include low reactivity of toxic metal catalysts, inevitable byproducts, and especially the ambiguous mechanism understanding. Herein, we present the first metal&#8208;free access to PCPC by using a series of modular dinuclear organoboron catalysts. PCPC was afforded in an unprecedented catalytic efficiency of 1.0&#8197;kg of PCPC/g of catalyst; while the depolymerization of PCPC abides by a combination pathway of random chain scission and chain unzipping, returning CPO in near&#8208;quantitative yield (&gt;99&#8201;%). The preparation and depolymerization of PCPC along with in depth understanding of related mechanisms would be helpful for further development of advanced catalysts and recyclable plastics.

         <title>Deracemization through Sequential Photoredox&#8208;Neutral and Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic deracemization is an ideal synthetic strategy due to its formally perfect atom utilization. Asymmetric photocatalysis has been appreciated as a promising tool to accomplish this attractive reaction pattern in an economical fashion, but it remains underdeveloped. Here, we report a new platform based on photoredox&#8208;neutral catalysis, allowing efficient and modular optical enrichment of &#945;&#8208;amino esters and other valuable analogues. Two single&#8208;electron transfer processes between the photocatalyst and the substrates serve to provide the key prochiral intermediates, and the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst mediates enantioselective protonation to reconstitute a stereogenic C&#8210;H bond. The efficiency of deracemization is determined by the enantiofacial differentiation effect during the stereocentre&#8208;forming step.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Free Radical RAFT Polymerization of Methacrylates in Homogeneous Solution: Design of exo&#8208;Olefin Chain&#8208;Transfer Agents (R&#8211;CH2C(=CH2)Z)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the development of  exo  &#8208;olefin compounds (R&#8211;CH  2  C(=CH  2  )Z) as chain&#8208;transfer agents for the sulfur&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) radical polymerization of methacrylates in homogeneous solution is described. A series of  exo  &#8208;olefin compounds with a methyl methacrylate (MMA) dimer structure as the R group and a substituted &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene unit as the &#8211;CH  2  C(=CH  2  )Z (Z: Ph&#8208;Y) group were synthesized and used for the radical polymerization of MMA in toluene and PhC(CF  3  )  2  OH. The  exo  &#8208;olefin compounds worked as RAFT agents, which underwent transfer of the CH  2  C(=CH  2  )Z group via addition&#8208;fragmentation of the propagating methacryloyl radical. Substituents that were more electron&#8208;donating (Y), such as methoxy and dimethylamino groups, performed better to produce polymers with narrower molecular weight distributions. A continuous monomer addition method further improved molecular weight control and enabled the synthesis of colorless, sulfur&#8208;free, multiblock copolymers of methacrylates in homogenous solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Isotropic Anhydrous Superprotonic Conductivity Cooperated with Installed Imidazolium Molecular Motions in a 3D Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Phosphate Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing molecular motion is essential for the use of anhydrous superprotonic molecular proton conductors (&#963; beyond&#160;10  &#8722;4&#160;&#160;S/cm) as electrolytes in hydrogen fuel cells. However, molecular motion contributing to the improvement of intrinsic proton conduction has been limited and little clarified in relation to the proton conduction mechanism, limiting the development of material design guidelines. Here, a salt with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) phosphate network with imidazolium cations installed inside was studied, whose components are known to exhibit molecular motions that contribute to proton conduction. Despite its anisotropic H&#8208;bonded network, the salt exhibits isotropic anhydrous superprotonic conductivity exceeding&#160;10&#160;&#8722;3&#160;&#160;S/cm at ~351 K, which is the first example for organic molecular crystal. Variable&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray structural analysis and solid&#8208;state  2  H NMR measurements revealed significant 3D molecular motion of imidazolium cations, which accelerate proton conduction via the 3D H&#8208;bonded phosphate network.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Toxicity ZnSe/ZnS Quantum Dots as Potent Photoreductants and Triplet Sensitizers for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can photocatalyze diverse organic reactions. However, reported QD&#8208;photocatalysts often contain highly&#8208;toxic elements Cd or Pb, and have not surpassed prototypical transition&#8208;metal complexes in terms of their photoredox power or excited&#8208;state energy. Here we report low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe/ZnS core/shell QDs as potent visible photocatalysts to drive challenging organic transformations. To overcome the limitation of short excited&#8208;state lifetime of the QDs, we functionalize their surfaces with benzophenone ligands which can rapidly extract electrons from photoexcited QDs and sustain long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states. The benzophenone anions function as potent electron relay to drive dehalogenation of aryl chlorides and additive&#8208;free polymerization of acrylates. Alternatively, the QDs are functionalized with biphenyl ligands to store energy in long&#8208;lived, energetic triplets, enabling [2+2] homo&#8208;cycloaddition of styrene and cycloaddition of carbonyls with alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemistry Controls Dihydrogen Bonding Strengths in Chiral Amine Boranes Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing interest in exploiting novel concepts of non&#8208;covalent interactions in catalysts and supramolecular chemistry made us revisit a special kind of hydrogen bonding: the dihydrogen bond (DHB), formed between a classical hydrogen bond donor and a hydridic hydrogen as acceptor. Herein, we investigate how the strength of the N&#8208;H  &#948;+  &#8729;&#8729;  &#948;&#8208;  H&#8208;B interaction and hence the DHB&#8208;driven self&#8208;aggregation of amine&#8208;borane adducts is governed by steric effects by comparing the structures and binding enthalpies of various chiral derivatives. For a diastereomeric pair of amine&#8208;boranes prepared from a chiral secondary amine, we show that the stereochemistry at the nitrogen has significant influence on the interaction enthalpy. Based on this finding, N&#8208;chiral amine boranes can be envisioned to become interesting building blocks in supramolecular chemistry to fine&#8208;tune the formation dynamics of assemblies.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Broadband rotational spectroscopy is used to investigate the geometries of 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol and its complexes with up to six water molecules, which are produced in supersonic jets. The main low&#8208;energy isomers of these clusters are unambiguously identified in the spectra with the support of quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The conformation of the 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;3&#8208;oxetanemethanol geometry is found to be influenced by the microsolvation effects. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrangements in the hydrate complexes, which are governed by the water&#8208;water and water&#8208;solute interactions, exhibit characteristic configurations with increasing number of water molecules and resemble the main isomers of the corresponding pure water clusters. Evolution of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding structures from one&#8208;dimensional chains to two&#8208;dimensional rings and further to multicyclic three&#8208;dimensional networks is observed, which provides information about the build&#8208;up process.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple Roles of Alkanethiolate&#8208;Ligands in Direct Formation of H2O2 over Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coadsorbed organic species including thiolates can promote direct synthesis of hy&#8208; drogen peroxide from H2 and O2 over Pd particles. Here, density functional theory based kinetic modeling, augmented with activity measurements and vibrational spec&#8208; troscopy are used to provide atomistic understanding of direct H2O2 formation over alkylthiolate(RS) Pd. We find that the RS species are oxidized during reaction condi&#8208; tions yielding RSO2 as the effective ligand. The RSO2 ligand shows superior ability for proton transfer to the intermediate surface species OOH, which accelerates the forma&#8208; tion of H2O2. The ligands promote the selectivity also by blocking sites for unselective water formation and by modifying the electronic structure of Pd. The work rationalizes observations of enhanced selectivity of direct H2O2 formation over ligand&#8208;funtionalized Pd nanoparticles and shows that engineering of organic surface modifiers can be used to promote desired hydrogen transfer routes.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Drives Part of the Reverse Krebs Cycle under Metal or Meteorite Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen (H2) is a geological source of reducing electrons that is thought to have powered the metabolism of the last universal common ancestor to all extant life and that is still metabolized by various modern organisms. It has been suggested that H2 drove a geochemical analogue of some or all of the reverse Krebs cycle at the origin of the metabolic network, catalyzed by metals, but this has yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Here, we show that three consecutive steps of the reverse Krebs cycle, converting oxaloacetate to succinate, can be driven without enzymes and in one&#8208;pot by H2 as the reducing agent under mild conditions compatible with biological chemistry. Low catalytic amounts of nickel (10&#8722;20 mol%) or platinum group metals (0.1&#8722;1 mol%) or even small amounts of ground meteorites are found to promote the reductive chemistry at temperatures between 5 and 60 &#176;C and over a wide pH range, including pH 7. These results lend additional support to the hypothesis that geologically produced hydrogen and metal catalysts could have initiated early biochemical networks.</dc:description>

         <title>A vitamin B2&#8208;photocatalysed approach to methionine analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Access to new non&#8208;canonical amino acid residues is crucial for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology. Analogues of the amino acid methionine have been far less explored &#8211; despite their use in biochemistry, pharmacology and peptide bioconjugation. This is largely due to limited synthetic access. Herein, we exploit a new disconnection to access non&#8208;natural methionines through the development of a photochemical method for the radical &#945; C&#8211;H functionalization of sulfides with alkenes, in water, using inexpensive and commercially&#8208;available riboflavin (vitamin B2)as a photocatalyst. Our photochemical conditions allow the two&#8208;step synthesis of novel methionine analogues &#8211; by radical addition to unsaturated amino acid derivatives &#8211; and the chemoselective modification of peptide side&#8208;chains to yield non&#8208;natural methionine residues within small peptides. The mechanism of the bio&#8208;inspired flavin photocatalysis has been probed by experimental, DFT and TDDFT studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated and Concerted Aza&#8208;Michael Addition and SuFEx Reaction in Microdroplets in Unitary and High&#8208;Throughput Formats</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) reaction is significant in drug discovery, materials science, and chemical biology. Conventionally, it involves installation of SO  2  F followed by fluoride exchange using a catalyst. We report catalyst&#8208;free Aza&#8208;Michael addition to install SO  2  F and SuFEx reaction with amines, both reactions occurring in a concerted fashion in electrosprayed microdroplets under ambient conditions. The microdroplet reaction is accelerated by a factor of ~10  4  relative to the corresponding bulk reaction. We suggest that the superacidic microdroplet surface assists SuFEx reaction by protonating fluorine and creating a good leaving group. The reaction scope was established by individual reactions in electrosprayed microdroplets of 18 amines in four solvents and confirmed using high&#8208;throughput desorption electrospray ionization screening. The study demonstrates the value of microdroplet&#8208;assisted accelerated reactions in combination with high&#8208;throughput screening for characterization of reaction scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Nitrogen&#8208;doped Graphene Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts in Acidic Electrolytes using Hydrophobic Cavities and Proton&#8208;conductive Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although pyridinic&#8208;nitrogen (pyri&#8208;N) doped graphene is highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of fuel cells in alkaline media, the activity critically decreases under acidic conditions. We report on how to prevent the deactivation based on the mechanistic understanding that O2+pyri&#8208;NH++e&#8208;&#160;&#8594; O2a+pyri&#8208;NH governs the ORR kinetics. First, we considered that the deactivation is due to the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+, leading to a lower shift of the redox potential. Introducing the hydrophobic cavity prevented the hydration of pyri&#8208;NH+ but inhibited the proton transport. We then increased proton conductivity in the hydrophobic cavity by introducing SiO2 particles coated with ionic liquid polymer/Nafion&#174; which kept the high onset potentials with an increased current density even in acidic media.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Catalytic Covalent Organic Frameworks with Redox&#8208;Active Sites for the Oxygen Reduction and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Construction of catalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. In this work, we have first constructed bifunctional COFs towards ORR and OER by integrating diarylamine derivatives into the Co&#8208;porphyrin based frameworks. Both of the new COFs (CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF and CoTAPP&#8208;BDTA&#8208;COF) have good ordered structures, high surface areas, and robust chemical stability. The diarylamine units, as a typical electron donor and redox&#8208;active cores, promote intramolecular electron transport along the frameworks and improve the electrochemically active surface areas. Thus, the COFs showed higher catalytic activities than that of the COF without redox&#8208;active units. CoTAPP&#8208;PATA&#8208;COF had a halfwave potential of 0.80 V towards ORR, and delieved an overpotential of 420 mV for OER in 0.1 M KOH. The theoretical calculation revealed introducing diarylamine unites improved the oxygen electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cation Concentration Gradient Approach to Tune the Selectivity and Activity of CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The linear scaling relationship of the binding energies of different intermediates limits the catalyst performance in CO  2  electroreduction. Here we demonstrate a cation concentration gradient strategy to promote the activity and tune the selectivity of CO  2  electroreduction, thereby breaking the scaling relationship. In optimal concentrations of the potassium acetate (KAc) electrolyte, Cu, Ag and In catalysts deliver current densities that are 7.1, 3.2, 2.7 times higher than those obtained in 0.5 M KAc for C  2  H  4  , CO, and formate production, respectively. Increasing the concentration of KAc also changes the selectivity from CO to formate on Ag, and from CO to C  2  products on Cu.  In situ  surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy and computational simulations reveal that the binding energies of intermediates are changed at different electrolyte concentrations, which is due to a local electrostatic interaction modulated by potassium cations at the electrode surface.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes have several advantages over conventional catalysts for organic synthesis. Over the last two decades, much effort has been made to further extend the scope of biocatalytic reactions available to synthetic chemists, particularly by expanding the repertoire of enzymes for abiological transformations. In this regard, exciting new developments in the area of photobiocatalysis enable now the introduction of non&#8208;natural reactivity in enzymes to solve long&#8208;standing synthetic challenges. A recently described example from the Hyster group demonstrates in an unprecedented way how the combination of photochemistry with enzyme catalysis empowers the catalytic asymmetric construction of Csp  3&#8211;Csp  3  bonds with high chemo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancement of Electrochemical Thermoelectric Conversion with Molecular Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermocells are a thermoelectric conversion technology that utilizes the shift in electrochemical equilibrium due to a temperature difference. This technology has a long history; however, its low conversion efficiency impedes its practical usage. Recently, an increasing number of reports have shown drastic improvements in thermoelectric conversion efficiency, and thermocells could arguably represent an alternative to solid thermoelectric devices. In this review article, we regard thermocells as molecular systems consisting of successive molecular processes responding to a temperature change to achieve energy generation. Various molecular technologies have been applied to thermocells in recent years, and could stimulate diverse research fields including supramolecular chemistry, physical chemistry, electrochemistry, and solid&#8208;state ionics. These research approaches will also provide novel methods for achieving a sustainable society in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Designing of MnO2 Half&#8208;Wrapped by Aromatic Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the excellent specific capacity and high working voltage, manganese oxide (MnO  2  ) has attracted considerable attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the irreversible structural collapse and sluggish ionic diffusion lead to poor rate capability and inferior lifespan. Herein, we proposed a novel organic/inorganic hybrid cathode of carbon&#8208;based poly(4,4'&#8208;oxybisbenzenamine)/MnO  2  (denoted as C@PODA/MnO  2  ) for AZIBs. Various in/ex&#8208;situ analyses and theoretical calculations prove that PODA chains with C=N groups can provide a more active surface/interface for ion/electron mobility and zinc ion storage in the hybrid cathode. More importantly, newly formed Mn&#8208;N interfacial bonds can effectively promote ion diffusion and prevent Mn atoms dissolution, enhancing redox kinetics and structural integrity of MnO  2  . Accordingly, C@PODA/MnO  2  cathode exhibits high capacity (321 mAh g  &#8722;1  or 1.7 mAh cm  &#8722;2  at 0.1 A g  &#8722;1  ), superior rate performance (88 mAh g  &#8722;1  at 10 A g  &#8722;1  ) and excellent cycling stability over 2000 cycles. Hence, rational interfacial designs shed light on the development of organic/inorganic cathodes for advanced AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Scaffold Rearrangement in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons Driven by Concerted Action of Single Gold Atoms on a Gold Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical transformation of polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules following different reaction strategies has always been the focus of organic synthesis. In this work, we report the synthesis of a PAH molecule, formation of which consist of an unusual C&#8208;C bond cleavage accompanied by a complex &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecular scaffold rearrangement. We demonstrate that the complex chemical transformation is steered by concerted motion of individual Au(0) gold atoms on supporting Au(111) surface. This observation underpins the importance of single atom catalysis mediated by adatoms in on&#8208;surface synthesis as well as catalytic activity of single Au(0) atoms facilitating cleavage of covalent carbon bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Formal Cycloadditions Driven by the Homolytic Opening of Strained, Saturated Ring Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of strain&#8208;driven, radical formal cycloadditions is experiencing a surge in activity motivated by a renaissance in free radical chemistry and growing demand for sp  3  &#8208;rich ring systems. The former has been driven in large part by the rise of photoredox catalysis, and the latter by adoption of the &#8220;Escape from Flatland&#8221; concept in medicinal chemistry. In the years since these broader trends emerged, dozens of formal cycloadditions, including catalytic, asymmetric variants, have been developed that operate via radical mechanisms. While cyclopropanes have been studied most extensively, a variety of strained ring systems are amenable to the design of analogous reactions. Many of these processes generate lucrative, functionally decorated sp  3  &#8208;rich ring systems that are difficult to access by other means. Herein, we summarize recent efforts in this area and analyze the state of the field.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sensitive and Nonoptical CRISPR Detection Mechanism by Sizing Double&#8208;Stranded &#955; DNA Reporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CRISPR&#8208;based biosensors often rely on colorimetric, fluorescent, or electrochemical signaling mechanism, which involves expensive reporters&#160; and/or sophisticated equipment. Here, we demonstrated a simple, inexpensive, nonoptical, and sensitive CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a&#8208;based sensing platform to detect ssDNA targets by sizing double&#8208;stranded &#955; DNA as novel report molecules. In this platform, the size reduction of &#955; DNA was quantified by gel electrophoresis analysis. We hypothesize that the massive trans&#8208;nuclease activity of Cas12a toward &#955; DNA is due to the presence of single&#8208;stranded looped structures along the &#955; DNA sequence. In addition, we observed a strong binding affinity between Cas12a and &#955; DNA, which further promotes the trans&#8208;cleavage activity and helps achieve sub&#8208;picomolar detection sensitivity, ~100 times more sensitive than the fluorescent counterpart.&#160;The concept of utilizing the physical size change of &#955; DNA unlocks the possibility of using a variety of dsDNA as CRISPR reporters.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The production of conjugated C4&#8208;C5 dienes from biomass can enable the sustainable synthesis of many important polymers and liquid fuels. Here, we report the first example of bimetallic (Nb, Al)&#8208;atomically doped mesoporous silica, denoted as AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41, which affords quantitative conversion of 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MTHF) to pentadienes with a high selectivity of 91%. The incorporation of Al(III) and Nb(V) sites into the framework of AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41 has effectively tuned the nature and distribution of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acid sites within the structure. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption, diffuse reflectance infrared and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy collectively reveal the molecular mechanism of the conversion of adsorbed 2&#8208;MTHF over AlNb&#8208;MCM&#8208;41. Specifically, the atomically&#8208;dispersed Nb(V) sites play an important role in binding 2&#8208;MTHF to drive the conversion. Overall, this study highlights the potential of hetero&#8208;atomic mesoporous solids for the manufacture of renewable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Phase Stability and Inherent Bandgap of Formamidinium Lead Triiodide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the intrinsic phase stability and inherent bandgap of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskites is crucial to further improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we explored the &#945;&#8208; to &#948;&#8208;phase transition and bandgap of FAPbI3 single crystals grown by an inverse temperature solubility method. We found that the residual &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone solvents in the inner empty space of the FAPbI3 single crystal accelerate the phase transition at kinetics. By adopting 2&#8208;methoxyethanol as the solvent, over 2,000 h of stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 crystals could be acquired. This proves that although FAPbI3 is regarded as unstable at thermodynamics, it could own excellent kinetic stability without any doping or additives because of the slow solid to solid phase transition instead of the fast phase transition assisted by the solvents. Furthermore, we revealed that the bulk FAPbI3 single crystal with a size above 100 &#956;m can have an inherent bandgap of 1.41 eV. Thus, our work provides key scientific guidance for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3&#8208;based PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Light, Heat and Electricity Integrated Energy Conversion System: Photothermal&#8208;assisted Co&#8208;electrolysis of CO2 and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strategy that can design powerful photothermal&#8208;catalysts to achieve photothermal&#8208;effect assisted coupling&#8208;catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO  2  electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (Ni&#8208;2CBpy  2+  &#8208;COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal&#8208;assisted co&#8208;electrolysis of CO  2  and methanol. Specifically, the FE  CO  (cathode) and FE  HCOOH  (anode) for Ni&#8208;2CBpy  2+  &#8208;COF can reach up to ~100% at 1.9 V with ~31.5% saved overall electricity&#8208;consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni&#8208;2CBpy  2+  &#8208;COF that enhance the photothermal effect (&#916;  T  = 49.1 &#176;C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Acceleration of Cathode Interfacial Kinetics by Liquid Organosulfides in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Great efforts have been made to tackle the issues of the shuttle effect and kinetics hysteresis in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery, but few on tuning the reaction path of sulfur cathode. Herein, we report a strategy to replace inorganic sulfur with liquid organosulfide and construct a novel liquid&#8208;liquid interface between cathode and electrolyte, which effectively inhibits the shuttle effect and simplifies the solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid conversion reaction to only liquid&#8208;solid process, thus greatly improving the reaction kinetics. The Li|PTS half&#8208;cell exhibits excellent cycling stability at 0.5 C, with a capacity retention of 64.9% after 750 cycles. The Li|PTS pouch cell with a high PTS loading of 3.1 g delivers a maximum capacity of 997 mAh and maintains 82.1% of initial capacity after 50 cycles at the current of 100 mA. This work enriches the reaction mechanism of Li&#8208;S batteries and provides new insights for the development of interphase chemistry in the design of cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Subporphyrin Free Base</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B(III) subporphyrins are the legitimate ring&#8208;contracted porphyrins consisting of three pyrroles and three meso&#8208;carbons and their chemistry has been extensively developed since the first synthesis in 2006. However, subporphyrin free bases have never been synthesized, despite tremendous attempts to remove B(III) ion. Here we report that Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling between &#945;,&#945;&#8217;&#8208;diborylated tripyrrane 1 and tetrabromide 5 gave subporphyrin free bases 6, 6A, and free base dimer 7 in 6%, 4%, and 2% yields as the first example. Subporphyrin free bases exhibit curved bowl&#8208;like structures and distinct 14&#960;&#8208;aromaticity. The steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies revealed that the excited&#8208;state behaviors of the subporphyrin free bases are comparable with those of the corresponding B(III) subporphyrins. Rotational relaxation processes in the excited states have been revealed, which enhance the electronic interactions with the meso&#8208;aryl substituents and between the two subporphyrins.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Denitrogenative Annulation to Access High&#8208;Valued N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The N&#8208;heterocycles are found in many therapeutics and bioactive natural products. To access those high&#8208;valued N&#8208;heterocycles, many methods have been developed. In this context, metal&#8208;catalyzed denitrogenative annulation of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles has appeared as a powerful synthetic tool because it offers step and atom economical route for the preparation of the nitrogen&#8208;rich molecules. Compared with the denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazole frameworks, annulation of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazole remains more challenging due to the inertness of the tetrazole moiety. This review aims to summarize the significant achievement made in the field of denitrogenative annulation of various 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles and 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrazoles including pioneering examples. We anticipated that this denitrogenative annulation reactions will find broad applications in pharmaceutical industries, drug discovery and other fields of medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>NaCdSb: An Orthorhombic Zintl Phase with Exceptional Intrinsic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many Zintl phases are promising thermoelectric materials owning to their features like narrow bandgaps, multiband behaviors, ideal charge transport tunnels, and loosely bound cations. Herein we show a new Zintl phase NaCdSb with exceptional intrinsic thermoelectric performance. Pristine NaCdSb exhibits semiconductor behaviors with an experimental hole concentration of 2.9 &#215; 1018 cm&#8208;3 and a calculated bandgap of 0.5 eV. As the temperature increases, the hole concentration rises gradually and approaches its optimal one, leading to a high power factor of 11.56 &#956;W cm&#8208;1 K&#8208;2 at 673 K. The ultralow thermal conductivity is derived from the small phonon group velocity and short phonon lifetime, ascribed to the structural anharmonicity of Cd&#8208;Sb bonds. As a consequence, a maximum zT of 1.3 at 673 K has been achieved without any doping optimization or structural modification, demonstrating that NaCdSb is a remarkable thermoelectric compound with great potential for performance improvement.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Homologation of Carbonyl Compounds for Iterative Syntheses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a photo&#8208;induced reaction for the in situ generation of highly reactive alkyl diazo compounds from carbonyl precursors via photo&#8208;excitation of N&#8208;tosylhydrazone anions. The diazo intermediates undergo efficient C&#8211;H insertion of aldehydes, leading to the productive synthesis of aldehydes and ketones. The method is applicable to the iterative synthesis of densely functionalized carbonyl compounds through sequential trapping of the diazo species with various aldehydes. The reaction proceeds without the need of any catalyst by light irradiation and features high functional group tolerance. More than 70 examples, some performed on a gram&#8208;scale, demonstrate the broad applicability of this reaction sequence in synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation to rotate a chemically fueled molecular switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here the development of a rotating molecular switch based on metal&#8208;catalyzed reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation. Under an argon atmosphere, acceptorless dehydrogenation induces a switch from an alcohol to a ketone, while reversing to a hydrogen pressure switches back the system to the alcohol. Based on a tolane scaffold, such reversible (de)&#8208;hydrogenation enables 180&#176; rotation. The absence of waste accumulation in a switch relying on chemical stimuli is of great significance and could potentially be applied to the design of efficient complex molecular machines.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Iteration Controls the Assembly of the Nonanoic Acid Side Chain of the Antibiotic Mupirocin.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mupirocin is a clinically important antibiotic produced by&#160;Pseudomonas fluorescens&#160;NCIMB 10586 that is assembled by a complex&#160;trans&#8208;AT polyketide synthase. The polyketide fragment, monic acid, is esterified by a 9&#8208;hydroxynonanoic acid (9HN) side&#8208;chain which is essential for biological activity.&#160;&#160;&#160;The ester side&#8208;chain assembly is initialised from a 3&#8208;hydroxypropionate (3HP) starter unit attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) MacpD, but the fate of this species is unknown. Here we report the application of NMR, mass spectrometry, chemical probes and&#160;in vitro&#160;assays to establish the remaining steps of 9HN biosynthesis. These investigations reveal a complex interplay between a novel iterative or &#8216;stuttering&#8217; KS&#8208;AT didomain (MmpF), the multi&#8208;domain module MmpB and multiple ACPs. This work has important implications for understanding the late&#8208;stage biosynthetic steps of mupirocin and will be important for future engineering of related&#160;trans&#8208;AT biosynthetic pathways (eg thiomarinol).</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Modular Access to Vinyl Cyclopropanes Enabled by Air&#8208;stable Palladium(I) Dimer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While vinyl cyclopropanes are valuable functional groups in drugs or natural products as well as established precursors to trigger a rich variety of synthetic transformations, their reactive nature makes their installation via direct catalytic approaches challenging. We herein present the first general and modular access to (di)vinyl cyclopropanes under full conservation of stereochemistry, allowing access to the cis or trans cyclopropane&#8208; as well as E or Z vinyl&#8208;stereochemical relationships in a fully selective manner, even for richly substituted cyclopropanes, for which typical Pd(0) catalysis protocols fail to trigger any coupling whatsoever. Our protocol relies on air&#8208;stable dinuclear Pd(I) catalysis, which enables rapid (&lt; 30 min reaction time) and selective access to a diverse range of vinyl cyclopropane motifs at room temperature, even on gram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced CO2 Photoreduction through Spontaneous Charge Separation in&#160;End&#8208;Capping Assembly of Heterostructured Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well known that charge separation is crucial for efficient photocatalytic solar conversion. Although some covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit visible&#8208;light harvest, the large exciton binding energies reduce their photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we developed a novel method to post treat the olefin&#8208;linked COFs with end&#8208;capping polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for spontaneous charge separation. Interestingly, a type&#8208;II heterostructure is constructed in our perylene modified COFs which displays drastically enhanced performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with an efficiency of 8&#8208;fold higher than that of unmodified COF. A combination of electrochemical, steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicates that such drastically enhanced performance should be attributed to photoinduced spontaneous charge separation in the heterostructure. These results illustrate the feasibility of engineering the charge&#8208;separation properties of crystalline porous frameworks at a molecular level for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Sensitive and Reversible Labeling Strategy Enables Global Mapping of the Core&#8208;Fucosylated Glycoproteome on Cell Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Core fucosylation, the attachment of &#945;1,6&#8208;fucose to the innermost N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue of  N  &#8208;glycans, has a strong relationship with tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, prognosis, and immune evasion by regulating many membrane proteins. However, details about the functional mechanism are still largely unknown due to the lack of an effective analytical method to identify cell&#8208;surface core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins, and especially glycosylation sites. Here, we developed a sensitive and reversible labeling strategy for probing core fucosylation, by which core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins that located on cell&#8208;surface were selectively tagged by a biotinylated probe with high sensitivity. The labeled probe can be further broken enzymatically after the capture by affinity resin. The on&#8208;bead traceless cleavage allowed the global mapping of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteins and glycosylation sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The profile of core&#8208;fucosylated glycoproteome provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the biological functions of core fucosylation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A direct spirocyclization approach for the chemical synthesis of spiro[cyclohexane&#8208;2&#8208;indoline] alkaloids was reported. The absolute stereochemistry was introduced by a desymmetrizing Dieckmann condensation, and the relative stereochemistry was controlled by the manipulation of the kinetic and thermodynamic pathways of the spirocyclization. By contrast to the biogenetic proposal involving the diester&#8208;type alkaloid as the precursor, we demonstrated that chemically a common lactone&#8208;type intermediate could bridge the chemical synthesis of this class of natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>General Access to N&#8208;CF3 Secondary Amines and Their Transformation to N&#8208;CF3 Sulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of  N  &#8208;CF  3  compounds through fluorination or trifluoromethylation of  N  &#8208;containing compounds has been extensively investigated. However, general access to  N  &#8208;CF  3  compounds simply from  N  &#8208;CF  3  secondary amines is hampered by the challenging preparation and instability of these amines, as well as a much lower reactivity due to the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing nature and steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl moiety. Herein, we report a general and highly efficient synthesis of  N  &#8208;CF  3  secondary amines with excellent isolated yields  via  the addition of the  in situ  generated difluoromethyl imine (R&#8208;N=CF  2  ) intermediates with hydrogen fluoride, which is mildly produced by triethylsilane and silver fluoride.  N  &#8208;CF  3  sulfonamides, highly desirable but scarce at present, are easily accessible from these valuable building blocks through an unprecedented route. This study will bring new vitality to the synthesis of  N  &#8208;CF  3&#160;  compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Assembling Phenothiazine into a Porous Coordination Cage to Improve Its Photocatalytic Efficiency for Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;catalysis by small&#8208;molecules is often limited by catalyst degradation and low electron&#8208;transfer efficiency. Herein we report a stable N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;phenothiazine (PTH)&#8208;derived porous coordination cage (PCC) as a highly efficient photocatalyst. By the incorporation of the photocatalytic PTH moiety into a PCC, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching (AIQ) was shown to be reduced. An improvement in catalyst stability was discovered, ascribed to the synergistic effects of the PTH moieties. The catalyst, operating through a photolytic single&#8208;electron transfer, was utilized for photo&#8208;catalyzed dehalogenation and borylation. Evaluation of the catalytic mechanism in the borylation reaction showed that the improved performance results from the more efficient formation of the electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex with the cage. This discovery provides a potential strategy to improve the photophysical properties and stabilities of small&#8208;molecule organic photocatalysts via supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in the Presence of Impurities: Influences and Mitigation Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of waste CO  2  into useful fuels and chemical products is a promising approach to reduce CO  2  emissions; however, several challenges still remain to be addressed. Thus far, most CO  2  reduction studies use pure CO  2  as the gas reactant, but CO  2  emissions typically contain a number of gas impurities such as nitrogen oxides, oxygen gas, and sulfur oxides. Gas impurities in CO  2  can pose a significant obstacle for efficient CO  2  electrolysis because they can influence the reaction and catalyst. This Minireview highlights early examples of CO  2  reduction studies using mixed gas feeds, explores strategies to sustain CO  2  reduction in the presence of gas impurities, and discusses their implications for future progress in this emerging field.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorine&#8208;18 Labeling of Difluoromethyl and Trifluoromethyl Groups via Monoselective C&#8211;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a general method for the labeling of both CF&#173;3 and CF2H groups in a broad range of chemical settings (aryl, oxide, sulfide). The method utilizes frustrated Lewis pair mediated selective C&#8211;F activation to formally substitute fluorine&#8208;19 with fluorine&#8208;18 in a two&#8208;step defluorination/radiofluorination process, and as such can utilize the target compounds as starting materials. The radiotracer precursors can be isolated as stable salts prior to radiofluorination. The method delivers good radiochemical yields and molar activities (up to 35.2&#177;6.5% non&#8208;decay corrected isolated activity yields and 12.0&#177;1.7 GBq &#956;mol&#8208;1 molar activities) and is shown to be applicable to biologically relevant compounds. The ability to utilize the target compound as the starting material and the synthetic simplicity of the method coupled with the ever&#8208;increasing use of CF3 and CF2H groups in pharmaceuticals makes this method attractive for drug and radiotracer development.</dc:description>
