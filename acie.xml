      <title>Emphasis on the properties of metal&#8208;containing zeolites operating outside the comfort zone of current heterogeneous catalytic reactions</title>
      <dc:description>The development of catalysts that can operate under exceptionally harsh and unconventional conditions is of critical importance for the transition of the energy and chemicals industries to low&#8208;emission and renewable chemical feedstocks. In this review we will highlight materials and more specifically metal&#8208;containing zeolite catalysts that have been tested under harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature light alkane conversion and biomass valorization. Particular attention will be given to studies that explore the stability and recyclability of metal&#8208;containing zeolite catalysts operating in continuous modes. Metal&#8208;containing zeolites are considered as an important class of catalysts operating outside the comfort zone of current heterogeneous catalytic reactions in both gas and liquid phase reactions.

      <title>From  Glucose to Polymers&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;A Continuous Chemoenzymatic Process</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:    Aiming for sustainable development, the syntheses of degradable polymers from renewable resources are highly encouraging. Unfortunately, such efforts are deterred by technical and economic challenges; especially, the conversion of natural building blocks to polymerizable monomers is inefficient, requiring multistep synthesis and chromatographic purification. Herein we report a chemoenzymatic process to address these challenges. In this work, a novel enzymatic reaction system was designed, which allowed for regioselective functional group transformation efficiently, converting glucose to a polymerizable monomer in quantitative yield, thus removing the need for chromatographic purification. With this key success, we further designed a continuous, 3&#8208;step process, which enabled the synthesis of a sugar polymer [sugar poly(orthoester)] directly from glucose in high yield (73% from glucose). The work reported here may provide a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in developing technically and economically viable approaches to address the many issues associated with current petroleum&#8208;based polymers.</dc:description>

      <title>CO2&#8208;Folded Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles as Recyclable, Intensified Carboxylase Mimics</title>
      <dc:description>Emulating the function of natural carboxylases to convert CO2 under atmospheric condition is a grand challenge. Here we report a class of CO2&#8208;folded single&#8208;chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) that can function as recyclable, function&#8208;intensified carboxylase mimics. Using Lewis pair polymer containing bulky Lewis acidic and basic groups as the precursor, it can bind CO2 to drive an intramolecular folding into SCNP, in which CO2 as the folded nodes can form gas&#8208;bridged bonds. Such bridging linkages highly activate CO2, which endows the SCNPs with extraordinary catalytic ability that can not only catalyze CO2&#8208;insertion of C(sp3)&#9472;H for imitating natural enzyme's function, and also act on non&#8208;natural carboxylation pathways for C(sp2 and sp)&#9472;H substrates. The nanocatalysts are of highly catalytic efficiency and recyclability, and can work at room temperature and near ambient CO2 condition, inspiring a new vista on sustainable C1 utilization.</dc:description>

      <title>A Paramagnetic NMR Spectroscopy Toolbox for the Characterisation of Paramagnetic/Spin&#8208;Crossover Coordination Complexes and Metal&#8208;Organic Cages</title>
      <dc:description>The large paramagnetic shifts and short relaxation times resulting from the presence of a paramagnetic centre complicate NMR data acquisition and interpretation in solution. As a result, NMR analysis of paramagnetic complexes is limited in comparison to diamagnetic compounds and often relies on theoretical models. We report a toolbox of 1D (  1  H, proton&#8208;coupled  13  C, selective  1  H&#8209;decoupling  13  C, steady&#8208;state NOE) and 2D (COSY, NOESY, HMQC) paramagnetic NMR methods that enables unprecedented structural characterisation and in some cases, provides more structural information than would be observable for a diamagnetic analogue. We demonstrate the toolbox&#8217;s broad versatility for fields from coordination chemistry and spin&#8209;crossover complexes to supramolecular chemistry through the characterisation of Co  II  and high&#8208;spin Fe  II  mononuclear complexes as well as a Co  4  L  6  cage.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;based nanostructures have been widely applied in nanomedicine. However, often their nanoparticle tumor retention time is too limited for efficient drug delivery. Inspired by the dynamic morphology control of molecular assemblies in biological systems, we have developed pH&#8208;responsive transformable peptide&#8208;based nanoparticles for photodynamic therapy (PDT) with prolonged tumor retention times. The self&#8208;assembled peptide&#8208;porphyrin nanoparticles transformed from spheres into nanofibers when exposed to the acidic inter and intracellular tumor microenvironment, which was mainly driven by enhanced intermolecular hydrogen bond formation between the protonated molecules. The nanoparticle transformation into fibrils improved their singlet oxygen generation and enabled high accumulation and long&#8208;term retention at tumor sites. Strong fluorescent signals of these nanomaterials were detected in tumor tissue up to 7 days after administration. Moreover, the peptide assemblies exhibited excellent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy via PDT in vivo. This in situ fibrillar transformation strategy of peptide conjugates could be widely utilized to design effective stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials for long&#8208;term imaging and therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8211;H Functionalization via Chiral Transient Directing Group Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of C&#8211;H bond, the most abundant functionality in organic molecules, has emerged as an expedient synthetic approach to streamline the synthesis of complex chiral molecules. Despite significant progress, traditional directing group&#8208;enabled strategy requires additional steps for the installation and removal of directing groups from the target molecule. The recent developed asymmetric C&#8211;H functionalization using chiral transient directing groups (  c  TDGs) offers a promising alternative that can circumvent this obstacle and therefore simplify the process. In this minireview, we briefly discuss the advent and recent advances of this emerging concept, with an emphasis on discussing the creation of various stereogenic centers and the developments of  c  TDGs. Applications in natural product synthesis and ligand derivatizations are also discussed. We hope this minireview will highlight the great potential of this strategy and help to inspire further endeavors.</dc:description>

      <title>Solvent&#8208;activated Hf&#8208;containing zeolites enable selective and continuous glucose&#8208;fructose isomerisation</title>
      <dc:description>The isomerisation of glucose to fructose is a critical step towards manufacturing petroleum&#8208;free chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass. Here we show that Hf&#8208;containing zeolites are unique catalysts for this reaction, enabling true thermodynamic equilibrium to be achieved in a single step during intensified continuous operation, which no chemical or biological catalyst has yet been able to achieve. Unprecedented single pass yields of 58 % are observed at a fructose selectivity of 94 %, and continuous operation for over 100 hours is demonstrated. The unexpected performance of the catalyst is realised following a period of activation within the reactor, during which time interaction with the solvent generates a state of activity that is absent in the synthesised catalyst. Mechanistic studies by X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy, chemisorption FTIR,&#160;  operando&#160;  UV&#8208;Vis and&#160;  1  H&#8208;  13  C HSQC NMR indicate that activity arises from isolated Hf(IV) atoms with monofunctional acidic properties.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Non&#8208;ionic polysubstituted azopyrimidines with strong push&#8211;pull character are promising candidates for extremely fast photochromic oscillators. The fast oscillation is based on photoinduced (E)&#8208;to&#8208;(Z) isomerization of the azo group and the accordingly very fast (Z)&#8208;to&#8208;(E) thermal relaxation. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007065), E. Proch&#225;zkov&#225;, M. Cig&#225;&#328; et&#8197;al. demonstrate how the relaxation lifetime can be tuned by proper substitution over 8 orders of magnitude from hundreds of milliseconds to several nanoseconds.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Biomolecule&#8208;Based Hydrogels and Their Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Having control: Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with triggered stiffness properties are attracting growing interest as smart materials for different applications. The Review discusses the design of biomolecule&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels and their applications as self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;memory, and controlled drug&#8208;release matrices, as well as mechanical actuators. Surface&#8208;confined switchable hydrogels and their uses are also introduced.







Abstract
This Review presents polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins as functional stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer scaffolds that yield hydrogels with controlled stiffness. Different physical or chemical triggers can be used to structurally reconfigure the crosslinking units and control the stiffness of the hydrogels. The integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular complexes and stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecular units as crosslinkers leads to hybrid hydrogels undergoing reversible triggered transitions across different stiffness states. Different applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogels are discussed. The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogel films on surfaces and their applications are discussed. The coating of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles with stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels for controlled drug release is also presented.

      <title>Reversible Luminescent Switching in an Organic Cocrystal: Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Phase Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformation of organic cocrystals under multiple external stimuli, such as solvent vapor and heating, accompanied by reversible luminescent switching, is demonstrated by B. Xu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002220). The results indicate that the luminescence switching originates from the unique molecular rearrangement of a hydrogen/halogen bond&#8208;directed stack to a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;directed stack in response to an external stimulus.

      <title>PI by NMR: Probing CH&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Protein&#8211;Ligand Complexes by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
The CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the CH donor groups of Trp81&#8208;&#950; and Trp81&#8208;&#951; with the aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems of ligand 3 (stylized in blue and green, respectively) are illustrated in the cover picture. The backdrop shows a NMR chemical shift scale into which the Trp81 CH cross peaks are schematically drawn. In the complexed form the CH groups are shifted by up to 2.3&#8197;ppm as they are shielded by the aromatic ring systems of the ligand. As explained by G. Platzer, M. Mayer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003732), these upfield shifts are indicative of favorable CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, which are difficult to detect directly in solution by other methods.

      <title>Smart magnetofluorogenic photosensitizer nanoassemblies enabling redox&#8208;driven disassembly for photodynamic therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;responsive smart photosensitizer (PS) nanoassemblies that allow enhanced delivery and controllable release of PSs are promising for imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of tumors. However, the lack of high&#8208;sensitivity and spatial&#8208;resolution signals and fast washout of released PSs from tumor tissues have impeded PDT efficacy in vivo. Herein, we report tumor targeting and redox&#8208;responsive megnetofluorogenic PS nanoasssemblies (  NP&#8208;RGD  ) via self&#8208;assembly of a cRGD&#8208; and disulfide&#8208;containing fluorogenic and paramagnetic small molecule (  1&#8208;RGD  ) for fluorescence/magnetic resonance bimodality imaging&#8208;guided tumor PDT.  NP&#8208;RGD  show high  r  1  relaxivity but quenched fluorescence and PDT activity; disulfide reduction by glutathione (GSH) promotes efficient disassembly into small&#8208;molecule probe (  2&#8208;RGD  ) and organic PS (PPa&#8208;SH), which could further bind with intracellular albumin, allowing (1) prolonged retention and (2) cascade activation of fluorescence and PDT activity to ablate tumors. Findings demonstrate great potential of combining self&#8208;assembly and stimuli&#8208;responsive disassembly to design smart PSs for precise bimodality imaging&#8208;guided on&#8208;demand tumor PDT in vivo.</dc:description>

      <title>Size&#8208;dependent Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle by converting CO  2  into reusable chemicals is recognized as an attractive solution to mitigate rising concentrations of CO  2  in the atmosphere. Herein, we prepared Ni metal catalysts ranging in size from single atoms to over 100 nm and distributed them across N&#8208;doped carbon substrates obtained from converted zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF). Results show variance in CO  2  reduction performance with variance in Ni metal size. Ni single atoms demonstrate a superior Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO selectivity of ~97% at &#8722;0.8 V  vs.  RHE, while results for 4.1 nm Ni nanoparticles are slightly lower (~93%). Further increase the particle size to 37.2 nm in Ni allows the H  2  evolution reaction (HER) to compete with CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR), with a FE towards CO production decrease to &lt; 30% and HER efficiency increase to &gt; 70%. These results uncover a size&#8208;dependent tendency towards CO  2  reduction for various sizes of Ni metal catalysts. The successful demonstration of metal size effects towards CO  2  RR resulting from this study will not only benefit renewable utilization for CO  2  , but also guide the future design of size&#8208;controlled electrocatalysts for efficient conversion of CO  2  into more useful chemicals.</dc:description>

      <title>Replacement of the Cobalt&#8208;Center of Vitamin B12 by Nickel &#8208; 

Nibalamin and Nibyric Acid Prepared from Metal&#8208;Free B12&#8208;Ligands Hydrogenobalamin and Hydrogenobyric Acid</title>
      <dc:description>The (formal) replacement of the cobalt&#8208;centre in cobalamin (Cbl) by a Ni(II) generates nibalamin (Nibl), a new type of transition metal analogue of vitamin B12. Here, we describe Nibl, synthesized by incorporation of a Ni(II)&#8208;ion into the complete metal&#8208;free B12&#8208;ligand hydrogenobalamin (Hbl), which was prepared from hydrogenobyric acid (Hby). The related Ni(II)&#8208;corrin nibyric acid (Niby) was similarly synthesized from Hby, the metal&#8208;free cobyric acid ligand. The solution structures of Hbl, as well as of the Ni&#8208;corrins Niby and Nibl, were characterized by detailed spectroscopic studies that included heteronuclear NMR. The metal&#8208;free corrin Hbl featured two inner protons bound at N2 and at N4 of the corrin ligand, as discovered in Hby. An X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of Niby provided detailed insights into both the structural adaptation of the natural corrin ligand to Ni(II)&#8208;ions and the coordination behavior of Ni(II) when corrin&#8208;bound. The diamagnetic d8&#8208;metal corrins Niby and Nibl, and corresponding iso&#8208;electronic Co(I)&#8208;corrins, were deduced to be closely iso&#8208;structural from DFT&#8208;calculated models. Nibl represents a specific new structural mimic of 4&#8208;coordinate base&#8208;off Cbls, a conclusion verified by its ability to act as a strong inhibitor of the bacterial adenosyltransferase (BtuR), which mediates its reaction through such an intermediate.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Developing non&#8208;cationic gene carrier and achieving efficient endo/lysosome escape of functional nucleic acids in cytosol are two major challenges faced by the field of gene delivery. Herein, we demonstrate a concept of self&#8208;escape spherical nucleic acid (SNA) to achieve light controlled non&#8208;cationic gene delivery with sufficient endo/lysosome escape capacity. In this system, Bcl&#8208;2 antisense oligonucleotides (OSAs) were conjugated onto the surface of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) nanoparticles to form core&#8208;shell SNAs. Once the SNAs were uptaken by tumor cells, upon light irradiation, the accumulative  1  O  2  produced by AIE PSs could rupture the lysosome structure to promote OSA escape. Prominent in vitro and in vivo results validated that the AIE based core&#8208;shell SNAs could remarkably downregulate the anti&#8208;apoptosis protein (Bcl&#8208;2) and induce tumor cell apoptosis without any transfection reagent.</dc:description>

      <title>Molten Salt Assisted Synthesis of Bismuth Nanosheets for Long&#8208;term Continuously Electrocatalytic Conversion CO2 to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monometallic pnictogens (antimony or Sb, and bismuth or Bi) nanosheets, thanks to their unique physical&#8208;chemical, electronic and optical properties, show great potential for applications in a variety of fields including quantum devices, catalysis, biomedical, and energy, while the development of general and high&#8208;efficiency route for preparation of high&#8208;quality pnictogens nanosheets remains a challenge yet. In this work, we report a general method for the synthesis of Sb and Bi nanosheets in high yields (&gt; 90%), which is implemented by molten salts&#8208;assisted aluminothermic reduction process. The electrocatalytic properties toward CO  2  reduction are systematically studied on bismuth nanosheets, which shows high catalytic selectively to reduce CO  2  to formate with a considerable current density at a low overpotential, and holds quite impressive stability over one&#8208;month catalysis operation. The theory calculations suggest that the edge sites of Bi are far more active than terrace sites based on its lowest thermodynamic barrier. We further demonstrate the Bi nanosheets hold the ultrahigh catalytic stability for continuously conversion of CO  2  into formate with a yield rate of 787.5 mmol cm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  in a flow cell upon one&#8208;month running. The present study shed light on a promising route to facilely prepare monometallic nanosheets and a system&#8208;engineering strategy for sustainable conversion of CO  2  into valuable chemicals by virtue of the highly desirable catalytic selectivity and stability of Bi nanosheets.</dc:description>

We further demonstrate the Bi nanosheets hold the ultrahigh catalytic stability for continuously conversion of CO  2  into formate with a yield rate of 787.5 mmol cm  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  in a flow cell upon one&#8208;month running. The present study shed light on a promising route to facilely prepare monometallic nanosheets and a system&#8208;engineering strategy for sustainable conversion of CO  2  into valuable chemicals by virtue of the highly desirable catalytic selectivity and stability of Bi nanosheets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Butadienyl Diiron Complexes: Nonplanar Metalla&#8208;Aromatics Involving &#963;&#8208;Type Orbital Overlap</title>
      <dc:description>A new class of nonplanar metalla&#8208;aromatics, diiron complexes  2  bridged by a 1,3&#8208;butadienyl dianionic ligand were synthesized in high yields from dilithio reagents and two equivalents of FeBr  2  .

Furthermore, experimental (X&#8208;ray structural analysis) and theoretical analyses (NICS, ICSS, AICD, MOs) suggest that  2  is aromatic. Remarkably, such nonplanar metalla&#8208;aromaticity is achieved by an uncommon &#963;&#8208;type overlap between the ligand p and metal d orbitals, in sharp contrast to the intensively studied planar aromatic systems featuring delocalized &#960;&#8208;type bonding. Specifically, the &#963;&#8208;type interaction between the two Fe 3d  xz  orbitals and the butadienyl &#960; orbital results in the formation of a six&#8208;electron conjugated system and hence endows the aromatic character to  2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Facile Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu Clusters via a Double&#8208;Confinement Enables Selective Reduction of Carbon Dioxide towards Methane</title>
      <dc:description>Previous density functional theory (DFT) calculations have fully proven that the sub&#8208;nanometric Cu clusters (i.e., 13 atoms) are more favorable for the generation of CH  4  from CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) than larger nanoparticles (NPs) due to the upshifted d center. However, it still lacks direct experimental evidence and remains unclear. Herein, we developed a facile impregnation&#8208;calcination route for the crafting of Cu clusters in diameter of ~1.0 nm with ~10 atoms via a double&#8208;confinement of carbon defects and micropores. The obtained Cu clusters enable a high selectivity for the CO  2  RR with a maximum Faraday efficiency of 81.7% towards CH  4  . Both DFT calculations and experimental results reveal that the Cu clusters can enhance the adsorption strength of *H and *CO intermediates and thus promotes the generation of CH  4  other than H  2  and CO, compared with larger Cu nanoparticles (~19 nm). Moreover, the strong interaction between Cu clusters and defective carbon optimizes the electronic structures of Cu clusters for further enhancing the selectivity and stability towards generation of CH  4  . Clearly, this work provides the first experimental evidence that the sub&#8208;nanometric Cu clusters indeed facilitate the production of CH  4  from CO  2  RR.</dc:description>

      <title>Advancing nanomedicine with cross&#8208;link functionalized nanoparticles for rapid excretion</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoparticles have been widely investigated for preclinical animal models as imaging, therapeutic or theranostic agent. However, a very limited number of nanoscale materials are approved for human use due to retention and toxicity concerns. Recent years have seen in vivo fluorescence imaging in the long end of the second near infrared window (NIR&#8208;IIb, 1,500&#8208;1,700 nm), affording deeper tissue penetration and higher imaging clarity owing to reduced light scattering and near&#8208;zero autofluorescence. Most NIR&#8208;IIb fluorophores are nanoparticle based probes with long retention&#160;in the body. Here, we applied a novel cross&#8208;linked coating to functionalize core/shell lead sulfide/cadmium sulfide quantum dots (PbS/CdS QDs) emitting at ~1,600 nm. The coating was comprised of an amphiphilic polymer followed by three crosslinked amphiphilic polymeric layers (branched PEG&#8208;linear PAA&#8208;branched PEG, P  3  coating), imparting high biocompatibility and &gt; 90% excretion of QDs within 2 weeks of intravenous administration. The P  3  &#8208;QDs were utilized for conjugation to an engineered anti&#8208;CD8 diabody to afford in vivo molecular imaging of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in response to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy. Two&#8208;plex molecular imaging in combination with down&#8208;conversion Er nanoparticles was performed for real&#8208;time in vivo monitoring of PD&#8208;L1+&#160;tumor cells and CD8+&#160;CTLs&#160;with cellular resolution by non&#8208;invasive NIR&#8208;IIb light sheet microscopy (LSM). In another application, angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment was imaged with P  3  &#8208;QDs conjugated to TRC105, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD105. Further, P  3  &#8208;QDs afforded imaging of lymph nodes deep in the body with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio of up to ~170. Lastly, we show that the P  3  coating on magnetic nanoparticles also afforded rapid excretion in &lt; 2 weeks, establishing generality of the approach. The ability of eliminating various nanoparticles from a body opens up many possibilities of nanomedicine for human use.</dc:description>

The ability of eliminating various nanoparticles from a body opens up many possibilities of nanomedicine for human use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Direct Mapping Approach to Understand Carrier Relaxation Dynamics in Varied Regions of a Polycrystalline Perovskite Film</title>
      <dc:description>We developed a direct mapping approach to overlay the image of a polycrystalline perovskite film obtained from the transient absorption microscope (TAM) with that from the scanning electron microscope (SEM). By mapping these imaging data pixel by pixel, we are able to observe the relaxation dynamics of the photo&#8208;generated charge carriers on varied regions of the film. The carrier relaxation dynamics contain a dominated single&#8208;exponential decay component due to the recombination of charge carriers. We found that the lifetime distribution of charge recombination shows a bimodal feature, for which the rapid and slow distributions are assigned as free and trapped carriers, respectively. The charge recombination was slower in the grain boundary (GB) region than in the grain interior (GI) region. The small grains have longer lifetimes than the large grains for the crystal size smaller than 500 nm. Our results thus indicate that GB with retarded charge recombination might play a positive role in a perovskite solar cell.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Abstract: Designing deep&#8208;Ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals is of the current research interests but faces a great challenge. In order to overcome the problem of crystal growth and the toxicity of BeO raw materials in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), the only applicable DUV NLO crystal so far, we substitute Be2+ cations with Zn2+ in the KBBF structure and modify the halogen anions, by which three new Zn&#8208;containing KBBF&#8208;like compounds, CsZn2BO3X2 (X = F, Cl and F&amp;Cl), have been successfully synthesized. They all exhibit excellent NLO properties, including improved SHG responses (2.8&#8208;3.5 &#215; KDP) and short UV cut&#8208;off edges (&lt;190 nm). In comparison with KBBF, CsZn2BO3X2 (X = F, Cl and F&amp;Cl) are all chemically benign and have better growth habits, so they are all promising as the DUV NLO crystals. The further study on the structure&#8208;property relationship indicates that the mixing of halogen anions is a feasible strategy to enhance the SHG responses of the KBBF family.</dc:description>

      <title>Freestanding millimeter&#8208;scale porphyrin&#8208;based monoatomic layers with 0.28 nm thickness for CO2 electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Developing novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and single atomic layered materials is a fascinating challenge. Here we successfully synthesize porphyrin&#8208;based monoatomic layer (PML), a freestanding 2D porphyrin&#8208;based material of monomer&#8208;unit thickness (2.8 &#197;). The solvothermal method provides a bottom&#8208;up approach for tailoring the monoatomic layer from the nanoscale to the milliscale. PMLs containing accurately tailorable M&#8211;N4 units (M=Cu and Au) were synthesized, which present metal center&#8208;dependent performance for CO2 electrocatalysis. PML with Cu&#8208;N4 centers performs high faradaic efficiencies of HCOO&#8208; and CH4 (80.9% and 11.5% at &#8208;0.7 V, respectively) while PML with Au&#8208;N4 centers generates HCOO&#8208; and CO as major products (40.9% and 34.4% at &#8208;0.8 V, respectively). The irreversible restructuring behavior of Cu sites is also observed.

      <title>Machine Driven Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Glycopeptide</title>
      <dc:description>Historically, researchers have put considerable effort into developing automation systems to prepare natural biopolymers such as peptides and oligonucleotides. The availability of such mature systems has significantly advanced the development of natural science. Over the past twenty years, breakthroughs about automation synthesis of oligosaccharides have also been made. Herein, we described a machine&#8208;driven platform for glycopeptide synthesis by a reconstructed peptide synthesizer.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Historically, researchers have put considerable effort into developing automation systems to prepare natural biopolymers such as peptides and oligonucleotides. The availability of such mature systems has significantly advanced the development of natural science. Over the past twenty years, breakthroughs about automation synthesis of oligosaccharides have also been made. Herein, we described a machine&#8208;driven platform for glycopeptide synthesis by a reconstructed peptide synthesizer. The designed platform is based on the use of an amine&#8208;functionalized silica resin to facilitate the chemical synthesis of peptides in organic solvent as well as the enzymatic synthesis of glycan epitopes in aqueous phase in a single reaction vessel. Both syntheses were performed by a peptide synthesizer in a semi&#8208;automated manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Biosynthesis of Indole Diterpene Lolitrems: Radical&#8208;Induced Cyclization of an Epoxyalcohol Affording a Characteristic Lolitremane Skeleton</title>
      <dc:description>Lolitrems  are tremorgenic indole diterpenes that exhibit a unique 5/6 bicyclic system of the indole&#160; moiety. Although genetic analysis has indicated that prenyltransferase LtmE and cytochrome P450 LtmJ are involved in the construction of this unique structure, the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic pathway for lolitrems employing a recently established genome&#8208;editing technique for the expression host Aspergillus oryzae. Heterologous expression and bioconversion of the various intermediates revealed that LtmJ catalyzes multistep oxidation to furnish the lolitrem core. We also isolated the key reaction intermediate with an epoxyalcohol moiety. This observation allowed us to establish the mechanism of radical&#8208;induced cyclization, which was firmly supported by density functional theory calculations and a model experiment with a synthetic analog.</dc:description>

      <title>Electroreduction of CO2 to Formate with low overpotential using Cobalt Pyridine Thiolate Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added products provides a viable alternative to the use of carbon sources derived from fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the ability to carry out these transformations at reasonable energetic costs, e.g. with low overpotential, remains a significant challenge. Molecular catalysts offer a great option in this context, as fine control of their activity and selectivity can be obtained via the tuning of their coordination sphere and ligand set. To this end, we investigated here a series of cheap cobalt(III) pyridine&#8208;thiolate complexes as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The effect of the ligands and proton sources on activity was examined. We were able to identify [bipyridine&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinethiolato)&#8208;cobalt(III)&#8208;hexaflurophosphate] as a highly selective catalyst for formate production operating at a very low overpotential of 110 mV to achieve a TOF of 10 s&#8208;1. Detailed electrokinetic analysis coupled with density functional theory allowed establishing a mechanistic pathway for these catalysts, highlighting the role of key metal hydride intermediates. The catalysts deactivate via the formation of stable Co carbonyl complexes, but we demonstrated that the active species could be regenerated upon oxidation and release of coordinated CO ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Polarization Effect in Surface Plasmon&#8208;Induced Photocatalysis on Au/TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Controlling the interaction of polarization light with an asymmetric nanostructure such as a metal/semiconductor heterostructure provides opportunities for tuning the surface plasmon excitation and near&#8208;field spatial distribution. However, the effects of light polarization on interfacial charge transport and consequently the photocatalysis of plasmonic metal/semiconductor photocatalysts, remain unclear. Herein, we reveal the polarization dependence of plasmonic charge separation and spatial distribution in Au/TiO2  nanoparticles under&#160;45&#176; incident light illumination&#160;at the single&#8208;particle level using a combination of photon&#8208;irradiated Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) and electromagnetic field simulation. We also quantitatively uncover the relationship between the local charge density and polarization angle by investigating the polarization&#8208;dependent surface photovoltage (SPV). The plasmon&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity is enhanced when the polarization direction is perpendicular to the Au/TiO2  interface.</dc:description>

We also quantitatively uncover the relationship between the local charge density and polarization angle by investigating the polarization&#8208;dependent surface photovoltage (SPV). The plasmon&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity is enhanced when the polarization direction is perpendicular to the Au/TiO2  interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Cationic Lipid&#8208;based Intracellular Delivery of Bacterial Effectors for Rewiring Malignant Cell Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>The unique and abundance of bacterial effectors have inspired us to explore their potential in rewiring malignant cell signaling. Their incapability for entering cells, however, hinders such application. Herein we developed a cationic lipid&#8208;based high throughput library screening platform for effective intracellular delivery of bacterial effectors. As the misregulated MAPK signaling is a hallmark of many types of cancer, we turned our attention to the  Shigella  effector OspF which irreversibly inactivates ERK, the terminal component of MAPK cascade. We created a function&#8208;based screening assay to obtain AMPA&#8208;O16B lipid nanoparticles for effective OspF intracellular delivery, which inhibited the malignant MAPK signaling and tumor growth  in vitro  and  in vivo.  Furthermore, the optimized lipid nanoparticle formulation can deliver OspF to modulate the immunosuppressive responses in macrophages. Our work represents a general strategy to explore the therapeutic potentials of naturally evolved bacterial effectors.</dc:description>

      <title>Ambient Chemical Fixation of CO2 Using a Robust Ag27 Cluster&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
      <dc:description>Coinage metals (Cu, Ag, Au)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely used in organic synthesis chemistry, however, robust and  heterogeneous silver&#8208;based catalysts are hard to access due to its high photosensitivity and chemical instability. Herein, the unprecedented double S  2  &#8722;  templated Ag  27  clusters have been stabilized by 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP&#8208;H  2  ) ligands to afford a robust 2D metal&#8208;organic framework (  Ag27&#8208;MOF  ). This silver cluster&#8208;assembled material serves as a highly efficient (TON &gt; 1000) heterogeneous catalyst for the cyclization of both terminal and internal propargylamines with CO  2  under atmospheric pressure. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the high catalytic activity and broad substrate scope are attributable to the saddle&#8208;shaped metallic node in  Ag27&#8208;MOF  , which features an accessible platform with high&#8208;density silver atoms as  &#960;  &#8208;Lewis acid sites for activating C&#8801;C triple bonds. As a result, different sterically hindered alkyne substrates can be effectively activated through &#960;&#8208;interactions with these cationic silver centers.

      <title>Photorelease of Pyridines Using the Metal&#8208;free Photoremovable Protecting Group</title>
      <dc:description>Photorelease of bioactive molecules has emerged as a valuable tool in biochemistry. Nevertheless, many important bioactive molecules, such as pyridine derivatives&#65292;cannot benefit from currently available organic photoremovable protecting groups (PPGs). We found that inefficient photorelease of pyridines is attributed to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from PPGs to pyridiniums. To alleviate PET, we rationally designed a strategy to drive excited state of PPG from S  1  to T  1  with heavy atom, and synthesized a new PPG by substitution of atom H at 3&#8208;position of 7&#8208;Dietheylamino&#8208;coumarin&#8208;4&#8208;methyl (  DEACM  ) with Br or I. This resulted in an improved photolytic efficiency of the pyridinium with hundreds of times in water solution. The PPG can be applied to various pyridine derivatives. The successful photorelease of a microtubule inhibitor, indibulin, in living cells was demonstrated for the potential application of this strategy in biochemical research.</dc:description>

      <title>Meta Junction Promoting Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>The meta junction is proposed to realize efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated polymers. Based on triphenylamine as D and dicyanobenzene as A, as a proof of concept, a series of D&#8208;A conjugated polymers has been developed by changing their connection sites. When the junction between D and A is tuned from para to meta, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;  E  ST  ) is found to be significantly decreased from 0.44 to 0.10 eV because of the increasing hole&#8208;electron separation. Unlike the para&#8208;linked analogue with no TADF, consequently, the meta&#8208;linked polymer shows a strong delayed fluorescence. Its corresponding solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) achieve a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.4% (51.9 cd A  &#8208;1  , 50.9 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.34, 0.57). The results first highlight the bright future of D&#8208;A conjugated polymers used for TADF OLEDs.</dc:description>

When the junction between D and A is tuned from para to meta, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;  E  ST  ) is found to be significantly decreased from 0.44 to 0.10 eV because of the increasing hole&#8208;electron separation. Unlike the para&#8208;linked analogue with no TADF, consequently, the meta&#8208;linked polymer shows a strong delayed fluorescence. Its corresponding solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) achieve a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.4% (51.9 cd A  &#8208;1  , 50.9 lm W  &#8208;1  ) and Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.34, 0.57). The results first highlight the bright future of D&#8208;A conjugated polymers used for TADF OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>An electrochemical biosensor architecture leveraging protein folding and supporting real&#8208;time measurements directly in whole blood</title>

      <title>Controlling residual lithium in high&#8208;nickel (&gt;90 %) lithium layered oxides for cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The rampant generation of lithium hydroxide and carbonate impurities, commonly known as &#8216;residual lithium&#8217;, is a practical obstacle to the mass&#8208;scale synthesis and handling of high&#8208;nickel (&gt;90%) layered oxides and their use as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

Based on thermodynamic considerations of the preferred reactions, we systematically designed a synthesis process that preemptively converts residual Li  2  O (the origin of LiOH and Li  2  CO  3  ) into a more stable compound by injecting reactive SO  2  gas. The preformed lithium sulfate thin film significantly suppresses the generation of LiOH and Li  2  CO  3  during both synthesis and storage, thereby mitigating slurry gelation and gas evolution and improving the cycle stability. This simple and versatile approach is thus a promising practical solution to overcome the residual lithium issues currently encountered on mass production lines.</dc:description>

      <title>An enzymatic platform for the highy enantioselective and stereodivergent construction of cyclopropyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactones</title>
      <dc:description>The development of enzymes capable of mediating abiological reactions offers new opportunities for sustainable chemistry. Here we report the development of biological catalysts derived from sperm whale myoglobin that exploit a carbene transfer mechanism for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactones, which are key structural motifs found in many biologically active natural products. While hemin, wild&#8208;type myoglobin, and other hemoproteins are unable to catalyze this reaction, the myoglobin scaffold could be remodeled by protein engineering to permit the intramolecular cyclopropanation of a broad spectrum of homoallylic diazoacetate substrates in high yields and with up to 99% enantiomeric excess. Through an alternate evolutionary trajectory, a stereodivergent biocatalyst was also obtained for affording mirror&#8208;image forms of the desired bicyclic products. In combination with whole&#8208;cell transformations, the myoglobin&#8208;based biocatalyst was readily applied to enable the asymmetric construction of a cyclopropyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactone scaffold at a gram scale. The enzymatic product could be further elaborated to furnish a variety of enantiopure trisubstituted cyclopropanes.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of enzymes capable of mediating abiological reactions offers new opportunities for sustainable chemistry. Here we report the development of biological catalysts derived from sperm whale myoglobin that exploit a carbene transfer mechanism for the asymmetric synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactones, which are key structural motifs found in many biologically active natural products. While hemin, wild&#8208;type myoglobin, and other hemoproteins are unable to catalyze this reaction, the myoglobin scaffold could be remodeled by protein engineering to permit the intramolecular cyclopropanation of a broad spectrum of homoallylic diazoacetate substrates in high yields and with up to 99% enantiomeric excess. Through an alternate evolutionary trajectory, a stereodivergent biocatalyst was also obtained for affording mirror&#8208;image forms of the desired bicyclic products. In combination with whole&#8208;cell transformations, the myoglobin&#8208;based biocatalyst was readily applied to enable the asymmetric construction of a cyclopropyl&#8208;&#948;&#8208;lactone scaffold at a gram scale. The enzymatic product could be further elaborated to furnish a variety of enantiopure trisubstituted cyclopropanes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A nickel/Josiphos&#8208;based catalytic system is shown to feature unique catalytic behavior allowing highly selective formation of the desired mono &#945;&#8208;arylated acetone.

The Josiphos ligand is shown to play a key role in the stabilization of Ni(II) intermediates to allow a Ni(0)/Ni(II) catalytic pathway.

      <dc:description>Free radicals with reactive chemical properties can battle against tumors without causing drug resistance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been widely used for cancer treatment, but regrettably, the common existence of O2  and H2O2  deficiency in tumor set a severe barrier for sufficient ROS production, leading to unsatisfactory anticancer outcomes. Here, we construct chlorine radical (&#8226;Cl) nano&#8208;generator with inner upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) coated by SiO2, and decorated with Ag0/AgCl hetero&#8208;dots outside. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the short&#8208;wavelength emission UCNP catalyzes Ag0/AgCl for &#8226;Cl generation with no dependence on O2/H2O2. &#8226;Cl with strong oxidability and nucleophilicity can attack biomolecules in cancer cells more effectively than ROS. This &#8226;Cl stress treatment will no doubt broaden the family of oxidative stress&#8208;induced antitumor strategy by using non&#8208;oxygen free radicals, which is significant for reference in the development of new anticancer agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating Benzothiadiazole&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks via Halogenation for Enhanced Photocatalytic Water Splitting: Small Changes Make Big Differences</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs), which is an emerging class of crystalline porous polymers, have been recognized as a new platform for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen energy conversion owing to their pre&#8208;designable structures and tailor&#8208;made functions. Herein, we demonstrate that slight modulation of the chemical structure of a typical photoactive 2D COF (Py&#8208;HTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF)  via  chlorination (Py&#8208;ClTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) and fluorination (Py&#8208;FTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) can lead to dramatically enhanced photocatalytic    H  2  evolution rates  (HER = 177.50 &#956;mol&#8201;h  &#8208;1  with a high apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 8.45% for Py&#8208;ClTP&#8208;BT&#8208;COF). Both experimental and computational studies reveal that halogen modulation at the photoactive benzothiadiazole moiety can efficiently suppress charge recombination and significantly reduce the energy barrier associated with the formation of H intermediate species (H*)  on polymer surface  .

      <title>Frontispiece: Counter&#8208;Intuitive Gas&#8208;Phase Reactivities of [V2]+ and [V2O]+ towards CO2 Reduction: Insight from Electronic Structure Calculations</title>
      <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;Phase Chemistry The fleeting existence of [V2O]+ as a reactive intermediate in the oxidation of [V2]+ by CO2 is described by J. Li, H. Schwarz et&#8197;al. in their Communication on page&#8197;12308. The counterintuitive oxidation behavior of [V2]+ can be traced back to the supportive role of the bridging oxygen atom in [V2O]+.

      <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of Mineral Respiration: How Iron Hemes Synchronize Electron Transfer Rates</title>
      <dc:description>
The bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens requires extracellular metal salts for respiration. Each microorganism produces 5&#215;105 electrons per second, which reduce the metal ions bound to the outer membrane cytochromes. With iron heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes, the electron flow is independent of the concentration and type of oxidant. This results in ATP homeostasis.







Abstract
Anaerobic microorganisms of the Geobacter genus are effective electron sources for the synthesis of nanoparticles, for bioremediation of polluted water, and for the production of electricity in fuel cells. In multistep reactions, electrons are transferred via iron/heme cofactors of c&#8208;type cytochromes from the inner cell membrane to extracellular metal ions, which are bound to outer membrane cytochromes. We measured electron production and electron flux rates to 5&#215;105&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1 per G.&#8197;sulfurreducens. Remarkably, these rates are independent of the oxidants, and follow zero order kinetics. It turned out that the microorganisms regulate electron flux rates by increasing their Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios in the multiheme cytochromes whenever the activity of the extracellular metal oxidants is diminished. By this mechanism the respiration remains constant even when oxidizing conditions are changing. This homeostasis is a vital condition for living systems, and makes G.&#8197;sulfurreducens a versatile electron source.

      <title>Automated, Accelerated Nanoscale Synthesis of Iminopyrrolidines</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi 3&#8208;component reaction is described. I&#8208;DOT was used to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. The reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups.







Abstract
Miniaturization and acceleration of synthetic chemistry is an emerging area in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and materials research and development. Herein, we describe the synthesis of iminopyrrolidine&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid derivatives using chiral glutamine, oxo components, and isocyanide building blocks in an unprecedented Ugi&#8208;3&#8208;component reaction. We used I&#8208;DOT, a positive&#8208;pressure&#8208;based low&#8208;volume and non&#8208;contact dispensing technology to prepare more than 1000 different derivatives in a fully automated fashion. In general, the reaction is stereoselective, proceeds in good yields, and tolerates a wide variety of functional groups. We exemplify a pipeline of fast and efficient nanomole&#8208;scale scouting to millimole&#8208;scale synthesis for the discovery of a useful novel reaction with great scope.
