         <title>Getting Ready for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction: The Infrared Spectrum of Hydrated Aluminum Hydride&#8208;Hydroxide HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1, n = 9&#8211;14</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated singly charged aluminum ions eliminate molecular hydrogen in a size regime from 11 to 24 water molecules. Here we probe the structure of HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1, n = 9&#8211;14, by infrared multiple photon spectroscopy in the region of 1400&#8211;2250 cm&#8208;1. Based on quantum chemical calculations, we assign the features at 1940&#160;cm&#8209;1 and 1850 cm&#8208;1 to the Al&#8208;H stretch in five&#8208; and six&#8208;coordinate aluminum(III) complexes, respectively. Hydrogen bonding towards the hydride is observed, starting at n = 12. The frequency of the Al&#8208;H stretch is very sensitive to the structure of the hydrogen bonding network, and the large number of isomers leads to significant broadening and red&#8208;shifting of the absorption of the hydrogen bonded Al&#8208;H stretch. The hydride can even act as a double hydrogen bond acceptor, shifting the Al&#8208;H stretch to frequencies below those of the water bending mode. The onset of hydrogen bonding and disappearance of the free Al&#8208;H stretch coincides with the onset of hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategic Design of Catalytic Lysine&#8208;Targeting Reversible Covalent BCR&#8208;ABL Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted covalent inhibitors have re&#8208;emerged as validated drugs to overcome acquired resistance in cancer treatment. Herein, by using a carbonyl boronic acid (CBA) warhead, we report the structure&#8208;based design of BCR&#8208;ABL inhibitors via reversible covalent targeting of the catalytic lysine with improved potency against both wild&#8208;type and mutant ABL kinases, especially ABLT315I bearing the gatekeeper residue mutation. We show the evolutionarily conserved lysine can be targeted selectively, and the selectivity depends largely on molecular recognition of the non&#8208;covalent pharmacophore in this class of inhibitors, probably due to the moderate reactivity of the warhead. We report the first co&#8208;crystal structures of covalent inhibitor&#8208;ABL kinase domain complexes, providing insights into the interaction of this warhead with the catalytic lysine. We also employed label&#8208;free mass spectrometry to evaluate off&#8208;targets of our compounds at proteome&#8208;wide level in different mammalian cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Control Viscoelasticity of Polymer Networks with Crosslinks of Superposed Fast and Slow Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Depending on the dynamics of the crosslinks, polymer networks can have distinct bulk mechanical behaviors, from viscous liquids to tough solids. Here, by means of designing a crosslink with variable molecular dynamics, we show the control of viscoelasticity of polymer networks in a broad range quantitatively. The hexanoate&#8208;isoquinoline@cucurbit[7]uril (HIQ@CB[7]) crosslink exhibits in a combination of protonated and deprotonated states of similar association affinity but distinct molecular dynamics. The molecular property of this crosslink is contributed by linear combination of the parameters at the two states, which is precisely tuned by pH. Using this crosslink, we achieve the quantitative control of viscoelasticity of quasi&#8208;ideal networks in 5 orders of magnitude, and we show the reversible control of mechanical response, such as stiffness, strength and extensibility, of tough random polymer networks. This strategy offers a way to tailor the mechanical properties of polymer networks at the molecular level and paves the way for engineering &#8220;smart&#8221; responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Anionic Metal Covalent Organic Framework with soc Topology Built from Octahedral Ti(IV) Complex for Photocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) remains challenging due to the limited types of organic building blocks. With octahedral Ti(IV) complex as the building unit, this study reports on the first 3D anionic titanium&#8208;based COF (  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  ) with an edge&#8208;transitive (6, 4)&#8208;connected  soc  topology.  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  exhibits high crystallinity, superior stability, and large specific surface area (1000.4 m  2  g  &#8722;1  ). Moreover,  Ti&#8208;COF&#8208;1  has a broad absorption band in the UV spectrum with an optical energy gap of 1.86 eV, and exhibits high photocatalytic activity toward Meerwein addition reactions. This research demonstrates an attractive strategy for the design of 3D functional COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Aglacins A, B and E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder (PEDA) reaction, between electron&#8208;rich 2&#8208;methylbenzaldehydes and unsaturated &#947;&#8208;lactones, was developed to directly construct the basic tricyclic core of aryltetralin lactone lignans. The first asymmetric total synthesis of aglacins A, B and E was achieved based on this newly developed methodology, which enable us to revise the absolute configuration of these natural lignans. This strategy was also used to efficiently prepare naturally occurring aryl&#8211;dihydronaphthalene&#8208;type lignans (&#8211;)&#8208;7,8&#8208;dihydroisojusticidine B and (+)&#8208;linoxepin in four and six steps, as well as 27 members of natural product&#8208;like molecules bearing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center at C&#8208;8&#8217;. We believe that the synthetic aglacins and small&#8208;molecule library provide new opportunities to carry out the SAR studies of podophyllotoxin&#8208;family natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Activation&#8208;Based Construction of&#160; Axiall and Centrally Chiral Indenes through Two Discrete Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported herein is asymmetric [3+2] annulation of arylnitrones with different classes of alkynes catalyzed by chiral rhodium(III) complexes, with the nitrone acting as an electrophilic directing group. Three classes of chiral indenes/indenones have been effectively constructed, depending on the nature of the substrates. The coupling system features mild reaction conditions, excellent enantioselectivity, and high atom&#8208;economy. In particular, the coupling of  N  &#8208;benzylnitrones and different classes of sterically hindered alkynes afforded C&#8208;C or C&#8208;N atropochiral pentatomic biaryls with a C&#8208;centered point&#8208;chirality in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (45 examples, average 95.6% ee). These chiral center and axis are disposed in a distal fashion and they are constructed via two distinct migratory insertions that are stereo&#8208;determining.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile synthesis of cyanide and isocyanides from CO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of K[N(SiMe  3  )  2  ] with  13  CO is shown to proceed in C  6  D  6  or THF affording K  13  CN and O(SiMe  3  )  2  under mild conditions. This was confirmed by the isolation and crystallographic characterization of K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)CN. In an analogous fashion, reaction of the alkali metal amides, M[N(SiR  3  )R&#8242;] (M= Li, K; R = Ph, Me; R&#8242; = alkyl, aryl) afford a facile route to the corresponding  13  C labeled isocyanide RN  13  C and MOSiR  3  generally in high yields. In some instances, the use of the sterically bulky Ph  3  Si&#8208;substituent is required to preclude 1,2&#8208;silyl migration affording the silylcarbamoyl salt M[Me  3  SiC(O)NR&#8242;]. These reactions have been used to obtain 19 examples of  13  C labelled isocyanides, and several examples of gram scale reactions are reported. The mechanism of the reactions is probed via reliable DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Scholl Reaction of Perylene&#8208;Based Polyphenylene Precursors under Different Conditions: Formation of Hexagon or Octagon?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Scholl reaction is a classic method for the synthesis of various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the fundamental reaction mechanisms remain unclear and the products sometimes are unpredictable. Herein, we report the successful synthesis of a planar dibenzo&#8208;peri&#8208;hexacene derivative (  2  ) via FeCl  3  &#8208;mediated Scholl reaction from a cyclopenta&#8208;fused perylene (CP) based polyphenylene precursor (  1  ). However, an unexpected octagon&#8208;containing, negatively curved molecule (  3  ) was obtained in nearly quantitative yield when 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) and methanesulfonic acid (MeSO  3  H) were used. Similar results were observed when two smaller&#8208;sized precursors containing one (  4  ) or two CP units (  5  ) were tested. The structures of the final products were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, which also reveal that there is no close p&#8208;p stacking between neighbouring p&#8208;conjugated skeletons. DFT calculations suggest a radical cation mechanism in the presence of FeCl  3  while an arenium ion pathway for the DDQ/MeSO  3  H mediated Scholl reaction, which can well explain the selective formation of hexagons and octagons under different conditions. The obtained compounds showed tunable optical and electrochemical properties. In particular, their non&#8208;aggregative feature endows them moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yields, which are desirable for solid&#8208;state luminescence devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Endocircular Li Carbon Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By employing accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art many&#8208;electron quantum chemistry methods, we establish that carbon monocyclic rings can accommodate Li guest atoms. The low&#8208;lying electronic states of these endocircular systems are analyzed and found to include both charge&#8208;separated states where the guest Li atom appears as a cation and the ring as an anion and encircled&#8208;electron states where Li and the ring are neutral. The electron binding energies of the encircled&#8208;electron states increase dramatically&#160;at their highly&#8208;symmetric equilibrium geometries with increasing size of rings, and in Li@C  24  , such a state becomes the ground state. Li is very weakly bound vertical to the rings in the low&#8208;lying encircled&#8208;electron states hinting to van der Waals binding. Applcations are mentioned.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversed Charge Transfer and Enhanced Hydrogen Spillover in Pt Nanoclusters Anchored on Titanium Oxide with Rich Oxygen Vacancies Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic activity of metal clusters is closely related with the support, while the knowledge about the influence of support on the catalytic activity is scarce. Herein, we show that, Pt nanoclusters (NCs) anchored on porous TiO  2  nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies (  V  O  &#8208;rich Pt/TiO  2  ) and deficient oxygen vacancies (  V  O  &#8208;deficient Pt/TiO  2  ), display significantly different catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which  V  O  &#8208;rich Pt/TiO  2  shows a mass activity of 45.28 A mg  Pt  &#8211;1  at &#8211;0.1 V  vs.  RHE, 16.7 and 58.8 times higher than those of  V  O  &#8208;deficient Pt/TiO  2  and commercial Pt/C, respectively. DFT calculations and  in&#8208;situ  Raman spectra suggest that porous TiO  2  with rich oxygen vacancies can simultaneously achieve the reversed charge transfer (electrons transfer from TiO  2  to Pt NCs) and enhanced hydrogen spillover from Pt NCs to TiO  2  support, which bring to electron&#8208;rich Pt NCs being favorable for proton reduction to absorbed H*, as well as the acceleration of hydrogen desorption at Pt catalytic sites, both promoting the HER. Our work provides a new strategy for rational design of highly efficient HER catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;responsive Deep&#8208;blue Organic Ultralong Phosphorescence with Lifetime over 5 s for Reversible Water&#8208;jet Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with photophysical properties sensitive to external stimulus are highly attractive for advanced applications. However, most OURTP molecules are in crystal and OURTP materials with good practicability and stimulus&#8208;responsive character are hard to be achieved. Here, we report, for the first time, the highly efficient, ultralong&#8208;lived and deep&#8208;blue OURTP materials by simply doping boron phosphor into cyanuric acid host. Thus constructed host&#8208;guest OURTP composites with abundant and tunable H&#8208;bond network are highly stable in air with ultralong lifetime of 5.08 s at room temperature, and more interestingly, are sensitive to water, which can strength the H&#8208;bond network to significantly enhance OURTP quantum yield from 16.1% to 37.6%. With the extraordinary water&#8208;responsive OURTP, anti&#8208;counterfeiting paper was facilely prepared for water&#8208;jet printing and the jet&#8208;printed high&#8208;resolution OURTP patterns can be easily erased by solvent fuming for another printing/erasing cycle with high reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Cage for Wide&#8208;Scope Chiral Recognition in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an anionic homochiral octahedral cage, by condensing six Ga  3+  cations and four trisacylhydrazone ligands. The robust nature of hydrazone bond renders the cage stability in water, where the cage can take advantage of hydrophobic effect for host&#8208;guest recognition. In addition to the internal binding site namely the inner cavity, the octahedral cage possesses four &#8220;windows&#8221;, each of which represents an external binding station allowing peripheral complexation. These internal and external binding sites endow the cage with capability of binding a broad range of guests whose sizes could either be smaller than, or exceed the volume of the cage inner cavity. Upon accommodation of a chiral guest, one of the two cage enantiomers becomes more favored than the other, producing CD signals. The CD signal intensity of the cage is observed proportional to the ee values of the chiral guest, allowing quantitative determination of the latter.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric Dibenzoheptazethrenes for Air&#8208;stable Organic Field&#8208;effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet diradicaloids hold great potential as semiconductors for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). However, their relative low material and device stabilities impede the practical applications. Here, to achieve balanced stability and performance, two isomeric dibenzoheptazethrene derivatives with singlet diradical character were synthesized in a concise manner. Benefitted from the aromatic stabilization, both compounds displayed small diradical character and large singlet&#8208;triplet gap, as corroborated by variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations. OFET devices based on single crystals showed high hole mobility of 0.15 cm  2  V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , which is the highest for zethrene&#8208;based semiconductors. Both isomers exhibited remarkable material stability in air&#8208;saturated solutions and excellent bias&#8208;stress and storage stability in device under ambient air.</dc:description>

Benefitted from the aromatic stabilization, both compounds displayed small diradical character and large singlet-triplet gap, as corroborated by variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations. OFET devices based on single crystals showed high hole mobility of 0.15 cm  2  V  -1  s  -1  , which is the highest for zethrene-based semiconductors. Both isomers exhibited remarkable material stability in air-saturated solutions and excellent bias-stress and storage stability in device under ambient air.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Influence of a Changing Local Environment during Photoinduced CO2 Dissociation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Though largely influencing the efficiency of a reaction, the molecular&#8208;scale details of the local environment of the reactants are experimentally inaccessible hindering an in&#8208;depth understanding of a catalyst&#8217;s reactivity, a prerequisite to maximizing its efficiency. We introduce a method to follow individual molecules and their largely changing environment during a photochemical reaction. The method is illustrated for a rate&#8208;limiting step in a photolytic reaction, the dissociation of CO  2  on two catalytically relevant surfaces, Ag(100) and Cu(111). We reveal with a single&#8208;molecule resolution how the reactant&#8217;s surroundings evolve with progressing laser illumination and with it their propensity for dissociation. Counteracting processes lead to a volcano&#8208;like reactivity. Our unprecedented local view during a photoinduced reaction opens the avenue for understanding the influence of the products on reaction yields on the nanoscale.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Vinylogous Addition Reactions Initiated by Meinwald Rearrangement of Vinyl Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complexes as catalysts. Direct vinylogous additions via dienolates of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes were realized. A series of chiral &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones were synthesized in good yields with excellent stereoselectivity.







Abstract
The first catalytic asymmetric multiple vinylogous addition reactions initiated by Meinwald rearrangement of vinyl epoxides were realized by employing chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex catalysts. The vinyl epoxides, as masked &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, via direct vinylogous additions with isatins, 2&#8208;alkenoylpyridines or methyleneindolinones, provided a facile and efficient way for the synthesis of chiral 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;substituted oxindoles, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes and spiro&#8208;cyclohexene indolinones, respectively with high efficiency and stereoselectivity. The control experiments and kinetic studies revealed that the Lewis acid acted as dual&#8208;tasking catalyst, controlling the initial rearrangement to match subsequent enantioselective vinylogous addition reactions. A catalytic cycle with a possible transition model was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Fabrication of Gradient and Patterned Organic Thin Films by Bipolar Electrolytic Micelle Disruption Using Redox&#8208;Active Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system is established by integrating bipolar electrochemistry with a redox&#8208;controlled micelle disruption process. Using the BEMD approach, gradient and patterned organic films with a wide range of a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules, were successfully fabricated.







Abstract
Bipolar electrochemistry could be regarded as a powerful approach for selective surface modification due to the beneficial feature that a wirelessly controllable potential distribution on bipolar electrodes (BPEs). Herein we report a bipolar electrolytic micelle disruption (BEMD) system for the preparation of shaped organic films. A U&#8208;shaped bipolar electrolytic system with a sigmoidal potential gradient on the BPE gave gradient&#8208;thin films including various interesting organic compounds, such as a polymerizable monomer, an organic pigment and aggregation induced emission (AIE) molecules. The gradient feature was characterized by UV&#8211;Vis absorption, thickness measurements and surface morphology analysis. Corresponding patterned films were also fabricated using a cylindrical bipolar electrolytic setup that enables site&#8208;selective application of the potential on the BPE. Such a facile BEMD approach will open a long&#8208;term perspective with respect to organic film preparation.

         <title>Tailoring the Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interactions in Supported Atomically Dispersed Gold Catalysts for Efficient Fenton&#8208;like Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substituted solid solution was used to achieve self&#8208;exfoliation of synthetic materials and optimize electronic metal&#8211;carrier interactions to increase the material's high efficiency and stable water treatment catalytic performance.







Abstract
The atomically dispersed metal is expected as one of the most promising Fenton&#8208;like catalysts for the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants (ROPs) by the strong &#8220;electronic metal&#8211;support interactions&#8221; (EMSIs). Here, we develop an atomically dispersed metal&#8211;atom alloy made by guest Au atoms substitute host V atoms in the two&#8208;dimensional VO2(B) nanobelt support (Au/VO2) to activate Fenton&#8208;like oxidation for elimination of ROPs. The 2D nanobelt structure enlarges the exposure of atomically Au thus increasing the number of active sites to absorb more S2O82&#8722; ions. And the EMSIs regulate the charge density in Au atoms to present positive charge Au+, lowering the energy barrier of S2O82&#8722; decomposition to produce SO4.&#8722;. The Au/VO2 catalyst possesses excellent durable and reliable characteristics and exhibits record&#8208;breaking efficiency with TOF as high as 21.42&#8197;min&#8722;1, 16.19&#8197;min&#8722;1, and 80.89&#8197;min&#8722;1 for rhodamine, phenol, and bisphenol&#8197;A degradation, respectively.

         <title>Chiral Metal Nanoparticle Superlattices Enabled by Porphyrin&#8208;Based Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices with diverse structures were engineered by templating from porphyrin based supramolecular structures. The chirality transfer from molecular systems to colloidal systems is on the basis of weak chain&#8208;chain van der Waals forces.







Abstract
Herein, we show that chiral metal nanoparticle superlattices can be produced through coassembly of achiral metal nanoparticles and porphyrin&#8208;based organic molecules. This chirality transfer from molecules to nanoparticle superstructures across three orders of magnitude in length scale is enabled by the hetero chain&#8208;chain van der Waals interactions. As far as we know, these are the first chiral nanoparticle assemblies based on chirality transfer through weak van der Waals forces. The dimensionality of the nanoparticle superlattices (1D chiral chains, 2D chiral sheets (cones), and 3D chiral particles) can be controlled based on a same synthetic chiral porphyrin molecule. Metalation of these porphyrin molecules with zinc cations results in the switching of molecular packing from J&#8208;type to H&#8208;type, which thereby produces 1D chiral nanoparticle chains. Functionalization of these zinc porphyrins with oleylamine can induce the assembly of nanoparticles into 2D chiral nanoparticle sheets.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen vacancies content and ordering are influencing the oxygen evolution reaction activity of one of the most active perovskite electrocatalyst, PrBaCo2O5+d. It is suggested that a high oxygen vacancy content in the perovskite lattice is beneficial for the activity, while lattice oxygen ordering leads to a drop in the OER activity.







Abstract
The role of the perovskite lattice oxygen in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is systematically studied in the PrBaCo2O5+&#948; family. The reduced number of physical/chemical variables combined with in&#8208;depth characterizations such as neutron dif&#8208;fraction, O K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), magnetization and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies, helps investigating the complex correlation between OER activity and a single perovskite property, such as the oxygen content. Larger amount of oxygen vacancies appears to facilitate the OER, possibly contributing to the mechanism involving the oxidation of lattice oxygen, i.e., the lattice oxygen evolution reaction (LOER). Furthermore, not only the number of vacancies but also their local arrangement in the perovskite lattice influences the OER activity, with a clear drop for the more stable, ordered stoichiometry.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydroboration of Alkynes and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein the photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes using newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2. The hydroborated products were obtained under mild conditions in high yields, excellent diastereoselectivities, a high functional group tolerance and developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. Finally, the reaction mechanism was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic hydroboration of alkenes and alkynes is reported. The use of newly&#8208;designed copper photocatalysts with B2Pin2 permits the formation a boryl radical, which is used for hydroboration of a large panel of alkenes and alkynes. The hydroborated products were isolated in high yields, with excellent diastereoselectivities and a high functional group tolerance under mild conditions. The hydroboration reactions were developed under continuous flow conditions to demonstrate their synthetic utility. The reaction mechanism was studied and suggested an oxidation reaction between an in situ formed borate and the Cu&#8208;photocatalyst in its excited state for the boryl radical formation.

         <title>Structural and Functional Analyses of the Tridomain&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Synthetase FmoA3 for 4&#8208;Methyloxazoline Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dimeric structure of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), FmoA3 which consists of Cy&#8208;A&#8208;PCP domains, was solved by two strategies, X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy. The molecular basis of the &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted amino acid recognition mechanism of the A domain of FmoA3 was proposed. The Cy domain of FmoA3 was expected to lose peptide bond formation activity by eliminating its ability to bind with a donor PCP.







Abstract
Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are attractive targets for bioengineering to generate useful peptides. FmoA3 is a single modular NRPS composed of heterocyclization (Cy), adenylation (A), and peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains. It uses &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine to synthesize a 4&#8208;methyloxazoline ring, probably with another Cy domain in the preceding module FmoA2. Here, we determined the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail homodimeric structures of FmoA3 by X&#8208;ray crystallography (apo&#8208;form, with adenylyl&#8208;imidodiphosphate and &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;seryl&#8208;AMP) and cryogenic electron microscopy single particle analysis, and performed site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments. The data revealed that &#945;&#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;serine can be accommodated in the active site because of the extra space around Ala688. The Cy domains of FmoA2 and FmoA3 catalyze peptide bond formation and heterocyclization, respectively. FmoA3&#8217;s Cy domain seems to lose its donor PCP binding activity. The collective data support a proposed catalytic cycle of FmoA3.

         <title>Enhancing Rechargeable Persistent Luminescence via Organic Dye Sensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Firefly&#8208;like persistent luminescence nanoparticles for accurate imaging guided tumor surgery are reported by Gang Han et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101492). Organic dye molecules act as &#8220;wings&#8221; and can be conjugated with persistent luminescence nanoparticles. Such dye&#8208;sensitized nanoparticles emit boosted afterglow signals for a long period of time without the need for additional light input, reminiscent of a firefly.

         <title>Exploiting Supramolecular Dynamics in Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks to Generate Metal&#8211;Oxide and Metal&#8211;Carbon Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular metal&#8211;phenolic networks, consisting of metal ions coordinated with phenolic motifs, can undergo selective thermodynamic transformations into nanoporous structures, including metal&#8211;carbon networks and metal&#8211;oxide networks, with tunable network organization and surface wettability.







Abstract
Supramolecular complexation is a powerful strategy for engineering materials in bulk and at interfaces. Metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), which are assembled through supramolecular complexes, have emerged as suitable candidates for surface and particle engineering owing to their diverse properties. Herein, we examine the supramolecular dynamics of MPNs during thermal transformation processes. Changes in the local supramolecular network including enlarged pores, ordered aromatic packing, and metal relocation arise from thermal treatment in air or an inert atmosphere, enabling the engineering of metal&#8211;oxide networks (MONs) and metal&#8211;carbon networks, respectively. Furthermore, by integrating photo&#8208;responsive motifs (i.e., TiO2) and silanization, the MONs are endowed with reversible superhydrophobic (&gt;150&#176;) and superhydrophilic (&#8776;0&#176;) properties. By highlighting the thermodynamics of MPNs and their transformation into diverse materials, this work offers a versatile pathway for advanced materials engineering.

Metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs), which are assembled through supramolecular complexes, have emerged as suitable candidates for surface and particle engineering owing to their diverse properties. Herein, we examine the supramolecular dynamics of MPNs during thermal transformation processes. Changes in the local supramolecular network including enlarged pores, ordered aromatic packing, and metal relocation arise from thermal treatment in air or an inert atmosphere, enabling the engineering of metal&#8211;oxide networks (MONs) and metal&#8211;carbon networks, respectively. Furthermore, by integrating photo-responsive motifs (i.e., TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and silanization, the MONs are endowed with reversible superhydrophobic (&amp;gt;150&#176;) and superhydrophilic (&#8776;0&#176;) properties. By highlighting the thermodynamics of MPNs and their transformation into diverse materials, this work offers a versatile pathway for advanced materials engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Implications of Quenching&#8208;to&#8208;Dequenching Switch in Quantitative Cell Uptake and Biodistribution of Dye&#8208;Labeled Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of fluorescence&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments was unveiled by Chun&#8208;Xia Zhao and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202101730). With dye molecules at a solid state, the release and/or degradation of the dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in biological environments led to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity due to the state switch, which has significant implications in quantitative cell uptake and biodistribution studies.

         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;controlled nanoelectrospray ionization explores the thermodynamics of hybrid quadruplex&#8211;duplex oligonucleotide assemblies comprised of multiple domains and brings insight into mutual domain interaction. As described by Renato Zenobi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202016757), thermal denaturation experiments were conducted to reveal unfolding intermediates and changes in thermodynamics DNA complexes depending on the number of domains and their position in a single MS experiment.

         <title>Bioinspired Network Analysis Enabled Divergent Syntheses and Structure Revision of Pentacyclic Cytochalasans</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent syntheses of a series of bioactive pentacyclic cytochalasans is reported by Pema&#8208;Tenzin Puno, Jun Deng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102831). Inspired by nature's way of synthesizing various secondary metabolites from a common precursor to maximize the number of natural products, total synthesis and structure revision of pentacyclic cytochalasans were realized from a common precursor aspochalasin D based on bioinspired structure network analysis and DFT calculations.

         <title>Bowl&#8208;Shaped Pentagon&#8208; and Heptagon&#8208;Embedded Nanographene Containing a Central Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>

         <dc:description>
A bowl&#8208;shaped nitrogen&#8208;doped nanographene composed of a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core substituted with six arene rings circularly bonded with one another, undergoes the bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl inversion with a low barrier. This inversion resembles that of an umbrella flipped by the strong wind. The transition state is not planar, but possesses a rather twisted, S&#8208;shaped conformation with Ci symmetry. The bowl&#8208;inversion mechanism follows a quadruple&#8208;well potential model, as reported by Andrzej&#8197;L. Sobolewski, Micha&#322;&#8197;K. Cyra&#324;ski, Daniel&#8197;T. Gryko et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202104092).

Superprotonic conductivity of sulfamate&#8208;grafted MOF&#8208;808 was described by Yung&#8197;Sam Kim, Seung&#8197;Bin Baek, Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202103191). The modulation of the binding mode of the grafted sulfamate from the monodentate mode to the bridging bidentate mode resulted in more efficient proton conduction by generating more acidic cationic sulfiliminium group (&#8211;S=NH2+).

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;dimensional arrangement of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs), which are a partially oxidized dysprosium(III) phthalocyaninato double&#8208;decker complexes, [DyPc2]Ix, was synthesized in the Communication by Keiichi Katoh, Masahiro Yamashita et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202102666) by using electro&#8208;oxidation and chemical oxidation. The results of spectrophotometric analysis on [DyPc2]Ix are consistent with the Drude model, which theoretically explains the optical response of the metal. Since conductivity was observed at temperatures lower than the spin blocking temperature (TB), magnetoresistance (MR) effects observed as magnetic hysteresis were observed for the SMM. Our strategy may pave the way for the construction of electro&#8208;conductive SMM as spin valves.

         <title>Surface oxygen vacancies on reduced Co3O4(100): superoxide formation and ultra&#8208;low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of molecular oxygen is a fundamental step in almost all catalytic oxidation reactions. We have studied this topic and the role of surface vacancies for Co  3  O  4  (100) films with a synergistic combination of experimental and theoretical methods. We show that the as&#8208;prepared surface is B&#8208;layer terminated and that mild reduction produces oxygen single and double vacancies in this layer. Oxygen adsorption experiments clearly reveal different superoxide species below room temperature. The superoxide desorbs below ~120&#160;K from a vacancy&#8208;free surface and is not active for CO oxidation while superoxide on a surface with oxygen vacancies is stable up to ~270&#160;K and can oxidize CO already at the low temperature of 120&#160;K. The vacancies are not refilled by oxygen from the superoxide, which makes them suitable for long&#8208;term operation. Our joint experimental/theoretical effort highlights the relevance of surface vacancies in catalytic oxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Rate CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products over a Copper&#8208;Copper Iodide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE, substantially higher than Cu or CuI alone. It is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling during CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon hydrocarbon and oxygenate (C2+) products with high energy density and wide availability is of great importance, as it provides a promising way to achieve the renewable energy storage and close the carbon cycle. Herein we design a Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst with abundant Cu0/Cu+ interfaces by physically mixing Cu nanoparticles and CuI powders. The composite catalyst achieves a remarkable C2+ partial current density of 591&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in a flow cell, substantially higher than Cu (329&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and CuI (96&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) counterparts. Induced by alkaline electrolyte and applied potential, the Cu&#8208;CuI composite catalyst undergoes significant reconstruction under CO2RR conditions. The high&#8208;rate C2+ production over Cu&#8208;CuI is ascribed to the presence of residual Cu+ and adsorbed iodine species which improve CO adsorption and facilitate C&#8722;C coupling.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Spin State Cobalt Cations in Spinel Zinc Cobalt Oxide for Spin Channel Propagation and Active Site Enhancement in Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering high&#8208;spin state cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 propagates a spin channel for spin&#8208;selected charge transport and enhances active sites for intermediate adsorption. High&#8208;spin cobalt cations can be directly engineered by varying the calcination temperature.







Abstract
Spinel zinc cobalt oxide (ZnCo2O4) is not considered as a superior catalyst for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the bottleneck reaction in water&#8208;electrolysis. Herein, taking advantage of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that the existence of low&#8208;spin (LS) state cobalt cations hinders the OER activity of spinel zinc cobalt oxide, as the t2g6eg0 configuration gives rise to purely localized electronic structure and exhibits poor binding affinity to the key reaction intermediate. Increasing the spin state of cobalt cations in spinel ZnCo2O4 is found to propagate a spin channel to promote spin&#8208;selected charge transport during OER and generate better active sites for intermediates adsorption. The experiments find increasing the calcination temperature a facile approach to engineer high&#8208;spin (HS) state cobalt cations in ZnCo2O4, while not working for Co3O4. The activity of the best spin&#8208;state&#8208;engineered ZnCo2O4 outperforms other typical Co&#8208;based oxides.

         <title>ZW800&#8208;PEG: A Renal Clearable Zwitterionic Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophore for Potential Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZW800&#8208;PEG is a water&#8208;soluble, non&#8208;sticky, and renal clearable near&#8208;infrared fluorophore owing to the balanced zwitterionic charges. By introducing a stable sulfide linker, it improves serum stability and also exhibits potential for augmenting photothermal therapy. It shows a maximum emission wavelength at 800&#8197;nm, enabling its use for image&#8208;guided interventions in the OR using conventional near&#8208;infrared imaging systems.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has advanced medical imaging and image&#8208;guided interventions during the past three decades. Despite tremendous advances in imaging devices, surprisingly only a few dyes are currently available in the clinic. Previous fluorophores, ZW800&#8208;1A and ZW800&#8208;1C, significantly improved the poor performance of the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green. However, ZW800&#8208;1A is not stable in serum and ZW800&#8208;1C induces severe stacking in aqueous media. To solve such dilemmas, ZW800&#8208;PEG was designed by introducing a flexible yet stable thiol PEG linker. ZW800&#8208;PEG shows high solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents, thus improving renal clearance with minimal binding to serum proteins during systemic circulation. The sulfide group on the meso position of the heptamethine core improves serum stability and physicochemical properties including the maximum emission wavelength shift to 800&#8197;nm, enabling the use of ZW800&#8208;PEG for image&#8208;guided interventions and augmenting photothermal therapy.

         <title>Wearable Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Achieved by a Crystallographic Size Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a size effect that controls the crystallization of perovskite and enhances the passivation effect with g&#8208;C3N4 additive. The similarity in value of lattice constant and distance between double hydrogen binding sites affects crystallization. The combination allows g&#8208;C3N4 to cover tin&#8208;based perovskite, thus improves hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance of films and leads to splendid PCE of wearable device with excellent stability.







Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) demonstrate a potential application in wearable electronics due to its hypotoxicity. However, poor crystal quality is still the bottleneck for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible devices. In this work, graphite phase&#8208;C3N4 (g&#8208;C3N4) is applied into tin&#8208;based perovskite as a crystalline template, which delays crystallization via a size&#8208;effect and passivates defects simultaneously. The double hydrogen bond between g&#8208;C3N4 and formamidine cation can optimize lattice matching and passivation. Moreover, the two&#8208;dimensional network structure of g&#8208;C3N4 can fit on the crystals, resulting an enhanced hydrophobicity and oxidation resistance. Therefore, the flexible tin&#8208;based PSCs with g&#8208;C3N4 realize a stabilized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.56&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis. In addition, the PSCs can maintain 91&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 1000&#8197;h under N2 environment and keep 92&#8201;% of their original PCE after 600&#8197;cycles at a curvature radius of 3&#8197;mm.

         <title>Catalytic Co&#8208;Conversion of CH4 and CO2 Mediated by Rhodium&#8211;Titanium Oxide Anions RhTiO2&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to syngas mediated by single Rh atom&#8208;doped titanium oxide anions (RhTiO2&#8722;) has been experimentally identified. The production of free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) could be achieved at room temperature while the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of the COads from RhTiO2CO&#8722;.







Abstract
Catalytic co&#8208;conversion of methane with carbon dioxide to produce syngas (2&#8201;H2+2&#8201;CO) involves complicated elementary steps and almost all the elementary reactions are performed at the same high temperature conditions in practical thermocatalysis. Here, we demonstrate by mass spectrometric experiments that RhTiO2&#8722; promotes the co&#8208;conversion of CH4 and CO2 to free 2&#8201;H2+CO and an adsorbed CO (COads) at room temperature; the only elementary step that requires the input of external energy is desorption of COads from the RhTiO2CO&#8722; to reform RhTiO2&#8722;. This study not only identifies a promising active species for dry (CO2) reforming of methane to syngas, but also emphasizes the importance of temperature control over elementary steps in practical catalysis, which may significantly alleviate the carbon deposition originating from the pyrolysis of methane.

         <dc:description>
Acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimides (AABIs), nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrenes with two imide functionalities (see structure), were found to exhibit excellent electron affinity, affording an air&#8208;stable radical anion. The intrinsic electron mobility of one derivative obeyed a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor device showed high electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and properties of acridino[2,1,9,8&#8208;klmna]acridine bisimide (AABI), a nitrogen&#8208;doped anthanthrene with two imide functionalities. AABI exhibits excellent electron affinity as evident by its low&#8208;lying LUMO level (&#8722;4.1&#8197;eV vs. vacuum). Single&#8208;electron reduction of one AABI derivative afforded the corresponding radical anion, which was stable under ambient conditions. Photoconductivity measurements suggest that the intrinsic electron mobility of an N&#8208;phenethyl AABI derivative obeys a band&#8208;transport model. Accordingly, an electron mobility of 0.90&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 was attained with the corresponding single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) device. The vacuum&#8208;deposited OFET device consisting of a polycrystalline sample exhibited high electron mobility of up to 0.27&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 even in air. This study demonstrates that dual incorporation of both imide substituents and imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms is an effective strategy to create novel electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;systems.

         <title>Engineering of a Peptide &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Methyltransferase to Methylate Non&#8208;Proteinogenic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide backbone methylation is a highly desired modification. Using split intein, synthetic peptides and an engineered variant of the methylase, fOphMA2, it was possible to enzymatically methylate amide bonds involving non&#8208;natural amino acids. This has application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.







Abstract
Introduction of &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;methylated non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids into peptides can improve their biological activities, membrane permeability and proteolytic stability. This is commonly achieved, in nature and in the lab, by assembling pre&#8208;methylated amino acids. The more appealing route of methylating amide bonds is challenging. Biology has evolved an &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;automethylating enzyme, OphMA, which acts on the amide bonds of peptides fused to its C&#8208;terminus. Due to the ribosomal biosynthesis of its substrate, the activity of this enzyme towards peptides with non&#8208;proteinogenic amino acids has not been addressed. An engineered OphMA, intein&#8208;mediated protein ligation and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis have allowed us to demonstrate the methylation of amide bonds in the context of non&#8208;natural amides. This approach may have application in the biotechnological production of therapeutic peptides.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Giant Conjugated Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant conjugated macrocycles with a diameter of roughly 7&#8197;nm consisting of up to 30 subunits were synthesized on a Ag(111) surface in a two&#8208;step reaction. Site&#8208;selective debromination initiated the synthesis, resulting in arched covalent oligomers and macrocycles, which were assisted by C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits. The subsequent cyclodehydrogenation steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles.







Abstract
We have achieved an on&#8208;surface synthesis of giant conjugated macrocycles having a diameter of &#8776;7&#8197;nm and consisting of up to 30 subunits. The synthesis started with a debrominative coupling of the molecular precursors on a hot Ag(111) surface, leading to the formation of arched oligomeric chains and macrocycles. These products were revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy in combination with density functional theory to be covalent oligomers. These intermediates also display C&#8211;Ag organometallic bonds between parallel molecular subunits due to site&#8208;selective debromination and the asymmetric molecular conformation. Subsequent cyclodehydrogenation at higher temperatures steered the final conjugation of the macrocycles. Our findings provide a novel design strategy toward &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles and open up new opportunities for the precise synthesis of organic nanostructures.

         <title>Effect of External Surface Diffusion Barriers on Platinum/Beta&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization of n&#8208;Pentane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
External surface diffusion barriers on zeolite Beta crystals significantly reduce their apparent catalytic activity in catalyzing isomerization of n&#8208;pentane. Eliminating surface barriers can lead to an improvement in apparent catalytic activity higher than 131&#8201;%.







Abstract
We have developed a generalizable strategy to quantify the effect of surface barriers on zeolite catalysis. Isomerization of n&#8208;pentane, catalyzed by Pt/Beta, is taken as a model reaction system. Firstly, the surface modification by chemical liquid deposition of SiO2 was carried out to control the surface barriers on zeolite Beta crystals. The deposition of SiO2 leads to a very slight change in the physical properties of Beta crystals, but an obvious reduction in Br&#248;nsted acid sites. Diffusion measurements by the zero&#8208;length column (ZLC) method show that the apparent diffusivity of n&#8208;pentane can be more than doubled after SiO2 deposition, indicating that the surface barriers have been weakened. Catalytic performance was tested in a fixed&#8208;bed reactor, showing that the apparent catalytic activity improved by 51&#8211;131&#8201;% after SiO2 deposition. These results provide direct proof that reducing surface barriers can be an effective route to improve zeolite catalyst performance deteriorated by transport limitations.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Silicon&#8208;Stereogenic Dihydrodibenzosilines: Silicon Central&#8208;to&#8208;Axial Chirality Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. A wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chirality are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivity via intramolecular dehydrogenative C&#8722;H silylation.







Abstract
A Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of silicon&#8208;stereogenic dihydrodibenzosilines featuring axially chiral 6&#8208;membered bridged biaryls is demonstrated. In the presence of a RhI catalyst with a chiral diphosphine ligand, a wide range of dihydrodibenzosilines containing both silicon&#8208;central and axial chiralities are conveniently constructed in excellent enantioselectivities via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8722;H silylation. Absolute configuration analysis by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures revealed a novel silicon central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality relay phenomenon, which we believe will inspire further research in the field of asymmetric catalysis and chiroptical materials.

         <title>Molecular Surgery at Microporous MOF for Mesopore Generation and Renovation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plane&#8208;oriented mesopore formation and closure in microporous MOFs were demonstrated mimicking the surgical operation but at molecular level. The established strategy enables formation of hierarchical MOF with tunable porosity. The anisotropic nature of the MOF lattice planes enabled not only engineering the mesopore size and volume, but also controlling the pore shape that could be beneficial for certain kind of new applications in the MOF field.







Abstract
Hierarchically porous MOFs (HP&#8208;MOFs) present advantageous synergism of micro&#8208; and mesopore but challenging in synthetic control at molecular scale. Herein, we present the first example of reversible and controllable mesopore generation and renovation in a microporous MOF of HKUST&#8208;1 via synthetic manipulation at molecular scale. An ammonia&#8208;gas etching strategy is proposed to create mesopores in carboxylate&#8208;based microporous MOFs and thus produce HP&#8208;MOFs. Gas&#8208;phase etching ensures uniform mesopore formation inside the MOF crystals via plane&#8208;oriented cutting the carboxylate&#8208;metal bonds off without affecting the crystal size and morphology. The mesopore size is controlled by the etching temperature, while the mesopore volume could be tuned by adjusting etchant pressure. The generated mesopores could be renovated using MOF precursors solutions so that to achieve controllable mesopore generation/closure, and encapsulation of the adsorbed molecules. This work demonstrates a powerful protocol for precisely tailoring and tuning the properties of MOF materials at molecular scale.

         <title>Engineering Bismuth&#8211;Tin Interface in Bimetallic Aerogel with a 3D Porous Structure for Highly Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to HCOOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12554-12559, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuth&#8211;Tin aerogel was prepared at ambient temperature, resulting in a three&#8208;dimensional porous nanostructure with abundant pores. The material presents excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for formic acid generation with a high Faradaic efficiency (93.9&#8201;%) and partial current density of 9.3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) into valuable hydrocarbons is appealing in alleviating the excessive CO2 level. We present the very first utilization of metallic bismuth&#8211;tin (Bi&#8208;Sn) aerogel for CO2RR with selective HCOOH production. A non&#8208;precious bimetallic aerogel of Bi&#8208;Sn is readily prepared at ambient temperature, which exhibits 3D morphology with interconnected channels, abundant interfaces and a hydrophilic surface. Superior to Bi and Sn, the Bi&#8208;Sn aerogel exposes more active sites and it has favorable mass transfer properties, which endow it with a high FEHCOOH of 93.9&#8201;%. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;Sn aerogel achieves a FEHCOOH of ca. 90&#8201;% that was maintained for 10&#8197;h in a flow battery. In&#8197;situ ATR&#8208;FTIR measurements confirmed that the formation of *HCOO is the rate&#8208;determining step toward formic acid generation. DFT demonstrated the coexistence of Bi and Sn optimized the energy barrier for the production of HCOOH, thereby improving the catalytic activity.

         <title>Tailoring a Dynamic Metal&#8211;Polymer Interaction to Improve Catalyst Selectivity and Longevity in Hydrogenation</title>

We synthesized a series of polymers with similar framework structures but different metal&#8208;ligating functionalities as supports for Pd catalysts to control the dynamic metal&#8211;polymer interactions (DMPI) and catalytic properties. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface via DMPI, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation.







Abstract
Controlling metal&#8211;support interactions is important for tuning the catalytic properties of supported metal catalysts. Here, premade Pd particles are supported on stable polymers containing different ligating functionalities to control the metal&#8211;polymer interactions and their catalytic properties in industrially relevant acetylene partial hydrogenation. The polymers containing strongly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;SH and Ar&#8208;S&#8208;Ar) can form a polymer overlayer on the Pd surface, which enables selective acetylene adsorption and partial hydrogenation to ethylene without deactivation. In contrast, polymers with weakly ligating groups (e.g., Ar&#8208;O&#8208;Ar) do not form an overlayer, resulting in non&#8208;selective hydrogenation and fast deactivation, similar to Pd catalysts on conventional inorganic supports. The results imply that tuning the metal&#8211;polymer interactions via rational polymer design can provide an efficient way of synthesizing selective and stable catalysts for hydrogenation.

With the guidance of machine learning, the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT (CIE coordinates) of 3107&#8197;K (0.48, 0.51), 4071&#8197;K (0.37, 0.37), and 4548&#8197;K (0.36, 0.36), and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5106&#8197;K (0.34, 0.37), 5632&#8197;K (0.33, 0.33), and 6034&#8197;K (0.32, 0.35) were obtained accurately.







Abstract
Here, we show the fabrication of the carbon dots (CDs) with green and orange emissions from PTCDA (perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride). Using these CDs as emitters, the orange (or green) CDs LEDs were fabricated, which show electroluminescence (EL) spectra centered at 560&#8197;nm (or 498&#8197;nm) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.98&#8201;% (1.76&#8201;%) adhering a luminescence of 626&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 (or 519&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2). The machine learning was successfully used to predict PL CCT value. With the model, the white photoluminescence (PL) emission with adjustable correlated color temperature (CCT) from 3093 to 11018&#8197;K via combining blue, green, and orange CDs was achieved. Then, we obtained the warm white CDs LEDs with CCT of 3107, 4071 and 4548&#8197;K, and cold white CDs LEDs with CCT of 5632 (CIE coordinates of (0.33, 0.33), EQE: 1.18&#8201;%, luminescence: 598&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2) and 6034&#8197;K accurately.

         <title>Deliberate Construction of Polyoxoniobates Exploiting the Carbonate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12461-12466, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonate reacts with the labile decaniobate&#8208;POM, yielding new polyoxoniobates featuring carbonate ligands. The carbonate ligands reinforce oligomerization of clusters in solution that is observed in the solid&#8208;state and scaffolds and stabilizes larger cluster aggregates. Lanthanides directly replace Nb in PONb clusters, rather than associate electrostatically as previously observed. The lanthanide substitution is enabled by carbonate ligation.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs, metals=VV, NbV, TaV, MoVI, WVI) are molecular metal oxides that can be isolated without capping ligands. The high negative charge of polyoxoniobates (PONb) provides strong interactions with heterocations, advantageous for electrostatic assembly of modular materials. In four single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, we demonstrate that carbonate combined with the very reactive decaniobate [Nb10O28]6&#8722; reassembles into a new decaniobate, [Nb10O25(CO3)6]12&#8722;, featuring three carbonate&#8208;ligated Nb&#8208;polyhedra. These Nb&#8208;sites can be replaced by heterometals (lanthanides), and the tridentate carbonate can serve as an anchor point to build niobate&#8208;frameworks. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and two additional X&#8208;ray structures reveal that the reaction pathway proceeds through a Nb24&#8208;PONb intermediate, and the obtained PONb (with or without carbonate) is counterion, temperature, and solvent&#8208;dependent (water or mixed water&#8208;methanol). This provides an uncommon level of control for PONb chemistry.

A peptide coupling reaction is described that relies mechanistically on sunlight activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.







Abstract
Amino acid and peptide couplings are widely used in fields related to pharma and materials. Still, current peptide synthesis continues to rely on the use of expensive, water sensitive, and waste&#8208;generating coupling reagents, which are often prepared in multi&#8208;step sequences and used in excess. Herein is described a peptide coupling reaction design that relies mechanistically on sun&#8208;light activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;pyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex to generate a novel coupling reagent in situ. The resulting coupling method is rapid, does not require dry solvents or inert atmosphere, and is compatible with all the most common amino acids and protecting groups. Peptide couplings can be run on gram&#8208;scale, without the use of special equipment. This method has a significantly reduced environmental and financial footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions. Experimental and computational studies support the proposed mechanism.

         <title>Prodrug Activation by Gold Artificial Metalloenzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Synthesis of Phenanthridinium Derivatives via Hydroamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12446-12454, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold artificial metalloenzyme catalyzes the conversion of a prodrug into a phenanthridinium&#8208;based anticancer drug with a good turnover number (&gt;100) via hydroamination under mild conditions. The gold artificial metalloenzyme successfully triggers drug synthesis to achieve cancer therapy in cell&#8208;based assays.







Abstract
An emerging approach in the field of targeted drug delivery is the establishment of abiotic metal&#8208;triggered prodrug mechanisms that can control the release of bioactive drugs. Currently, the design of prodrugs that use abiotic metals as a trigger relies heavily on uncaging strategies. Here, we introduce a strategy based on the gold&#8208;catalyzed activation of a phenanthridinium&#8208;based prodrug via hydroamination under physiological conditions. To make the prodrug strategy biocompatible, a gold artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) based on human serum albumin, rather than the free gold metal complex, was used as a trigger for prodrug activation. The albumin&#8208;based gold ArM protected the catalytic activity of the bound gold metal even in the presence of up to 1&#8197;mM glutathione in vitro. The drug synthesized via the gold ArM exerted a therapeutic effect in cell&#8208;based assays, highlighting the potential usefulness of the gold ArM in anticancer applications.

&lt;p&gt;A gold artificial metalloenzyme catalyzes the conversion of a prodrug into a phenanthridinium-based anticancer drug with a good turnover number (&amp;gt;100) via hydroamination under mild conditions. The gold artificial metalloenzyme successfully triggers drug synthesis to achieve cancer therapy in cell-based assays.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An emerging approach in the field of targeted drug delivery is the establishment of abiotic metal-triggered prodrug mechanisms that can control the release of bioactive drugs. Currently, the design of prodrugs that use abiotic metals as a trigger relies heavily on uncaging strategies. Here, we introduce a strategy based on the gold-catalyzed activation of a phenanthridinium-based prodrug via hydroamination under physiological conditions. To make the prodrug strategy biocompatible, a gold artificial metalloenzyme (ArM) based on human serum albumin, rather than the free gold metal complex, was used as a trigger for prodrug activation. The albumin-based gold ArM protected the catalytic activity of the bound gold metal even in the presence of up to 1&#8197;mM glutathione in vitro. The drug synthesized via the gold ArM exerted a therapeutic effect in cell-based assays, highlighting the potential usefulness of the gold ArM in anticancer applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Organic Cages</title>

Engineering mesopores into microporous organic cages to create hierarchically porous organic cage was explored. The beneficial effect of hierarchical pores on the selective adsorption properties and enhanced catalytic performances was demonstrated.







Abstract
Imparting mesopores to organic cages of an intrinsic microporous nature to build up hierarchically porous cage soft materials is a grand challenge and will reshape the property and application scope of traditional organic cage molecules. Herein, we discovered how to engineer mesopores into microporous organic cages via their host&#8211;guest interactions with long chain ionic surfactants. Equally important, the ionic head of surfactants equips the supramolecularly assembled porous structures with charge&#8208;selective uptake and release function in solution. Interestingly, such hierarchically porous organic cage can serve as a nanoreactor once trapping enzymes within the cavity, which show 5&#8208;fold enhanced activity of enzymatic catalysis when compared with the free enzymes.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Asymmetric Aminoazidation and Diazidation of Styrenes</title>

Biologically accessible hydroxylation in nature often proceeds through a radical rebound process. However, such a radical rebound usually leads to non&#8208;stereoselectivity. Rendering the radical rebound enantioselective is quite challenging. Herein, the first radical asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation on acyclic systems via radical rebound is reported.







Abstract
Asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of alkenes are straightforward strategies to build value&#8208;added chiral nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds from feedstock chemicals. They provide direct access to chiral organoazides and complement enantioselective diamination. Despite the advances in non&#8208;asymmetric reactions, asymmetric aminoazidation or diazidation based on acyclic systems has not been previously reported. Here we describe the iron&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric aminoazidation and diazidation of styrenes. The method is practically useful and requires relatively low loading of catalyst and chiral ligand. With mild reaction conditions, the reaction can be completed on a 20&#8197;mmol scale. Studies of the mechanism suggest that the reaction proceeds via a radical pathway and involves stereocontrol of an acyclic free radical which probably takes place through a group transfer mechanism.

         <title>Truly Monodisperse Molecular Nanoparticles of Cerium Dioxide of 2.4&#8197;nm dimensions: A {Ce100O167} Cluster</title>

A bottom&#8208;up molecular approach yields a giant Ce/O cluster with a 2.4&#8197;nm {Ce100O167} core within a monolayer shell of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands. The crystal structure shows it has the fluorite structure of bulk CeO2 and it is thus an ultra&#8208;small piece of CeO2 in molecular form (a molecular nanoparticle) providing structural information to atomic resolution of surface features important to catalysis by CeO2 nanoparticles.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;small nanoparticles of CeO2 obtained in molecular form, so&#8208;called molecular nanoparticles, have been limited to date to a family whose largest member is of nuclearity Ce40 with a {Ce40O58} core atom count. Herein we report that a synthetic procedure has been developed to the cation [Ce100O149(OH)18(O2CPh)60(PhCO2H)12(H2O)20]16+, a member with a much higher Ce100 nuclearity and a {Ce100O167} core that is more akin to the smallest ceria nanoparticles. Its crystal structure reveals it to possess a 2.4&#8197;nm size and high D2d symmetry, and it has also allowed identification of core surface features including facet composition, the presence and location of Ce3+and H+ (i.e. HO&#8722;) ions, and the binding modes of the ligand monolayer of benzoate, benzoic acid, and water ligands.

         <title>Unravelling the Fast Alkali&#8208;Ion Dynamics in Paramagnetic Battery Materials Combined with NMR and Deep&#8208;Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>

The unambiguous assignment of chemical shift in paramagnetic battery materials relies on first&#8208;principles calculation, while the state&#8208;of&#8208;art computational methodology is limited in sluggish dynamic systems. We incorporate hundreds of nanoseconds deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to expanding the ssNMR application in high&#8208;rate cathode materials.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) has received extensive attention in characterizing alkali&#8208;ion battery materials because it is highly sensitive for probing the local environment and dynamic information of atoms/ions. However, precise spectral assignment cannot be carried out by conventional DFT for high&#8208;rate battery materials at room temperature. Herein, combining DFT calculation of paramagnetic shift and deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulation to achieve the converged Na+ distribution at hundreds of nanoseconds, we obtain the statistically averaged paramagnetic shift, which is in excellent agreement with ssNMR measurements. Two 23Na shifts induced by different stacking sequences of transition metal layers are revealed in the fast chemically exchanged NMR spectra of P2&#8208;type Na2/3(Mg1/3Mn2/3)O2 for the first time. This DPMD simulation auxiliary protocol can be beneficial to a wide range of ssNMR analysis in fast chemically exchanged material systems.

         <title>Beyond Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12577-12584, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphines are notorious in acting exclusively as terminal donors, binding a single metal center. We have discovered that a non&#8208;traditional scenario is possible where the phosphorus(III) atom of a R3P ligand bridges three metal atoms at once. Such triply bridging pattern is first observed in the [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes, which also exhibit remarkable luminescence properties.







Abstract
The first example of a triply bridging (&#956;3&#8208;P) phosphine ligand has been discovered in the crown&#8208;shaped [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;Hal)3L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes supported by tris[2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)ethyl]phosphine (L). Theoretical analysis completely confirms the observed &#956;3&#8208;P&#8208;bridging pattern, revealing the interaction of the same lone pair of phosphorus with three valence 4s&#8208;orbitals of Cu atoms. The presented complexes exhibit outstanding blue phosphorescence (&#955;em=442&#8211;465&#8197;nm) with the quantum efficiency reaching 100&#8201;%. The complex [Cu3(&#956;2&#8208;I)3L] also exhibits remarkable thermo&#8208; and mechanochromic luminescence resulting in a sharp change in the emission colour upon external stimuli. These findings essentially contribute to coordination chemistry of the pnictine ligands.

     alt="Beyond Classical Coordination Chemistry: The First Case of a Triply Bridging Phosphine Ligand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphines are notorious in acting exclusively as terminal donors, binding a single metal center. We have discovered that a non-traditional scenario is possible where the phosphorus(III) atom of a R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P ligand bridges three metal atoms at once. Such triply bridging pattern is first observed in the [Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Hal)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;L] (Hal=Cl, Br, or I) complexes, which also exhibit remarkable luminescence properties.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Encapsulated with DNAzyme for Intracellular Drug Synthesis and Self&#8208;Sufficient Gene Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12431-12437, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergetic therapy nanoplatform was developed by encapsulating the therapeutic DNAzyme into Cu/Zn bimetallic MOF for intracellular drug synthesis and self&#8208;sufficient gene therapy. This design can not only avoid the side effects of traditional chemotherapy, but also effectively inhibit tumor metastasis by cleaving the oncogene substrate.







Abstract
Although chemotherapy is one of the most widely used cancer treatments, there are serious side effects, drug resistance, and secondary metastasis. To address these problems, herein we designed a bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) encapsulated with DNAzyme for co&#8208;triggered in situ cancer drug synthesis and DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Once in cancer cells, MOFs would disassemble and liberate copper ions, zinc ions, and DNAzyme under the acidic environment of lysosomes. Copper ions can catalyze the synthesis of the chemotherapeutic drug through copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction after being reduced to CuI; zinc ions act as the cofactor to activate the cleavage activity of DNAzyme. The anticancer drug is synthesized intracellularly and can kill cancer cells on site to minimize side effects to normal organisms. The activated DNAzyme starts gene therapy to inhibit tumor proliferation and metastasis by targeting and cleaving oncogene substrates.

         <title>Functionalization of Silk by AIEgens through Facile Bioconjugation: Full&#8208;Color Fluorescence and Long&#8208;Term Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12424-12430, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent silks with full&#8208;color emissions were fabricated through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation with five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens). White light&#8208;emitting silk was prepared and demonstrated potential applications in flexible displays. Moreover, red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silk materials were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging.







Abstract
Silkworm silk is a promising natural biopolymer for textile and biomedical applications for its remarkable flexibility, excellent biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. The functionalization of silks makes them more versatile for flexible displays and visible bioscaffolds. However, fluorescent silks are normally fabricated through unstable physical absorption or complicated chemical reactions under harsh conditions. Herein, we developed a simple strategy for preparing fluorescent silks. Five aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) with activated alkynes were synthesized by rational molecular design, and then reacted with silk fibers through facile metal&#8208;free click bioconjugation. The resulting conjugates show bright full&#8208;color emissions and high stability. A white light&#8208;emitting silk was fabricated by simultaneous bioconjugation with red&#8208;, green&#8208; and blue&#8208;emissive AIEgens. The red&#8208;emissive AIEgen&#8208;functionalized silks were successfully applied for long&#8208;term cell tracking and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, demonstrating great potential for tissue engineering and bioscaffold monitoring.

         <title>Lignin Compounds to Monoaromatics: Selective Cleavage of C&#8722;O Bonds over a Brominated Ruthenium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12513-12523, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brominated supported Ru catalyst was developed for the cleavage of C&#8722;O linkages in aryl ethers (reaching yield 90.3&#8201;% to monoaromatics from diphenyl ether) in lignin compounds without hydrogenation of the aromatic rings. Both selective poisoning of terrace sites and electronic promotion of defect sites contribute to the catalytic performance.







Abstract
The cleavage of C&#8722;O linkages in aryl ethers in biomass&#8208;derived lignin compounds without hydrogenation of the aromatic rings is a major challenge for the production of sustainable mono&#8208;aromatics. Conventional strategies over the heterogeneous metal catalysts require the addition of homogeneous base additives causing environmental problems. Herein, we propose a heterogeneous Ru/C catalyst modified by Br atoms for the selective direct cleavage of C&#8722;O bonds in diphenyl ether without hydrogenation of aromatic rings reaching the yield of benzene and phenol as high as 90.3&#8201;% and increased selectivity to mono&#8208;aromatics (97.3 vs. 46.2&#8201;% for initial Ru) during depolymerization of lignin. Characterization of the catalyst indicates selective poisoning by Br of terrace sites over Ru nanoparticles, which are active in the hydrogenation of aromatic rings, while the defect sites on the edges and corners remain available and provide higher intrinsic activity in the C&#8722;O bond cleavage.

         <title>Automated Quantification of Hydroxyl Reactivities: Prediction of Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12413-12423, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A so&#8208;called &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; program has been developed to foresee and predict the yield and stereoselectivity of glycosylation reactions based on the properties of various donors, acceptors, activation systems and solvents. The program statistically analyzes and compares the relative reactivity value (RRV) of donors and the acceptor nucleophilic constant (Aka) of acceptors.







Abstract
The stereoselectivity and yield in glycosylation reactions are paramount but unpredictable. We have developed a database of acceptor nucleophilic constants (Aka) to quantify the nucleophilicity of hydroxyl groups in glycosylation influenced by the steric, electronic and structural effects, providing a connection between experiments and computer algorithms. The subtle reactivity differences among the hydroxyl groups on various carbohydrate molecules can be defined by Aka, which is easily accessible by a simple and convenient automation system to assure high reproducibility and accuracy. A diverse range of glycosylation donors and acceptors with well&#8208;defined reactivity and promoters were organized and processed by the designed software program &#8220;GlycoComputer&#8221; for prediction of glycosylation reactions without involving sophisticated computational processing. The importance of Aka was further verified by random forest algorithm, and the applicability was tested by the synthesis of a Lewis A skeleton to show that the stereoselectivity and yield can be accurately estimated.

         <title>Merging Reagent Modulation and Remote Anchimeric Assistance for Glycosylation: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Glycans up to a 30&#8208;mer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12597-12606, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging reagent modulation and a 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl remote anchimeric assistance glycosylation strategy has been developed to achieve the first highly stereoselective synthesis of the branched Dendrobium Huoshanense glycans with the immunostimulating activities and the linear Longan glycans containing up to 30 contiguous 1,2&#8208;cis glucosidic bonds with anti&#8208;cancer activities.







Abstract
The efficient synthesis of long, branched, and complex carbohydrates containing multiple 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic linkages is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a merging reagent modulation and 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl remote anchimeric assistance glycosylation strategy, which is successfully applied to the first highly stereoselective synthesis of the branched Dendrobium Huoshanense glycans and the linear Longan glycans containing up to 30 contiguous 1,2&#8208;cis glucosidic bonds. DFT calculations shed light on the origin of the much higher stereoselectivities of 1,2&#8208;cis glucosylation with 6&#8208;O&#8208;levulinoyl group than 6&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl or 6&#8208;O&#8208;benzoyl groups. Orthogonal one&#8208;pot glycosylation strategy based on glycosyl ortho&#8208;alkynylbenzoates and ortho&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylvinyl)benzoates has been demonstrated in the efficient synthesis of complex glycans, precluding such issues as aglycon transfer inherent to orthogonal one&#8208;pot synthesis based on thioglycosides.

         <title>Construction of Flexible Amine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by Catalysis and Reduction of Formic Acid via the Eschweiler&#8211;Clarke Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12396-12405, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the Eschweiler&#8211;Clarke reaction, a series of flexible amine&#8208;linked COFs was synthesized by catalysis and reduction of formic acid. The unique bifunctional properties of formic acid can not only catalyze the formation of rigid C=N bond like acetic acid, the most common catalyst in COF synthesis, but also reduce and transform it to flexible C&#8722;N bond simultaneously, giving COFs the accommodative adaptability to guest molecules.







Abstract
Compared to the current mainstream rigid covalent organic frameworks (COFs) linked by imine bonds, flexible COFs have certain advantages of elasticity and self&#8208;adaptability, but their construction and application are greatly limited by the complexity in synthesis and difficulty in obtaining regular structure. Herein, we reported for the first time a series of flexible amine&#8208;linked COFs with high crystallinity synthesized by formic acid with unique catalytic and reductive bifunctional properties, rather than acetic acid, the most common catalyst for COF synthesis. The reaction mechanism was demonstrated to be a synchronous in situ reduction during the formation of imine bond. The flexibilities of the products endow them with accommodative adaptability to guest molecules, thus increasing the adsorption capacities for nitrogen and iodine by 27&#8201;% and 22&#8201;%, respectively. Impressively, a novel concept of flexibilization degree was proposed firstly, which provides an effective approach to rationally measure the flexibility of COFs.

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8211;Shell Gold Nanoparticles and Controllable Assemblies for SERS Ratiometric Detection of MicroRNA</title>

A series of asymmetrical plasmonic core&#8211;shell nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) are created, displaying tailorable optical properties. Using amphiphilic polymer brushes, core&#8208;to&#8208;core or shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell dimers with controllable spatial precision and position of EM field enhancement are fabricated. DNA linkers are utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%), enabling them to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors.







Abstract
Janus nanogap gold nanoparticles (JAuNNPs) with varying proportions of Au shell coverage of (ca. 100/75/50/25&#8201;%) are presented. The internal nanogap between the partial Au shell and core caused asymmetric optical behavior; tunability depends on the degree of Au shell coverage and structural asymmetry. The shell&#8208;to&#8208;shell or core&#8208;to&#8208;core JAuNNDs(50&#8201;%) were self&#8208;assembled from amphiphilic JAuNNPs(50&#8201;%) by tuning the hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymer brushes on the Au core or shell. The positions of electromagnetic field enhancement of JAuNNDs varied with geometrical configurations because of hybridized plasmonic coupling effects. Furthermore, DNA linkers were utilized to form JAuNND12(50&#8201;%). By combining with Raman molecules, ratiometric SERS signals could be generated, enabling JAuNND12(50&#8201;%) to image the distribution of miR&#8208;21 in living cells and tumors. Asymmetric JAuNNPs allowed facile conjugation of various linkage molecules to fabricate dimeric nanostructures.

Herein, we have designed and prepared FRET&#8208;based two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MTP&#8211;MSNs) for multiplexed intracellular imaging and targeted cancer therapy for the first time. After incubation with cancer cells, MTP&#8211;MSNs could release drugs and performed multicolor two&#8208;photon cellular imaging. These MTP&#8211;MSNs provide a promising system for traceable targeted cancer therapy with further applications in multiplex intracellular imaging.







Abstract
The novel theranostic nanosystems based on two&#8208;photon fluorescence can achieve higher spatial resolution of deep tissue imaging for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of a variety of cancers. Herein, we have designed and prepared FRET&#8208;based two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MTP&#8211;MSNs) for single&#8208;excitation multiplexed intracellular imaging and targeted cancer therapy for the first time. This nanosystem includes two constituents, containing (1) multicolor two&#8208;photon mesoporous silica nanoparticles and (2) cancer cell&#8208;targeting aptamers that act as gatekeepers for MTP&#8211;MSNs. After incubation with cancer cells, the Dox&#8208;loaded and aptamer&#8208;capped MTP&#8211;MSNs could be internalized into the cells, opening the pores and releasing the drug. Furthermore, using two&#8208;photon multicolor fluorescence, MTP&#8211;MSNs could serve as good contrast agents for multicolor two&#8208;photon intracellular imaging with increased imaging depth and improved spatial localization of tissue. In sum, these multicolor MTP&#8211;MSNs provide a promising system for traceable targeted cancer therapy with further applications in multiplex intracellular imaging and the screening of drug.

         <title>A Cysteine&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Red Phosphorus Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12524-12531, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox method was developed for fabrication of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs). Cysteine was responsible for assembly of the RPNSs, and the addition of acetylacetonate enabled the construction of doped RPNSs. In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results confirmed that native RPNSs induce drastic autophagy in tumor chemotherapy.







Abstract
Among phosphorus&#8208;based nanomaterials, layered black phosphorus and violet phosphorus have been actively explored in the past decade. However, methods for the synthesis of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs) is lacking, even though red phosphorus (RP) is commercially available at low cost and has excellent chemical stability at room temperature. We report an efficient strategy for fabrication of RPNSs and doped RPNSs using cysteine as a reducing reagent. Data from in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies suggested that RPNSs can trigger production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and subsequent autophagy&#8208;mediated cell death in a shape&#8208;dependent manner. Our findings provide a method for construction of layered RP nanomaterials and they present a unique mechanism for the application of phosphorus&#8208;based materials in nanomedicines.

In&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo results confirmed that native RPNSs induce drastic autophagy in tumor chemotherapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among phosphorus-based nanomaterials, layered black phosphorus and violet phosphorus have been actively explored in the past decade. However, methods for the synthesis of red phosphorus nanosheets (RPNSs) is lacking, even though red phosphorus (RP) is commercially available at low cost and has excellent chemical stability at room temperature. We report an efficient strategy for fabrication of RPNSs and doped RPNSs using cysteine as a reducing reagent. Data from in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies suggested that RPNSs can trigger production of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and subsequent autophagy-mediated cell death in a shape-dependent manner. Our findings provide a method for construction of layered RP nanomaterials and they present a unique mechanism for the application of phosphorus-based materials in nanomedicines.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Covalent Organic Framework Film for Three&#8208;State Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromism and a Molecular Logic Gate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12498-12503, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film was synthesized and exhibited three&#8208;state electrochromic properties with sub&#8208;second response time and long retention time in the near&#8208;infrared region. Taking potential and absorbance as input and output signal, respectively, a mimicking logic gate with optical memory functions was demonstrated based on the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film.







Abstract
A Kagome structure covalent organic framework (COF) film with three&#8208;state NIR electrochromic properties was designed and synthesized. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film is composed of hexagonal nanosheets with high crystallinity and has three reversible color states at different applied potentials. It has high absorption spectra changes in the NIR region, ascribed to the strong intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) interaction of the Class III mixed&#8208;valence systems of the conjugated triphenylamine species. The film showed sub&#8208;second response time (1.3&#8197;s for coloring and 0.7&#8197;s for bleaching at 1050&#8197;nm) and long retention time in the NIR region. COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film shows superior NIR electrochromic properties in term of response time and stability, attributed to the highly ordered porous structure and the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking structure of the COFTPDA&#8208;PDA architecture. The COFTPDA&#8208;PDA film was applied in mimicking a flip&#8208;flop logic gate with optical memory function.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of Hot Carriers in Plasmonic Catalysis of C&#8722;N Bond Forming Reaction of Amines</title>

A simple gold nanoparticle catalyzes the oxidative coupling of benzylamine to form imine in presence of visible light. Photoexcitation of Au NP generates an electron&#8211;hole pair that activates adsorbates (reactants) at Au NP surface to form a strong oxidant&#8211;reductant pair (benzylamine radical cation and superoxide radical), which is conducive for the reaction at a low temperature, with high product yield and selectivity.







Abstract
Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous utilization of both the hot carriers (electrons and holes) in the photocatalytic transformation of benzylamine to N&#8208;benzylidenebenzylamine and the scope of reaction has also been successfully demonstrated with catalytic oxidation of 4&#8208;methoxybenzylamine. The wavelength&#8208;dependent excitation of AuNP allows us to tune the potential energy of charge carriers relative to the redox potential of the reactants which leads to energetically favorable product formation on the nanoparticle surface. We capture the formation of reaction intermediates and products by using in situ Raman spectroscopy, complemented by NMR spectroscopy and GC&#8208;MS. Based on the experimental substantiations, a plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Water Oxidation: O&#8211;O Bond Formation via Intramolecular Oxo&#8211;Oxo Interaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12467-12474, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three binuclear Fe complexes are tested as molecular water oxidation catalysts. O&#8722;O bond formation can be achieved via intramolecular oxo&#8211;oxo interaction rather than by water nucleophilic attack (WNA), and the catalytic performance can be effectively controlled by the framework of the ligand.







Abstract
Herein, we report the importance of structure regulation on the O&#8722;O bond formation process in binuclear iron catalysts. Three complexes, [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)(OH2)2(TPA)2]4+ (1), [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)(OH2)2(6&#8208;HPA)]4+ (2) and [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;O)(OH2)2(BPMAN)]4+ (3), have been designed as electrocatalysts for water oxidation in 0.1&#8197;M NaHCO3 solution (pH&#8197;8.4). We found that 1 and 2 are molecular catalysts and that O&#8722;O bond formation proceeds via oxo&#8211;oxo coupling rather than by the water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway. In contrast, complex 3 displays negligible catalytic activity. DFT calculations suggested that the anti to syn isomerization of the two high&#8208;valent Fe=O moieties in these catalysts takes place via the axial rotation of one Fe=O unit around the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;Fe center. This is followed by the O&#8722;O bond formation via an oxo&#8211;oxo coupling pathway at the FeIVFeIV state or via oxo&#8211;oxyl coupling pathway at the FeIVFeV state. Importantly, the rigid BPMAN ligand in complex 3 limits the anti to syn isomerization and axial rotation of the Fe=O moiety, which accounts for the negligible catalytic activity.

         <title>A Ge/Carbon Atomic&#8208;Scale Hybrid Anode Material: A Micro&#8211;Nano Gradient Porous Structure with High Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12539-12546, May 25, 2021. </description>

Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500&#8201;&#176;C), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom&#8208;level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
The continuous growth of the solid&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI) and material crushing are the fundamental issues that hinder the application of Ge anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Solving Ge deformation crushing during discharge/charge cycles is challenging using conventional carbon coating modification methods. Due to the chemical stability and high melting point of carbon (3500&#8201;&#176;C), Ge/carbon hybridization at the atomic level is challenging. By selecting a suitable carbon source and introducing an active medium, we have achieved the Ge/carbon doping at the atom&#8208;level, and this Ge/carbon anode shows excellent electrochemical performance. The reversible capacity is maintained at 1127&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles (2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (2&#8211;71&#8197;cycles), 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 (72&#8211;1000&#8197;cycles)) with a retention of 84&#8201;% compared to the second cycle. The thickness of the SEI is only 17.4&#8197;nm after 1000&#8197;cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance and stable SEI fully reflect the application potential of this material.

         <title>Design of Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Cr2O3 Spheres for Metabolic Fingerprinting</title>

Multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres displayed strong photo&#8208;response for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites, thereby enabling fast and sensitive metabolic profiling in bio&#8208;fluids. Based on the decoded urine and serum metabolic fingerprints, we performed machine learning to discriminate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls with high specificity and selectivity.







Abstract
Schizophrenia (SZ) detection enables effective treatment to improve the clinical outcome, but objective and reliable SZ diagnostics are still limited. An ideal diagnosis of SZ suited for robust clinical screening must address detection throughput, low invasiveness, and diagnosis accuracy. Herein, we built a multi&#8208;shelled hollow Cr2O3 spheres (MHCSs) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI MS) platform for the direct metabolic profiling of biofluids towards SZ diagnostics. The MHCSs displayed strong light absorption for enhanced ionization and microscale surface roughness with stability for the effective LDI of metabolites. We profiled urine and serum metabolites (&#8776;1&#8197;&#956;L) with the enhanced LDI efficacy in seconds. We discriminated SZ patients (SZs) from healthy controls (HCs) with the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 1.000 for the blind test. We identified four compounds with optimal diagnostic power as a simplified metabolite panel for SZ and demonstrated the metabolite quantification for clinic use. Our approach accelerates the growth of new platforms toward a precision diagnosis in the near future.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Noncovalently Fused&#8208;Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Noncovalent Intramolecular Interactions and End&#8208;Group Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12475-12481, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a series of noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions. Combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were achieved.







Abstract
Noncovalently fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have attracted much attention in recent years owing to their advantages of simple synthetic routes, high yields and low costs. However, the efficiencies of NFREAs based organic solar cells (OSCs) are still far behind those of fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREAs). Herein, a series of NFREAs with S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent intramolecular interactions were designed and synthesized with a two&#8208;step synthetic route. Upon introducing &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;groups into the backbones, the electronic properties, charge transport, film morphology, and energy loss were precisely tuned by fine&#8208;tuning the degree of multi&#8208;fluorination. As a result, a record PCE of 14.53&#8201;% in labs and a certified PCE of 13.8&#8201;% for NFREAs based devices were obtained. This contribution demonstrated that combining the strategies of noncovalent conformational locks and &#960;&#8208;extended end&#8208;group engineering is a simple and effective way to explore high&#8208;performance NFREAs.

         <title>Functionalized Phosphonium Cations Enable Zinc Metal Reversibility in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12438-12445, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of phosphonium&#8208;based supporting salts and a subtle difference in their ligand chemistry remarkably improves the reversibility of aqueous Zn electrolytes. By promoting interphase formation, P444(2O1)&#8208;TFSI supports a Zn coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even at 1.17&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle, and a stable Zn&#8741;Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cell cycling.







Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc metal batteries promise attractive advantages including safety, high volumetric energy density, and low cost; however, such benefits cannot be unlocked unless Zn reversibility meets stringent commercial viability. Herein, we report remarkable improvements on Zn reversibility in aqueous electrolytes when phosphonium&#8208;based cations are used to reshape interfacial structures and interphasial chemistries, particularly when their ligands contain an ether linkage. This novel aqueous electrolyte supports unprecedented Zn reversibility by showing dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping for over 6400&#8197;h at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, or over 280&#8197;h at 2.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with coulombic efficiency above 99&#8201;% even with 20&#8201;% Zn utilization per cycle. Excellent full cell performance is demonstrated with Na2V6O16&#8901;1.63&#8201;H2O cathode, which cycles for 2000 times at 300&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. The microscopic characterization and modeling identify the mechanism of unique interphase chemistry from phosphonium and its functionalities as the key factors responsible for dictating reversible Zn chemistry

A gold catalyst promotes the sequential cleavage of the S&#8722;O and N&#8722;S bonds of a sulfinyl group, leading to S&#8208;functionalized azirines. As Itaru Nakamura et&#8197;al. illustrate in their Communication on page&#8197;12248, the transformation is like making plastic models: A golden diagonal plier cuts these bonds, and the cut out parts are assembled into the product using an alkyne triple bond unit. Substituents in the product can be chosen from the kit as desired.

A peptide coupling method that relies on sunlight activation of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine&#8211;alkyl halide charge&#8208;transfer complex for the in&#8197;situ generation of a novel coupling reagent is described by Yoav Eichen, Alex&#8197;M. Szpilman, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;12406. The reaction is rapid, water&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;tolerant, and compatible with all common amino acids and protective groups. It is characterized by a significantly reduced environmental, energetical, and economic footprint compared to standard peptide coupling reactions.

Chlorophyll&#8197;f (Chl&#8201;f)&#8208;containing Photosystem&#8197;II absorbing in the far red has transgressed the red limit of photosynthesis locked by chlorophyll&#8197;a at 680&#8197;nm and drives water oxidation at 727&#8197;nm. A phthalocyanine chromophore with similar absorption properties as Chl&#8201;f was stitched to a model of tyrosineZ/histidine, the pair of amino acids that enables electron relay between the Chl&#8201;f and the Mn4Ca water oxidizing complex. In their Communication on page&#8197;12284, Annamaria Quaranta, &#193;ngela Sastre&#8208;Santos, Ally Aukauloo, and co&#8208;workers report evidence that these chromophores can mirror the photoactivity of Chl&#8201;f.

         <title>Colloidal Metal Nanocrystals with Metastable Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12192-12203, May 25, 2021. </description>

There is a strong interest in developing metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;controlled shapes while featuring metastable crystal structures. The unconventional crystal phases not only enrich the diversity and functionality of nanomaterials but also enhance their catalytic properties.







Abstract
In addition to the conventional knobs such as composition, size, shape, and defect structure, the crystal structure (or phase) of metal nanocrystals offers a new avenue for engineering their properties. Various strategies have recently been developed for the fabrication of colloidal metal nanocrystals in metastable phases different from their bulk counterparts. With a focus on noble metals, we begin with a brief introduction to their atomic packing, followed by a discussion about five major synthetic approaches to their colloidal nanocrystals in unconventional phases. We then highlight the success of synthesis in terms of mechanistic insights and experimental controls, as well as the enhanced catalytic properties. We end this Minireview with perspectives on the remaining issues and future opportunities.

Organofluorine chemistry in the focus: Novel transformations based on a radical process were designed recently, offering new synthetic tools for the selective functionalization of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with a fluorinated group at a remote position to a functional group. This Minireview highlights these recent advances based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer or a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation process.







Abstract
Due to their unique properties, fluorinated scaffolds are pivotal compounds in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science. Over the last years, the development of versatile strategies for the selective synthesis of fluorinated molecules by direct C&#8722;H bond functionalization has attracted a lot of attention. In particular, the design of novel transformations based on a radical process was a bottleneck for distal C&#8722;H functionalization reactions, offering synthetic solutions for the selective introduction of fluorinated groups. This Minireview highlights the major contributions in this blossoming field. The development of new methodologies for the remote functionalization of aliphatic derivatives with various fluorinated groups based on a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process and a &#946;&#8208;fragmentation reaction will be showcased and discussed.

         <title>Salt to Taste: The Critical Roles Played by Inorganic Salts in Organozinc Formation and in the Negishi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12224-12241, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of organozinc reagents has been studied since its discovery in 1977, but the dramatic dependence on salt additives was only realized some 30&#8197;years later. LiCl and LiBr have been found not only to improve coupling outcomes, but their absence can shut down the reaction completely. This Review summarizes all reports outlining the ways that salt additives impact the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in Negishi cross&#8208;coupling.







Abstract
The first cross&#8208;coupling of organozinc nucleophiles with aryl halides was reported in 1977 by Negishi. Unknown to all at the time was the importance of salt additives that were often present as a byproduct from the organozinc preparation. For decades, these salt additives were overlooked until 2006 when it was discovered that two different, yet effective methods for preparing organozinc solutions (i.e. one with salt and one without) provided drastically different results. Since this finding, the exact role of salt additives in cross&#8208;coupling has been debated in the catalysis community. In this Review we highlight all the major discoveries regarding the influence of salt additives on the formation of organozinc reagents and their use in the Negishi reaction. These effects include solubilizing key intermediates, the formation of higher&#8208;order zincates, product inhibition, catalyst protection, and solvent effects.

         <title>Toward Replacing Ethylene Oxide in a Sustainable World: Glycolaldehyde as a Bio&#8208;Based C2 Platform Molecule</title>

Fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide currently serve as the primary feedstock for the C2&#8208;based chemical industry. This Review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward bio&#8208;based structural analogues of ethylene oxide, for example glycolaldehyde, and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C2&#8208;based chemical processes.







Abstract
Fossil&#8208;based platform molecules such as ethylene and ethylene oxide currently serve as the primary feedstock for the C2&#8208;based chemical industry. However, in the search for a more sustainable chemical industry, fossil&#8208;based resources may preferentially be replaced by renewable alternatives, provided there is realistic economic feasibility. This Review compares and critically discusses several production routes toward bio&#8208;based structural analogues of ethylene oxide and the required adaptations for their implementation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art C2&#8208;based chemical processes. For example, glycolaldehyde, a structural analogue obtainable from carbohydrates by atom&#8208;economic retro&#8208;aldol reactions, may replace ethylene oxide's leading role. This alternative chemical route may not only allow the carbon footprint of conventional chemicals production to be lowered, but the introduction of a bio&#8208;based pathway may also contribute to safer production processes. Where possible, challenges, drawbacks, and prospects are highlighted.

A strategic implementation of indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole units into polycyclic heteroaromatics is proposed, making use of not only the multi&#8208;resonance for narrowband emission but also the enhanced electronic coupling of para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms to narrow energy gaps. The corresponding emitters show narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminance and high efficiencies when assisted by a sensitizer with thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) organic emitters bearing small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) are of general interest in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole (ICz) embedded MR&#8208;fluorophors have demonstrated extremely small FWHMs, yet in the violet region with low electroluminescence efficiency. Herein, a strategic implementation of ICz subunits into MR fluorophors is proposed by taking advantage of the synergetic effect of para&#8208;positioned nitrogen atoms to enhance electronic coupling to decrease emitting energy gap. Deep blue emitters peaking at 441 and 447&#8197;nm with FWHMs of only 18 and 21&#8197;nm are thereof obtained, respectively, accompanied by &#8776;90&#8201;% photo&#8208;luminance quantum yields. With the assistance of a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer to recycle excitons, the corresponding narrowband electroluminescent devices show unprecedent high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.0&#8201;% and 34.7&#8201;% with CIEy of 0.10 and 0.085, respectively.

The crystal of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin B (TbCatB), which is spontaneously produced in insect cells, is used to fabricate protein bundled filaments. The designed disulfide bonds between the monomers are formed by autoxidation in the isolated crystals.







Abstract
Protein assemblies can be designed for development of nano&#8211;bio materials. This has been achieved by modulating protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, fabrication of highly ordered protein assemblies remains challenging. Protein crystals, which have highly ordered arrangements of protein molecules, provide useful source matrices for synthesizing artificial protein assemblies. Here, we describe construction of a supramolecular filament structure by engineering covalent and non&#8208;covalent interactions in a protein crystal. Performing in&#8208;cell crystallization of Trypanosoma brucei cysteine protease cathepsin&#8197;B (TbCatB), we achieved a precise arrangement of protein molecules while suppressing random aggregation due to disulfide bonds. We succeeded in synthesizing bundled filament from the crystals by autoxidation of cysteinyl thiols after the isolation of the crystals from living cells.

         <title>Conversion of Dinitrogen into Nitrile: Cross&#8208;Metathesis of N2&#8208;Derived Molybdenum Nitride with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12242-12247, May 25, 2021. </description>

The combination of N2 splitting on a Mo complex followed by nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis results in the direct synthesis of nitrile from dinitrogen under mild conditions. This provides a new strategy for functionalizing N2&#8208;derived metal nitrido complexes.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of nitrile from N2 under mild conditions is of great importance and has attracted much interest. Herein, we report a direct conversion of N2 into nitrile via a nitrile&#8211;alkyne cross&#8208;metathesis (NACM) process involving a N2&#8208;derived Mo nitride. Treatment of the Mo nitride with alkyne in the presence of KOTf afforded an alkyne&#8208;coordinated nitride, which was then transformed into MoV carbyne and the corresponding nitrile upon 1&#8201;e&#8722; oxidation. Both aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkynes underwent this process smoothly. Experiments and DFT calculations have proved that the oxidation state of the Mo center plays a crucial role. This method does not rely on the nucleophilicity of the N2&#8208;derived metal nitride, offering a novel strategy for N2 fixation chemistry.

         <title>Reversible Micrometer&#8208;Scale Spiral Self&#8208;Assembly in Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymer Film with Controllable Chiral Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12308-12312, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with clear handedness are obtained through self&#8208;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(methyl methacrylate) bearing azobenzene mesogen side chains, with the aid of enantiopure tartaric acid as chiral additive. The formation of spiral structures can be reversibly controlled by ultraviolet light and heat treatment.







Abstract
The spiral is a fundamental structure in nature and spiral structures with controllable handedness are of increasing interest in the design of new chiroptical materials. In this study, micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with reversible chirality were fabricated based on the assembly of a liquid crystalline block copolymer film assisted by enantiopure tartaric acid. Mechanistic insight revealed that the formation of the spiral structures was closely related to the liquid crystalline properties of the major phase of block copolymer under the action of chiral tartaric acid. The chiral spiral structures with controllable handedness were easily erased under ultraviolet light irradiation and restored via thermal annealing. This facile thermal treatment method provides guidance for fabrication of chiral micrometer&#8208;scale spiral structures with adjustable chiral properties.

         <title>Cascade Oxidative C&#8722;H Annulation of Thiophenes: Heck&#8208;Type Pathway Enables Concise Access to Thienoacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12371-12375, May 25, 2021. </description>

A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation provides a rapid access to a new class of planar thienoacenes with superior stability. Heck&#8208;type pathway is firstly exemplified as a superior process enabling multiple C&#8722;H fusions of heteroaromatics for the synthesis of heteroacenes.







Abstract
The pursuit of efficient synthetic route to thienoacenes represents an appealing yet challenging task in the fields of both organic synthetic chemistry and organic functional materials. In this work, we disclose a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H annulation of phenacyl phosphoniums with (benzo)thiophenes via a Heck&#8208;type pathway to provide a new class of planar thienoacenes, which involves the formation of three Caryl&#8208;Caryl bonds and one Caryl&#8722;O bond in a single operation. The neutral S,O&#8208;heteroacenes exhibit superior stability and adopt a herringbone&#8208;like packing mode with efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the crystals, suggesting their potential in organic semiconducting materials. This work first exemplifies the superiority of cascade oxidative C&#8722;H annulation involving a Heck&#8208;type pathway in the development of concise access to heteroacenes.

The O&#8722;S and N&#8722;S bonds of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were cleaved in gold&#8208;catalyzed skeletal rearrangement reactions to afford S&#8208;functionalized 2H&#8208;azirines in good to excellent yields (see scheme). The reactions proceed via a thiooxime intermediate directly bound to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety.







Abstract
Gold&#8208;catalyzed reactions of alkynyl N&#8208;sulfinylimines were used to produce the corresponding 2H&#8208;azirines possessing sulfenyl and acyl groups at the 3&#8208;position of the azirine ring in good to excellent yields. These reactions involved internal transfer of the sulfinyl oxygen atom to form a thiooxime intermediate tethered to an &#945;&#8208;oxo gold carbene moiety. Subsequent insertion of the carbene into the N&#8722;S bond resulted in ring construction.

Abstract
A one&#8208;step synthetic pathway for the preparation of fully conjugated &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;azaDIPY hybrid chromophores comprised of &#946;&#8208;isoindigo and azadipyrromethene moieties is reported. The target compounds were characterized by spectroscopic, crystallographic, and theoretical methods and show unprecedented broad absorption across the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the octa(n&#8208;butyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;azaDIPY derivative revealed that a trans&#8208;configuration of the &#946;&#8208;isoindigo fragment accompanies a planar conjugated core.

         <title>Catalytic Boration of Alkyl Halides with Borane without Hydrodehalogenation Enabled by Titanium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12298-12303, May 25, 2021. </description>

A general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides with boranes is reported. The system can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation process that prevails using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The current strategy worked for various alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Mechanistic studies reveal a possible radical reaction pathway.







Abstract
An unprecedented and general titanium&#8208;catalyzed boration of alkyl (pseudo)halides (alkyl&#8208;X, X=I, Br, Cl, OMs) with borane (HBpin, HBcat) is reported. The use of titanium catalyst can successfully suppress the undesired hydrodehalogenation products that prevail using other transition&#8208;metal catalysts. A series of synthetically useful alkyl boronate esters are readily obtained from various (primary, secondary, and tertiary) alkyl electrophiles, including unactivated alkyl chlorides, with tolerance of other reducing functional groups such as ester, alkene, and carbamate. Preliminary studies on the mechanism revealed a possible radical reaction pathway. Further extension of our strategy to aryl bromides is also demonstrated.

         <title>Atomically Precise Engineering of Single&#8208;Molecule Stereoelectronic Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12274-12278, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise control of the dihedral angle and the rotation processes of phenyl rings of a prototype terphenyl molecule can be achieved by introducing a photochromic molecule, azobenzene, as the side chain. The experimental and theoretical data demonstrate that the structure of the side chain can alter the twisted angle of adjacent phenyl rings, as well as the rotation barrier, because of the variable steric hindrance of the azobenzene group.







Abstract
Charge transport in a single&#8208;molecule junction is extraordinarily sensitive to both the internal electronic structure of a molecule and its microscopic environment. Two distinct conductance states of a prototype terphenyl molecule are observed, which correspond to the bistability of outer phenyl rings at each end. An azobenzene unit is intentionally introduced through atomically precise side&#8208;functionalization at the central ring of the terphenyl, which is reversibly isomerized between trans and cis forms by either electric or optical stimuli. Both experiment and theory demonstrate that the azobenzene side&#8208;group delicately modulates charge transport in the backbone via a single&#8208;molecule stereoelectronic effect. We reveal that the dihedral angle between the central and outer phenyl ring, as well as the corresponding rotation barrier, is subtly controlled by isomerization, while the behaviors of the phenyl ring away from the azobenzene are hardly affected. This tunability offers a new route to precisely engineer multiconfigurational single&#8208;molecule memories, switches, and sensors.

         <title>Compression&#8208;Driven Internanocluster Reaction for Synthesis of Unconventional Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12253-12257, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compression&#8208;driven internanocluster reaction in the solid state of Au25 was firstly demonstrated by introducing high pressure technology and a novel unconventional NC Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 was obtained. Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 NC consists of a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, which has not been previously reported and endows it with enhanced photoluminescence.







Abstract
Can the active kernels in ultrasmall metal nanoparticles (nanoclusters, NCs) react with one another, or can the internanocluster reaction occur when they are in close enough proximity? To resolve this fundamental issue, we investigated the solid&#8208;state internanocluster reaction of the most studied gold NC Au25(SR)18 (SR: thiolate). A novel NC was produced by increasing the pressure to 5&#8197;GPa, whose composition was determined to be Au32(SC2H4Ph)24 by mass spectrometry and thermogravimetric analysis. As revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, the structure, a bicuboid Au14 kernel and three pairs of interlocked trimetric staples, has not been reported and endows the NC with obvious photoluminescence. DFT calculations indicate that the staples contribute substantially to the absorption properties. Further experiments reveal the pressure (internanocluster distance) can tune the internanocluster reaction, and the resulting product is not necessarily the thermodynamic product.

         <title>Deep Learning Accelerated Determination of Hydride Locations in Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12289-12292, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep convolutional neural networks, trained on existing examples with known hydride locations from neutron diffraction, were able to accurately predict hydride locations given an X&#8208;ray structure of copper&#8208;hydride nanoclusters, thereby relieving the need of neutron diffraction.







Abstract
Although the coordinates of the metal atoms can be accurately determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography, locations of hydrides in metal nanoclusters are challenging to determine. In principle, neutron crystallography can be employed to pinpoint the hydride positions, but it requires a large crystal and a neutron source, which prevents its routine use. Here, we present a deep&#8208;learning approach that can accelerate determination of hydride locations in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of metal nanoclusters of different sizes. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method in predicting the most probable hydride sites and their combinations to determine the total structure for two recently reported copper nanoclusters, [Cu25H10(SPhCl2)18]3&#8722; and [Cu61(StBu)26S6Cl6H14]+ whose hydride locations have not been determined by neutron diffraction. Our method can be generalized and applied to other metal systems, thereby eliminating a bottleneck in atomically precise metal hydride nanochemistry.

         <title>Regulative Electronic States around Ruthenium/Ruthenium Disulphide Heterointerfaces for Efficient Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12328-12334, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profiting from the rearranged charge density around the abundant interface and the enhanced electronic states, in acidic media, the Ru/RuS2 heterostructure exhibits prominent catalytic activity toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, and consequent remarkably high overall water splitting performance, demonstrating promising application prospect for industrial proton exchange membrane&#8208;water electrolysis.







Abstract
Theoretical calculations unveil the charge redistribution over abundant interfaces and the enhanced electronic states of Ru/RuS2 heterostructure. The resulting surface electron&#8208;deficient Ru sites display optimized adsorption behavior toward diverse reaction intermediates, thereby reducing the thermodynamic energy barriers. Experimentally, for the first time the laminar Ru/RuS2 heterostructure is rationally engineered by virtue of the synchronous reduction and sulfurization under eutectic salt system. Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for both OER (201&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and HER (45&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in acidic media due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity, consequently leading to a terrific performance in acidic overall water splitting devices (1.501&#8197;V @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The in&#8208;depth insight into the internal activity origin of interfacial effect could offer precise guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces.

Impressively, it exhibits extremely high catalytic activity for both OER (201&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and HER (45&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in acidic media due to favorable kinetics and excellent specific activity, consequently leading to a terrific performance in acidic overall water splitting devices (1.501&#8197;V @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The in-depth insight into the internal activity origin of interfacial effect could offer precise guidance for the rational establishment of hybrid interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Integrating a Concentration Gradient Generator and a Single&#8208;Cell Trapper Array for High&#8208;Throughput Screening the Bioeffects of Nanomaterials</title>

An integrated microfluidic platform combining a concentration gradient generator (CGG) module with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) module has been designed for generating gradient concentrations of nanoparticles and evaluating the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of nanoparticles on mammalian cells.







Abstract
We herein develop a concentration gradient generator (CGG) on a microfluidic chip for diluting different nanoparticles. Specifically designed compact disk (CD)&#8208;shaped microchannels in the CGG module could thoroughly mix the flowing solutions and generate a linear concentration gradient of nanoparticles without aggregation. We combine the CGG with a single&#8208;cell trapper array (SCA) on microfluidics to evaluate the concentration&#8208;dependent bioeffects of the nanoparticles. The precise control of the spatiotemporal generation of nanoparticle concentration on the CGG module and the single&#8208;cell&#8208;level monitoring of the cell behaviors on the SCA module by a high&#8208;content system in real time, render the CGG&#8208;SCA system a highly precise platform, which can exclude the average effect of cell population and reflect the response of individual cells to the gradient concentrations accurately. In addition, the CGG&#8208;SCA system provides an automated platform for high&#8208;throughput screening of nanomedicines with high precision and low sample consumption.

         <title>Phthalocyanine as a Bioinspired Model for Chlorophyll f&#8208;Containing Photosystem&#8197;II Drives Photosynthesis into the Far&#8208;Red Region</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12284-12288, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phthalocyanine chromophore absorbing in the far&#8208;red region with a tyrosine residue hydrogen bonded to an imidazole moiety provides the first example of a bioinspired model for the recent discovery that chlorophyll f&#8208;containing Photosystem II absorbing in the far&#8208;red limit at 727&#8197;nm can drive the four&#8208;electron water oxidation.







Abstract
The textbook explanation that P680 pigments are the red limit to drive oxygenic photosynthesis must be reconsidered by the recent discovery that chlorophyll f (Chlf)&#8208;containing Photosystem II (PSII) absorbing at 727&#8197;nm can drive water oxidation. Two different families of unsymmetrically substituted Zn phthalocyanines (Pc) absorbing in the 700&#8211;800&#8197;nm spectral window and containing a fused imidazole&#8208;phenyl substituent or a fused imidazole&#8208;hydroxyphenyl group have been synthetized and characterized as a bioinspired model of the Chlf/TyrosineZ/Histidine190 cofactors of PSII. Transient absorption studies in the presence of an electron acceptor and irradiating in the far&#8208;red region evidenced an intramolecular electron transfer process. Visible and FT&#8208;IR signatures indicate the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded phenoxyl radical in ZnPc II&#8208;OH. This study sets the foundation for the utilization of a broader spectral window for multi&#8208;electronic catalytic processes with one of the most robust and efficient dyes.

A straightforward preparation of photochromic siloles based on the dithienylethene motif is developed. It relies upon an efficient palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of a 2,3&#8208;bis(3&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;silirene with terminal alkynes in mild conditions. The reaction is functional group&#8208;tolerant and can be performed in high yields with a variety of functional terminal alkynes.

Catalytic and enantioselective control of the C&#8211;N stereogenic axis of heterocyclic scaffolds is reported. The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction is achieved by employing a chiral phosphoric acid via dynamic kinetic resolution. Application to substituted benzaldehyde enables control of both axial and point chirality.







Abstract
An unprecedented example of a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction of N&#8208;arylindoles is reported. Highly enantioenriched N&#8208;aryl&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines with C&#8722;N bond axial chirality are obtained via dynamic kinetic resolution. The hydrogen bond donor introduced on the bottom aromatic ring, forming a secondary interaction with the phosphoryl oxygen, is essential to achieving high enantioselectivity. A wide variety of substituents are tolerable with this transformation to provide up to 98&#8201;% ee. The application of electron&#8208;withdrawing group&#8208;substituted benzaldehydes enables the control of both axial and point stereogenicity. Biological evaluation of this new and unique scaffold shows promising antiproliferative activity and emphasizes the significance of atroposelective synthesis.

Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed highly &#947;&#8208;regioselective arylation and carbonylative arylation of 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;difluoropropene has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, providing the gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The resulting gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes can serve as versatile building blocks for diversified synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed highly &#947;-regioselective arylation and carbonylation of 3-bromo-3,3-difluoropropene has been developed. The reaction provides a variety of &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-difluoroalkenes with good functional group tolerance and high efficiency.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nickel-catalyzed highly &#947;-regioselective arylation and carbonylative arylation of 3-bromo-3,3-difluoropropene has been developed. The reaction proceeds under mild reaction conditions, providing the gem-difluoroalkenes with high efficiency and good functional group tolerance. The resulting gem-difluoroalkenes can serve as versatile building blocks for diversified synthesis. Preliminary mechanistic studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that both non-radical and radical pathways are possible for the reaction, and the radical pathway is more likely. The high &#947;-regioselectivity results from the &#946;-bromide elimination of alkylnickel(II) species or from the reductive elimination of nickel(III) species [(aryl)(CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Ni&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)X]. The &#947;-selective carbonylation of 3-bromo-3,3-difluoropropene under 1&#8197;atm CO gas also provides a new way for nickel-catalyzed carbonylation.&lt;/p&gt;

A new class of electrophile, Cu&#8211;allenylidene has been introduced to induce 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. Merger of Cu&#8208;catalyzed propargylation and 1,2&#8208;boronate shift has allowed access to densely functionalized chiral indolines with up to three contiguous stereogenic centres in highly diastereoselective fashion (&gt;20:1 dr). Utility of Bpin and alkyne moieties has been demonstrated by subsequent synthetic elaborations.







Abstract
A process to achieve 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangements of indole boronate as a way to access substituted indolines in high diastereoselectivities is presented. The reaction involves the generation of a Cu&#8211;allenylidene, which is sufficiently electrophilic to induce the 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement. The scope of the reaction is evaluated as well as further transformations of the product.

         <title>Functionalized High Mannose&#8208;Specific Lectins for the Discovery of Type&#8197;I Mannosidase Inhibitors</title>

Lectins that can be applied to specifically detect high mannose N&#8208;glycans on cell surfaces have been prepared by engineering the C&#8208;terminus of a naturally occurring cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue. The functionalized lectins can be utilized to aid type&#8197;I &#945; 1,2&#8208;mannosidase inhibitor discovery and development. The functionalized lectin is used to prepare kifunensine analogues that are &gt;75&#8208;fold more potent than kifunensine.







Abstract
An engineered cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue that exhibits specificity for high mannose N&#8208;glycans has been constructed to aid type&#8197;I &#945; 1,2&#8208;mannosidase inhibitor discovery and development. Engineering the lectins C&#8208;terminus permitted facile functionalization with fluorophores via a sortase and click strategy. The resulting lectin constructs exhibit specificity for cells presenting high mannose N&#8208;glycans. Importantly, these lectin constructs can also be applied to specifically assess changes in cell surface glycosylation induced by type&#8197;I mannosidase inhibitors. Testing the utility of these lectin constructs led to the discovery of type&#8197;I mannosidase inhibitors with nanomolar potency. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the specificity and utility of the functionalized cyanovirin&#8208;N homologue constructs, and highlight their potential in analytical contexts that require high mannose&#8208;specific lectins.

         <title>Organic Tetrabutylammonium Cation Intercalation to Heal Inorganic CsPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12351-12355, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite is well&#8208;known for its resistance to organic cation substitution. Here, a specific organic cation of tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) with strong ionic binding to the Pb&#8208;I octahedral framework can effectively intercalate into CsPbI3 and substitute the Cs+ cation. A post&#8208;synthesis TBAI passivation then leads to in situ formation of TBAPbI3 layer to heal CsPbI3 perovskite with lower defect density and enhanced stability.







Abstract
The in situ formation of reduced dimensional perovskite layer via post&#8208;synthesis ion exchange has been an effective way of passivating organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites. In contrast, cesium ions in Cs&#8208;based inorganic perovskite with strong ionic binding energy cannot exchange with those well&#8208;known organic cations to form reduced dimensional perovskite. Herein, we demonstrate that tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) cation can intercalate into CsPbI3 to effectively substitute the Cs cation and to form one&#8208;dimensional (1D) TBAPbI3 layer in the post&#8208;synthesis TBAI treatment. Such TBA cation intercalation leads to in situ formation of TBAPbI3 protective layer to heal defects at the surface of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite. The TBAPbI3&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite exhibited enhanced stability and lower defect density, and the corresponding perovskite solar cell devices achieved an improved efficiency up to 18.32&#8201;% compared to 15.85&#8201;% of the control one.

A versatile direct cyclization is demonstrated to proceed by substituted diarylamines with various ketones under simple solvent&#8208;free and metal&#8208;free conditions. It shows huge potential in preparing spiro&#8208;acridan derivatives and TADF emitters.







Abstract
Spiro&#8208;acridan (SpA) derivatives possess a great potential in preparing efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters. However, the conventional synthetic routes are cost&#8208;expensive and time&#8208;consuming. The development of a simple procedure to synthesize SpAs is still in urgent pursuing appreciated by academic and industrial communities. In this contribution, we present a feasible acid&#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free metal&#8208;free cyclization between diarylamines and ketones to construct SpAs. The as&#8208;constructed moieties provide a wide possibility to assemble efficient TADF emitters. As an example, D2T&#8208;TR with high photoluminescent quantum yield and proper TADF character is applied in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) which achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 27.1&#8201;%. This work shows us a bright inspiration on developing excellent organic optoelectronic materials and an effective tool to realize it.

         <title>Aptamer Switches Regulated by Post&#8208;Transition/Transition Metal Ions</title>

Structural transition metal ions: Post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions can induce, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. We exploited such property for elaborating fluorescent aptamer probes that switch between inert, metal ion&#8208;complexed and active, target&#8208;bound states. This very simple structural switching strategy was applied to the homogeneous&#8208;phase detection of small organics using diversely structured aptamers.







Abstract
We introduced an aptamer switch design that relies on the ability of post&#8208;transition/transition metal ions to trigger, through their coordination to nucleobases, substantial DNA destabilization. In the absence of molecular target, the addition of one such metal ion to usual aptamer working solutions promotes the formation of an alternative, inert DNA state. Upon exposure to the cognate compound, the equilibrium is shifted towards the competent DNA form. The switching process was preferentially activated by metal ions of intermediate base over phosphate complexation preference (i.e. Pb2+, Cd2+) and operated with diversely structured DNA molecules. This very simple aptamer switch scheme was applied to the detection of small organics using the fluorescence anisotropy readout mode. We envision that the approach could be adapted to a variety of signalling methods that report on changes in the surface charge density of DNA receptors.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;Undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;Alpneumine&#8197;H</title>

(+)&#8208;Alstilobanine&#8197;C has been synthesized in 11 steps from prochiral 4&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)cyclohexan&#8208;1&#8208;one (A). It is subsequently converted into (+)&#8208;undulifoline and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H via reductive N&#8208;methylation and diastereoselective N&#8208;oxidation of the tertiary amine.







Abstract
We report herein the enantioselective total synthesis of three monoterpene indole alkaloids, namely, (+)&#8208;alstilobanine&#8197;C, (+)&#8208;undulifoline, and (&#8722;)&#8208;alpneumine&#8197;H. The key features of our synthesis include: a) introduction of chirality via enantioselective deprotonation of a prochiral 4&#8208;substituted cyclohexanone; b) use of methoxymethyl (MOM) ether as both a hydroxyl protective group and a latent oxonium species for the formation of bridged oxepane and c) domino double reductive cyclization to build both the indole and the piperidine ring at the end of the synthesis. The synthesis confirmed the absolute configuration of these natural products assigned based on the biogenetic hypothesis.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Turn&#8208;On Persistent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Purely Organic Luminogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12335-12340, May 25, 2021. </description>

The first example of force&#8208;induced turn&#8208;on persistent RTP luminogen named Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F is reported. The abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is attributed to the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group. This material was successfully applied in thermal printing and stylus printing.







Abstract
Research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has been a hot topic, especially for those with stimulus response character. Herein, an abnormal stimulus&#8208;responsive RTP effect is reported, in which, purely organic luminogen of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F shows turn&#8208;on persistent phosphorescence under grinding. Careful analyses of experimental results, coupled with the theoretical calculations, show that the transition of molecular conformation from quasi&#8208;axial to quasi&#8208;equatorial of the phenothiazine group should be mainly responsible for this exciting result. Furthermore, the applications of stylus printing and thermal printing are both successfully realized, based on the unique RTP effect of Czs&#8208;ph&#8208;3F.

         <title>Potent Cyclic Tetrapeptide for Lead Detoxification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12381-12385, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic tetrapeptides were designed and screened for their ability to recover Pb&#8208;poisoned bacteria and human cells. Excellent potency was identified with two members, outcompeting the benchmark clinical chelating agents. The leading peptide was further characterized, revealing an outstanding metal affinity and selectivity, indicating its great potential as a next&#8208;generation treatment for Pb poisoning.







Abstract
Lead (Pb) is a ubiquitous poisonous metal, affecting the health of vast populations worldwide. Medications to treat Pb poisoning suffer from various limitations and are often toxic owing to insufficient metal selectivity. Here, we report a cyclic tetrapeptide that selectively binds Pb and eradicates its toxic effect on the cellular level, with superior potency than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art drugs. The Pb&#8208;peptide complex is remarkably strong and was characterized experimentally and computationally. Accompanied by the lack of toxicity and enhanced stability of this peptide, these qualities indicate its merit as a potential remedy for Pb poisoning.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Multicomponent Emissive Metallacages as Solid&#8208;State Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12293-12297, May 25, 2021. </description>

Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages with high fluorescence quantum yield and good processability were prepared. These metallacages were further utilized as coatings of a blue light&#8208;emitting bulb to prepare white&#8208;light emitting diodes, demonstrating their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials.







Abstract
The construction of solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials with high quantum yield and good processability is of vital importance in the preparation of organic light&#8208;emitting devices. Herein, a series of tetraphenylethylene (TPE)&#8208;based multicomponent emissive metallacages are prepared by the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of tetra&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridylphenyl)ethylene, cis&#8208;Pt(PEt3)2(OTf)2 and tetracarboxylic ligands. These metallacages exhibit good emission both in solution and in the solid state because the coordination bonds and aggregation restrict the molecular motions of TPE synergistically, which suppresses the non&#8208;radiative decay of these metallacages. Impressively, one of the metallacages achieves very high fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F=88.46&#8201;%) in the solid state, which is further used as the coatings of a blue LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. The study not only provides a general method to the preparation of TPE&#8208;based metallacages but also explores their applications as solid&#8208;state fluorescent materials, which will promote the future design and applications of metallacages as useful emissive devices.

         <title>Fluorescent Membrane Tension Probes for Early Endosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12258-12263, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unidirectional penetration along minimalist pH gradients is developed as a strategy to label the membrane of early endosomes with mechanosensitive flipper probes, by simple addition to unmodified cells. Substituted benzylamines offer the right acidity, pKa=10, not too strong to allow reversibility, not too weak to inhibit penetration from neutral water in the cytosol, and, perhaps, extra returns from interfacial aromatic anchoring.







Abstract
Fluorescent flipper probes have been introduced recently to image membrane tension in live cells, and strategies to target these probes to specific membranes are emerging. In this context, early endosome (EE) targeting without the use of protein engineering is especially appealing because it translates into a fascinating transport problem. Weakly basic probes, commonly used to track the inside of acidic late endosomes and lysosomes, are poorly retained in EE because they are sufficiently neutralized in weakly acidic EE, thus able to diffuse out. Here, we disclose a rational strategy to target EE using a substituted benzylamine with a higher pKa value as a head group of the flipper probe. The resulting EE flippers are validated for preserved mechanosensitivity, ready for use in biology, particularly to elucidate the mechanics of endocytosis.

         <title>Arylene Diimide Phosphors: Aggregation Modulated Twin Room Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyromellitic Diimides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12323-12327, May 25, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, stable in air, from the simplest class of arylene diimides, i.e., pyromellitic diimides, is achieved. Aggregation modulated, colour tuneable phosphorescence emission from cyan to orange&#8208;red in amorphous film and crystalline state is observed. The role of molecular design and weak intermolecular interactions in the observed properties is explained.







Abstract
Arylene diimide derived ambient organic phosphors are seldom reported despite their potential structural characteristics to facilitate the triplet harvesting. In this context, highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from simple, heavy&#8208;atom substituted pyromellitic diimide derivatives in amorphous matrix and crystalline state is reported here. Multiple intermolecular halogen bonding interactions among these phosphors, such as halogen&#8208;carbonyl and halogen&#8208;&#960; resulted in the modulation of phosphorescence, cyan emission from monomeric state and orange&#8208;red emission from its aggregated state, to yield twin RTP emission. Remarkably, the air&#8208;stable phosphorescence presented here own one of the highest quantum yield (&#8776;48&#8201;%) among various organics in orange&#8208;red emissive region.

NHC&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides is presented. The reaction proceeds via the Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation. Preliminary studies on the rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond and detailed DFT studies on the mechanism are also provided.







Abstract
Although the construction of axially chiral C&#8722;C bonds leading to the atroposelective synthesis of biaryls and allied compounds are well&#8208;known, the related synthesis of compounds bearing axially chiral C&#8722;N bonds are relatively rare. Described herein is the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;aryl succinimides having an axially chiral C&#8722;N bond via the desymmetrization of N&#8208;aryl maleimides. The NHC involved intermolecular Stetter&#8208;aldol cascade of dialdehydes with prochiral N&#8208;aryl maleimides followed by oxidation afforded N&#8208;aryl succinimides in good yields and ee values. Preliminary studies on rotation barrier for the C&#8722;N bond, the temperature dependence, and detailed DFT studies on mechanism are also provided.

         <title>Reversed Active Sites Boost the Intrinsic Activity of Graphene&#8208;like Cobalt Selenide for Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 22, Page 12360-12365, May 25, 2021. </description>

Graphene&#8208;like Co0.85Se was doped with sulfur, bringing about a reversal in active sites for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from cationic cobalt sites to anionic sulfur sites. A consequent change in the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of the active sites improved the overpotential of the HER.







Abstract
Optimizing the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) of active sites is essential to improve the overpotential of the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We doped graphene&#8208;like Co0.85Se with sulfur and found that the active sites are reversed (from cationic Co sites to anionic S sites), which contributed to an enhancement in electrocatalytic HER performance. The optimal S&#8208;doped Co0.85Se composite has an overpotential of 108&#8197;mV (at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a Tafel slope of 59&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, which exceeds other reported Co0.85Se&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The doped S sites have much higher activity than the Co sites, with a hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH) close to zero (0.067&#8197;eV), which reduces the reaction barrier for hydrogen production. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the intrinsic HER activity of other related transition metal chalcogenides.

         <title>Generating Assembled MFI Nanocrystals with Reduced b&#8208;Axis through Structure&#8208;Directing Agent Exchange Induced Recrystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned plate&#8208;shaped MFI crystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness was synthesized through homogeneous nucleation followed by structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) exchange induced recrystallization, using tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). The obtained materials markedly exaggerated propene selectivity and showed prolonged catalyst lifetime in the conversion of dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
Controlling crystal size and shape of zeolitic materials is an effective way to promote their mass transport and catalytic properties. Herein, we report a single step, Na+&#8208; and porogen&#8208; free crystallization of MFI hierarchical architecture made up of aligned nanocrystals with reduced b&#8208;axis thickness (5&#8211;23&#8197;nm) and adjustable Si/Al ratios between 35 to 120, employing the commonly used tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) as structure&#8208;directing agents (SDAs). Homogeneous nucleation driven by both SDAs and subsequent SDA&#8208;exchange induced dissolution&#8208;recrystallization are responsible for the formation of such structure. The enhanced textural and diffusion properties account for a notable exaggeration of propene selectivity and catalyst lifetime in dimethyl ether&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (DTO) conversion. This protocol is extendable to the rational synthesis of other hierarchical zeolites through crystallization process control.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Nanodisc formation of Non&#8208;ionic Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite lipid&#8208;nanodiscs are increasingly used in the structural studies of membrane proteins, drug delivery and other applications, the interaction between the nanodisc&#8208;belt and the protein to be reconstituted is a major limitation. To overcome this limitation and to further broaden the scope of nanodiscs, a family of non&#8208;ionic amphiphilic polymers synthesized by hydrophobic functionalization of fructo&#8208;oligosaccharides/inulin is reported. We show the stability of lipid&#8208;nanodiscs formed by these polymers against pH and divalent metal ions, and their magnetic&#8208;alignment properties. The reported results also demonstrate that the non&#8208;ionic polymers extract membrane proteins with unprecedented efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of the Arene&#8208;Limited Nondirected C&#8211;H Activation of Arenes with Palladium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently palladium catalysts have been discovered that enable the directing group&#8208;free C&#8211;H activation of arenes without requiring an excess of the arene substrate, thereby enabling methods for the late&#8208;stage modification of complex organic molecules. The key to success has been the use of two complementary ligands, an N&#8208;acyl amino acid and an N&#8208;heterocycle. Detailed experimental and computational mechanistic studies on the dual ligand&#8208;enabled C&#8211;H activation of arenes have led us to identify the catalytically active species and a transition state model that explains the exceptional activity and selectivity of these catalysts. These findings are expected to be highly useful for further method development using this powerful class of catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Kirkendall Effect Boosts Phosphorylated nZVI for Efficient Heavy Metal Wastewater Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Removal of non&#8208;biodegradable heavy metals has been the top priority in wastewater treatment; the development of green technologies remains a significant challenge. Here we show the phosphorylated nanoscale zero&#8208;valent iron (nZVI) is promising for heavy metals (Ni(II), Cu(II), Cr(VI), Hg(II)) removal via boosted Kirkendall effect. Phosphorylation confines tensile hoop stress on the nZVI particles and "breaks" the structurally&#8208;dense spherical nZVI to produce numerous radial nanocracks. Exemplified by Ni(II) removal, the radial nanocracks favor the facile inward diffusion of Ni(II) and the rapid outward transport of electrons and ferrous ions through the oxide shell for surface (Ni(II)/electron) and boundary (Ni(II)/Fe0) galvanic exchange. Accompanied by a pronounced hollow&#8208;out phenomenon, phosphorylated nZVI can instantly reduce and immobilize Ni(II) throughout the inherent oxide shell with a high capacity (258 mg Ni/g Fe). For real electroplating factory wastewater treatment, this novel nZVI performs simultaneous Ni(II) and Cu(II) removal, producing effluent of stable quality that meets local discharge regulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Carbanions through Carbonyl Umpolung</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbonyl Umpolung is a powerful strategy in organic chemistry to construct complex molecules. Over the last years, versatile catalytic approaches for the generation of acyl anion equivalents from carbonyls have been developed, but methods to obtain alkyl carbanions from carbonyls in a catalytic fashions are still at an early stage. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the generation of alkyl carbanions through catalytic carbonyl Umpolung. Two different catalytic approaches can be utilized to enable alkyl carbanion generation from carbonyl compounds: the catalytic Wolff Kishner reaction and the catalytic single&#8208;electron reduction of carbonyls and imines. We discuss the reaction scope, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of the methods as well as potential future developments.</dc:description>

         <title>Introduction of a Luminophore into Generic Polymers via Mechanoradical Coupling with a Prefluorescent Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a novel strategy for introducing a luminophore into generic polymers facilitated by mechanical stimulation. In this study, polymeric mechanoradicals were formed  in situ  under ball&#8208;milling conditions to undergo radical&#8211;radical coupling with a prefluorescent nitroxide&#8208;based reagent in order to incorporate a luminophore into the polymer main chains via a covalent bond. This method allowed the direct and conceptually simple preparation of luminescent polymeric materials from a wide range of generic polymers such as polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyethylene. These results indicate that the present mechanoradical coupling strategy may help to transform existing commodity polymers into more valuable functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroaromatic Hyperbranched Polyelectrolytes: Multicomponent Polyannulation and Photodynamic Biopatterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of facile methods for the synthesis of functional hyperbranched polyelectrolytes plays a pivotal role for biomimicry and the creation of new materials. In this study, we reported an efficient multicomponent polyannulation for  in situ  generation of heteroaromatic hyperbranched polyelectrolytes by using readily accessible internal diynes and low&#8208;cost, commercially available arylnitriles, NaSbF  6  , and H  2  O/AcOH. The polymers were obtained in excellent yields (up to 99%) with extraordinary high molecular weights (Mw up to 1.011 &#215; 10^6  &#160;  ) and low polydispersity indices. The resulting polymers showed good processibility and high quantum yields with tunable emission in the solid state, making them as ideal materials for highly ordered fluorescent photopatterning. These hyperbranched polyelectrolytes also possessed strong ability to generate reactive oxygen species, which allowed their applications in efficient bacterial killing and customizable photodynamic patterning of living organisms in a simple and cost&#8208;effective way. In view of the unique properties and functionalities, these hyperbranched polyelectrolytes hold great promise to be used in a plethora of follow&#8208;up studies, such as photoelectronic materials, disease theranostics, biochips, and tissue engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Crystallization Induced Emission Probes to Detect Amorphous Protein Aggregation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike amyloid, amorphous protein aggregation of no defined structures has been challenging to target and detect in complex cellular milieu. Herein, we rationally designed amorphous protein aggregation sensors from aggregation induced emission probes (AIEgens). Utilizing dicyanoisophorone as a model AIEgen scaffold, we first sensitized the fluorescence of AIEgens to non&#8208;polar and viscous environment mimicking the interior of amorphous aggregated proteins. We identified a generally applicable moiety (dimethylaminophenylene) for selective binding and fluorescence enhancement. Regulation of the electron withdrawing groups tunes the emission wavelength while retaining selective detection. Finally, we utilized the optimized probe to systematically image aggregated proteome upon proteostasis network regulations. Overall, we present a rational approach to develop amorphous protein aggregation sensors from AIEgens with controllable sensitivity, spectral coverage, and cellular performance.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA framework&#8208;engineered long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions for DNA hybridization reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions beyond biomolecular interaction interfaces have not been extensively studied due to the limitation in engineering electric double layers in physiological fluids. Here we find that long&#8208;range electrostatic interactions play an essential role in kinetic modulation of DNA hybridizations. Protein and gold nanoparticles with different charges are encapsulated in tetrahedral frameworks to exert diverse electrostatic effects on site&#8208;specifically tethered single DNA strands. Using this strategy, we have successfully modulated the hybridization kinetics in both bulk solution and single molecule level. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for hybridization rates.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Long-range electrostatic interactions beyond biomolecular interaction interfaces have not been extensively studied due to the limitation in engineering electric double layers in physiological fluids. Here we find that long-range electrostatic interactions play an essential role in kinetic modulation of DNA hybridizations. Protein and gold nanoparticles with different charges are encapsulated in tetrahedral frameworks to exert diverse electrostatic effects on site-specifically tethered single DNA strands. Using this strategy, we have successfully modulated the hybridization kinetics in both bulk solution and single molecule level. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that long-range Coulomb interactions are the key factor for hybridization rates. This work validates the important role of long-range electrostatic forces in nucleic acid-biomacromolecule complexes, which may encourage new strategies of gene regulation, antisense therapy, and nucleic acid detection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nocathioamides, uncovered by a Tunable Metabologenomic Approach, define a Novel Class of Chimeric Lanthipeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing number of available genomes, in combination with advanced genome mining techniques, unveiled a plethora of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) coding for ribosomal synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). The products of these BGCs often represent an enormous resource for new and bioactive compounds, but frequently, they cannot be readily isolated and remain cryptic. Here, we describe a tunable metabologenomic approach that recruits a synergism of bioinformatics in tandem with isotope&#8208; and NMR&#8208;guided platform to identify the product of an orphan RiPP gene cluster in the genomes of Nocardia terpenica IFM 0406 and 0706T. The application of this tactic resulted in the discovery of nocathioamides family as a founder of a new class of chimeric lanthipeptides I.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells Based on Copper(II/I) Redox Mediators Bearing a Pentadentate Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, copper redox mediators have attracted growing interest in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs), exhibiting high photovoltage of over 1.0 V and outstanding performance under ambient lighting. However, emerging experimental evidence reveals that the ubiquitously used Lewis base additives in the electrolytes, such as 4&#8208;  tert  &#8208;butylpyridine (TBP), coordinate to the Cu(II) species, which restricts further enhancement of device performance and stability for these electrolytes. Here, we report for the first time the application of copper complexes endowed with diamine&#8208;tripyridine pentadentate ligands, namely [Cu(tpe)]  2+/+  (tpe =  N  &#8208;benzyl&#8208;  N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;  &#8208;tris(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine) and [Cu(tme)]  2+/+  (tme =  N  &#8208;benzyl&#8208;  N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;  &#8208;tris(6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)ethylenediamine), as redox mediators in DSCs. Cyclic voltammetry, absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies demonstrate that the coordination environment of copper(II) complexes with pentadentate ligands remains unchanged in the presence of TBP, which is in stark contrast to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bipyridyl counterpart. Strikingly, DSCs based on [Cu(tme)]  2+/+  complexes exhibit an excellent long&#8208;term stability and maintain more than 90% of the initial efficiency after 400 h under continuous illumination, which outperform the reference devices incorporating the bipyridyl counterpart (less than 80%) under identical conditions. The present work thus provides a guidance for future design of stable copper redox mediators in DSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>The Current Status of MOF and COF Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The amalgamation of different disciplines is at the heart of reticular chemistry and has broadened the boundaries of chemistry by opening up an infinite space of chemical composition, structure, and material properties. Reticular design has enabled the precise prediction of crystalline framework structures, tunability of chemical composition, incorporation of various functionalities onto the framework backbone, and as a consequence, fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and covalent organic framework (COF) properties beyond that of any other material class. Leveraging the unique properties of reticular materials has resulted in significant advances from both a fundamental and an applied perspective. Here, we wish to review the milestones in MOF and COF research and give a critical view on progress in their real&#8208;world applications. Finally, we briefly discuss the major challenges in the field that need to be addressed to pave the way for industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Microenvironment Modulation Boosting Electron Transfer between Metal Nanoparticles and MOFs for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial electron transfer between cocatalyst and photosensitizer plays a key role in heterogeneous photocatalysis, yet the underlying mechanism remains subtle and unclear. Particularly, the surfactant coated on the metal cocatalysts, greatly modulating the microenvironment of catalytic sites, is largely ignored. Herein, a series of Pt co&#8208;catalysts with modulated microenvironments, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) capped Pt nanoparticles (denoted as Pt  PVP  ), Pt with partially removed PVP (Pt  rPVP  ), and clean Pt without PVP (Pt), have been encapsulated into a representative metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , to afford Pt  PVP  @UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , Pt  rPVP  @UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , and Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , respectively, for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Systemic investigations suggest that the PVP presents a negative influence on the interfacial electron transfer between Pt and the MOF. Compared with Pt  PVP  @UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , the removal of interfacial PVP effectively improves the sluggish kinetics of electron transfer, accordingly boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <title>Coupling Strategy for CO2 Valorization Integrated with Organic Synthesis by Heterogeneous Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox&#8208;catalyzed win&#8211;win coupling strategy, in which CO2 valorization is integrated with organic synthesis in one reaction system, provides a promising approach that enables sufficient utilization of excited electrons and holes to achieve feasible and sustainable light&#8208;mediated artificial photosynthesis.







Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to solar fuels and/or fine chemicals is a promising way to increase the energy supply and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the conventional reaction system for CO2 photoreduction with pure H2O or sacrificial agents usually suffers from low catalytic efficiency, poor stability, or cost&#8208;ineffective atom economy. A recent surge of developments, in which photocatalytic CO2 valorization is integrated with selective organic synthesis into one reaction system, indicates an efficient modus operandi that enables sufficient utilization of photogenerated electrons and holes to achieve the goals for sustainable economic and social development. In this Review we discuss current advances in cooperative photoredox reaction systems that integrate CO2 valorization with organics upgrading based on heterogeneous photocatalysis. The applications and virtues of this strategy and the underlying reaction mechanisms are discussed. The ongoing challenges and prospects in this area are critically discussed.

         <title>Photochemical Probe Identification of a Small&#8208;Molecule Inhibitor Binding Site in Hedgehog Acyltransferase (HHAT)**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;activity relationship analysis of Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) inhibitors allowed rational design of photochemical probes for HHAT. Probe photocrosslinking identified the first small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in HHAT and revealed the inhibitory mechanism, providing an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor IMP&#8208;1575 (Ki=38&#8197;nM) for future studies.







Abstract
The mammalian membrane&#8208;bound O&#8208;acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily is involved in biological processes including growth, development and appetite sensing. MBOATs are attractive drug targets in cancer and obesity; however, information on the binding site and molecular mechanisms underlying small&#8208;molecule inhibition is elusive. This study reports rational development of a photochemical probe to interrogate a novel small&#8208;molecule inhibitor binding site in the human MBOAT Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). Structure&#8208;activity relationship investigation identified single enantiomer IMP&#8208;1575, the most potent HHAT inhibitor reported to&#8208;date, and guided design of photocrosslinking probes that maintained HHAT&#8208;inhibitory potency. Photocrosslinking and proteomic sequencing of HHAT delivered identification of the first small&#8208;molecule binding site in a mammalian MBOAT. Topology and homology data suggested a potential mechanism for HHAT inhibition which was confirmed by kinetic analysis. Our results provide an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor IMP&#8208;1575 (Ki=38&#8197;nM) and a strategy for mapping small molecule interaction sites in MBOATs.

Probe photocrosslinking identified the first small-molecule inhibitor binding site in HHAT and revealed the inhibitory mechanism, providing an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor &lt;b&gt;IMP-1575&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian membrane-bound &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily is involved in biological processes including growth, development and appetite sensing. MBOATs are attractive drug targets in cancer and obesity; however, information on the binding site and molecular mechanisms underlying small-molecule inhibition is elusive. This study reports rational development of a photochemical probe to interrogate a novel small-molecule inhibitor binding site in the human MBOAT Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT). Structure-activity relationship investigation identified single enantiomer &lt;b&gt;IMP-1575&lt;/b&gt;, the most potent HHAT inhibitor reported to-date, and guided design of photocrosslinking probes that maintained HHAT-inhibitory potency. Photocrosslinking and proteomic sequencing of HHAT delivered identification of the first small-molecule binding site in a mammalian MBOAT. Topology and homology data suggested a potential mechanism for HHAT inhibition which was confirmed by kinetic analysis. Our results provide an optimal HHAT tool inhibitor &lt;b&gt;IMP-1575&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=38&#8197;nM) and a strategy for mapping small molecule interaction sites in MBOATs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of a Structurally Dynamic Antibacterial Diterpenoid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the isolation of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold. The absolute configurations and antibacterial activities of benditerpenoic acid and the benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene core were established.







Abstract
A new bicyclic diterpenoid, benditerpenoic acid, was isolated from soil&#8208;dwelling Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4). We sequenced the bacterial genome, identified the responsible biosynthetic gene cluster, verified the function of the terpene synthase, and heterologously produced the core diterpene. Comparative bioinformatics indicated this Streptomyces strain is phylogenetically unique and possesses nine terpene synthases. The absolute configurations of the new trans&#8208;fused bicyclo[8.4.0]tetradecanes were achieved by extensive spectroscopic analyses, including Mosher's analysis, J&#8208;based coupling analysis, and computations based on sparse NMR&#8208;derived experimental restraints. Interestingly, benditerpenoic acid exists in two distinct ring&#8208;flipped bicyclic conformations with a rotational barrier of &#8776;16&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in solution. The diterpenes exhibit moderate antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive bacteria including methicillin and multi&#8208;drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This is a rare example of an eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid from bacteria and the first identification of a diterpene synthase and biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for the construction of the eunicellane scaffold.

         <title>Coating the Right Polymer: Achieving Ideal Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Particle Dispersibility in Polymer Matrixes Using a Coordinative Crosslinking Surface Modification Method</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new general method for the coating of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with a uniform layer of polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, or polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1) is reported. By matching the surface polymer with the matrix polymer, ideal dispersibility of MOF particles in various polymer matrices can thus be achieved.







Abstract
This work describes the first generalizable method to modify various metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) surfaces with polyimide, polysulfone, polycarbonate, and polymer of intrinsic microporosity&#8208;1 (PIM&#8208;1). The method first utilizes electrostatic adsorption to rapidly decorate positively charged MOF surfaces with a layer of negatively charged metal&#8208;organic nanocapsule, PgC5Cu. After mixing with the polymer, the copper open metal sites on PgC5Cu can coordinatively crosslink the polar functional groups on the surface polymer upon thermal activation thereby resulting in the immobilization of a uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm polymer coating. We quantitatively analyzed the distribution of free path spacing between MOF particles and demonstrated that when the surface polymer matches the matrix polymer, the MOF dispersion was not only visually improved but also found to align perfectly with a theoretically predicted ideal dispersion model where no aggregation driving force was present.

         <title>Spatial Confinement Tunes Cleavage and Re&#8208;Formation of C=N Bonds in Fluorescent Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial confinement dramatically changes the pathway and energy profile of chemical reactions. Confinement effect promoted increased local concentration and reduced steric hindrance of reactive groups, which realized the reversible conversion of molecular fluorescence. This fluorescence switching system has potential applications in information encryption and multi&#8208;informational display.







Abstract
Molecules in confined spaces exhibit unusual behaviors that are not typically observed in bulk systems. Such behavior can provide alternative strategies for exploring new reaction pathways. Cleavage of the C=N bond of Nile red (NR) in solution is an irreversible reaction. Here, we used spatial confinement within a cationic micelle&#8208;confined system to convert this reaction to a reversible process. The fluorescence of NR shifted between red and green for nine cycles. The new chemical pathway based on spatial confinement can be attributed to two factors: increasing the local concentration of reactants and reducing the reaction energy barrier. This effect is supported by both experimental evidence and theoretical calculations. The cross&#8208;linked silica shell comprising the confinement chamber stabilizes the enclosed molecules. This reduces fluorophore leakage and maintains fluorescence intensity in most environments, including in solution, on paper, and in hydrogel films, and expands practical applications in encrypted information and multi&#8208;informational displays.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled Palladium(II) Barrel for Binding of Fullerenes and Photosensitization Ability of the Fullerene&#8208;Encapsulated Barrel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole&#8208;based tetra&#8208;imidazole ligand and a PdII acceptor were employed to construct a trifacial molecular barrel (1), which acts as an efficient host for fullerenes. The barrel has better binding affinity towards C70 over C60 and predominantly encapsulates C70 from a mixture of C60/C70. In the presence of visible light, C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 show efficient photosensitizing ability for 1O2 generation.







Abstract
Fullerene extracts obtained from fullerene soot lack their real application due to their poor solubility in common solvents and difficulty in purification. Encapsulation of these extracts in a suitable host is an important approach to address these issues. We present a new Pd6 barrel (1), which is composed of three 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole panels, clipped through six cis&#8208;PdII acceptors. Large open windows and cavity make it an efficient host for a large guest. Favorable interactions between the ligand and fullerene (C60 and C70) allows the barrel to encapsulate fullerene efficiently. Thorough investigation reveals that barrel 1 has a stronger binding affinity towards C70 over C60, resulting in the predominant extraction of C70 from a mixture of the two. Finally, the fullerene encapsulated barrels C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 were found to be efficient for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced singlet oxygen generation. Such preferential binding of C70 and photosensitizing ability of C60&#8834;1 and C70&#8834;1 are noteworthy.

         <dc:description>
An unconventional ZIF&#8208;67 colloidal dispersion consisting of amorphous nanoparticles has been discovered, which was used as precursors to yield uniform films that deposited onto a number of substrates by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating approach, enabling fabrication of large&#8208;area ZIF&#8208;67 thin films with highly controlled thickness. This method can be extended to fabricate ZIF&#8208;8 thin film.

We report that continuous MOF films with highly controlled thickness (from 44 to 5100&#8197;nm) can be deposited over length scales greater than 80&#8197;centimeters by a facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective spray&#8208;coating method. Such success relies on our discovery of unprecedented perfectly dispersed colloidal solutions consisting of amorphous MOF nanoparticles, which we adopted as precursors that readily converted to the crystalline films upon low&#8208;temperature in situ heating. The colloidal solutions allow for the fabrication of compact and uniform MOF films on a great deal of substrates such as fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide, glass, SiO2, Al2O3, Si, Cu, and even flexible polycarbonate, widening their technological applications where substrates are essential. Despite the present work focuses on the fabrication of uniform cobalt&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 and zinc&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)2 films, our findings mark a great possibility in producing other high&#8208;quality MOF thin films on a large scale.

&lt;p&gt;An unconventional ZIF-67 colloidal dispersion consisting of amorphous nanoparticles has been discovered, which was used as precursors to yield uniform films that deposited onto a number of substrates by a facile, fast, and cost-effective spray-coating approach, enabling fabrication of large-area ZIF-67 thin films with highly controlled thickness. This method can be extended to fabricate ZIF-8 thin film.

         <title>The Hydrotropic Effect of Ionic Liquids in Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolytes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic liquids boost the LiTFSI solubility in water from 21 to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Excess lithium salt solubility arises from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. This approach improves particularly the reductive stability of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes, enabling stable cycling of commercially relevant LTO/NMC811 full cells.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes have successfully expanded the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes beyond 2&#8197;V. Further improvements in stability can be achieved by partially substituting water with either classical organic solvents or ionic liquids. Here, we study ternary electrolytes composed of LiTFSI, water, and imidazolium ionic liquids. We find that the LiTFSI solubility strongly increases from 21&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in water to up to 60&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in the presence of ionic liquid. The solution structure is investigated with Raman and NMR spectroscopy and the enhanced LiTFSI solubility is found to originate from a hydrotropic effect of the ionic liquids. The increased reductive stability of the ternary electrolytes enables stable cycling of an aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery with an energy density of 150&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 on the active material level based on commercially relevant Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 electrode materials.

         <title>Cooperation between a T&#8197;Domain and a Minimal C&#8208;Terminal Docking Domain to Enable Specific Assembly in a Multiprotein NRPS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction between two non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) proteins mediates the biosynthesis of PAX peptides and involves an extended docking interface, where a part of the thiolation (T) domain and a minimal C&#8208;terminal docking domain (CDD) cooperate to bind to the N&#8208;terminal docking domain (NDD) with nanomolar affinity&#8212;the highest docking domain affinity yet observed in such megasynthases.







Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) produce natural products from amino acid building blocks. They often consist of multiple polypeptide chains which assemble in a specific linear order via specialized N&#8208; and C&#8208;terminal docking domains (N/CDDs). Typically, docking domains function independently from other domains in NRPS assembly. Thus, docking domain replacements enable the assembly of &#8220;designer&#8221; NRPS from proteins that normally do not interact. The multiprotein &#8220;peptide&#8208;antimicrobial&#8208;Xenorhabdus&#8221; (PAX) peptide&#8208;producing PaxS NRPS is assembled from the three proteins PaxA, PaxB and PaxC. Herein, we show that the small CDD of PaxA cooperates with its preceding thiolation (T1) domain to bind the NDD of PaxB with very high affinity, establishing a structural and thermodynamical basis for this unprecedented docking interaction, and we test its functional importance in vivo in a truncated PaxS assembly line. Similar docking interactions are apparently present in other NRPS systems.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Insights into C&#8722;S Bond Formation in Gliotoxin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of structural biology, mutagenesis, natural product isolation and activity assays provides insights into the formation of two carbon&#8722;sulfur bonds in the fungal virulence factor gliotoxin and related epipolythiodioxopiperazine natural products. The exceptional glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferase GliG uses an unusual bis&#8208;hydroxylated gliotoxin precursor and successively links two molecules of glutathione.







Abstract
Glutathione&#8208;S&#8208;transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulfur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulfurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon&#8722;sulfur linkage formation from a bis&#8208;hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[&#8208;l&#8208;Phe&#8208;l&#8208;Ser]&#8208;bis&#8208;glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified A. fumigatus strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme&#8208;mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C&#8722;S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.

         <title>Cluster From Cluster: A Quantitative Approach to Magic Gold Nanoclusters [Au25(SR)18]&#8722;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;cluster from cluster&#8221; approach was developed to assemble gold nanoclusters via preformed atomically precise Au13 precursors. This facile approach has attractive advantages: very high overall yield (&#8776;100&#8201;%), large scale (gram&#8208;scale) and generally applicable in the synthesis of magic cluster Au25 (10 examples).







Abstract
High&#8208;yield and large&#8208;scale synthesis are highly demanded for the studies of gold nanoclusters. We developed a &#8220;cluster from cluster&#8221; approach to assemble gold nanoclusters with preformed atomically precise Au13 precursors. This facile approach has proved to be very effective in the synthesis of the well&#8208;known magic cluster [Au25(SR)18]&#8722;, which could prepare the target cluster in high yield (overall yield up to &#8776;100&#8201;%) at large scale (gram&#8208;scale based on gold). This method can be applied in the synthesis of 10 Au25 clusters with different R groups. This work presents an important approach that may be extended to high&#8208;yield and large&#8208;scale synthesis of other metal nanoclusters.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type Oxidation of Olefins at Room Temperature with 1,3&#8208;Diketones or Neocuproine as Ligands**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Various iron catalyst systems featuring a range of different ligands have been evaluated for the Wacker&#8208;type oxidation of olefins to ketones in the presence of phenylsilane at room temperature and ambient air. The transformation is operationally simple, sustainable, exhibits a high functional group tolerance, and is applicable to natural product synthesis.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a convenient and general method for the oxidation of olefins to ketones using either tris(dibenzoylmethanato)iron(III) [Fe(dbm)3] or a combination of iron(II) chloride and neocuproine (2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) as catalysts and phenylsilane (PhSiH3) as additive. All reactions proceed efficiently at room temperature using air as sole oxidant. This transformation has been applied to a variety of substrates, is operationally simple, proceeds under mild reaction conditions, and shows a high functional&#8208;group tolerance. The ketones are formed smoothly in up to 97&#8201;% yield and with 100&#8201;% regioselectivity, while the corresponding alcohols were observed as by&#8208;products. Labeling experiments showed that an incorporated hydrogen atom originates from the phenylsilane. The oxygen atom of the ketone as well as of the alcohol derives from the ambient atmosphere.

         <title>UV Solar&#8208;Blind&#8208;Region Phase&#8208;Matchable Optical Nonlinearity and Anisotropy in a &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Cation&#8208;Containing Phosphate</title>

         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#8901;3&#8201;H2O exhibits rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large second harmonic generation (SHG) response and sufficient birefringence for phase&#8208;matching at a short SHG wavelength.







Abstract
Wide ultraviolet (UV) transparency, strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, and sufficient optical birefringence for phase&#8208;matching (PM) at short SHG wavelengths are vital for practical UV nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, simultaneously optimizing these properties is a major challenge, particularly for metal phosphates. Herein, we report a non&#8208;traditional &#960;&#8208;conjugated cation&#8208;based UV NLO phosphate [C(NH2)3]6(PO4)2&#8901;3&#8201;H2O (GPO) with a short UV cutoff edge. GPO is SHG active at 1064&#8197;nm (3.8 &#215; KH2PO4 @ 1064&#8197;nm) and 532&#8197;nm (0.3 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4 @ 532&#8197;nm) and also possesses a significant birefringence (0.078 @ 546&#8197;nm) with a band gap &gt;6.0&#8197;eV. The PM SHG capability of GPO can extend to 250&#8197;nm, indicating GPO is a promising UV solar&#8208;blind NLO material. Calculations and crystal structure analysis show that the rare coexistence of wide UV transparency, large SHG response, and optical anisotropy is due to the introduction of &#960;&#8208;conjugated cations [C(NH2)3]+ and their favorable arrangement with [PO4]3&#8722; anions.

         <title>Acridinium Salts and Cyanoarenes as Powerful Photocatalysts: Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a result of their unique reactivity in numerous challenging organic transformations, acridinium salts and cyanoarenes have become the organophotocatalysts of choice in organic chemistry. This Minireview discusses the synthesis of these catalysts and their multireactivity, with a special focus on mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
The use of organic photocatalysts has revolutionized the field of photoredox catalysis, as it allows access to reactivities that were traditionally restricted to transition&#8208;metal photocatalysts. This Minireview reports recent developments in the use of acridinium ions and cyanoarene derivatives in organic synthesis. The activation of inert chemical bonds as well as the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biorelevant molecules are discussed, with a special focus on their mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ionic Organic Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a result of the efficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;mediated chirality transfer and light&#8208;harvesting energy transfer, well&#8208;ordered ionic microcrystals formed between pyridine&#8208;containing achiral molecules and chiral camphor sulfonic acid display full&#8208;color and homogeneously white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with &#934;FL of up to 80&#8201;% and glum in the order of 10&#8722;2.







Abstract
A simple and general method is presented herein for the in situ preparations of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)&#8208;active microcrystals with a large luminescence dissymmetry factor glum, high fluorescence quantum efficiency (&#934;FL), wide emission color tenability, and well&#8208;ordered morphology. The reactions of pyridine&#8208;containing achiral molecules 1&#8211;7 with chiral camphor sulfonic acid ((&#177;)&#8208;CSA) gave crystalline microplates formed by hydrogen bonding interactions between the protonated pyridinium units and the sulfonic anions. The chiral information of CSA are effectively transferred to the microcrystals by hydrogen bonding to afford full&#8208;color CPL from deep&#8208;blue to red with glum in the order of 10&#8722;2 and &#934;FL up to 80&#8201;%. Moreover, organic microcrystals with high&#8208;performance white CPL (&#934;FL=46&#8201;%; |glum|=0.025) are achieved via the light&#8208;harvesting energy transfer between blue and yellow emitters.

         <title>Library Creation of Ultrasmall Multi&#8208;metallic Nanoparticles Confined in Mesoporous MFI Zeolites</title>

         <dc:description>
A library of ultrasmall multi&#8208;metallic nanoparticles confined in both micro&#8208; and mesopores of molecular sieves was created by the trifunctional templating route.







Abstract
The development of materials integrated with ultrasmall multi&#8208;metal nanoparticles (UMMNs) and mesoporous zeolite is a considerable challenge in chemistry and materials science. We designed a trifunctional surfactant, in which the pyridyl benzimidazole in the hydrophobic tail generates the mesopores through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking; the diquaternary ammonium in the hydrophilic headgroup direct the formation of MFI zeolite sheets and the nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic rings coordinate with various metal ions to form UMMNs confined in the zeolite matrix after calcination and reduction. A library of 56 UMMNs confined within both micropores and mesopores of MFI zeolites (MMZs) with 4 mono&#8208;, 14 bi&#8208; and 38 tri&#8208;metallic nanoparticles (sizes of 1.3&#8211;4.7&#8197;nm) of combinations of Rh, Pd, Pt, Au, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn were made. An improved catalytic performance was exhibited in the sequence of Rh&#8208;MMZ&lt;Rh/Pt&#8208;MMZ&lt;Rh/Pt/Ni&#8208;MMZ for the mild oxidation of methane to methanol or liquid acid.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Copper&#8211;DNAzyme Nanohybrids for Dual&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohybrid was reported for highly efficient combined gene silencing and chemodynamic therapy. The system can effectively co&#8208;deliver DNAzyme and Cu2+ into cancer cells for dual&#8208;catalytic therapy to fight against tumors, thus providing an intelligent self&#8208;driven strategy for smart theranostics.







Abstract
Despite the great efforts of using DNAzyme for gene therapy, its clinical success is limited by the lack of simple delivery systems and limited anticancer efficacy. Here, we develop a simple approach for the synthesis of hybrid nanostructures that exclusively consist of DNAzyme and Cu2+ with ultra&#8208;high loading capacity. The Cu&#8211;DNAzyme nanohybrids allow to effectively co&#8208;deliver DNAzyme and Cu2+ into cancer cells for combinational catalytic therapy. The released Cu2+ can be reduced to Cu+ by glutathione and then catalyze endogenous H2O2 to form cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy (CDT), while the 10&#8211;23 DNAzyme enables the catalytic cleavage of VEGFR2 mRNA and activates gene silencing for gene therapy. We demonstrate that the system can efficiently accumulate in the tumor and exhibit amplified cascade antitumor effects with negligible systemic toxicity. Our work paves an extremely simple way to integrate DNAzyme with CDT for the dual&#8208;catalytic tumor treatment.

         <title>Production of Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam Chemicals from Biomass&#8208;Derived Triacetic Acid Lactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tandem catalytic route was developed for the selective production of 2&#8208;methyl piperidine (MP) or 6&#8208;methylpiperidin&#8208;2&#8208;one (MPO) from biomass&#8208;derived triacetic acid lactone (TAL), which opens the way for efficient production of piperidine and &#948;&#8208;lactam chemicals from renewable biomass.







Abstract
Piperidine and &#948;&#8208;Lactam chemicals have wide application, which are currently produced from fossil resource in industry. Production of this kind of chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass is of great importance, but is challenging and the reported routes give low yield. Herein, we demonstrate the strategy to synthesize 2&#8208;methyl piperidine (MP) and 6&#8208;methylpiperidin&#8208;2&#8208;one (MPO) from biomass&#8208;derived triacetic acid lactone (TAL) that is produced microbially from glucose. In this route, TAL was firstly converted into 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;6&#8208;methylpyridin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one (HMPO) through facile aminolysis, subsequently HMPO was selectively transformed into MP or MPO over Ru catalysts supported on beta zeolite (Ru/BEA&#8208;X, X is the molar ratio of Si to Al) via the tandem reaction. It was found that the yield of MP could reach 76.5&#8201;% over Ru/BEA&#8208;60 in t&#8208;BuOH, and the yield of MPO could be 78.5&#8201;% in dioxane. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent catalytic performance of Ru/BEA&#8208;60 was closely correlated with the cooperative effects between active metal and acidic zeolite with large pore geometries. The related reaction pathway was studied on the basis of control experiments.

         <title>Merging Electron Transfer with 1,2&#8208;Metalate Rearrangement: Deoxygenative Arylation of Inert Amides with Arylboronic Esters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amides are essentially inert carboxyl derivatives in many types of chemical transformations. In particular, deoxygenative C&#8208;C bond formation of amides to synthetically important amines is a long&#8208;standing challenge for synthetic chemists due to the inertness of the resonance&#8208;stabilized amide C=O bond. Herein, it is disclosed that by merging electron transfer induced activation with 1,2&#8208;metalate rearrangement, a wide range of inert amides react smoothly with arylboron regents, affording a series of biologically relevant diarylmethylamines as deoxygenative C&#8208;C bond cross coupling products. With its simplicity and versatility, it shows great promise in synthesis of amines from amides, which may open up new avenues in retrosynthetic planning and find widespread use in academia and industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;invasive Regulation of Cellular Morphology Using a Photoswitchable Mechanical DNA Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extracellular matrix, residing the cells provides a dynamic and reversible environment. Spatiotemporal cues are essential when cells are undergoing morphogenesis, repair and differentiation. Recapitulation of such an intricate system with reversible presentation of nanoscale cues can help us better understand cellular processes and can allow precise manipulation of cell function in vitro. Herein, we formulated a photoswitchable DNA mechanical nanostructure containing azobenzene moieties and dynamically regulated the spatial distance between adhesion peptides using the photoswitchable DNA polymer with photoirradiation. We found that the DNA polymer reversibly forms two different structures, a relaxed linear and shrinked compact form, observed by AFM. Using mechanical properties of this DNA polymer, UV and visible light irradiation induced significant morphology change of cells between a round shape and spindle shape, thus provides a tool to decipher the language of the ECM better.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic study of carbon dioxide hydrogenation over Pd/ZnO&#8208;based catalysts: the role of palladium&#8208;zinc alloy in selective methanol synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd/ZnO catalysts show good activity and high selectivity to methanol during catalytic CO  2  hydrogenation. The palladium&#8208;zinc alloy phase has been usually considered as the active phase, though mechanistic studies under  operando  conditions have not been conducted to verify this. Here, we report a detailed mechanistic study under realistic conditions of methanol synthesis, using  in situ  and  operando  X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and time&#8208;resolved isotope labeling experiments coupled with FTIR spectroscopy and MS analysis. Palladium&#8208;zinc alloy&#8208;based catalysts, prepared through reduction of a heterobimetallic Pd  II  Zn  II  acetate bridge complex, and which do not contain zinc oxide or any PdZn/ZnO interface, produce mostly carbon monoxide. The palladium&#8208;zinc phase is, therefore, principally associated with the formation of carbon monoxide, and does not provide the active sites required to produce methanol from the direct hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. Instead, we show that the presence of a zinc oxide phase, in contact with a palladium&#8208;zinc phase, is essential for efficient production of methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Benzothiophene/Benzofuran&#8208;Fused Biaryls by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalyzed Arene Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyzed enantioselective de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzylbenzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes has been developed. This cascade process comprises a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion, allowing rapid access to atropoisomeric tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls with high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
Axially chiral biaryl scaffolds are prevalent in natural products, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. However, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed de novo construction of an aromatic ring with concomitant axial chirality induction for the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers is far less developed, and the efficient synthesis of axially chiral tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls remains an unsolved problem under NHC catalysis. Reported here is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls from enals and 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;carbaldehydes through a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization cascade with central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion. The developed method provides efficient and general access to novel axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran&#8208;fused biaryls in high enantioselectivities and works well for the synthesis of tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryls.

This cascade process comprises a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization with central-to-axial chirality conversion, allowing rapid access to atropoisomeric tri- and tetra-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted biaryls with high enantioselectivities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axially chiral biaryl scaffolds are prevalent in natural products, chiral ligands, and organocatalysts. However, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed de novo construction of an aromatic ring with concomitant axial chirality induction for the synthesis of biaryl atropisomers is far less developed, and the efficient synthesis of axially chiral tetra-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted biaryls remains an unsolved problem under NHC catalysis. Reported here is an NHC-catalyzed de novo synthesis of axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran-fused biaryls from enals and 2-benzyl-benzothiophene/benzofuran-3-carbaldehydes through a [2+4] annulation, decarboxylation, and oxidative aromatization cascade with central-to-axial chirality conversion. The developed method provides efficient and general access to novel axially chiral benzothiophene/benzofuran-fused biaryls in high enantioselectivities and works well for the synthesis of tetra-&lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-substituted biaryls.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Operando Cooperated Catalytic Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 for Promoting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom dispersed catalyst of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 has been established for enhancing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Operando XANES combined with DFT calculation demonstrate that the Cu&#8722;N4 sites as active center experience the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turn to single&#8208;atom state again after reaction.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit superior performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, the synergistic catalytic mechanism is not deeply understood. Herein, we report a dual&#8208;metal single&#8208;atom catalyst consisted of Cu&#8722;N4 and Zn&#8722;N4 on the N&#8208;doped carbon support (Cu/Zn&#8722;NC). It exhibits high&#8208;efficiency ORR activity with an Eonset of 0.98&#8197;V and an E1/2 of 0.83&#8197;V, excellent stability (no degradation after 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles), surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C and great mass of Pt&#8208;free single atom catalysts. Operando XANES demonstrates that the Cu&#8722;N4 as active center experiences the change from atomic dispersion to cluster with the cooperation of Zn&#8722;N4 during ORR process, and then turns to single atom state again after reaction. DFT calculation further indicates that the adjustment effect of Zn on the d&#8208;orbital electron distribution of Cu could benefit to the stretch and cleavage of O&#8208;O on Cu active center, speeding up the process of rate determining step of OOH*.

         <title>A Colorimetric Method for Quantifying Cis and Trans Alkenes Using an Indicator Displacement Assay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput method was developed using a colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) to quantify the alkene stereochemistry present within mixtures to an accuracy of 2&#8211;3&#8201;%. Within a series of 96&#8208;well plates, alkenes were dihydroxylated and the resulting diols were subjected to an IDA with an indicator and a boronic acid to determine the amount of threo and/or erythro vicinal diols present.







Abstract
A colorimetric indicator displacement assay (IDA) amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation was developed to determine the percentage of cis and trans alkenes. Using 96&#8208;well plates two steps are performed: a reaction plate for dihydroxylation of the alkenes followed by an IDA screening plate consisting of an indicator and a boronic acid. The dihydroxylation generates either erythro or threo vicinal diols from cis or trans alkenes, depending upon their syn&#8208; or anti&#8208;addition mechanisms. Threo diols preferentially associate with the boronic acid due to the creation of more stable boronate esters, thus displacing the indicator to a greater extent. The generality of the protocol was demonstrated using seven sets of cis and trans alkenes. Blind mixtures of cis and trans alkenes were made, resulting in an average error of &#177;2&#8201;% in the percentage of cis or trans alkenes, and implementing E2 and Wittig reactions gave errors of &#177;3&#8201;%. Furthermore, we developed variants of the IDA for which the color may be tuned to optimize the response for the human eye.

         <title>Transformable Nanosensitizer with Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Sonodynamic Process and Calcium Release for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2@CaP nanosonosensitizer promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS). In an acidic tumor microenvironment, the CaP shell releases Ca2+ under ultrasound. The cascade process induces mitochondrial dysfunction and enhanced immunogenic cell death to boost T cells recruitment and infiltration into the cold tumor, leading to regression of the primary tumor, non&#8208;treated distant tumors, and inhibition of lung metastasis when in conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy.







Abstract
Despite the promise of sonodynamic processes in cancer therapy, existing sonosensitizers often fail to regulate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) against tumors, potentially leading to off&#8208;target toxicity to normal tissues. We report a transformable core&#8208;shell nanosonosensitizer (TiO2@CaP) that reinvigorates ROS generation and dissolves its CaP shell to release Ca2+ in an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) under ultrasound activation. Thus, TiO2@CaP acts as a smart nanosonosensitizer that specifically induces mitochondrial dysfunction via overloading intracellular Ca2+ ions to synergize with the sonodynamic process in the TME. TiO2@CaP substantially enhances immunogenic cell death, resulting in enhanced T&#8208;cell recruitment and infiltration into the immunogenic cold tumor (4T1). In conjunction with checkpoint blockade therapy (anti&#8208;PD 1), TiO2@CaP&#8208;mediated sonodynamic therapy elicits systemic antitumor immunity, leading to regression of non&#8208;treated distant tumors and inhibition of lung metastasis. This work paves the way to development of &#8220;smart&#8221; TME&#8208;activatable sonosensitizers with temporospatial control over antitumor responses.

         <title>H2O&#8208;Built Proton Transfer Bridge Pronouncedly Enhances Continuous Methane Oxidation to Methanol over Cu&#8208;BEA Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct oxidation of methane to methanol (DMTM) constitutes a big challenge in C  1  chemistry. Herein, we present a continuous N  2  O&#8208;DMTM investigation by simultaneously introducing 10 vol% H  2  O into the reaction system over Cu&#8208;BEA zeolites. Combining a D  2  O isotopic tracer technique and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, we for the first time demonstrate that the H  2  O molecules can participate in the reaction through a proton transfer route, wherein the H  2  O molecules can build a high&#8208;speed proton transfer bridge between the generated moieties of CH  3  &#8208;  and OH  &#8208;  over the evolved mono(&#956;&#8208;oxo) dicopper ([Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]  2+  ) active site, thereby pronouncedly boosting the CH  3  OH selectivity (3.1 &#8594; 71.6%), productivity (16.8 &#8594; 242.9 &#956;mol g  cat  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) and long&#8208;term reaction stability (10 &#8594; 70 h) relative to the scenario of absence of H  2  O. Unravelling the proton transfer of H  2  O over the dicopper [Cu&#8208;O&#8208;Cu]  2+  site would substantially contribute to highly efficient catalyst designs for the continuous DMTM.</dc:description>

An asymmetric multicomponent interrupted Kinugasa allylic alkylation (IKAA) reaction has been developed with a synergistic Cu&#8208;catalyzed Kinugasa and Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation system. This strategy provides a high yield and highly selective synthesis of &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams, which are not easily produced by other methods. Stereoselective coupling of two transient organometallic intermediates formed in&#8197;situ is the most important feature of this reaction.







Abstract
An asymmetric multicomponent, interrupted Kinugasa allylic alkylation (IKAA) reaction has been developed with a synergistic Cu&#8208;catalyzed Kinugasa system and a Pd&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation reaction. This unprecedented reaction provides in high yields and with high stereoselectivity a synthesis of &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams, which cannot be produced with existing synthetic methods. Stereoselective coupling of two catalytic amounts of transient organometallic intermediates formed in&#8197;situ is an important feature of this reaction.

         <title>Ultra long&#8208;lived triplet excited state in water at room temperature: Insights on the molecular design of tridecafullerenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Suitably engineered molecular systems exhibiting triplet excited states with very long lifetimes are important for high&#8208;end applications in nonlinear optics, photocatalysis or biomedicine. We report the finding of an ultra long&#8208;lived triplet with a mean lifetime of 93 ms in aqueous phase at room temperature, measured for a globular tridecafullerene with a highly compact glycodendrimeric structure. A series of three tridecafullerenes bearing different glycodendrons and spacers to the C  60  units have been synthesized and characterized. UV/Vis spectra and DLS experiments prove their aggregation in water. Steady state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence experiments suggest a different degree of inner solvation of the multifullerenes depending on their molecular design. Efficient quenching of the triplet states by O  2  but not by waterborne azide anion has been observed. Molecular modelling reveals dissimilar access of the aqueous phase to the internal structure of the tridecafullerenes, differently shielded by the glycodendrimeric shell.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;inorganic quantum dot LEDs based on phase&#8208;stabilized &#945;&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The all&#8208;inorganic nature of CsPbI  3  perovskites offers an avenue to enhance stability in perovskite devices. Concerted research efforts have led to improved stability of the black phase in CsPbI  3  films; however, these strategies &#8211; including strain and doping &#8211;   are based on organic&#8208;ligand&#8208;capped perovskites, which prevent perovskites from forming the close&#8208;packed QD solids necessary to achieve high charge transport and thermal transport.  Here we develop an inorganic ligand exchange that leads to CsPbI  3  QD films that unite superior phase stability with increased thermal transport. We demonstrate that the atomic ligand exchanged QD films, once mechanically coupled, exhibit improved phase stability, and we link this to distributing strain across the film. Further, operando measurements of the temperature of LEDs indicate that KI&#8208;exchanged QD films exhibit increased thermal transport compared to controls that rely on organic ligands. The LEDs exhibit a maximum EQE of 23% with EL emission centered at 640 nm (FWHM of ~31 nm). These red LEDs provide an operating half lifetime of 10 hours (luminance of 200 cd/m  2  ), an operating stability that is 6x higher than that of control devices.</dc:description>

         <title>The First High&#8208;Temperature Supramolecular Radical Ferroics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the discovery of TEMPO (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxyl) in 1973, organic radical ferroics attracted widespread interest among the scientific community. However, the relatively low Curie temperature of 287 K and melting point of 311 K severely hinder its application potential. Despite extensive interest, high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics have not been found to date. Here, taking advantage of chemical design theory and supramolecular radical chemistry, we successfully designed two high&#8208;temperature organic supramolecular radical ferroics [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ReO4) (1) and [(NH3&#8208;TEMPO)([18]crown&#8208;6)](ClO4) (2), which can retain the ferroelectricity up to 413 K and 450 K, respectively. To our knowledge, they are both the first supramolecular radical ferroics and unprecedented high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics, where the supramolecular component plays a vital role in the stabilization of radical and extending working temperature window. Additionally, both of them can also present the paramagnetism and non&#8208;interacting spin moments, as well as excellent piezoelectric and electrostrictive behaviors comparable to that of LiNbO3. This work provides an efficient design strategy for enriching the family of high&#8208;temperature radical ferroics, and should inspire further exploration of multi&#8208;functional organic ferroics.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Identification of Catalytically Active Sites on Oxygen&#8208;doped Carbon Nanosheet to Decipher the High Activity for Electro&#8208;synthesis Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide through two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;  ) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an on&#8208;site and clean route. Oxygen&#8208;doped carbon materials with high ORR activity and H2O2  selectivity have been considered as the promising catalysts, however, there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence to identify true active sites at complex carbon surface. Herein, we proposed a chemical titration strategy to decipher the oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheet (OCNS900  ) catalyst for 2e&#8722;  &#160;ORR. The OCNS900  exhibits outstanding 2e&#8722;  ORR performances with onset potential of 0.825 V (vs. RHE), mass activity of 14.5 A g&#8722;1  at 0.75 V (vs. RHE) and H2  O2  production rate of 770 mmol g  &#8722;1  h  &#8722;1  in flow cell, surpassing most reported carbon catalysts. Through selective chemical titration of C=O, C&#8722;OH, and COOH groups, we found C=O species contributed to the most electrocatalytic activity and were the most active sites for 2e&#8722;  ORR, which were corroborated by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboxylate Ligands&#8208;Promoted Superior Electrocatalytic Performance for Oxygen Evolution Reaction and Their Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with carboxylate ligands as co&#8208;catalysts are very efficient for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the role of local adsorbed carboxylate ligands around the in situ transformed metal (oxy)hydroxides during OER is often overlooked. Here we detailedly reveal the extraordinary role and mechanism of surface adsorbed carboxylate ligands on bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/MOFs for OER electrocatalytic activity enhancement. The results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the carboxylic groups around metal (oxy)hydroxides can efficiently induce the interfacial electron redistribution, facilitate abundant high&#8208;valence state of nickel species with partial distorted octahedral structure, and optimize the d&#8208;band center together with the beneficial Gibbs free energy of intermediate. Furthermore, the results of in&#8208;situ Raman and FI&#8208;IR spectra firstly reveal that the surface adsorbed carboxylate ligands as Lewis base can promote the sluggish OER kinetics by accelerating proton transfer and facilitating adsorption/activation/dissociation of hydroxyl ions (OH&#8208;). Our findings will offer the unique insights into the reason for disclosing the origin of excellent catalytic activity of MOF/NiFe&#8208;LDHs catalysts for OER.</dc:description>

         <title>Leakage&#8208;Proof Electrolyte Chemistry for High Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is well known that electrolyte leakage is a severe safety concern in commercially available lithium batteries, especially for pouch cell applications. With highly volatile 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane as solvent, the leakage related hazards are more pronounced and serious for promising lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, which feature high energy density exceeding 500 Wh kg  &#8211;1  . To address this concern, a leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte is delicately designed through tuning the electrolyte chemistry to achieve high performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. We functionalize the commercial 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based electrolyte by Li  +  &#8208;conductive macromolecules of Li  6  PS  5  Cl&#8208;grafted poly(ethyl cyanoacrylate) with strong polar groups, which can interact readily with the aluminum&#8208;plastic packing layer through hydrogen bond to immobilize the electrolyte. More importantly, the moisture from ambient environment can catalyze a further polymerization of the macromolecules to seal the leaking points of the pouch cell and thereby to solve the leakage issue effectively. As a result, the as&#8208;designed electrolyte endows lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries stable charge/discharge behavior and superior safety characteristics without any leakage even in an artificial cut pouch cell. It is noted that, with a bare sulfur loading of 4.9 mg cm  &#8211;2  , the battery can deliver good endurance due to the suppressed polysulfide shuttle by its polar groups and high ionic conductivity of the leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte. This contribution enlightens the design of leakage&#8208;proof electrolyte and makes a milestone for high performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with significantly enhanced safety characteristics.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Immunodetection of Global A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA Editing Activity with a Chemiluminescent Bioassay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) editing is a conserved RNA modification that contributes to&#160;immune response and overall cellular function. RNA editing patterns can vary significantly between different cell and tissue types, and hyperactive A&#8208;to&#8208;I signatures are indicative of several diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Because of the&#160;importance of these differences, there is significant need for efficient methods to measure overall A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing levels in cellular RNA. The current standard approach relies on RNA&#8208;seq to indirectly detect editing sites, which requires large investments in time and material as well as extensive computational analysis. Here, we utilize Endonuclease V (EndoV), which binds&#160;to inosine in RNA, to develop a protein&#8208;based chemiluminescent bioassay to directly profile A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing activity. We previously showed that EndoV can&#160;enrich edited transcripts prior to RNA&#8208;seq, and we now leverage this activity to construct an EndoV&#8208;linked immunosorbency assay (EndoVLISA) as a rapid&#160;chemiluminescent method for measuring global A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing signatures in cellular RNA. We first optimize and validate our assay, illustrating highly selective and sensitive detection of inosine in RNA. We then demonstrate rapid detection of inosine content in treated cell lines, demonstrating equivalent performance against current standard RNA&#8208;seq approaches. Lastly, we deploy our EndoVLISA for profiling differential A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA editing signatures in normal and diseased human tissue, illustrating the utility of our platform as a diagnostic bioassay. Together, the EndoVLISA method is cost&#8208;effective, straightforward, and utilizes common laboratory equipment, offering a highly accessible new approach for studying A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing. Moreover, the multi&#8208;well plate format makes this the first assay amenable for direct high&#8208;throughput quantification of A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing for applications in disease detection and drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA&#8208;based microparticle tension sensors (&#181;TS) for measuring cell mechanics in non&#8208;planar geometries and for high&#8208;throughput quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanotransduction, the interplay between physical and chemical signaling, plays vital roles in many biological processes ranging from cell differentiation to metastasis. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques to quantify cell forces employ deformable polymer films or molecular probes tethered to glass substrates. These types of flat substrates limit applications in investigating mechanotransduction on non&#8208;planar geometries where physiological activities such as phagocytosis and immunological synapse formation mostly occur. A second challenge is the low throughput of microscopy readout which limits the application of current assays in fundamental and clinical research. We address these challenges by developing a DNA&#8208;based microparticle tension sensor (&#181;TS), which features a spherical surface and thus allows for investigation of mechanical events at curved interfaces or within groups of cells in suspension. Importantly, the micron&#8208;scale of &#181;TS enables flow cytometry readout, which is rapid and high throughput. To demonstrate the scope of &#181;TS, we applied the method to map and measure T&#8208;cell receptor (TCR) forces and platelet integrin forces at 12 and 56 pN thresholds. Furthermore, we quantified the inhibition efficiency of two anti&#8208;platelet drugs providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of &#181;TS to screen drugs that modulate cellular mechanics.</dc:description>

         <title>SO2 Capture using Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first experimental investigation of porous organic cages (POCs) for the demanding challenge of SO  2  capture. Three isostructural cage molecular materials were studied. An imine functionalized POC (CC3) showed modest and reversible SO  2  capture, while a secondary amine POC (RCC3) exhibited high but irreversible SO  2  capture. A tertiary amine POC (6FT&#8208;RCC3) demonstrated very high SO  2  capture (13.78 mmol g  &#8208;1  ; 16.4 SO  2  molecules per cage) combined with excellent reversibility for at least 50 adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. The adsorption behavior was investigated by FTIR spectroscopy,  13  C CP MAS NMR experiments and computational calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;Tenon Joint Inspired Mechanically Interlocked Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joints have been widely used for thousands of years in wooden architectures in virtue of their artistic and functional performance. However, imitation of similar structural and mechanical design philosophy to construct mechanically adaptive materials at the molecular level represents a challenging goal. Herein, we report a mortise&#8208;and&#8208;tenon joint inspired mechanically interlocked network (MIN), in which the [2]rotaxane crosslink not only mimics the joint in structure, but also reproduces its function in modifying mechanical properties of the MIN. Benefiting from the hierarchical energy dissipative ability along with the controllable intramolecular movement of the mechanically interlocked crosslink, the resultant MIN simultaneously exhibits notable mechanical adaptivity and structural stability in a single system, as manifested by decent stiffness, strength, toughness, and deformation recovery capacity. The present research provides a structurally mimetic strategy toward mechanically robust yet dynamic mechanically interlocked polymers, which will facilitate the progress and application of mechanically interlocked molecules in intelligent materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The formation and the chemical characterization of single atoms of dubnium (Db, element 105), in the form of its volatile oxychloride, was investigated using the on&#8208;line gas phase chromatography technique, in the temperature range 350&#8208;600 &#176;C. Under the exactly same chemical conditions, comparative studies with the lighter homologs of group&#8208;5 in the Periodic Table clearly indicate the volatility sequence being NbOCl3 &gt; TaOCl3 &#8805; DbOCl3. From the obtained experimental results, thermochemical data for DbOCl3 were derived. The present study delivers reliable experimental information for theoretical calculations on chemical properties of transactinides.</dc:description>

         <title>FRET&#8208;Integrated Polymer Brushes for Spatially&#8208;Resolved Sensing of Changes in Polymer Conformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymer brush surfaces that alter their physical properties in response to chemical stimuli have the capacity to be used as new surface&#8208;based sensing materials. For such surfaces, detecting the polymer conformation is key to their sensing capabilities. Herein, we report on FRET&#8208;integrated ultrathin (&lt; 70 nm) polymer brush surfaces that exhibit stimuli&#8208;dependent FRET with changing brush conformation. Poly(  N  &#8208;isopropylacrylamide) polymers were chosen due their exceptional sensitivity to liquid mixture compositions and their ability to be assembled into well&#8208;defined polymer brushes. The brush transitions were used to optically sense changes in liquid mixture compositions with high spatial resolution (10s of &#956;m), where the FRET&#8208;coupling allowed for non&#8208;invasive observation of brush transitions around complex interfaces with real&#8208;time sensing of the liquid environment. Our methods have the potential to be leveraged towards greater surface&#8208;based sensing capabilities at intricate interfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries with a Ruthenium&#8208;Complex&#8208;Based Mobile Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;CO  2  batteries are regarded as next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical devices, with great importance in the understanding of Li&#8208;air batteries and promising potential for application in the aviation industry. However, the greatest challenge arises from the formation of the discharge product, Li  2  CO  3  , which would accumulate and deactivate heterogenous catalysts to cause huge polarization. Herein, Ru(bpy)  3  Cl  2  was employed as a solution&#8208;phase catalyst for Li&#8208;CO  2  batteries and proved to be the most effective one screened so far. Spectroscopy and electrochemical analyses elucidate that the Ru(II) center could interact with both CO  2  and amorphous Li  2  C  2  O  4  intermediate, thus promoting electroreduction process and delaying carbonate transformation. As a result, the charge potential is reduced to 3.86 V and over 60 discharge/charge cycles are achieved with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g  &#8208;1  at a current density of 300 mA g  &#8208;1  . Our work provides a new avenue to improve the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;CO  2  batteries with efficient mobile catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;Cancer Meroterpenoids Dysideanone&#8197;B and Dysiherbol&#8197;A and Structural Reassignment of Dysiherbol&#8197;A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer natural products dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been completed and the structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised. A radical cyclization was employed to construct the 6/6/6/6 skeleton of dysideanone&#8197;B and a Heck reaction was utilized to forge the 6/6/5/6 core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of marine anti&#8208;cancer meroterpenoids dysideanone&#8197;B and dysiherbol&#8197;A have been accomplished in a divergent way. The synthetic route features: 1)&#8197;a site and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;position alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher ketone derivative with a bulky benzyl bromide to join the terpene and aromatic moieties together and set the stage for subsequent cyclization reactions; 2)&#8197;an intramolecular radical cyclization to construct the 6/6/6/6&#8208;tetracycle of dysideanone&#8197;B and an intramolecular Heck reaction to forge the 6/6/5/6&#8208;fused core structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A. A late&#8208;stage introduction of the ethoxy group in dysideanone&#8197;B reveals that this group might come from the solvent ethanol. The structure of dysiherbol&#8197;A has been revised based on our chemical total synthesis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Photon Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Responsiveness from the Molecular to the Supramolecular Level via Platination of Pentacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems have been constructed on the basis of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes, which display high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency from the molecular to the supramolecular level.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) responsiveness is important for various applications. Currently, single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems are rare compared to systems that display two&#8208;photon absorption and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation processes. Supramolecular stacking of photo&#8208;responsive chromophores results in decreased efficiency due to space&#8208;confinement effects. Herein we show that &#963;&#8208;platination of pentacenes is a feasible protocol to build single&#8208;photon NIR&#8208;responsive systems, with advantages including a low HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, high photochemical efficiency, and pathway specificity. The pentacene&#8208;to&#8208;endoperoxidation transformation is accompanied by color and absorbance changes. The high photo&#8208;oxygenation efficiency of &#963;&#8208;platinated pentacenes facilitates NIR responsiveness in one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers, resulting in the disappearance of supramolecular chirality signals and disruption of self&#8208;assembled nanofibers. Overall, the &#963;&#8208;platination strategy opens up new avenues toward NIR photo&#8208;responsive materials at the molecular and supramolecular levels.

         <title>Persistent peri&#8208;Heptacene: Synthesis and In Situ Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of the hitherto unknown peri&#8208;heptacene 7&#8208;PA is demonstrated by a rational molecular design strategy in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. The open&#8208;shell 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits a persistent stability (half&#8208;life &#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions.







Abstract
n&#8208;peri&#8208;Acenes (n&#8208;PAs) have gained interest as model systems of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons for potential applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics. However, the synthesis of n&#8208;PAs larger than peri&#8208;tetracene remains challenging because of their intrinsic open&#8208;shell character and high reactivity. Presented here is the synthesis of a hitherto unknown n&#8208;PA, that is, peri&#8208;heptacene (7&#8208;PA), in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected with eight 4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4 groups. The formation of 7&#8208;PA is validated by high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT&#8208;Raman spectroscopy. 7&#8208;PA displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits persistent stability (t1/2&#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions. Moreover, electron&#8208;spin resonance measurements and theoretical studies reveal that 7&#8208;PA exhibits an open&#8208;shell feature and a significant tetraradical character. This strategy could be considered a modular approach for the construction of next&#8208;generation (3&#8201;N+1)&#8208;PAs (where N&#8805;3).

Presented here is the synthesis of a hitherto unknown n-PA, that is, peri-heptacene (&lt;b&gt;7-PA&lt;/b&gt;), in which the reactive zigzag edges are kinetically protected with eight 4-tBu-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; groups. The formation of &lt;b&gt;7-PA&lt;/b&gt; is validated by high-resolution mass spectrometry and in situ FT-Raman spectroscopy. &lt;b&gt;7-PA&lt;/b&gt; displays a narrow optical energy gap of 1.01&#8197;eV and exhibits persistent stability (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8776;25&#8197;min) under inert conditions. Moreover, electron-spin resonance measurements and theoretical studies reveal that &lt;b&gt;7-PA&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an open-shell feature and a significant tetraradical character. This strategy could be considered a modular approach for the construction of next-generation (3&#8201;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;+1)-PAs (where &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8805;3).&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reversing the Chirality of Surface Ligands Can Improve the Biosafety and Pharmacokinetics of Cationic Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improved biosafety and in vivo transportation of cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) are achieved by tuning the chirality of surface ligands. D&#8208;GNCs effectively shield the high toxicity induced by cationic ligands. Post&#8208;exposure to mice, renal&#8208;/hepatic&#8208;clearable D&#8208;GNCs also show superior in vivo performances in aspects of biological circulation and tumor accumulation.







Abstract
Severe toxicity and rapid in vivo clearance of cationic nanomaterials seriously hinder their clinical translation. Present strategies to improve the biosafety and in vivo performance of cationic nanomaterials require neutralization of positive charge, which often compromises their efficacy. Herein, we report that substituting L&#8208;glutathione (L&#8208;GSH) on cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) with its D&#8208;counterpart can effectively improve the biosafety and pharmacokinetics. Compared with L&#8208;GNCs, D&#8208;GNCs do not exhibit cellular cytotoxicity, hemolysis, or acute damage to organs. Cationic D&#8208;GNCs show less cell internalization than L&#8208;GNCs, and do not induce cellular apoptosis. In vivo, the chirality of surface ligands distinctly affects the pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting abilities of D&#8208;/L&#8208;GNCs. D&#8208;GNCs show higher extended circulation time in blood plasma compared to similarly&#8208;sized and poly (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the choice of chirality of surface ligands can determine toxicities and pharmacokinetics of cationic nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Improved biosafety and in vivo transportation of cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) are achieved by tuning the chirality of surface ligands. D-GNCs effectively shield the high toxicity induced by cationic ligands. Post-exposure to mice, renal-/hepatic-clearable D-GNCs also show superior in vivo performances in aspects of biological circulation and tumor accumulation.

&lt;p&gt;Severe toxicity and rapid in vivo clearance of cationic nanomaterials seriously hinder their clinical translation. Present strategies to improve the biosafety and in vivo performance of cationic nanomaterials require neutralization of positive charge, which often compromises their efficacy. Herein, we report that substituting L-glutathione (L-GSH) on cationic gold nanoclusters (GNCs) with its D-counterpart can effectively improve the biosafety and pharmacokinetics. Compared with L-GNCs, D-GNCs do not exhibit cellular cytotoxicity, hemolysis, or acute damage to organs. Cationic D-GNCs show less cell internalization than L-GNCs, and do not induce cellular apoptosis. In vivo, the chirality of surface ligands distinctly affects the pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting abilities of D-/L-GNCs. D-GNCs show higher extended circulation time in blood plasma compared to similarly-sized and poly (ethylene glycol)-modified gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that the choice of chirality of surface ligands can determine toxicities and pharmacokinetics of cationic nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental understanding of the dependence between the structure and composition on the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR) would guide the rational design of highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts. A major impediment to the deep reduction CO  2  to multi&#8208;carbon products is the complexity of carbon&#8208;carbon bond coupling. The chemically well&#8208;defined catalysts with atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites are required for these C&#8208;C coupling involved processes. Here, we developed a catalyst (BIF&#8208;102NSs) that features Cl  &#8208;  bridged dimer copper (Cu  2  ) units, which delivers high catalytic activity and selectivity for C  2  H  4  . Mechanistic investigation verifies that neighboring Cu monomers not only perform as regulator for varying the reaction barrier, but also afford distinct reaction paths compared with isolated monomers, resulting in greatly improved electroreduction performance for CO  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Benchmark C2H2/CO2 Separation in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework via Copper(I)&#8208;Alkynyl Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of acetylene from carbon dioxide remains a daunting challenge because of their very similar molecular sizes and physical properties. We herein report the first example of using copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry within an ultramicroporous MOF (CuI@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(COOH)2) to achieve ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity. The anchored Cu(I) ions on the pore surfaces can specifically and strongly interact with C2H2 molecule through copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl &#960;&#8208;complexation and thus rapidly adsorb large amount of C2H2 at low&#8208;pressure region, while effectively reduce CO2 uptake due to the small pore sizes. This material thus exhibits the record high C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 185 at ambient conditions, significantly higher than the previous benchmark ZJU&#8208;74a (36.5) and ATC&#8208;Cu (53.6). Theoretical calculations reveal that the unique &#960;&#8208;complexation between Cu(I) and C2H2 mainly contributes to the ultrastrong C2H2 binding affinity and record selectivity. The exceptional separation performance was evidenced by breakthrough experiments for C2H2/CO2 gas mixtures. This work suggests a new perspective to functionalizing MOFs with copper(I)&#8208;alkynyl chemistry for highly selective separation of C2H2 over CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic State Manipulation of Surface Titanium Activates Dephosphorylation over TiO2 Near Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dephosphorylation that removes a phosphate group from substrates is an important reaction for not only living organisms but also environmental protection. Although CeO2 has been shown to catalyze this reaction, as one of the rare earth elements, cerium is low in natural abundance and has a narrow global distribution (&gt; 90% of these reserves are located within six countries). It is thus imperative to find another element/material with high worldwide abundance that can also efficiently extract the phosphate out of agricultural wastes for phosphorus recycle. Using para&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate (p&#8208;NPP) as the model compound, we demonstrate herein that TiO2 with F&#8208;modified (001) surface can activate p&#8208;NPP dephosphorylation at temperature as low as 40 &#176;C. By probe&#8208;assisted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), it was revealed that the strong electron withdrawing effect of fluorine makes Ti atoms (i.e., the active sites) on (001) surface very acidic. The bidentate adsorption of p&#8208;NPP on this surface further promotes its subsequent activation with barrier ~20 kJ/mol lower than that of pristine (001) and (101) surfaces, allowing the activation of this reaction at nearly room temperature (from &gt; 80 &#176;C).</dc:description>

These cations do not show interaction with B(C  6  F  5  )  4  &#713; and feature long Mg&#8208;Al(or Ga) distances or a short Zn&#8208;Ga bond. The complex with the [(  tBu  BDI)Zn&#8208;Al(  Me  BDI)  +  ] cation could not be obtained but should, according to DFT calculations, be stable. Combined AIM and charge calculations suggest that the metal&#8208;metal bonds to Zn are considerably more covalent whereas those to Mg should be described as weak Al  I  (or Ga  I  )&#8594;Mg  2+  donor bonds.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis and Structural Revision of Dysiherbol A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A 12&#8208;step total synthesis of the natural product dysiherbol A, a strongly anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;tumor avarane meroterpene isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea sp., was elaborated. As key steps, the synthesis features an enantioselective Cu&#8208;catalyzed 1,4&#8208;addition/enolate&#8208;trapping opening move, an Au&#8208;catalyzed double cyclization to build up the tetracyclic core&#8208;carbon skeleton, and a late installation of the C5&#8208;bridgehead methyl group via proton&#8208;induced cyclopropane opening associated with spontaneous cyclic ether formation. The obtained pentacyclic compound (corresponding to an anhydride of the originally suggested structure for dysiherbol A) showed identical spectroscopic data as the natural product, but an opposite molecular rotation. CD&#8208;spectroscopic measurements&#160;finally confirmed that both the constitution and the absolute configuration of the originally proposed structure of (+)&#8208;dysiherbol A need to be revised.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative Amidation of Light Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds in light alkanes, particularly to form C&#8208;N bonds, remains a challenge. We report the dehydrogenative coupling of amides with these C1&#8208;C4 hydrocarbons to form the  N  &#8208;alkyl amide products with  t  BuOO  t  Bu as the oxidant, and a copper catalyst ligated by a phenanthroline&#8208;type ligand. The reactions occurred in good yields in benzene or supercritical carbon dioxide as solvents. This strategy allowed for the determination of the relative reactivity of these alkane C&#8208;H bonds toward this amination process and showed, in contrast to prior work with larger alkanes, that the reactivity correlated with bond dissociation energies.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanosynthesis of Higher&#8208;Order Cocrystals: Tuning Order, Functionality and Size in Cocrystal Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to rationally design and predictably construct crystalline solids has been the hallmark of crystal engineering research. To date, numerous examples of multicomponent crystals comprising organic molecules have been reported. However, the crystal engineering of cocrystals comprising both organic and inorganic chemical units is still poorly understood and mostly unexplored. Here, we report a new diverse set of higher&#8208;order cocrystals (HOCs) based on the structurally versatile &#8211; yet largely unexplored &#8211; phosph(V/V)azane heterosynthon building block. The novel ternary and quaternary cocrystals reported are held together by synergistic and orthogonal intermolecular interactions. Notably, the HOCs can be readily obtained either via sequential or one&#8208;pot mechanochemical methods. Computational modelling methods reveal that the HOCs are thermodynamically driven to form and that their mechanical properties strongly depend on the composition and intermolecular forces in the crystal, offering untapped potential for optimizing material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Implications of Quenching&#8208;to&#8208;Dequenching Switch in Quantitative Cell Uptake and Biodistribution of Dye&#8208;Labeled Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ubiquitous quenching&#8208;to&#8208;dequenching switch of dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo is presented. When dye&#8208;labeled nanoparticles interact with biological systems (cell culture medium, cells, and organs to animals), the dye undergoes the switch, causing a significant increase of fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
A general strategy to carry out cell uptake and biodistribution studies is to label nanoparticles (NPs) with a fluorescent dye. However, the comparative study of different dye&#8208;loaded NPs remains difficult owing to uncontrolled dye quenching and de&#8208;quenching. Here we compared two types of dye&#8208;labeled NPs and demonstrated their distinct properties. NPs with dye molecules at a solid state suffer from dye quenching, so the dye release and/or NP degradation in biological environments leads to a several&#8208;fold increase of fluorescence intensity despite the same amount of NPs, owing to the state switch from quenching to de&#8208;quenching. In contrast, NPs with dye molecules at a soluble state exhibit no quenching effect. To standardize the comparative study, we propose two possible solutions: using lower dye loading or using medium analysis for quantifying cell uptake of NPs. This work provides valuable insights into selecting valid quantification methods for bio&#8208;nano studies.

         <title>Efficient Nitrogen Fixation to Ammonia through Integration of Plasma Oxidation with Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step process, serially integrating non&#8208;thermal plasma technique for facile N2 to NOx&#8722; and electrocatalytic reduction for highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3, is presented. A surface boron&#8208;rich nickel boride electrocatalyst was developed to boost the activity, selectivity, and stability for nitrate reduction to NH3 with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and low overpotential.







Abstract
Present one&#8208;step N2 fixation is impeded by tough activation of the N&#8801;N bond and low selectivity to NH3. Here we report fixation of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 can be decoupled to a two&#8208;step process with one problem effectively solved in each step, including: 1)&#8197;facile activation of N2 to NOx&#8722; by a non&#8208;thermal plasma technique, and 2)&#8197;highly selective conversion of NOx&#8722; to NH3 by electrocatalytic reduction. Importantly, this process uses air and water as low&#8208;cost raw materials for scalable ammonia production under ambient conditions. For NOx&#8722; reduction to NH3, we present a surface boron&#8208;rich core&#8211;shell nickel boride electrocatalyst. The surface boron&#8208;rich feature is the key to boosting activity, selectivity, and stability via enhanced NOx&#8722; adsorption, and suppression of hydrogen evolution and surface Ni oxidation. A significant ammonia production of 198.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 was achieved, together with nearly 100&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented for nickel&#8208; catalyzed asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides react to produce oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Notably, synthesis of a range of bioactive pyrroloindolines was achieved.







Abstract
Reductive carboxylation of organo (pseudo)halides with CO2 is a powerful method to provide carboxylic acids quickly. Notably, the catalytic reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons via CO2 fixation is a highly challenging but desirable approach for structurally diverse carboxylic acids. There are only a few reports and no examples of alkenes via transition metal catalysis. We report the first asymmetric reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 via nickel catalysis. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides, such as aryl bromides, aryl triflates and inert aryl chlorides of particular note, undergo the reaction smoothly to give important oxindole&#8208;3&#8208;acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. This transformation features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, facile scalability, good to excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.

     alt="Nickel-Catalyzed Asymmetric Reductive Carbo-Carboxylation of Alkenes with CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy is presented for nickel- catalyzed asymmetric reductive carbo-carboxylation of alkenes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides react to produce oxindole-3-acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3-quaternary stereocenter. Notably, synthesis of a range of bioactive pyrroloindolines was achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductive carboxylation of organo (pseudo)halides with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a powerful method to provide carboxylic acids quickly. Notably, the catalytic reductive carbo-carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation is a highly challenging but desirable approach for structurally diverse carboxylic acids. There are only a few reports and no examples of alkenes via transition metal catalysis. We report the first asymmetric reductive carbo-carboxylation of alkenes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via nickel catalysis. A variety of aryl (pseudo)halides, such as aryl bromides, aryl triflates and inert aryl chlorides of particular note, undergo the reaction smoothly to give important oxindole-3-acetic acid derivatives bearing a C3-quaternary stereocenter. This transformation features mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope, facile scalability, good to excellent chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivities. The method highlights the formal synthesis of (&#8722;)-Esermethole, (&#8722;)-Physostigmine and (&#8722;)-Physovenine, and the total synthesis of (&#8722;)-Debromoflustramide&#8197;B, (&#8722;)-Debromoflustramine&#8197;B and (+)-Coixspirolactam&#8197;A; thereby, opening an avenue for the total synthesis of chiral natural products with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Healable and Rearrangeable Networks of Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Diselenide Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) materials, hierarchically structured soft actuators could meet some requirements for &#8220;human&#8208;friendly&#8221; working mode and execute complex tasks with intelligent adaptation to environmental changes. However, few researchers have    paid much attention to  the preparation methods of multicomponent/hierarchical LCE actuators. In this communication, we demonstrate the successful integration of an exchangeable diselenide chain extender for the preparation of dynamic LCEs, which could be reprogrammed on heating or under visible light illumination. Moreover, the rearrangeable polydiselenide networks could be applied to develop the self&#8208;welding technology toward fabricating hierarchically structured LCE actuators with sophisticated deformability without using any auxiliary reagent (adhesive, tape, catalysts or initiator) during the assembling process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids from amphoteric &#945;&#8208;boryl aldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our ongoing search for underdeveloped functional group combinations has brought to light &#946;&#8208;fluorinated aminoalkylboronic acids, a new class of molecules featuring the B&#8211;CF linkage. These compounds can now be generated from secondary amines and &#945;&#8208;boryl aldehydes through electrophilic fluorination of boryl enamines or enamides. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids show no signs of degradation under ambient conditions. We present evidence for the involvement of chair&#8208;like motifs, favored over the acyclic forms by up to 1.7 &#177; 0.1 kcal mol  &#8208;1  in water and held together by an amine&#8208;boronate hydrogen bond. Fluorinated &#946;&#8208;aminoalkylboronic acids are stable over a wide pH range and are characterized by a p  K  a  of 3.4, which is the lowest of any alkylboronic acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses of Cyclic Anhydrides via Ligand&#8208;Enabled C&#8722;H Carbonylation of Simple Aliphatic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of C(sp  3  )&#8722;H functionalizations of free carboxylic acids has provided a wide range of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;Y (Y = heteroatom) bond&#8208;forming reactions that both complement and expand upon what can be achieved through conventional methods. Additionally, C&#8722;H functionalizations have lent themselves to the one&#8208;step preparation of a number of valuable, synthetic motifs, that are often difficult to prepare through conventional methods. Herein, we report a &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8722;H carbonylation of free carboxylic acids using Mo(CO)  6  as a convenient solid CO source and enabled by a bidentate ligand, leading to convenient syntheses of cyclic anhydrides. Among these, the succinic anhydride products are versatile stepping stones for the mono&#8208;selective introduction of alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkynyl, boryl, silyl, fluoro, iodo, and thiophenyl groups at the &#946; position of the parent acids by decarboxylative functionalizations, thus providing a divergent strategy to synthesize a myriad of carboxylic acids inaccessible by previous &#946;&#8208;C&#8722;H activation reactions. The enantioselective carbonylation of free cyclopropanecarboxylic acids has also been achieved using a chiral bidentate thioether ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>A Bubble&#8208;Assisted Approach for Patterning Nanoscale Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a new approach to pattern functional organic molecules with a template of foams, and achieve a resolution of sub 100 nm. The bubble&#8208;assisted assembly (BAA) process is consisted of two periods, including bubble evolution and molecular assembly, which are dominated by the Laplace pressure and molecular interactions, respectively. Using TPPS (meso&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin), we systematically investigate the patterns and assembly behaviour in the bubble system with a series of characterizations, which show good uniformity in nanoscale resolution. Theoretical simulations reveal that TPPS&#8217;s J&#8208;aggregates contribute to the ordered construction of molecular patterns. Finally, we propose an empirical rule for molecular patterning approach, that the surfactant and functional molecules should have the same type of charge in a two&#8208;component system. This approach exhibits promising feasibility to assemble molecular patterns at nanoscale resolution for micro/nano functional devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Aziridine formation by a Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dependent oxygenase and 2&#8208;aminoisobutyrate biosynthesis in fungi</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aziridine is a characteristically reactive molecule with increased bioactivity due to its strained ring structure. Here, we investigated the biosynthesis of 2&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) in&#160;  Penicillium  , and successfully reconstituted the three&#8208;step biosynthesis from L&#8208;Val to AIB  &#160;in vitro  . This previously unknown aziridine formation pathway proceeded with the non&#8208;heme iron and&#160; a &#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent (Fe(II)/ &#945; KG) oxygenase TqaL, followed by aziridine ring opening by the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (HAD)&#8208;type hydrolase TqaF, and subsequent oxidative decarboxylation by the NovR/CloR&#8208;like non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase TqaM. Furthermore, the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the C&#8208;N bond forming Fe(II)/ &#945; KG oxygenase TqaL was solved at 2.0 &#197; resolution. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis, thereby expanding the catalytic repertoire of the Fe(II)/ &#945; KG oxygenases. We also report the unique aziridine ring opening by a HAD&#8208;type hydrolase and the remarkable oxidative decarboxylation by a non&#8208;heme iron oxygenase to produce AIB.</dc:description>

This previously unknown aziridine formation pathway proceeded with the non-heme iron and&#160; a -ketoglutarate-dependent (Fe(II)/ &#945; KG) oxygenase TqaL, followed by aziridine ring opening by the haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase (HAD)-type hydrolase TqaF, and subsequent oxidative decarboxylation by the NovR/CloR-like non-heme iron oxygenase TqaM. Furthermore, the X-ray crystal structure of the C-N bond forming Fe(II)/ &#945; KG oxygenase TqaL was solved at 2.0 &#197; resolution. This work presents the first molecular basis for aziridine biogenesis, thereby expanding the catalytic repertoire of the Fe(II)/ &#945; KG oxygenases. We also report the unique aziridine ring opening by a HAD-type hydrolase and the remarkable oxidative decarboxylation by a non-heme iron oxygenase to produce AIB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Converted In2O3 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships in nanostructured catalysts is of fundamental importance. The size modulation of catalyst particles represents a useful dimension to tune catalytic performances by impacting not only their surface areas but also local electronic structures. It, however, has remained inadequately explored and poorly elucidated. Here, we report the interesting size&#8208;dependent selectivity of electrochemical CO  2  reduction on In  2  O  3  nanocrystals. 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles and 15&#8208;nm nanocubes with focused size distribution are prepared via a facile solvothermal reaction in oleylamine by carefully controlling a set of experimental parameters. They serve as the precatalysts, and are reduced to In nanocrystals while largely inherit the original size feature during electrochemical CO  2  reduction. Catalyst derived from 15&#8208;nm nanocubes exhibits greater formate selectivity (&gt;95%) at lower overpotential and negligible side reactions compared to bulk&#8208;like samples (indium foil and 200&#8208;nm cubes) as well as the catalyst derived from smaller 5&#8208;nm nanoparticles. This unique size dependence is rationalized as a result of the competition among different reaction pathways by our theoretical computations. Smaller is not always better in the catalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Uncovering the Role of Bicarbonate in Calcium Carbonate Formation at Near&#8208;Neutral pH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic pathways relevant to mineralization are not well&#8208;understood fundamentally, let alone in the context of their biological and geological environments. Through quantitative analysis of ion association at near&#8208;neutral pH, we identify the involvement of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions in CaCO  3  nucleation. Incorporation of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions into the structure of amorphous intermediates is corroborated by solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, complemented by quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We identify the roles of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions as being through (i) competition for ion association during the formation of ion pairs and ion clusters prior to nucleation and (ii) incorporation as a significant structural component of amorphous mineral particles. The role of HCO  3  &#8208;  ions as active soluble species and structural constituents in CaCO  3  formation are of fundamental importance and provide a basis for a better understanding of physiological and geological mineralization.</dc:description>
