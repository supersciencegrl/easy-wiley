         <title>Photonic Modulation Enabled by Controlling the Edge Structures of Boron&#8208;Doped Molecular Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Control over topological edges of molecular carbons (MCs) is of importance for achieving diverse molecular topologies and desirable physical properties. However, it remains very challenging for heteroatom&#8208;doped MCs due to the synthetic difficulty. Herein, we report control over the edge structures of boron&#8208;doped MCs (BMCs) via the sequential cyclization strategy. Three BMC molecules that feature the C56B2 or C84B2 polycyclic &#960;&#8208;skeletons with selective cove/fjord or cove/bay edges, respectively, were synthesized through the rational combination of Mallory photoreaction and Scholl reaction. We not only obtain the largest boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system reported so far, but also disclose that fine control of their edges and length greatly affects electronic structures and thereby photonic properties of BMCs, such as tunable aromaticity, decreased band gaps, as well as redshifted absorptions and fluorescence. Remarkably, the C56B2 molecule exhibits stimulated emission behavior and amplified spontaneous emission property, both of which have never been reported for pristine boron&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems, thus demonstrating the potential of BMCs as optical gain materials for laser cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomically&#8208;Dispersed FeN2P2 Motif with High Activity and Stability for Oxygen Reduction Reaction Over Entire pH Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The past decade has witnessed the great potential of Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysis in catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, it remains a grand challenge to substantially improve their intrinsic activity and long&#8208;term stability in acidic electrolytes. Herein, we report a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy, by which high&#8208;density Fe atoms (3.97 wt%) are coordinated with square&#8208;planar para&#8208;positioned nitrogen and phosphorus atoms in a hierarchical carbon framework. The as&#8208;crafted Fe&#8208;SA/PNC manifest an outstanding activity towards ORR over the entire pH range. Specifically, the half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92 V, 0.83 V, and 0.86 V vs. RHE are attained in alkaline, neutral, and acidic electrolytes, respectively, representing the high performance among reported catalysts to date. Furthermore, after 30,000 durability cycles, the Fe&#8208;SA/PNC remains to be stable with no visible performance decay when tested in 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, and only a minor negative shift of 40 mV detected in 0.1 M HClO4, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C counterpart. The coordination motif of Fe&#8208;SA/PNC is validated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides atomic&#8208;level insight into improving the activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal ORR catalysts, opening up an avenue to craft the desired single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Desulfurative Transformations with Thioethers as Alkyl Radical Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thioethers are highly prevalent functional groups in organic compounds of natural and synthetic origin but remain remarkably underexplored as starting materials in desulfurative transformations. As such, new synthetic methods are highly desirable to unlock the potential of the compound class and electrochemistry is an ideal tool to enable new reactivity and selectivity under mild conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient use of aryl alkyl thioethers as alkyl radical precursors in electroreductive transformations, along with mechanistic details. The transformations proceed with complete selectivity for C(sp3)&#8208;S bond cleavage, orthogonal to that of established transition metal&#8208;catalyzed two&#8208;electron routes. We showcase a hydrodesulfurization protocol with broad functional group tolerance, the first example of desulfurative C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bond formation in Giese&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling and the first protocol for electrocarboxylation of synthetic relevance with thioethers as starting materials. Finally, the compound class is shown to outcompete their well&#8208;established sulfone analogues as alkyl radical precursors, demonstrating their synthetic potential for future desulfurative transformations in a one&#8208;electron manifold.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular control of the oxidative addition as a way to improve the catalytic efficiency of pincer&#8208;rhodium (I) complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1H NMR studies using a cationic complex with a pyridine&#8208;di&#8208;imidazolylidene pincer ligand of formula [Rh(CNC)(CO)]+ revealed that this compound showed high binding affinity with coronene in CH2Cl2. The interaction between coronene and the planar Rh(I) complex is established by means of p&#8208;stacking interactions. This interaction has a strong impact on the electrondonating strength of the pincer CNC ligand, which is increased significantly, as demonstrated by the shifting of the n(CO) stretching bands to lower frequencies. The addition of coronene increases the reaction rate of the nucleophilic attack of methyl iodide on the rhodium (I) pincer complex, and also has a positive effect on the performance of the complex as catalyst in the cycloisomerization of 4&#8208;pentynoic acid. These findings highlight the importance of supramolecular interactions for tuning the reactivity and catalytic activity of square planar metal complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards a Precise NMR Quantification of Acute Phase Inflammation Proteins from Human Serum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of human serum and plasma show, besides metabolites and lipoproteins, two characteristic signals termed GlycA and B arising from the acetyl groups of glycoprotein glycans from acute phase proteins, which constitute good markers for inflammatory processes. Here, we report a comprehensive assignment of glycoprotein glycan NMR signals observed in human serum, showing that GlycA and GlycB signals originate from Neu5Ac and GlcNAc moieties from N&#8208;glycans, respectively. Diffusion&#8208;edited NMR experiments demonstrate that signal components can be associated with specific acute phase proteins. Conventionally determined concentrations of acute phase glycoproteins correlate well with distinct features in NMR spectra (R2 up to 0.9422, p&#8208;value &lt;0.001), allowing the simultaneous quantification of several acute phase inflammation proteins. Overall, a proteo&#8208;metabolomics NMR signature of significant diagnostic potential is obtained within 10 &#8211; 20 min acquisition time. This is exemplified in serum samples from COVID&#8208;19 and cardiogenic shock patients showing significant changes in several acute phase proteins compared to healthy controls.</dc:description>

         <title>Translating Planar Heterocycles into Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogs by Photoinduced Hydrocarboxylation
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new strategy that translates indoles and related heterocycles into diverse 3D analogs by dearomative hydrocarboxylation. The transformation is highly chemoselective, broad in scope, operationally simple, and readily amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE).







Abstract
The rapid preparation of complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) heterocyclic scaffolds is a key challenge in modern medicinal chemistry. Despite the increased probability of clinical success for small molecule therapeutic candidates with increased 3D complexity, new drug targets remain dominated by flat molecules due to the abundance of coupling reactions available for their construction. In principle, heteroarene hydrofunctionalization reactions offer an opportunity to transform readily accessible planar molecules into more three&#8208;dimensionally complex analogs through the introduction of a single molecular vector. Unfortunately, dearomative hydrofunctionalization reactions remain limited. Herein, we report a new strategy to enable the dearomative hydrocarboxylation of indoles and related heterocycles. This reaction represents a rare example of a heteroarene hydrofunctionalization that meets the numerous requirements for broad implementation in drug discovery. The transformation is highly chemoselective, broad in scope, operationally simple, and readily amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE). Accordingly, this process will allow existing libraries of heteroaromatic compounds to be translated into diverse 3D analogs and enable exploration of new classes of medicinally relevant molecules.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Molecular Engineering of Triazole&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Polymeric Photocatalysts with Strong Electron Push&#8208;Pull Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor polymer photocatalysts bearing alkyl chains were synthesized to explore the effect of side&#8208;chain engineering on charge separation and migration kinetics. High activity was reached in photocatalytic reduction reactions with promoted exciton dissociation, suppressed charge recombination, facilitated charge transfer, and favorable hydrophilicity. Key: donor (D), acceptor (A), pyrene (green), triazole (yellow), methyl (red).







Abstract
A new series of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A)&#8208;type semiconductive polymers were generated by the integration of electron&#8208;deficient alkyl chain anchored triazole (TA) moieties and electron&#8208;rich pyrene units into the polymer skeleton. The polymer series demonstrated satisfactory light&#8208;harvesting ability and suitable band gaps. In the series, polymer P&#8208;TAME benefits from a minimized exciton binding energy, strongest D&#8208;A interaction, and favorable hydrophilicity, affording an outstanding photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of ca. 100&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (10&#8197;mg polymer, AQY420&#8201;nm=8.9&#8201;%) and H2O2 production rate of ca. 190&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (20&#8197;mg polymer) under visible&#8208;light irradiation, which is superior to most currently reported polymers. All polymers in the series can mediate water oxidation reactions to evolve O2. Thus, these TA&#8208;based polymers open up a new avenue toward tailor&#8208;made efficient photocatalysts with broad photocatalytic activities.

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by 8&#8208;Connected Quadrangular Prism Ligands for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of rigid, highly connected organic linkers is critical for the reticular synthesis of functional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, highly&#8208;stable MOFs (e.g. Al/Cr/Zr&#8208;based MOFs) based on rigid ligands with more than 6 coordinating functions have been rarely achieved thus far. Herein, we describe the construction of two&#160;bcu Zr&#8208;based MOFs (named ZrMOF&#8208;1 and ZrMOF&#8208;2) from peripherally extended pentiptycene ligands (H8PEP&#8208;1 and H8PEP&#8208;2) with rigid quadrangular prism shape possessing 8 carboxylic groups at the prism vertices. Particularly, ZrMOF&#8208;1 exhibits microporous structure with large Bruno&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller surface area and high water stability, endowing it a promising water harvesting material with a high water uptake capacity of 0.83 gH2O gMOF&#8208;1 at P/P0 = 0.90 and 25 &#176;C, a steep uptake at a low P/P0 of 0.30, and excellent durability over 500 water adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Moreover, self&#8208;consistent charge density functional tight&#8208;binding calculations were carried out, rationalizing the water adsorbing process and amount in ZrMOF&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a (1&#8208;propylpyridinium)2[ReN(CN)4]&#8208;type organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid exhibiting water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced drastic structural changes of the [ReN(CN)4]2&#8722; assemblies. Specifically, upon exposure to water vapor, dehydrated nitrido&#8208;bridged chains were converted to hydrated cyanido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear clusters via rearrangements of large molecular building units in the crystals. These switchable assembly forms display substantially different photo&#8208;physical properties, although in both cases the emission is caused by a metal&#8208;centered d&#8211;d transition. The nitrido&#8208;bridged chain exhibited a near&#8208;infrared (749 nm) emission, which blue&#8208;shifted as the temperature increased, while a visible (561 nm) emission and its red shift was demonstrated by the cyanido&#8208;bridged cluster.</dc:description>

         <title>Observation of Confinement&#8208;Free Neutral Group Three Transition Metal Carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectroscopic characterization of neutral highly&#8208;coordinated compounds is essential in fundamental and applied research, but has been proven to be a challenging experimental target because of the difficulty in mass selection. Here, we report the preparation and size&#8208;specific infrared&#8208;vacuum ultraviolet (IR&#8208;VUV) spectroscopic identification of group&#8208;3 transition metal carbonyls Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La) in the gas phase, which are the first confinement&#8208;free neutral heptacarbonyl and octacarbonyl complexes. The results indicate that Sc(CO)7 has a C2v structure and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La) have a D4h structure. Theoretical calculations predict that the formation of Sc(CO)7 and TM(CO)8 (TM = Y, La) is both thermodynamically exothermic and kinetically facile in the gas phase. These highly&#8208;coordinated carbonyls are 17&#8208;electron complexes when only those valence electrons that occupy metal&#8211;CO bonding orbitals are considered, in which the ligand&#8208;only 4b1u molecular orbital is ignored. This work opens new avenues toward the design and chemical control of a large variety of compounds with unique structures and properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Universal Sub&#8208;Nanoreactor Strategy for Synthesis of Yolk&#8208;Shell MoS2 Supported Single Atom Electrocatalysts toward Robust Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination structure determines the electrocatalytic performances of single atom catalysts (SACs), while it remains a challenge to precisely regulate their spatial location and coordination environment. Herein, we report a universal sub&#8208;nanoreactor strategy for synthesis of yolk&#8211;shell MoS2 supported single atom electrocatalysts with dual&#8211;anchored microenvironment of vacancy&#8208;enriched MoS2 and intercalation carbon toward robust hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the &#8220;E&#8208;Lock&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8208;Channel&#8221; are conducive to stabilize and activate metal single atoms. A group of SACs is subsequently produced with the assistance of sulfur vacancy and intercalation carbon in the yolk&#8211;shell sub&#8208;nanoreactor. The optimized C&#8208;Co&#8208;MoS2 yields the lowest overpotential (&#951;10=17 mV) compared with previously reported MoS2&#8208;based electrocatalysts to date, and also affords a 5&#8210;9 fold improvement in activity even comparing with those as&#8208;prepared single&#8211;anchored analogues. Theoretical results and in&#8208;situ characterizations unveil its active center and durability. This work provides a universal pathway to design efficient catalysts for electro&#8208;refinery.</dc:description>

         <title>Multicomponent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed from metal ions or clusters and organic linkers. Typical MOFs are rather simple, comprising just one type of joint and linker. An additional degree of structural complexity can be introduced by using multiple different components that are assembled into the same framework In the early days of MOF chemistry, conventional wisdom held that attempting to prepare frameworks starting from such a broad set of components would lead to multiple different phases. However, this view was mistaken and the focus of this review is the deliberate design and synthesis of frameworks comprising multiple different components. When coupled to structural order and periodicity, the presence of multiple components leads to exceptional functional properties that can be understood at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Anodic and cathodic platinum dissolution processes involve different oxide species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The degradation of Pt&#8208;containing oxygen reduction catalysts for fuel cell applications is strongly linked to the electrochemical surface oxidation and reduction of Pt. Here, we study the surface restructuring and Pt dissolution mechanisms during oxidation/reduction for the case of Pt(100) in 0.1 M HClO4&#160;by combined operando&#160;high&#8208;energy surface X&#8208;ray diffraction, online mass spectrometry, and density functional theory study. Our atomic&#8208;scale structural studies reveal that anodic dissolution, detected during oxidation, and cathodic dissolution, observed during the subsequent reduction, are linked to two different oxide phases. Anodic dissolution occurs predominantly during nucleation and growth of the first, stripe&#8208;like oxide. Cathodic dissolution is linked to a second, amorphous Pt oxide phase that resembles bulk PtO2&#160;and starts to grow when the coverage of the stripe&#8208;like oxide saturates. In addition, we find the amount of surface restructuring after an oxidation/reduction cycle to be potential&#8208;independent after the stripe&#8208;like oxide has reached its saturation coverage.</dc:description>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Anchored Covalent Organic Frameworks@Amino&#8208;Modified Ti3C2Tx MXene on Nylon 6 Film for High&#8208;Performance Deformable Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing deformable supercapacitors (D&#8208;SCs) that has robust skeleton, smoothly active channels and architected interface for charges kinetic migration and faradic storage are highly crucial for flexible wearable systems. Here, we develop the high&#8208;performance D&#8208;SCs made of the covalent organic frameworks(COF)@amino&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx deposited on decorated nylon 6 (DPA) film (COF@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/DPA) via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabrication. The hierarchical COF@N&#8208;Ti3C2Tx/DPA exhibits admirable specific capacitance, rate performance and cycling stability (20000 cycles) in three&#8208;electrode system due to the porous networks, rich active sites, superior H+ storage property and large interfacial charge transfer clarified by first principles calculations based on density functional theory. Moreover, the solid&#8208;state D&#8208;SCs present high deformable stabilities, with regard to 80.7, 80.6 and 83.4% capacitance retention after 5000 bending cycles, 2000 stretching cycles and 5000 folding cycles, separately.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Activation of Nitromethane to Construct Isoxazoline Aldoximes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activating the nitromethane to endow new reactivity is an intersesting and meaningful but challenging topic. Herein, we report an electrochemical activation of nitromethane to serve as both heterocyclic skeleton and oxime sources for the construction of isoxazoline aldoximes. The isoxazoline aldoximes that prepared by four steps with reported strategy are synthesized in a single step from low&#8208;cost and readily available nitromethane and olefins with moderate to excellent yields under our electrochemical conditions. The reaction also takes advantages of high atom&#8208;economy and E&#8208;selectivity. Moreover, the mechanism is studied by control experiments, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) study, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanistic results reveal that nitromethane may be activated under electrochemical conditions to deliver 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole 2&#8208;oxide intermediate, which undergoes [3 + 2] cycloaddition with olefins to yield isoxazoline aldoximes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>C(sp3)&#8211;H oxyfunctionalization, the insertion of O&#8208;atom into C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds, streamlines the synthesis of complex molecules from easily accessible precursors and represents one of the most challenging tasks in organic chemistry, in regard to site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity. Biocatalytic C(sp3)&#8211;H oxyfunctionalization has the potential to overcome limitations inherent to small&#8208;molecule&#8208;mediated approaches by delivering catalyst&#8208;controlled selectivity. Through enzyme repurposing and activity profiling of natural variants, we report here a subfamily of &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent iron dioxygenase that catalyzes site&#8208; and stereo&#8208;divergent oxyfunctionalization of secondary and tertiary C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds, providing concise synthetic routes toward four types of 92 &#945;&#8208;and &#946;&#8208;hydroxy acids with high efficiency and selectivity.

         <title>An Efficient Direct Arylation Polycondensation via C&#8208;S Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) has become one of the most important methods to construct conjugated polymers (CPs). However, the homocoupling side&#8208;reactions of aryl halides and the low regioseletive reactivities of unfunctionalized aryls hinder the development of DArP. Here, an efficient Pd and Cu co&#8208;catalyzed DArP was developed via inert C&#8208;S bond cleavage of aryl thioethers, of which robustness was exemplified by over twenty conjugated polymers (CPs), including copolymers, homopolymers, and random polymers. The capture of oxidative addition intermediate together with experimental and theoretic results suggested the important role of palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) co&#8208;catalysis with a bicyclic mechanism. The studies of NMR, molecular weights, trap densities, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and the charge transport mobilities revealed that the homocoupling reactions were significantly suppressed with high regioselectivity of unfunctionalized aryls, suggesting this method is an excellent choice for synthesizing high performance CPs.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into Anion&#8208;Solvent Interactions to Boost Stable Operation of the Ether&#8208;Based Electrolytes in Pure&#8208;SiOx||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 Full Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ether solvents with superior reductive stability promise excellent interphasial stability with high&#8208;capacity anodes while the limited oxidative resistance hinders their high&#8208;voltage operation. Extending the intrinsic electrochemical stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes to construct stable&#8208;cycling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is challenging but rewarding. Herein, the anion&#8208;solvent interactions were concerned as the key point to optimize the anodic stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes and an optimized interphase was realized on both pure&#8208;SiOx anodes and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ether solvents with superior reductive stability promise excellent interphasial stability with high-capacity anodes while the limited oxidative resistance hinders their high-voltage operation. Extending the intrinsic electrochemical stability of ether-based electrolytes to construct stable-cycling high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries is challenging but rewarding. Herein, the anion-solvent interactions were concerned as the key point to optimize the anodic stability of ether-based electrolytes and an optimized interphase was realized on both pure-SiOx anodes and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes. Specifically, the small-anion-size LiNO3 and tetrahydrofuran with high dipole moment to dielectric constant ratio realized strengthened anion-solvent interactions, which enhanced the oxidative stability of the electrolyte. The designed ether-based electrolyte enabled a stable cycling performance over 500 cycles (capacity retention of 81.7%) in pure-SiOx||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell, demonstrating its superior practical prospects. This work provides new insight into the design of advanced electrolytes for emerging high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries through the regulation of interactions between species in the electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transition Metal Catalysis in Living Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Novel Supramolecular Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The importance of transition metal catalysis is exemplified by its wide range of applications, for example in the synthesis of chemicals, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. However, one relatively new application is for carrying out new&#8208;to&#8208;nature reactions inside living cells. The complex environment of a living cell is not welcoming to transition metal catalysts, as a diverse range of biological components have the potential to inhibit or deactivate the catalyst. Here we review the current progress in the field of transition metal catalysis, and evaluation of catalysis efficiency in living cells and under biological (relevant) conditions. Catalyst poisoning is a ubiquitous problem in this field, and we propose that future research into the development of physical and kinetic protection strategies may provide a route to improve the reactivity of catalysts in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Catalytic RNA Deprotection and Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with mespores (2 to 50 nm) allows the inclusion of large biomolecules, such as nucleic acids. However, chemical reaction on the nucleic acids, to further regulate their bioactivity, is yet to be demonstrated within MOF pores. Here, we report the deprotection of carbonate protected RNA molecules (21 to 102 nt) to resume their original activity using MOF as catalyst. Two MOFs, MOF&#8208;626 and MOF&#8208;636 are designed and synthesized, with mesopores of 2.2 and 2.8 nm, respectively, carrying isolated metal sites (Ni, Co, Cu, Pd, Rh and Ru). The pores favor the entrance of RNA, while the metal sites catalyze C&#8208;O bond cleavage at the carbonate group. Complete conversion of RNA is achieved by Pd&#8208;MOF&#8208;626, 90 times more efficient than Pd(NO3)2. MOF crystals are also removable from the aqueous reaction media, leaving negligible metal footprint, 3.9 ppb, only 1/55 of that using homogeneous Pd catalysts. These features make MOF potentially suited for bioorthogonal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Diazulenorubicene as a Non&#8208;benzenoid Isomer of peri&#8208;Tetracene with Two Sets of 5/7/5 Membered Rings Showing Good Semiconducting Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have received a lot of attention because of their unique optical, electronic, and magnetic properties, but their synthesis remains challenging. Herein, we report a non&#8208;benzenoid isomer of peri&#8208;tetracene, diazulenorubicene (DAR), with two sets of 5/7/5 membered rings synthesized via a (3+2) annulation reaction. Compared with the precursor containing only 5/7 membered rings, the newly formed five membered rings switch the aromaticity of the original heptagon/pentagon from antiaromatic/aromatic to non&#8208;aromatic/antiaromatic respectively, modify the intermolecular packing modes and lower the LUMO levels. Notably, compound 2b (DAR&#8208;TMS) shows p&#8208;type semiconducting property with hole mobility up to 1.27 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. Moreover, further extension to larger non&#8208;benzenoid PAHs with 19 rings was achieved through on surface chemistry from the DAR derivative with one alkynyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>Designs of Tandem Catalysts and Cascade Catalytic Systems for CO2 Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Upgrading CO2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) compounds through the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a practical approach to mitigate atmospheric CO2 while simultaneously producing high value chemicals. The reaction pathways for C2+ production involve multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) and C&#8208;C coupling processes. By increasing the surface coverage of adsorbed protons (*Had) and *CO intermediates, the reaction kinetics of PCET and C&#8208;C coupling can be accelerated, thereby promoting C2+ production. However, *Had and *CO are competitively adsorbed intermediates on monocomponent catalysts, making it difficult to break the linear scaling relationship between the adsorption energies of the *Had/*CO intermediate. Recently, tandem catalysts consisting of multicomponents have been developed to improve the surface coverage of *Had or *CO by enhancing water dissociation or CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO production on auxiliary sites. In this context, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design principles of tandem catalysts based on reaction pathways for C2+ products. Moreover, the development of cascade CO2RR catalytic systems that integrate CO2RR with downstream catalysis has expanded the range of potential CO2 upgrading products. Therefore, we also discuss recent advancements in cascade CO2RR catalytic systems, highlighting the challenges and perspectives in these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Donor Coordinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To enhance photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance, additional electron donor/acceptor is generally required to inhibit the electron&#8208;hole recombination. However, the enhancement is limited due to the long&#8208;distance diffusion. Herein a self&#8208;supplying electron strategy is designed for PEC enhancement by coordinating an electron donor 1.4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dabco) in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The intrareticular photoelectron transfer mechanism in mixed&#8208;ligand MOF (m&#8208;MOF) is experimentally revealed and verified by density functional theory calculations. The presence of Dabco efficiently inhibits the electron&#8208;hole recombination due to the self&#8208;supplying electrons and longer electron lifetime in the framework, and thus leads to 23.2&#8208;fold enhancement of photocurrent. As proof of concept, a simple PEC method is constructed with the designed m&#8208;MOF to demonstrate its application in sensitive bioanalysis. This work provides a new avenue for improving the PEC performance of nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their high efficiency and low cost. However, their long&#8208;term stability, mechanical durability, and environmental risks are still unable to meet practical needs. To overcome these issues, we designed a multifunctional elastomer PPG&#8208;mUPy&#8208;APDS with abundant hydrogen and carbonyl bonds. The chemical bonding between polymer and perovskite could increase the growth activation energy of perovskite film and promote the preferential growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Owing to the low defect density and gradient energy&#8208;level alignment, the corresponding device exhibited a champion efficiency of 23.10 %. Furthermore, due to the formation of the hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network in the perovskite film, the target devices demonstrated excellent air stability and enhanced flexibility for the flexible PSCs. More importantly, the polymer network could coordinate with Pb2+ ions, immobilizing lead atoms to reduce their release into the environment. This strategy paves the way for the industrialization of high&#8208;performance flexible PSCs.

         <title>Synthetic Peptide Antibodies as TNF&#8208;&#945; Inhibitors: Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels Neutralize the Inflammatory Activity of TNF&#8208;&#945; in THP&#8208;1 Derived Macrophages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tumor Necrosis Factor&#8208;&#945;&#160;(TNF&#8208;&#945;) is a cytokine that is normally produced by immune cells when fighting an infection. But, when too much TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;is produced as in autoimmune diseases, this leads to unwanted and persistent inflammation. Anti&#8208;TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized the therapy of these disorders by blocking TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;and preventing its binding to TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;receptors, thus suppressing the inflammation. Herein, we propose an alternative in the form of molecularly imprinted polymer nanogels (MIP&#8208;NGs). MIP&#8208;NGs are synthetic antibodies obtained by nanomoulding the 3&#8208;dimensional shape and chemical functionalities of a desired target in a synthetic polymer. Using an in&#8208;house developed&#160;in silico&#160;rational approach, epitope peptides of TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;were generated and &#8216;synthetic peptide antibodies&#8217; prepared. The resultant MIP&#8208;NGs bind the template peptide and recombinant TNF&#8208;a&#160;with high affinity and selectivity, and can block the binding of TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;to its receptor. Consequently they were applied to neutralize pro&#8208;inflammatory TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;in the supernatant of human THP&#8208;1 macrophages, leading to a downregulation of the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. Our results indicate that MIP&#8208;NGs, which are thermally and biochemically more stable, easier to manufacture, and cost&#8208;effective than antibodies, are very promising as next generation TNF&#8208;&#945;&#160;inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated cascade nanozymes with antisenescence activities for atherosclerosis therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Senescent cells are the critical drivers of atherosclerosis formation and maturation. Mitigating senescent cells holds promise for the treatment of atherosclerosis. In an atherosclerotic plaque microenvironment, senescent cells interact with reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting the disease development. Here, we hypothesize that a cascade nanozyme with antisenescence and antioxidant activities can serve as an effective therapeutic for atherosclerosis. An integrated cascade nanozyme with superoxide dismutase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, named MSe1, is developed in this work. The obtained cascade nanozyme can attenuate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) senescence by protecting DNA from damage. It significantly weakens inflammation in macrophages and HUVECs by eliminating overproduced intracellular ROS. Additionally, the MSe1 nanozyme effectively inhibits foam cell formation in macrophages and HUVECs by decreasing the internalization of oxidized low&#8208;density lipoprotein. After intravenous administration, the MSe1 nanozyme significantly inhibits the formation of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (ApoE&#8208;/&#8208;) mice by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation and then decreases the infiltration of inflammatory cells and senescent cells in atherosclerotic plaques. This study not only provides a cascade nanozyme but also suggests that the combination of antisenescence and antioxidative stress holds considerable promise for treating atherosclerosis.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress on Electrode Design for Efficient Electrochemical Valorisation of CO2, O2, and N2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrode design is key in progressing electrochemical gas reduction reactions for sustainable production of high&#8208;value chemicals. This review examines the present challenges in electrode design, proposes the concept of a desirable electrode that mitigates the challenges, and provides practical solutions to construct such an electrode based on recent research.







Abstract
CO2 reduction, two&#8208;electron O2 reduction, and N2 reduction are sustainable technologies to valorise common molecules. Their further development requires working electrode design to promote the multistep electrochemical processes from gas reactants to value&#8208;added products at the device level. This review proposes critical features of a desirable electrode based on the fundamental electrochemical processes and the development of scalable devices. A detailed discussion is made to approach such a desirable electrode, addressing the recent progress on critical electrode components, assembly strategies, and reaction interface engineering. Further, we highlight the electrode design tailored to reaction properties (e.g., its thermodynamics and kinetics) for performance optimisation. Finally, the opportunities and remaining challenges are presented, providing a framework for rational electrode design to push these gas reduction reactions towards an improved technology readiness level (TRL).

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Cyclopropanes with Internal Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules represents a longstanding challenge in organic chemistry. Herein, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction between readily available gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopropanes (gem&#8208;DFCPs) and internal olefins has been developed, enabling the efficient synthesis of gem&#8208;difluorinated cyclopentanes with good functional group compatibility, excellent regioselectivity and good diastereoselectivity. The resulting gem&#8208;difluorinated products can undergo downstream transformations to access various mono&#8208;fluorinated cyclopentenes and cyclopentanes. This reaction demonstrates the use of gem&#8208;DFCPs as a type of &#8220;CF2&#8221; C3 synthon for cycloaddition under transition metal catalysis, which provides potential strategy for synthesizing other gem&#8208;difluorinated carbocyclic molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrolysis of Biaryl Oxazepines for the Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryl Amino Phenol Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of catalytic asymmetric reaction with water as the reactant is challenging due to the reactivity&#8208; and stereoselectivity&#8208;control issues resulted from the low nucleophilicity and the small size of water. We disclose herein a chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed atroposelective ring&#8208;opening reaction of biaryl oxazepines with water. A series of biaryl oxazepines undergo the CPA catalyzed asymmetric hydrolysis in a highly enantioselective manner. The key for the success of this reaction is the use of a new SPINOL&#8208;derived CPA catalyst and the high reactivity of biaryl oxazepine substrates towards water under acidic conditions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the reaction proceeds via a dynamic kinetic resolution pathway and the CPA catalyzed addition of water to the imine group is both enantio&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining.</dc:description>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Templated Chiral Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8201;for Enantioselective Chemoresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a facile synthesis of chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), from achiral precursors grown on chiral nematic cellulose&#8208;derived nanostructured bio&#8208;templates. The chiral structure demonstrates enantioselective recognition and chiral sensing abilities with a low limit of detection of 39&#8197;&#956;M for representative chiral amino acid, D&#8208; and L&#8208; alanine.







Abstract
Chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained rising attention as ordered nanoporous materials for enantiomer separations, chiral catalysis, and sensing. Among those, chiral MOFs are generally obtained through complex synthetic routes by using a limited choice of reactive chiral organic precursors as the primary linkers or auxiliary ligands. Here, we report a template&#8208;controlled synthesis of chiral MOFs from achiral precursors grown on chiral nematic cellulose&#8208;derived nanostructured bio&#8208;templates.

The uniaxially compressed dimensions of the unit cell of templated ZIF and crystalline dimensions are signatures of this structure.

&lt;p&gt;We report a facile synthesis of chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), from achiral precursors grown on chiral nematic cellulose-derived nanostructured bio-templates. The chiral structure demonstrates enantioselective recognition and chiral sensing abilities with a low limit of detection of 39&#8197;&#956;M for representative chiral amino acid, D- and L- alanine.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained rising attention as ordered nanoporous materials for enantiomer separations, chiral catalysis, and sensing. Among those, chiral MOFs are generally obtained through complex synthetic routes by using a limited choice of reactive chiral organic precursors as the primary linkers or auxiliary ligands. Here, we report a template-controlled synthesis of chiral MOFs from achiral precursors grown on chiral nematic cellulose-derived nanostructured bio-templates. We demonstrate that chiral MOFs, specifically, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), &lt;b&gt;unc&lt;/b&gt;-[Zn(2-MeIm)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2-MeIm=2-methylimidazole], can be grown from regular precursors within nanoporous organized chiral nematic nanocelluloses &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; directed assembly on twisted bundles of cellulose nanocrystals. The template-grown chiral ZIF possesses tetragonal crystal structure with chiral space group of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, which is different from traditional cubic crystal structure of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;-43&#8197;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; for freely grown conventional ZIF-8. The uniaxially compressed dimensions of the unit cell of templated ZIF and crystalline dimensions are signatures of this structure. We observe that the templated chiral ZIF can facilitate the enantiotropic sensing. It shows enantioselective recognition and chiral sensing abilities with a low limit of detection of 39&#8197;&#956;M and the corresponding limit of chiral detection of 300&#8197;&#956;M for representative chiral amino acid, D- and L- alanine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Sodium Thioborate Fast Ion Conductor: Na3B5S9</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na3B5S9 is the first sodium thioborate fast ion conductor, exhibiting high total ionic conductivity of 0.80&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (sintered pellet). The corner&#8208;sharing B10S20 supertetrahedral clusters create 3D diffusion channels housing Na&#8208;ions that are well&#8208;distributed over five crystallographic sites. Solid state NMR and AIMD simulations further demonstrate fast Na&#8208;ion diffusion within the channels.







Abstract
We report a new sodium fast&#8208;ion conductor, Na3B5S9, that exhibits a high Na ion total conductivity of 0.80&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (sintered pellet; cold&#8208;pressed pellet=0.21&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The structure consists of corner&#8208;sharing B10S20 supertetrahedral clusters, which create a framework that supports 3D Na ion diffusion channels. The Na ions are well&#8208;distributed in the channels and form a disordered sublattice spanning five Na crystallographic sites. The combination of structural elucidation via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and powder synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at variable temperatures, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal high Na&#8208;ion mobility (predicted conductivity: 0.96&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and the nature of the 3D diffusion pathways. Notably, the Na ion sublattice orders at low temperatures, resulting in isolated Na polyhedra and thus much lower ionic conductivity. This highlights the importance of a disordered Na ion sublattice&#8212;and existence of well&#8208;connected Na ion migration pathways formed via face&#8208;sharing polyhedra&#8212;in dictating Na ion diffusion.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Promoted Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Access to Functionalized Azetidines from Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current work presents a new strategy for tandem N1,C3&#8208;functionalization and formal [3+2] cycloaddition of azabicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane (ABB) promoted by an aza(oxy)allyl cation. This cationic activation paradigm proves highly versatile and effective, and is expected to create new impetus for preparing functionalized azetidines from ABBs.







Abstract
Access to 1,3&#8208;functionalized azetidines through a diversity&#8208;oriented approach is highly sought&#8208;after for finding new applications in drug&#8208;discovery. To this goal, strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven functionalization of azabicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane (ABB) has generated significant interest. Through appropriate N&#8208;activation, C3&#8208;substituted ABBs are shown to render tandem N/C3&#8208;fucntionalization/rearrangement, furnishing azetidines; although, modalities of such N&#8208;activation vis&#8208;&#224;&#8208;vis N&#8208;functionalization remain limited to selected electrophiles. This work showcases a versatile cation&#8208;driven activation strategy of ABBs. And capitalizes on the use of Csp3 precursors amenable to forming reactive (aza)oxyallyl cations in situ. Herein, N&#8208;activation leads to formation of a congested C&#8722;N bond, and effective C3 activation. The concept was extended to formal [3+2] annulations involving (aza)oxyallyl cations and ABBs, leading to bridged bicyclic azetidines. Besides the fundamental appeal of this new activation paradigm, operational simplicity and remarkable diversity should engender its prompt use in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations we show that the CeO2(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. This effect is induced by the first water layer that is in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2(100) surface, and it is manifested by a measurable water contact angle and a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water.







Abstract
The nature of the hydrophobicity found in rare&#8208;earth oxides is intriguing. The CeO2 (100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. In order to understand this puzzling and counter&#8208;intuitive effect we performed a detailed analysis of the water structure and dynamics. We report here an ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation (AIMD) study which demonstrates that the first water layer, in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2 surface, is responsible for the effect behaving as a hydrophobic interface with respect to the rest of the liquid water. The hydrophobicity is manifested in several ways: a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water at the same thermodynamic condition, a weak adhesion energy and few H&#8208;bonds above the hydrophobic water layer, which may also sustain a water droplet. These findings introduce a new concept in water/rare&#8208;earth oxide interfaces: hydrophobicity mediated by specific water patterns on a hydrophilic surface.

         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical approaches are widely used for the efficient, solvent&#8208;free synthesis of organic molecules, however their applicability to the synthesis of functional polymers has remained underexplored. In their Research Article (e202305783), Carsten Bolm, Andrij Pich, and co&#8208;workers developed a free&#8208;radical polymerization approach to mechanochemically synthesize structurally and morphologically well&#8208;defined complex functional macromolecular architectures, stimuli&#8208;responsive microgels, in the conditions of solvent&#8208; and initiator&#8208;free.

An insoluble alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline framework (Alkynyl&#8208;CPF) is designed, the electronic structure of which can be tuned through the high degree of electron conjugation along alkynyl units and aromatic rings. The Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries demonstrates large reversible capacities and long cycle life.







Abstract
The poor conductivity of the pristine bulk covalent organic material is the main challenge for its application in energy storage. The mechanism of symmetric alkynyl bonds (C&#8801;C) in covalent organic materials for lithium storage is still rarely reported. Herein, a nanosized (&#8776;80&#8197;nm) alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline framework (Alkynyl&#8208;CPF) is synthesized for the first time to improve the intrinsic charge conductivity and the insolubility of the covalent organic material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Because of the high degree of electron conjugation along alkynyl units and N atoms from phenanthroline groups, the Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrodes with the lowest HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap (&#916;E=2.629&#8197;eV) show improved intrinsic conductivity by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, the pristine Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode delivers superior cycling performance with a large reversible capacity and outstanding rate properties (1068.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 410.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 700&#8197;cycles at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1). Moreover, by Raman, FT&#8208;IR, XPS, EIS, and theoretical simulations, the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of C&#8801;C units and phenanthroline groups in the Alkynyl&#8208;CPF electrode has been investigated. This work provides new strategies and insights for the design and mechanism investigation of covalent organic materials in electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Coronaviruses Use ACE2 Monomers as Entry&#8208;Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coronavirus (round particles) carrying trimeric spike proteins (green) infects a host cell that expresses monomeric ACE2 receptors (magenta). The low density of ACE2 receptors on the cell membrane demonstrates that on average only one spike protein per virus particle can bind to an ACE2 receptor simultaneously, which provides SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2 a high infectivity. After binding, the membranes fuse and viral components are released into the cell, as reported by Gerti Beliu, Markus Sauer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202300821).

         <title>Rotaxane Synthesis by an End&#8208;Capping Strategy via Swelling Axle&#8208;Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enlargement of the size of the terminal phenol group of the axle component by aromatic bromination was found effective for rotaxane synthesis. The 19 examples given, including the formation of a [3]rotaxane, illustrate the broad scope of the approach as well as the possible degradative release of the axle component by dethreading of the thermally stable brominated rotaxanes under the basic conditions.







Abstract
A method for rotaxane synthesis by enlargement of the size of the terminal phenol group of the axle component by aromatic bromination has been developed. This method may be regarded as an end&#8208;capping strategy involving the swelling of the phenol group at the axle terminal. The advantages of the present strategy include: ready availability of axle components with a variety of swelling precursors, wide product scope (19 examples given including a [3]rotaxane), mild conditions for the swelling process, rich potential for the derivatization of the brominated rotaxanes, and possible release of the axle component by degradative dethreading of the thermally stable brominated rotaxanes under the basic conditions.

         <title>Managing Multiple Halide&#8208;Related Defects for Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple iodine&#8208;related defects in CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were inhibited by the synergistic effects of halogen, coordination, and hydrogen bonds of 2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (2,6&#8208;DAPy). This offers an excellent power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 21.8&#8201;% for the 2,6&#8208;DAPy&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSCs, alongside significantly enhanced humidity stabilities of unencapsulated cells.







Abstract
Halide&#8208;related surface defects on inorganic halide perovskite not only induce charge recombination but also severely limit the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells. Herein, adopting density functional theory calculation, we verify that iodine interstitials (Ii) has a low formation energy similar to that of the iodine vacancy (VI) and is also readily formed on the surface of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite, and it is regarded to function as an electron trap. We screen a specific 2,6&#8208;diaminopyridine (2,6&#8208;DAPy) passivator, which, with the aid of the combined effects from halogen&#8208;Npyridine and coordination bonds, not only successfully eliminates the Ii and dissociative I2 but also passivates the abundant VI. Furthermore, the two symmetric neighboring &#8208;NH2 groups interact with adjacent halides of the octahedral cluster by forming hydrogen bonds, which further promotes the adsorption of 2,6&#8208;DAPy molecules onto the perovskite surface. Such synergetic effects can significantly passivate harmful iodine&#8208;related defects and undercoordinated Pb2+, prolong carrier lifetimes and facilitate the interfacial hole transfer. Consequently, these merits enhance the power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) from 19.6&#8201;% to 21.8&#8201;%, the highest value for this type of solar cells, just as importantly, the 2,6&#8208;DAPy&#8208;treated CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx films show better environmental stability.

         <title>&#946;&#8208;Arylation of Racemic Secondary Benzylic Alcohols to Access Enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;Arylated Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a single Pd catalyst, the first example of &#946;&#8208;arylation of secondary alcohols with aryl bromides has been developed via borrowing hydrogen catalysis enabled by an MPV type hydrogen transfer process. In addition, the enantioconvergent version of the reaction has also been realized under the catalysis of Pd and Ru, allowing for the transformation of racemic secondary alcohols into enantioenriched chiral alcohols with good enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The transformation of alcohols into value&#8208;added products is of great importance, as simple alcohols are widespread and can be easily derived from both fossil fuels and biomass. The selective functionalization of a sp3 C&#8722;H bond on the alkyl side chain of an alcohol over its hydroxyl group would offer an expedient route to expand the chemical space of alcohols but it remains a challenging task. Harnessing the borrowing hydrogen strategy, the &#946;&#8208;arylation of secondary alcohols with aryl bromides has been achieved in this study, which allows for the selective functionalization of a &#946;&#8208;Csp3&#8722;H bond in an alcohol substrate. Under the catalysis of a Pd complex, secondary alcohols reacted with aryl bromides to afford 1,2&#8208;diaryl alcohols with broad substrate scope in the presence of a ketone additive. Furthermore, the enantioconvergent version of the reaction has also been realized, transforming racemic secondary alcohols into enantioenriched chiral 1,2&#8208;diaryl alcohols under the cooperative Pd and Ru catalysis.

     alt="&#946;-Arylation of Racemic Secondary Benzylic Alcohols to Access Enantioenriched &#946;-Arylated Alcohols"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a single Pd catalyst, the first example of &#946;-arylation of secondary alcohols with aryl bromides has been developed via borrowing hydrogen catalysis enabled by an MPV type hydrogen transfer process. In addition, the enantioconvergent version of the reaction has also been realized under the catalysis of Pd and Ru, allowing for the transformation of racemic secondary alcohols into enantioenriched chiral alcohols with good enantioselectivities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformation of alcohols into value-added products is of great importance, as simple alcohols are widespread and can be easily derived from both fossil fuels and biomass. The selective functionalization of a sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; C&#8722;H bond on the alkyl side chain of an alcohol over its hydroxyl group would offer an expedient route to expand the chemical space of alcohols but it remains a challenging task. Harnessing the borrowing hydrogen strategy, the &#946;-arylation of secondary alcohols with aryl bromides has been achieved in this study, which allows for the selective functionalization of a &#946;-Csp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;H bond in an alcohol substrate. Under the catalysis of a Pd complex, secondary alcohols reacted with aryl bromides to afford 1,2-diaryl alcohols with broad substrate scope in the presence of a ketone additive. Furthermore, the enantioconvergent version of the reaction has also been realized, transforming racemic secondary alcohols into enantioenriched chiral 1,2-diaryl alcohols under the cooperative Pd and Ru catalysis. Mechanism studies indicate that the reactions are enabled by borrowing hydrogen catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Organodiselenide Comediator to Facilitate Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Encapsulating Lithium Polysulfide Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox comediation strategy is proposed for promoting the cathode redox kinetics and simultaneously retaining the anode protection capability of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries using encapsulating lithium polysulfide electrolyte. A 1.5&#8197;Ah lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell realizes a high initial energy density of 359&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 37 stable cycles following the above strategy.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are regarded as promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, the cycling stability of Li&#8211;S batteries is restricted by the parasitic reactions between Li metal anodes and soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Encapsulating LiPS electrolyte (EPSE) can efficiently suppress the parasitic reactions but inevitably sacrifices the cathode sulfur redox kinetics. To address the above dilemma, a redox comediation strategy for EPSE is proposed to realize high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries. Concretely, dimethyl diselenide (DMDSe) is employed as an efficient redox comediator to facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics in Li&#8211;S batteries with EPSE. DMDSe enhances the liquid&#8211;liquid and liquid&#8211;solid conversion kinetics of LiPS in EPSE while maintains the ability to alleviate the anode parasitic reactions from LiPSs. Consequently, a Li&#8211;S pouch cell with a high energy density of 359&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at cell level and stable 37&#8197;cycles is realized. This work provides an effective redox comediation strategy for EPSE to simultaneously achieve high energy density and long cycling stability in Li&#8211;S batteries and inspires rational integration of multi&#8208;strategies for practical working batteries.

Microbial electrosynthesis is a sustainable strategy for electricity&#8208;driven chemical production. In their Communication (e202305189), Guillermo&#8197;C. Bazan et&#8197;al. designed an n&#8208;type redox&#8208;active conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) that intercalates into cell membranes and mimics the function of endogenous transmembrane electron transport proteins. The incorporation of the COE into electroactive bacteria amplifies current uptake from the electrode, leading to enhanced microbial electrosynthesis.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method based on in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry has been developed to capture the nascent intermediates&#160;during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8208;ZnO. The results shed light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8226;CH3, as described by Chengyuan Liu, Yang Pan et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202304352).

A thiol&#8211;aldehyde polycondensation was developed for the polymerization of phenolic compounds. In their Research Article (e202305677), Shichao Xu, Liang Yuan et&#8197;al. found several catalysts for making linear and network&#8208;structured phenolic polymers from plant&#8208;derived monomers. Since the repeating units are connected via dynamic dithioacetal groups, the cross&#8208;linked networks can be reprocessed and oxidatively degraded by DMSO to recover the monomers for reuse.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Bipolar Polyimide Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Cathodes for Durable Aluminium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of integrating n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type active sites into one framework to form redox&#8208;bipolar polyimide two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks. The synthesized 2D polymers are demonstrated as attractive cathode materials for Al batteries by enabling both anion and cation storage.







Abstract
Emerging rechargeable aluminium batteries (RABs) offer a sustainable option for next&#8208;generation energy storage technologies with low cost and exemplary safety. However, the development of RABs is restricted by the limited availability of high&#8208;performance cathode materials. Herein, we report two polyimide two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) cathodes with redox&#8208;bipolar capability in RAB. The optimal 2D&#8208;COF electrode achieves a high specific capacity of 132&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Notably, the electrode presents long&#8208;term cycling stability (with a negligible &#8776;0.0007&#8201;% capacity decay per cycle), outperforming early reported organic RAB cathodes. 2D&#8208;COFs integrate n&#8208;type imide and p&#8208;type triazine active centres into the periodic porous polymer skeleton. With multiple characterizations, we elucidate the unique Faradaic reaction of the 2D&#8208;COF electrode, which involves AlCl2+ and AlCl4&#8722; dual&#8208;ions as charge carriers. This work paves the avenue toward novel organic cathodes in RABs.

         <title>Mesoporous PtPb Nanosheets as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution and Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly mesoporous PtPb nanosheets have been successfully synthesized. Due to their abundant active sites and large electrochemical specific surface area, these nanosheets exhibit excellent catalytic performance in both electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction and selective ethanol oxidation.







Abstract
Using a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method with ethylenediamine, we have synthesized mesoporous PtPb nanosheets that exhibit exceptional activity in both hydrogen evolution and ethanol oxidation. The resulting PtPb nanosheets have a Pt&#8208;enriched structure with up to 80&#8201;% atomic content of Pt. The synthetic method generated a significant mesoporous structure, formed through the dissolution of Pb species. These advanced structures enable the mesoporous PtPb nanosheets to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an extreme low overpotential of 21&#8197;mV for hydrogen evolution under alkaline conditions. Furthermore, the mesoporous PtPb nanosheets exhibit superior catalytic activity and stability for ethanol oxidation. The highest catalytic current density of PtPb nanosheets is 5.66&#8197;times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This research opens up new possibilities in designing mesoporous, two&#8208;dimensional noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based materials for electrochemical energy conversion with excellent performance.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Nylon&#8208;6 Precursor at Almost 100&#8201;% Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards efficient electrocatalysis of C&#8722;N coupling reactions, the accumulation of critical intermediates, i.e., N&#8208;contained intermediate and C&#8208;contained intermediate, must be facilitated. Taking the direct electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime as an example, Fe can serve as an ideal electrode because it can accumulate adsorbed hydroxylamine and cyclohexanone, which is supported by DFT calculations and in situ characterizations.







Abstract
Synthesis of cyclohexanone oxime via the cyclohexanone&#8208;hydroxylamine process is widespread in the caprolactam industry, which is an upstream industry for nylon&#8208;6 production. However, there are two shortcomings in this process, harsh reaction conditions and the potential danger posed by explosive hydroxylamine. In this study, we presented a direct electrosynthesis of cyclohexanone oxime using nitrogen oxides and cyclohexanone, which eliminated the usage of hydroxylamine and demonstrated a green production of caprolactam. With the Fe electrocatalysts, a production rate of 55.9&#8197;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 can be achieved in a flow cell with almost 100&#8201;% yield of cyclohexanone oxime. The high efficiency was attributed to their ability of accumulating adsorbed hydroxylamine and cyclohexanone. This study provides a theoretical basis for electrocatalyst design for C&#8722;N coupling reactions and illuminates the tantalizing possibility to upgrade the caprolactam industry towards safety and sustainability.

         <title>Lewis Acid Catalyzed Formal (3+2)&#8208;Cycloaddition of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes with Ketenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, efficient and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for the preparation of valuable bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes by Lewis acid catalyzed formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of readily available bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes and ketenes is presented. Excellent tolerance towards functional groups and versatile substitution patterns in the 3&#8208;position of the bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane core are demonstrated.







Abstract
Design, synthesis and application of benzene bioisosteres have attracted a lot of attention in the past 20&#8197;years. Recently, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes have emerged as highly attractive bioisosteres for ortho&#8208; and meta&#8208;substituted benzenes. Herein we report a mild, scalable and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of highly substituted bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones through Lewis acid catalyzed (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of bicyclo[1.1.0]&#8208;butane ketones with disubstituted ketenes. The reaction shows high functional group tolerance as documented by the successful preparation of various 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;aryl as well as 3,3&#8208;bisalkyl bicyclo[2.1.1]hexan&#8208;2&#8208;ones (26&#8197;examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield). Postfunctionalization of the exocyclic ketone moiety is also demonstrated.

         <title>Coupled Solar Battery with 6.9&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coupled solar battery with a photo&#8208;intercoupled electron&#8208;ion transfer (PIEIT) mechanism enabled high efficiency and large scale solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage, demonstrating the great potential for practical application.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage in solar batteries is an important solar utilization technology comparable to solar&#8208;to&#8208;electricity (solar cells) and solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel (photocatalytic cells) conversion. Unlike the indirect approach of integrated solar flow batteries combining photoelectrodes with redox&#8208;electrodes, coupled solar batteries enable direct solar energy storage, but are hampered by low efficiency due to rapid charge recombination of materials and misaligned energy levels between electrodes. Herein, we propose a design for a coupled solar battery that intercouples two photo&#8208;coupled ion transfer (PCIT) reactions through electron&#8208;ion transfer upon co&#8208;photo&#8208;pumping of photoelectrochemical storage cathode and anode. We used a representative covalent organic framework (COF) to achieve efficient charge separation and directional charge transfer between two band&#8208;matched photoelectrochemical storage electrodes, with a photovoltage sufficient for COF dual&#8208;redox reactions. By pumping these electrodes, the coupled solar battery stores solar energy via two synergistic PCIT reactions of electron&#8208;proton&#8208;relayed COF oxidation and reduction, and the stored solar energy is released as electrochemical energy during COF regeneration in discharge while interlocking the loops. A breakthrough in efficiency (6.9&#8201;%) was achieved, adaptive to a large&#8208;area (56&#8197;cm2) tandem device. The presented photo&#8208;intercoupled electron&#8208;ion transfer (PIEIT) mechanism provides expandable paths toward practical solar&#8208;to&#8208;electrochemical energy storage.

         <dc:description>
O&#8208;fucosylated glycan epitopes of membrane&#8208;bound mucin glycoproteins are key ligands of many bacterial lectins. In their Research Article (e202302437), Ulrika Westerlind and co&#8208;workers describe the synthesis of fucosylated mucin glycopeptides using a chemoenzymatic approach. Starting from simple building blocks, Fmoc&#8208;protected glycosylated amino acids were prepared and incorporated into peptides and enzymatically diversified. Bacteria lectin interactions were then elucidated on glycopeptide microarrays.

         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of converting NOx substances into amino acids is realized by electrochemistry over self&#8208;standing carbon fiber membranes with CoFe alloy. Grams of product has been achieved in lab, which offers great significance to the development of energy and environmental sustainability with highly efficient utilization of hydrogen energy.







Abstract
The conversion of industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;value products is significantly meaningful for global environment and human health.

&lt;p&gt;The conversion of industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high-value products is significantly meaningful for global environment and human health.

         <title>Superprotonic Conductivity of MOFs Confining Zwitterionic Sulfamic Acid as Proton Source and Conducting Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superprotonic conductivity, utilizing MOFs embedded with a moderately acidic guest&#8212;zwitterionic sulfamic acid (HSA)&#8212;was demonstrated by Myoung Soo Lah et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202302376). HSA not only acted as a proton source, but also as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. The MOFs, which had been filled with high quantities of HSA using a sustained concentration gradient method, exhibited impressive superprotonic conductivity, in the order of 10&#8722;1 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, they maintained their stability for a period of 7 days.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valent CoH&#8208;catalyzed facial&#8208;selective cyclopropene hydroalkylation has been reported. The reaction works in the absence of any additional directing groups.







Abstract
Cyclopropene hydrofunctionalization has been a promising strategy for accessing multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes; however, cyclopropene hydroalkylation remains underdeveloped. Herein, we report a low&#8208;valent CoH&#8208;catalyzed facial&#8208;selective cyclopropene hydroalkylation to access multi&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes. This reaction exhibits a broad substrate scope of alkyl halides and cyclopropenes and tolerates many functional groups. Moderate&#8208;to&#8208;good facial&#8208;selectivity is obtained without any directing groups. Mechanism studies provide evidence that alkyl radicals are generated from alkyl halides and irreversible CoH insertion is responsible for the facial&#8208;selectivity. Our preliminary exploration demonstrates that asymmetric cyclopropene hydroalkylation can be realized without conspicuous auxiliary groups.

         <title>Correlating Photophysical Properties with Stereochemical Expression of 6s2 Lone Pairs in Two&#8208;dimensional Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work unveils structural dynamics and their impacts on photophysical properties of 2D lead iodide perovskites with different spacer cations. Minimizing stereochemical expression of 6s2 lone pair and dynamic octahedral tilting is essential to realize photoluminescence with narrow line shape and high quantum yield via reducing exciton&#8208;phonon coupling.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have shown great promises for light&#8208;emitting applications and excitonic devices. Fulfilling these promises demands an in&#8208;depth understanding on the relationships between the structural dynamics and exciton&#8208;phonon interactions that govern the optical properties. Here, we unveil the structural dynamics of 2D lead iodide perovskites with different spacer cations. Loose packing of an undersized spacer cation leads to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane octahedral tilting, whereas compact packing of an oversized spacer cation stretches Pb&#8722;I bond length, resulting in Pb2+ off&#8208;center displacement driven by stereochemical expression of the Pb2+ 6s2 lone pair electrons. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Pb2+ cation is off&#8208;center displaced mainly along the direction where the octahedra are stretched the most by the spacer cation. We find dynamic structural distortions associated with either octahedral tilting or Pb2+ off&#8208;centering lead to a broad Raman central peak background and phonon softening, which increase the non&#8208;radiative recombination loss via exciton&#8208;phonon interactions and quench the photoluminescence intensity. The correlations between the structural, phonon, and optical properties are further confirmed by the pressure tuning of the 2D LHPs. Our results demonstrate that minimizing the dynamic structural distortions via a judicious selection of the spacer cations is essential to realize high luminescence properties in 2D LHPs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Immolative Amphiphilic Poly(ferrocenes) for Synergistic Amplification of Oxidative Stress in Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;immolative amphiphilic poly(ferrocenes) are fabricated with self&#8208;immolative backbone, aminoferrocene (AFc) side chains, and end&#8208;capping poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether. Upon acidic milieu&#8208;triggered head&#8208;to&#8208;tail degradation, rational GSH depletion and reactive oxygen species burst is observed to amplify the oxidative stress for efficient tumor inhibition. This work provides a promising drug&#8208;free polymer strategy for precision medicine.







Abstract
Amphiphilic self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) can achieve complete degradation solely through one triggerable event, which potentially optimize the blood clearance and uncontrollable/inert degradability for therapeutic nanoparticles. Herein, we report self&#8208;immolative amphiphilic poly(ferrocenes), BPnbs&#8208;Fc, composed by self&#8208;immolative backbone and aminoferrocene (AFc) side chains as well as end&#8208;capping poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether. Upon triggering by tumor acidic milieu, the BPnbs&#8208;Fc nanoparticles readily degrade to release azaquinone methide (AQM) moieties, which can rapidly deplete intracellular glutathione (GSH) to cascade release AFc. Furthermore, both AFc and its product Fe2+ can catalyze intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), thus amplifying the oxidative stress of tumor cells. Rational synergy of GSH depletion and &#8901;OH burst can efficiently inhibit tumor growth by the SIPs in vitro and in vivo. This work provides an elegant design to adopt innate tumor milieu&#8208;triggerable SIPs degradation to boost cellular oxidative stress, which is a promising candidate for precision medicine.

Photogenerated electrons could rapidly (2&#8197;ps) transfer from the ZnO &#8220;core&#8221; to the single&#8208;atom Co catalysts &#8220;shell&#8221;, boosting the catalytic performance for heterogeneous photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction.







Abstract
In photosynthesis, solar energy is harvested by photosensitizers, and then, the excited electrons transfer via a Z&#8208;Scheme mode to enzymatic catalytic centers to trigger redox reactions. Herein, we constructed a core&#8211;shell Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction of semiconductor@single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). The oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich ZnO core and single&#8208;atom Co&#8722;N4 sites supported on nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon shell (SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN) act as the photosensitizer and the enzyme&#8208;mimicking active centers, respectively. Driven by built&#8208;in electric field across the heterojunction, photoexcited electrons could rapidly (2&#8197;ps) transfer from the n&#8208;type ZnO core to the p&#8208;type SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN shell, finally boosting the catalytic performance of the surface&#8208;exposed single&#8208;atom Co&#8722;N4 sites for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation under light irradiation. The synergies between photocatalysis and heterogeneous Fenton&#8208;like reaction lead to phenomenally enhanced production of various reactive oxygen species for rapid degradation of various microcontaminants in water. Experimental and theoretical results validate that the interfacial coupling of SA&#8208;Co&#8208;CN with ZnO greatly facilitates PMS adsorption and activation by reducing the adsorption energy and enhancing the cascade electron transfer processes for the photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reaction.

         <title>A Nitrogen Battery Electrode involving Eight&#8208;Electron per Nitrogen for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;centered redox cycle operating between ammonia and nitrate via an eight&#8208;electron transfer as a catholyte was successfully implemented for Zn&#8208;based flow battery. A very competitive energy density of 577&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 and 930 charging&#8208;discharging cycles can be reached, demonstrating nitrogen cycle can offer promising cathodic redox chemistry for safe, affordable, and scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries have been discussed as scalable and simple stationary energy storage devices. However, currently developed systems encounter less competitive energy density and high costs, restricting their wider application. There is a lack of appropriate redox chemistry, preferably based on active materials that are abundant in nature and show high solubility in aqueous electrolytes. A nitrogen&#8208;centered redox cycle operating between the limiting species ammonia and nitrate via an eight&#8208;electron redox reaction stayed practically unnoticed, albeit its ubiquity in biological processes. Ammonia or nitrate are world&#8208;scale chemicals with high aqueous solubility, and are then comparably safe. We demonstrate here the successful implementation of such a nitrogen&#8208;based redox cycle between ammonia and nitrate with eight&#8208;electron transfer as a catholyte for Zn&#8208;based flow batteries, which continuously worked for 12.9&#8197;days with 930 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. A very competitive energy density of 577&#8197;Wh&#8201;L&#8722;1 can be reached, which is well above most reported flow batteries (e.g. 8&#8197;times the standard Zn&#8208;bromide battery), demonstrating that the nitrogen cycle with eight&#8208;electron transfer can offer promising cathodic redox chemistry for safe, affordable, and scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices.

         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed marked progress in the efficient synthesis of various enantioenriched 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines. However, enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective access to&#160;trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines remains much less explored. Herein we report that a frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;based catalyst generated via in situ hydroboration of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene with HB(C6F5)2&#160;allows for the one&#8208;pot tandem cyclization/hydrosilylation of 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzenes and 1,2&#8208;diketones with commercially available PhSiH3&#160;to exclusively afford&#160;trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with excellent diastereoselectivities (&gt;20:1 dr).&#160;&#160;Furthermore, this reaction can be rendered asymmetric by using an enantioenriched borane&#8208;based catalyst derived from HB(C6F5)2&#160;and a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral diene to give rise to enantioenriched&#160;trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxalines in high yields with almost complete diastereo&#8208; and enantiocontrol (&gt;20:1 dr, up to &gt;99% ee). A wide substrate scope, good tolerance of diverse functionality and up to 20&#8208;gram scale production are demonstrated. The enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol are achieved by the judicious choice of borane catalyst and hydrosilane.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis with 63.5% Faradaic Efficiency and 100% N&#8208;selectivity via&#160;One&#8208;step C&#8211;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic urea synthesis via coupling N2 and CO2 provides an effective route to mitigate energy crisis and close carbon footprint. However, the difficulty on breaking N&#8801;N is the main reason that caused low efficiencies for both electrocatalytic NH3 and urea synthesis, which is the bottleneck restricting their industrial applications. Herein, a new mechanism to overcome the inert of the nitrogen molecule was proposed by elongating N&#8801;N instead of breaking N&#8801;N to realize one&#8208;step C&#8208;N coupling in the process for urea production. We constructed a Zn&#8208;Mn diatomic catalyst with axial chloride coordination, Zn&#8208;Mn sites display high tolerance to CO poisoning and the Faradaic efficiency can even be increased to 63.5%, which is the highest value that has ever been reported. More importantly, negligible N&#8801;N bond breakage effectively avoids the generation of ammonia as intermediates, therefore, the N&#8208;selectivity in the co&#8208;electrocatalytic system reaches100% for urea synthesis. The previous cognition that electrocatalysts for urea synthesis must possess ammonia synthesis activity has been broken. Isotope&#8208;labelled measurements and Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validate that activation of N&#8211;N triple bond and nitrogen fixation activity arise from the one&#8208;step C&#8211;N coupling process of CO species with adsorbed N2 molecules.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a highly regioselective, catalytic one&#8208;step dehydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;substituted cyclic ketones in the presence of 2,3&#8208;dichlorobenzo&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ). The high regioselectivity originates from a phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enolization, selectively affording the thermodynamically preferred enol, followed by the subsequent oxidation event.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metallonucleases (AMNs) are promising DNA damaging drug candidates. Here, we demonstrate how the 1,2,3&#8208;triazole linker produced by the copper&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can be directed to build copper&#8208;binding AMN scaffolds. We selected biologically inert reaction partners&#160;tri&#8208;azidomethyl&#8208;mesitylene and ethynyl&#8208;thiophene to develop&#160;TC&#8208;Thio, a bioactive&#160;C3&#8208;symmetric ligand in which three thiophene&#8208;triazole moieties are positioned around a central mesitylene core. The ligand was characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and forms multinuclear Cu(II) and Cu(I) complexes identified by mass spectrometry and rationalised by density functional theory (DFT). Upon copper coordination, Cu(II)&#8208;TC&#8208;Thio becomes a potent DNA binding and cleaving agent. Mechanistic studies reveal DNA recognition occurs exclusively at the minor groove with subsequent oxidative damage promoted through a superoxide&#8208; and peroxide&#8208;dependent pathway. Single molecule imaging of DNA isolated from Cu(II)&#8208;TC&#8208;Thio treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells shows that&#160;the complex has comparable activity to the clinical drug temozolomide, with DNA damage that is recognised by a combination of base excision repair (BER) enzymes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial metallonucleases (AMNs) are promising DNA damaging drug candidates. Here, we demonstrate how the 1,2,3-triazole linker produced by the copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction can be directed to build copper-binding AMN scaffolds. We selected biologically inert reaction partners&#160;tri-azidomethyl-mesitylene and ethynyl-thiophene to develop&#160;TC-Thio, a bioactive&#160;C3-symmetric ligand in which three thiophene-triazole moieties are positioned around a central mesitylene core. The ligand was characterised by X-ray crystallography and forms multinuclear Cu(II) and Cu(I) complexes identified by mass spectrometry and rationalised by density functional theory (DFT). Upon copper coordination, Cu(II)-TC-Thio becomes a potent DNA binding and cleaving agent.

         <title>Circumpentacene with Open&#8208;Shell Singlet Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circumacenes (CAs) are a distinctive type of benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons where an acene unit is completely enclosed by a layer of outer fused benzene rings. Despite their unique structure, the synthesis of CAs is challenging, and until recently, the largest CA molecule synthesized was circumanthracene. In this study, we report the successful synthesis of an extended circumpentacene derivative 1, which represents the largest CA molecule synthesized to date. Its structure was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and its electronic properties were systematically investigated by both experiments and theoretical calculations. It shows a unique open&#8208;shell diradical character due to the existence of extended zigzag edges, with a moderate diradical character index (y0 = 39.7%) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;ES&#8208;T = &#8208;4.47 kcal/mol). It exhibits a dominant local aromatic character with &#960;&#8208;electrons delocalized in the individual aromatic sextet rings. It has a small HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap and displays amphoteric redox behavior. The electronic structures of its dication and dianion can be considered as doubly charged structures in which two coronene units are fused with a central aromatic benzene ring. This study provides a new route toward stable multizigzag&#8208;edged graphene&#8208;like molecules with open&#8208;shell di/polyradical character.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Kinetics in Chiral Poly(diphenylacetylene)s: Dynamic P/M Memory Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic P/M (plus/minus) helical memory in chiral dissymmetric poly(diphenylacetylene)s (PDPA) is shown by using as model compound a PDPA that bears the benzamide of (L)&#8208;alanine methyl ester as pendant. Thus, for a single chiral polymer, it is possible to obtain either P or M macromolecular helical structures in a specific solvent without the presence of any chiral external stimuli. To do that, it is necessary to combine the conformational control at the pendant group with a high steric hindrance at the backbone. In this case, by thermal annealing in low polar solvents, an anti&#8208;conformer is stabilized at the pendant which commands a P helix in the PDPA. Next, solvent removal followed by addition of a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), results in the kinetic conformationally trapped P helix. However, in this medium, the preferred handedness and the thermodynamic macromolecular helix for poly&#8208;(L)&#8208;1 is M. This process also occurs in the opposite way. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) studies show that the dynamic memory effect is present both in ground and excited states. These studies also show a remarkable long&#8208;term memory effect that can be stored for several months.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline: A New Entry to Aza&#8208;Oxa&#8208;Crown Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new 15&#8208;membered&#8208;macrocyclic molecular entity, oxa&#8208;TriQuinoline (o&#8208;TQ), was designed and synthesized. In o&#8208;TQ, three oxygen atoms were joined onto three quinoline units at the 2&#8208; and 8&#8208;positions in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail fashion via three&#8208;fold SNAr reactions, giving rise to the characteristic N3O3 aza&#8208;oxa&#8208;crown architecture. o&#8208;TQ can serve as a new tridentate nitrogen ligand to capture a Cu(I) cation and adopt a bowl shape, before supramolecular complexation with corannulene and [12]CPP occurs via &#960;&#8211;&#960; and CH&#8211;&#960; interactions. In the presence of the Cu(I) cation, the non&#8208;emissive o&#8208;TQ becomes a highly emissive material in the solid state, whereby the emission wavelengths depend on the ancillary ligand on the Cu(I) cation. The o&#8208;TQ/Cu(I) complex is able to promote carbene catalysis to provide a range of enamines with a gem&#8208;difluorinated terminus.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Bacterial Neutral Ceramidase in Diabetic Foot Ulcers with an Optimized Substrate and Chemoenzymatic Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ceramidases (CDases) are important in controlling skin barrier integrity by regulating ceramide composition and affording downstream signal molecules. While the functions of epidermal CDases are known, roles of neutral CDases secreted by skin&#8208;residing microbes are undefined. Here, we developed a one&#8208;step fluorogenic substrate, S&#8208;B, for specific detection of bacterial CDase activity and inhibitor screening. We identified a non&#8208;hydrolyzable substrate mimic C6 as the best hit. Based on C6, we designed JX&#8208;1, a photoaffinity probe and observed an efficient detection of bacterial CDases. Using JX&#8208;1 we identified endogenous low&#8208;abundant PaCDase in P. aeruginosa monoculture and mixed skin bacteria culture. Harnessing both S&#8208;B and JX&#8208;1, we observed in clinical diabetic foot ulcers patient samples that CDase activity positively correlates to P. aeruginosa relative abundance and is negatively associated with wound area reduction. Overall, our study demonstrates that bacterial CDases are important regulators of skin ceramides and potentially play a role in wound healing.</dc:description>

         <title>14.31% Power Conversion Efficiency of Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells via Efficient Reduction of Sn 4+</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoelectric properties of nontoxic Sn&#8208;based perovskite make it a promising alternative to toxic Pb&#8208;based perovskite. It has superior photovoltaic performance in comparison to other Pb&#8208;free counterparts. The facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ presents a notable obstacle in the advancement of perovskite solar cells that utilize Sn, as it adversely affects their stability and performance. The study revealed the presence of a Sn4+ concentration on both the upper and lower surfaces of the perovskite layer. This discovery led to the adoption of a bi&#8208;interface optimization approach. A thin layer of Sn metal was inserted at the two surfaces of the perovskite layer. The implementation of this intervention yielded a significant decrease in the levels of Sn4+ and trap densities. The power conversion efficiency of the device was achieved at 14.31% through the optimization of carrier transportation. The device exhibited operational and long&#8208;term stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Blending Low&#8208;Frequency Vibrations and Push&#8208;pull Effects Affords Superior Photoacoustic Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noninvasive in vivo imaging technique, has been widely used in clinical disease diagnosis. However, the design of high&#8208;performance PAI agents with three key characteristics, i.e., near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption (&#955;abs &gt; 800 nm), intense PA signals, and excellent photostability, remains a challenging goal. Herein, we present a facile but effective approach for engineering PAI agents by amplifying intramolecular low&#8208;frequency vibrations and enhancing the push&#8208;pull effect. As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1&#8208;NEt2) based on the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA&#8208;approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; &#955;abs = 788 nm), BDP1&#8208;NEt2 exhibited a UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectrum peaked at 825 nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.</dc:description>

As a demonstration of this blended approach, we constructed a PAI agent (BDP1-NEt2) based on the boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) scaffold. Compared with indocyanine green (ICG, an FDA-approved organic dye widely utilized in PAI studies; &#955;abs = 788 nm), BDP1-NEt2 exhibited a UV-Vis-NIR spectrum peaked at 825 nm, superior in vivo PA signal intensity and outstanding stability to offer improved tumor diagnostics. We believe this work provides a promising strategy to develop the next generation of PAI agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Adsorbed Hydroxyl: A Double&#8208;Edged Sword in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction over Oxide&#8208;Derived Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide&#8208;derived Cu (OD&#8208;Cu) featured with surface located sub&#8208;20 nm nanoparticles (NPs) created via surface structure reconstruction was developed for electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR). With surface adsorbed hydroxyls (OHad) identified during ECO2RR, it is realized that OHad, sterically confined and adsorbed at OD&#8208;Cu by surface located sub&#8208;20 nm NPs, should be determinative to the multi&#8208;carbon (C2) product selectivity. In&#8208;situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that OHad favors the adsorption of low&#8208;frequency *CO with weak C&#8801;O bonds and strengthens the *CO binding at OD&#8208;Cu surface, promoting *CO dimerization and then selective C2 production. However, excessive OHad would inhibit selective C2 production by occupying active sites and facilitating competitive H2 evolution. In a flow cell, stable C2 production with high selectivity of ~60% at &#8722;200 mA cm&#8722;2 could be achieved over OD&#8208;Cu, with adsorption of OHad well steered in the fast flowing electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>An Extracellular miRNA&#8208;Responsive Artificial Receptor via Dynamic DNA Nano&#8208;assembly for Biomarker&#8208;Driven Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various diseases. However, there is currently a lack of molecular strategies that can effectively use disease&#8208;associated extracellular miRNAs as input signals to drive therapeutic functions. Herein, we present a modular and programmable miRNA&#8208;responsive chimeric DNA receptor (miRNA&#8208;CDR) capable of biomarker&#8208;driven therapy. By grafting a miRNA&#8208;responsive DNA nanodevice on a natural membrane receptor via aptamer anchoring, miRNA&#8208;CDR can sense extracellular miRNA levels and autonomously induce dimerization&#8208;mediated receptor activation via the complementary&#8208;mediated strand displacement reaction&#8208;induced dynamic DNA assembly. The sequence programmability of miRNA&#8208;CDR allows it to sense and respond to a user&#8208;defined miRNA with tunable sensitivity. Moreover, the miRNA&#8208;CDR is versatile and customizable to reprogram desirable signaling output via adapting a designated receptor, such as MET and FGFR1. Using a mouse model of drug&#8208;induced acute liver injury (DILI), we demonstrate the functionality of a de&#8208;signer miRNA&#8208;CDR in rewiring the recognition of the DILI&#8208;elevated miR&#8208;122 to promote MET signaling of hepatocytes for biomarker&#8208;driven in situ repair and liver function restoration. Our synthetic miRNA&#8208;CDR platform provides a novel molecular device enabling biomarker&#8208;driven therapeutic cellular response, potentially paving the way for improving the precision of cell therapy in regenerative medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light and Microwave&#8208;Mediated Rapid Trapping and Release of Singlet Oxygen Using a Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to its high reactivity and oxidative strength, singlet oxygen (1O2) is used in a variety of fields including organic synthesis, biomedicine, photodynamic therapy and materials science. Despite its importance, the controlled trapping and release of 1O2 is extremely challenging. Herein, we describe a one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer, CP1, which upon irradiation with visible light, transforms 3O2 (triplet oxygen) to 1O2. CP1 consists of Cd(II) centers bridged by 9,10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)vinyl)anthracene ligands which undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with 1O2, resulting in the generation of CP1&#8208;1O2. Using microwave irradiation, CP1&#8208;1O2 displays efficient release of 1O2, over a period of 30 s. In addition, CP1 exhibits enhanced fluorescence and has an oxygen detection limit of 97.4 ppm. Theoretical calculations reveal that the fluorescence behaviour is dominated by unique through&#8208;space conjugation. In addition to describing a highly efficient approach for the trapping and controlled release of 1O2, using coordination polymers, this work also provides encouragement for the development of efficient fluorescent oxygen sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Harmonious Heterointerfaces Formed on 2D&#8208;Pt Nanodendrites by Facet&#8208;Respective Stepwise Metal Deposition for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of nanocrystal (NC) catalysts could be maximized by introducing rationally designed heterointerfaces formed by the facet&#8208; and spatio&#8208;specific modification with other materials of desired size and thickness. However, such heterointerfaces are limited in scope and synthetically challenging. Herein, we applied a wet chemistry method to tunably deposit Pd and Ni on the available surfaces of porous 2D&#8208;Pt nanodendrites (NDs). Using 2D silica nanoreactors to house the 2D&#8208;PtND, an 0.5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (e&#8208;Pd or&#160;e&#8208;Ni) was exclusively formed on the flat {110} surface of 2D&#8208;Pt, while a non&#8208;epitaxial Pd or Ni layer (n&#8208;Pd or n&#8208;Ni) was typically deposited at the {111/100} edge in absence of nanoreactor. Notably, these differently located Pd/Pt and Ni/Pt heterointerfaces experienced distinct electronic effect to influence unevenly in electrocatalytic synergy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For instance, an enhanced H2 generation on the Pt{110} facet with 2D&#8208;2D interfaced&#160;e&#8208;Pd&#160;deposition and faster water dissociation on the edge&#8208;located&#160;n&#8208;Ni overpowered their facet&#8208;located counterparts in respective HER catalysis. Therefore, a feasible assembling of the valuable heterointerfaces in the optimal 2D n&#8208;Ni/e&#8208;Pd/Pt catalyst overcame the sluggish alkaline HER kinetics, with a catalytic activity 7.9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C.</dc:description>

         <title>Desolvation&#8208;Induced Highly Symmetrical Terbium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet Exhibiting Luminescent Self&#8208;Monitoring of Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conjunction of Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behavior and luminescence thermometry is an emerging research line aiming at contactless read&#8208;out of temperature in future SMM&#8208;based devices. The shared working range between slow magnetic relaxation and the thermometric response is typically narrow or absent. We report TbIII&#8208;based emissive SMMs formed in a cyanido&#8208;bridged framework whose properties are governed by the reversible structural transformation from [TbIII(H2O)2][CoIII(CN)6]&#183;2.7H2O (1) to its dehydrated phase, TbIII[CoIII(CN)6] (2). The 8&#8208;coordinated complexes in 1 show the moderate SMM effect&#160;but it is enhanced for trigonal&#8208;prismatic TbIII complexes in 2, showing the SMM features up to 42 K. They are governed by the combination of QTM, Raman, and Orbach relaxation with the energy barrier of 594(18) cm&#8211;1 (854(26) K), one of the highest among the TbIII&#8208;based molecular nanomagnets. Both systems exhibit emission&#160;related to the f&#8208;f electronic transitions, with the temperature variations resulting in the optical thermometry below 100 K. The dehydration leads to a wide temperature overlap between the SMM behavior and thermometry, from 6 K to 42 K. These functionalities are further enriched after the magnetic dilution. The role of post&#8208;synthetic formation of high&#8208;symmetry TbIII complexes in achieving the SMM effect and hot&#8208;bands&#8208;based optical thermometry is discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc (Zn) ion batteries are attractive for next generation batteries with high safety, yet their applications are still hindered by the uncontrollable dendrite formation and side reactions on Zn anode. Here, a polyzwitterion protective layer (PZIL) was engineered by polymerizing 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) in carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), which renders the following merits: the choline groups of MPC can preferentially adsorb onto Zn metal to avoid side reactions; the charged phosphate groups chelate with Zn2+ to regulate the solvation structure, further improving side reaction inhibition; the Hofmeister effect between ZnSO4 and CMCS can enhance the interfacial contact during electrochemical characterization. Consequently, the symmetrical Zn battery with PZIL can keep stable for more than 1000 hours under the ultra&#8208;high current density of 40 mA cm&#8208;2. The PZIL confers the Zn/MnO2 full battery and Zn/active carbon (AC) capacitor with stable cycling performance under high current density.</dc:description>

         <title>Click&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Nanopipettes for the Capture and Dynamic Analysis of a Single Mitochondrion inside One Living Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth study of single cells requires the dynamically molecular information in one particular nanometer&#8208;sized organelle in a living cell, which is difficult to achieve using current methods. Due to high efficiency of click chemistry, a new nanoelectrode&#8208;based pipette architecture with dibenzocyclooctyne at the tip is designed to realize fast conjugation with azide group&#8208;containing triphenylphosphine, which targets mitochondrial membranes. The covalent binding of one mitochondrion at the tip of the nanopipette allows a small region of the membrane to be isolated on the Pt surface inside the nanopipette. Therefore, the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the mitochondrion is monitored, which is not interfered by the species present in the cytosol. The dynamic tracking of ROS release from one mitochondrion reveals the distinctive &#8220;ROS&#8208;induced ROS release&#8221; within the mitochondria. Further study of RSL3&#8208;induced ferroptosis using nanopipettes provides direct evidence for supporting the noninvolvement of glutathione peroxidase 4 in the mitochondria during RSL3&#8208;induced ROS generation, which has not previously been observed at the single&#8208;mitochondrion level. Eventually, this established strategy should overcome the existing challenge of the dynamic measurement of one special organelle in the complicated intracellular environment, which opens a new direction for electroanalysis in subcellular analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal Free Electrophilic Aminations of Polyfunctional O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Trimethylbenzoyl Hydroxylamines with Zinc and Magnesium Organometallics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various zinc and magnesium reagents were successfully aminated using O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl hydroxylamines (O&#8208;TBHAs) leading to the corresponding tertiary alkyl amines in 52&#8211;99&#8201;% yield without any additional transition&#8208;metal catalyst. This reaction was extended to the preparation of optically enriched amines (up to 88&#8201;% ee) starting from enantioenriched secondary alkylmagnesium reagents of the type s&#8208;AlkylMgCH2SiMe3.







Abstract
We reported a new electrophilic amination of various primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl, benzylic, allylic zinc and magnesium organometallics with O&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl hydroxylamines (O&#8208;TBHAs) in 52&#8211;99&#8201;% yield. These O&#8208;TBHAs displayed an excellent long&#8208;term stability and were readily prepared from various highly functionalized secondary amines via a convenient 3 step procedure. The amination reactions showed remarkable chemoselectivity proceeding without any transition&#8208;metal catalyst and were usually complete after 1&#8211;3&#8197;h reaction time at 25&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, this electrophilic amination also provided access to enantioenriched tertiary amines (up to 88&#8201;% ee) by using optically enriched secondary alkylmagnesium reagents of the type s&#8208;AlkylMgCH2SiMe3.

         <title>Photoredox Catalysis for the Synthesis of N&#8208;CF2H Compounds Using 1&#8208;((N&#8208;(difluoromethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl)&#8208;sulfonamido)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium Trifluoromethanesulfonate</title>

         <dc:description>
NCF2H compounds are seen widely in approved and experimental drugs, yet methods to install this moiety are limited. A direct N&#8208;(difluoromethyl)sulfonamidation protocol is presented, and enables the diversification of NCF2H compounds to benefit drug discovery. This photoredox&#8208;catalyzed strategy employs a novel pyridinium reagent with broad functional group tolerance and showcases the effective adaptation of a continuous flow protocol.







Abstract
N&#8208;(difluoromethyl)amino (&#8722;NCF2H) compounds are of great interest given their unique and underexplored physiochemical properties. The lack of structural diversity in NCF2H compounds is likely due in part to the shortage of protocols for efficient installation. Presented herein is a new shelf&#8208;stable pyridinium reagent that enables the direct installation of the N&#8208;(difluoromethyl)sulfonamide moiety [N(Ts)CF2H)] onto (hetero)arenes and alkenes for the diversification of aryl and alkyl NCF2H compounds. The described protocol utilizes blue light photoredox catalysis and displays broad functional group tolerance with excellent chemoselectivity. Additional transformations and applicability towards a photoredox continuous flow protocol are also demonstrated.

         <title>About Perfluoropolyhedranes, Their Electron&#8208;Accepting Ability and Questionable Supramolecular Hosting Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry infers perfection and perennity, order, and harmony. Synthesizing perfluoropolyhedranes, a serious challenge, greatly enhances polyhedrane electron affinity, providing a unique opportunity for hosting an extra electron inside a molecular frame. The expectations for an easy entry to supramolecular chemistry hinted by such &#8220;cage&#8221; or &#8220;box&#8221; structures are, however, illusive.







Abstract
Polyhedral molecules are appealing for their eye&#8208;catching architecture and distinctive chemistry. Perfluorination of such, often greatly strained, compounds is a momentous challenge. It drastically changes the electron distribution, structure and properties. Notably, small high&#8208;symmetry perfluoropolyhedranes feature a centrally located, star&#8208;shaped low&#8208;energy unoccupied molecular orbital that can host an extra electron within the polyhedral frame, thus producing a radical anion, without loss of symmetry. This predicted electron&#8208;hosting capacity was definitively established for perfluorocubane, the first perfluorinated Platonic polyhedrane to be isolated pure. Hosting atoms, molecules, or ions in such &#8220;cage&#8221; structures is, however, all but forthright, if not illusionary, offering no easy access to supramolecular constructs. While adamantane and cubane have fostered numerous applications in materials science, medicine, and biology, specific uses for their perfluorinated counterparts remain to be established. Some aspects of highly fluorinated carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes and graphite, are briefly mentioned for context.

         <title>A Duplex Polymerization Strategy for General, Programmable and High&#8208;Resolution Nanopore&#8208;Based Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a programmable, general, and flexible signal transduction and resolution&#8208;enhancing concept named target&#8208;induced duplex polymerization strategy (DPS). DPS simultaneously provides size&#8208;amplification and signal&#8208;specificity for solid&#8208;state nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule characterization and analysis.







Abstract
Nanopore sensing is highly promising in single molecular analysis but their broad applications have been challenged by the limited strategies that can transduce a target&#8208;of&#8208;interest into a specific and anti&#8208;false/inference signal, especially for solid&#8208;state nanopores with relatively lower resolution and higher noise. Here we report a high&#8208;resolution signal&#8208;production concept named target&#8208;induced duplex polymerization strategy (DPS). Through linking the same or different duplex substrates (DSs) with a special linker (L) and an optional structure tag (ST), the DPS can generate target&#8208;specific DS polymers with highly controllable duration times, duration intervals and even distinguished secondary tagging currents. Experimentally, DPS mono&#8208;polymerization of single DS and co&#8208;polymerization of multiple DSs has verified the duration time of a DPS product is the sum of those for each DS monomer. Tetrahedron&#8208;DNA structures with different sizes are used as the STs to provide needle&#8208;like secondary peaks for further resolution enhancement and multiplex assay. With these examples DPS represents a general, programmable and advanced strategy that may simultaneously provide size&#8208;amplification, concentration amplification, and signal&#8208;specificity for molecular recognition. It is also promisingly in various applications regarding to single molecular investigation, such as polymerization degree, structure/side chain conformation, programmable multiplex decoding and information index.

&lt;p&gt;Nanopore sensing is highly promising in single molecular analysis but their broad applications have been challenged by the limited strategies that can transduce a target-of-interest into a specific and anti-false/inference signal, especially for solid-state nanopores with relatively lower resolution and higher noise. Here we report a high-resolution signal-production concept named target-induced duplex polymerization strategy (DPS). Through linking the same or different duplex substrates (DSs) with a special linker (L) and an optional structure tag (ST), the DPS can generate target-specific DS polymers with highly controllable duration times, duration intervals and even distinguished secondary tagging currents. Experimentally, DPS mono-polymerization of single DS and co-polymerization of multiple DSs has verified the duration time of a DPS product is the sum of those for each DS monomer. Tetrahedron-DNA structures with different sizes are used as the STs to provide needle-like secondary peaks for further resolution enhancement and multiplex assay. With these examples DPS represents a general, programmable and advanced strategy that may simultaneously provide size-amplification, concentration amplification, and signal-specificity for molecular recognition. It is also promisingly in various applications regarding to single molecular investigation, such as polymerization degree, structure/side chain conformation, programmable multiplex decoding and information index.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;activated esters as reactive handles in direct post&#8208;polymerization modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;activated esters are prominently featured functional groups in polymer science, as ester functional monomers display great structural diversity and excellent compatibility with a wide range of polymerization mechanisms. Yet, their direct use as a reactive handle in post&#8208;polymerization modification has been typically avoided due to their low reactivity, which impairs the quantitative conversion typically desired in post&#8208;polymerization modification reactions. While activated ester approaches are a well&#8208;established alternative, the modification of non&#8208;activated esters remains a synthetic and economically valuable opportunity. In this review, we discuss past and recent efforts in the utilization of non&#8208;activated ester groups as a reactive handle to facilitate transesterification and aminolysis/amidation reactions, and the potential of the developed methodologies in the context of macromolecular engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Carbon Nanodots Can Act as Molecular Catalysts in Chemical and Photochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, a microwave synthesis followed by a simple purification process produces a new type of chiral Carbon Nanodots (CNDs). These CNDs are soluble in organic solvents, exhibit amino groups on their surface and display interesting absorption and emission properties along with mirror image profiles in the electronic circular dichroism spectrum. All these features set the stage for CNDs to act as multifunctional catalytic platforms, able to promote diverse chemical transformations. In particular, the outer shell composition of CNDs was instrumental to carry out organocatalytic reactions in an enantioselective fashion. In addition, the redox and light&#8208;absorbing properties of the material are suitable to drive photochemical processes. Finally, the photoredox and organocatalytic activations of CNDs were exploited at the same time to promote a cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling. This work demonstrates that CNDs can be used as catalysts to promote multiple reactivities, previously considered exclusive domain of molecular catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>New Anderson&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate Covalent Organic Frameworks as Electrodes for Energy Storage Boosted Through Keto&#8208;Enol Tautomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unique electrochemical properties of polyoxometalates (POMs) render them ideal components for the fabrication of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems. However, their practical applications have been hindered by their high solubility in common electrolytes. This problem can be overcome by the effective hybridization of POMs with other materials. Here we present the design and synthesis of two novel polyoxometalate&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (POCOF)&#160;via&#160;one&#8208;pot solvothermal strategy between an amino&#8208;functionalized Anderson&#8208;type POM and a trialdehyde&#8208;based building unit.&#160;We show that structural and functional complexity can be enriched by adding hydroxyl groups in the 2,4,6 position to the benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarbaldehyde allowing to exploit for the first time in POCOFs keto&#8208;enol tautomerization as additional feature to impart greater chemical stability to the COFs and enhanced properties leading to large specific surface area (347 m2/g) and superior electrochemical performance of POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes, when compared with POCOF&#8208;2 electrodes that possess only imine&#8208;type linkage and with pristine POM electrodes. Specifically, POCOF&#8208;1 electrodes display remarkable specific, areal, and volumetric capacitance (125 F/g, 248 mF/cm2&#160;and 41.9 mF/cm3, respectively) at a current density of 0.5 A/g, a maximum energy density (56.2 Wh/kg), a maximum power density (3.7 kW/kg) and an outstanding cyclability (90% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>An artificial intelligence approach for tackling conformational energy uncertainties in chiroptical spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Determination of the absolute configuration of chiral molecules is a prerequisite for obtaining a fundamental understanding in any chirality&#8208;related field. The interaction with polarised light has proven to be a powerful means to determine this absolute configuration, but its application rests on the comparison between experimental and computed spectra for which the inherent uncertainty in conformational
Boltzmann factors has proven to be extremely hard to tackle. Here we present a novel approach that overcomes this issue by combining a genetic algorithm that identifies the relevant conformers by accounting for the uncertaintie in DFT relative energies, and a hierarchical clustering algorithm that analyses the trends in the spectra of the considered conformers and identifies on&#8208;the&#8208;fly when a given chiroptical technique is not able to make reliable predictions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by considering the challenging cases of papuamine and haliclonadiamine, two bis&#8208;indane natural products with eight chiral centres and considerable&#160; conformational heterogeneity that could not be assigned unambiguously with current approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Solution Synthesis of Graphene Nanoribbons with Precisely Engineered Nanopores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of nanopores into graphene nanostructures has been demonstrated as an efficient tool in tuning their bandgaps and electronic structures. However, precisely embedding the uniform nanopores into graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) at the atomic level remains underdeveloped especially for in&#8208;solution synthesis due to the lack of efficient synthetic strategies. Herein we report the first case of solution&#8208;synthesized porous GNR (pGNR) with a fully conjugated backbone via the efficient Scholl reaction of tailor&#8208;made polyphenylene precursor (P1) bearing pre&#8208;installed hexagonal nanopores. The resultant pGNR features periodic subnanometer pores with a uniform diameter of 0.6 nm and an adjacent&#8208;pores&#8208;distance of 1.7 nm. To solidify our design strategy, two porous model compounds (1a, 1b) containing the same pore size as the shortcuts of pGNR, are successfully synthesized. The chemical structure and photophysical properties of pGNR are investigated by various spectroscopic analyses. Notably, the embedded periodic nanopores largely reduce the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and alleviate the inter&#8208;ribbon &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, compared to the nonporous GNRs with similar widths, affording pGNR with a notably enlarged bandgap and enhanced liquid&#8208;phase processability.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Titanium&#8208;based catalysis in single electron transfer (SET) steps has evolved into a versatile approach for the synthesis of fine chemicals and first attempts have recently been made to enhance its sustainability by merging it with photo&#8208;redox (PR) catalysis. Here, we explore the photochemical principles of all&#8208;Ti&#8208;based SET&#8208;PR&#8208;catalysis, i.e. in the absence of a precious metal PR&#8208;co&#8208;catalyst. By combining time&#8208;resolved emission with ultraviolet&#8208;pump/mid&#8208;infrared&#8208;probe (UV/MIR) spectroscopy on femtosecond&#8208;to&#8208;microsecond time scales we quantify the dynamics of the critical events of entry into the catalytic cycle; namely, the singlet&#8208;triplet interconversion of the do&#8208;it&#8208;all titanocene(IV) PR&#8208;catalyst and its one&#8208;electron reduction by a sacrificial amine electron donor. The results highlight the importance of the PR&#8208;catalyst&#8217;s singlet&#8208;triplet gap as a design guide for future improvements.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Design of a Robustly Stabilized Folded State Enabling Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization under Microfluidic Mixing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have investigated the folding and assembly behavior of a cystine&#8208;based dimeric diamide bearing pyrene units and solubilizing alkyl chains. In low&#8208;polarity solvents, it forms a 14&#8208;membered ring through double intramolecular hydrogen bonds between two diamide units. The spectroscopic studies revealed that the folded state is thermodynamically unstable and eventually transform into more energetically&#8208;stable helical supramolecular polymers that show an enhanced chiral excitonic coupling between the transition dipoles of the pyrene units. Importantly, compared to an alanine&#8208;based monomeric diamide, the dimeric diamide exhibits a superior kinetic stability in the metastable folded state, as well as an increased thermodynamic stability in the aggregated state. Accordingly, the initiation of supramolecular polymerization can be regulated using a seeding method even under microfluidic mixing conditions. Furthermore, taking advantage of a self&#8208;sorting behavior observed in a mixture of l&#8208;cysteine&#8208; and d&#8208;cysteine&#8208;based dimeric diamides, a two&#8208;step supramolecular polymerization was achieved by stepwise addition of the corresponding seeds.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Phosphido Catalysis: Enantioselective Addition of Phosphines to Cyclopropenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a copper catalyst that promotes the addition of phosphines to cyclopropenes at ambient temperature. A range of cyclopropylphosphines bearing different steric and electronic properties can now be accessed in high yields and enantioselectivities. Enrichment of phosphorus stereocenters is also demonstrated via a Dynamic Kinetic Asymmetric Transformation (DyKAT) process. A combined experimental and theoretical mechanistic study supports an elementary step featuring insertion of a Cu(I)&#8211;phosphido into a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. Density functional theory calculations reveal migratory insertion as the rate&#8208; and stereo&#8208;determining step, followed by a&#160;syn&#8208;protodemetalation.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Molecular Separation on Through&#8208;Space Intervalence Transient Charge Transfer in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Cofacially arranged Redox Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate direct evidence of photoinduced through&#8208;space intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) between two cofacially arranged redox&#8208;active pairs in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and their dynamic variation with their molecular separation. Two homologous MOFs [Co2(NDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DPTTZ. DMF, 1 and [Co2(BDC)2(DPTTZ)2]. DMF, 2 (where, NDC = naphthalene dicarboxylate, BDC = benzene dicarboxylate, DPTTZ = N, N&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl)thiazolo&#8208;[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole, DMF = N, N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl formamide) are considered for this, whose intra&#8208;dimer distance of redox&#8208;active DPTTZ ligands differs ca. 1 &#197; from one system to another. Spectroelectrochemical study detects the formation of IVCT band at near&#8208;IR (NIR) region between cofacially oriented DPTTZ dimers in both MOFs. Transient spectroscopy shows faster charge separation as well as charge recombination when intra&#8208;dimer distance is lesser (in MOF 2) due to stronger electronic coupling. We quantify the extent of IVCT by charge transfer (CT) integral calculation; and also, by optical pump terahertz probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, where MOF 2 shows three times higher carrier mobility due to lesser inter&#8208;DPTTZ distance than MOF 1. These findings reveal a more localised aspect of through&#8208;space IVCT between cofacially organised redox&#8208;active pair in a three&#8208;dimensional framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Structural Plasticity of Kratom Pseudoindoxyl Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitragynine pseudoindoxyl, a kratom metabolite, has attracted increasing attention due to its favorable side effect profile compared to conventional opioids. Herein, we describe the first enantioselective and scalable total synthesis of this natural product in addition to its epimeric congener, speciogynine pseudoindoxyl. The characteristic spiro&#8208;5&#8208;5&#8208;6 tricyclic system of these alkaloids is formed via a protecting group&#8208;free cascade relay process in which oxidized tryptamine and secologanin analogs are used. Furthermore, we uncovered that mitragynine pseudoindoxyl acts not as a single molecular entity but as a dynamic ensemble of stereoisomers in protic environments, thus, it exhibits structural plasticity in biological systems. Accordingly, these synthetic, structural, and biological studies provide a basis for the planned design of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl analogs, which can guide the development of next&#8208;generation analgesics.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline Nanoparticles of Water&#8208;Soluble Covalent Basket Cages (CBCs) for Encapsulation of Anticancer Drugs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe the preparation, assembly, recognition characteristics, and biocompatibility of novel covalent basket cage CBC&#8208;11,&#160;composed of four molecular baskets linked to four trivalent aromatic amines via amide groups. The cage is tetrahedral in shape and similar in size to small proteins (Mw&#160;= 8637 g/mol) with a spacious nonpolar interior for accommodating multiple guests. While twenty&#8208;four carboxylates at the outer surface of CBC&#8208;11&#160;render it soluble in aqueous phosphate buffer (PBS) at pH = 7.0, the amphiphilic nature prompts its assembly into nanoparticles (d&#160;= 250 nm, DLS). Cryo&#8208;TEM examination of nanoparticles revealed their crystalline nature with wafer&#8208;like shape and hexagonally arranged cages. Nanoparticulate CBC&#8208;11&#160;traps anticancer drugs irinotecan and doxorubicin with each cage binding up to four drug molecules in a non&#8208;cooperative manner. The inclusion complexation resulted in nanoparticles growing in size and precipitating. In media containing mammalian cells (HCT 116, human colon carcinoma), IC50&#160;value of CBC&#8208;11&#160;was above 100&#160;mM. While this work presents the first example of a large covalent organic cage operating in water at the physiological pH and forming crystalline nanoparticles, it also demonstrates its biocompatibility and potential to act as a polyvalent binder of drugs for their sequestration or delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared Multiphoton Dissociation Enables Top&#8208;Down Characterization of Membrane Protein Complexes and G Protein&#8208;Coupled Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins are challenging to analyze by native mass spectrometry (MS) as their hydrophobic nature typically requires detergent micelles that are removed prior to analysis via collisional activation. There is however a practical limit to the amount of energy which can be applied, which often precludes subsequent characterization by top&#8208;down MS. To overcome this barrier, we have applied a modified Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer coupled to an infrared laser within a high&#8208;pressure linear ion trap. We show how tuning the intensity and time of incident photons enables liberation of membrane proteins from detergent micelles. Specifically, we relate the ease of micelle removal to the infrared absorption of detergents in both condensed and gas phases. Top&#8208;down MS via infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), results in good sequence coverage enabling unambiguous identification of membrane proteins and their complexes. By contrasting and comparing the fragmentation patterns of the ammonia channel with two class A GPCRs, we identify successive cleavage of adjacent amino acids within transmembrane domains. Using gas&#8208;phase molecular dynamics simulations, we show that areas prone to fragmentation maintain aspects of protein structure at increasing temperatures. Altogether, we propose a rationale to explain why and where in the protein fragment ions are generated.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction through Water Structure Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past, the design of efficient electrocatalyst materials for alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) were mostly focused on tuning the adsorption properties of reaction intermediates. A recent breakthrough shows that the performance can be improved by manipulating water structure at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface using atomically localized electric fields.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Redox&#8208;Neutral&#160;Thiolation  of Alkyl Halides with Thioformates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as an important strategy to furnish thioethers; however, the dominant utilization of noble metal catalysts as well as the construction of challenging C(sp3)&#8208;S bonds by transition metal&#8208;catalysis remain highly problematic. Earth&#8208;abundant manganese has gathered increasing interest as an attractive catalyst for new reaction development; nevertheless, C(sp3)&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reaction by manganese catalysis has not been reported. Herein, we disclose a highly efficient manganese&#8208;catalyzed redox&#8208;neutral thiolation of a broad range of alkyl halides with thioformates as practical sulfuration agents. Strategically, employing easily synthesized thioformates as thiyl radical precursors allows access to various aryl and alkyl thioethers in good to excellent yields. Notably, this redox&#8208;neutral method avoids the utilization of strong bases, external ligands, forcing reaction conditions, and stoichiometric manganese, thus presenting apparent advantages, such as broad substrate scope, excellent functional group compatibility, and mild reaction conditions. Finally, the utilities of this method are also illustrated by downstream transformations and late&#8208;stage thiolation of structurally complex natural products and pharmaceuticals.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward a Formyl&#8208;to&#8208;Phenyl Conversion: An Unexpected Photochemical Fulvene&#8208;Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Toward a conversion of aldehydes into arenes, we designed a sequence involving the initial reaction of an aldehyde to give a fulvene, followed by photochemical and platinum&#8208;catalyzed rearrangements into a Dewar benzene&#8208;derivative, which finally isomerizes into the targeted arene. While computational studies support the plausibility of this route, we find that fulvene irradiation resulted in an unexpected isomerization into a spiro[2.4]heptadiene. This unusual photorearrangement has been investigated mechanistically and provides access to a variety of spiro[2.4]heptadienes with different substituents.</dc:description>

         <title>When High&#8208;Temperature Cesium Chemistry Meets Self&#8208;Templating: Metal Acetates as Building Blocks of Unusual Highly Porous Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous carbon with a large specific surface area of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 is obtained by highly facile and straightforward pyrolysis of cesium acetate. The unique role of CsAc is revealed as a precursor, catalyst, physical template, and activating agent during the whole process.







Abstract
Self&#8208;templating is a facile strategy for synthesizing porous carbons by direct pyrolysis of organic metal salts. However, the method typically suffers from low yields (&lt;4%) and limited specific surface areas (SSA&lt;2000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) originating from low activity of metal cations (e.g., K+ or Na+) in promoting construction and activation of carbon frameworks. Here we use cesium acetate as the only precursor of oxo&#8208;carbons with large SSA of the order of 3000&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, pore volume approaching 2&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1, tunable oxygen contents, and yields of up to 15&#8201;%. We unravel the role of Cs+ as an efficient promoter of framework formation, templating and etching agent, while acetates act as carbon/oxygen sources of carbonaceous frameworks. The oxo&#8208;carbons show record&#8208;high CO2 uptake of 8.71&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an ultimate specific capacitance of 313&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the supercapacitor. This study helps to understand and rationally tailor the materials design by a still rare organic solid&#8208;state chemistry.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Cationic Defects Coupling with Local Alkaline&#8208;Enriched Environment for Efficient and Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density cationic defects coupling with local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment were developed to inhibit the dissolution of highly active species during oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. A higher concentration of alkaline around cationic defects than bulk electrolyte enables ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8722; ions. This novel strategy greatly enhances the stability and improves the activity.







Abstract
The inferior activity and stability of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) seriously limit their practical applications in various electrochemical energy conversion systems. Here we report, a drastic nonequilibrium precipitation approach to construct a highly disordered crystal structure of layered double hydroxides as a model OER catalyst. The unconventional crystal structure contains high&#8208;density cationic defects coupled with a local alkaline&#8208;enriched environment, enabling ultrafast diffusion of OH&#8722; ions and thus avoiding the formation of a local acidic environment and dissolution of active sites during OER. An integrated experimental and theoretical study reveals that high&#8208;density cationic defects, especially di&#8208;cationic and multi&#8208;cationic defects, serve as highly active and durable catalytic sites. This work showcases a promising strategy of crystal structure engineering to construct robust active sites for high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution in an alkaline solution.

         <title>CuNi Nanoalloys with Tunable Composition and Oxygen Defects for the Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of Cu to bimetallic CuNi nanoalloys of tunable composition and size promotes the catalytic activity in the electrochemical Oxygen Evolution reaction and the formation of Ni3+ under reaction conditions. The experimental evidence together with theoretical calculations showed that the relative amount between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) is an excellent descriptor of the catalytic performance in alkaline conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal synthesis is an excellent tool for the study of cooperative effects in nanoalloys. In this work, bimetallic CuNi nanoparticles of defined size and composition are fully characterized and tested for the oxygen evolution reaction. Copper addition to nickel leads to modifications in the structural and electronic properties, showing a higher concentration of surface oxygen defects and formation of active Ni3+ sites under reaction conditions. The ratio OV/OL between oxygen vacancies and lattice oxygen shows a clear correlation with the overpotential, being an excellent descriptor of the electrocatalytic activity. This is attributed to modifications in the crystalline structure, leading to lattice strain and grain size effects. Bimetallic Cu50Ni50NP showed the lowest overpotential (318&#8197;mV vs RHE), low Tafel slope (63.9&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), and excellent stability. This work unravels the relative concentration between oxygen defects and lattice oxygen (OV/OL) as an excellent descriptor of the catalytic activity of bimetallic precatalysts.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Targeted Glycan Editing on Living Cells Disrupts KRAS Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protein&#8208;targeted glycan editing strategy is developed for interfering with KRAS activity by manipulating the glycosylation of upstream membrane receptors. The attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3 blocks its binding with galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes.







Abstract
The frequent mutation of KRAS oncogene in some of the most lethal human cancers has spurred incredible efforts to develop KRAS inhibitors, yet only one covalent inhibitor for the KRASG12C mutant has been approved to date. New venues to interfere with KRAS signaling are desperately needed. Here, we report a &#8220;localized oxidation&#8208;coupling&#8221; strategy to achieve protein&#8208;specific glycan editing on living cells for disrupting KRAS signaling. This glycan remodeling method exhibits excellent protein and sugar specificity and is applicable to different donor sugars and cell types. Attachment of mannotriose to the terminal galactose/N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine epitopes of integrin &#945;v&#946;3, a membrane receptor upstream of KRAS, blocks its binding to galectin&#8208;3, suppresses the activation of KRAS and downstream effectors, and mitigates KRAS&#8208;driven malignant phenotypes. Our work represents the first successful attempt to interfere with KRAS activity by manipulating membrane receptor glycosylation.

         <title>Toward Complete Transformation of Sodium Polysulfides by Regulating the Second&#8208;Shell Coordinating Environment of Atomically Dispersed Fe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed N, S&#8208;coordinated Fe catalysts are anchored into porous carbon nanofibers as hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The introduction of second&#8208;shell S atoms modulates the electronic structure of Fe centers, thus enhancing the catalytic activity for promoting complete transformation of active S species, while realizing dendrite&#8208;free Na deposition.







Abstract
Room temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries are highly competitive as potential energy storage devices. Nevertheless, their actually achieved reversible capacities are far below the theoretical value due to incomplete transformation of polysulfides. Herein, atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N/S active center by regulating the second&#8208;shell coordinating environment of Fe single atom is proposed. The Fe&#8722;N4S2 coordination structure with enhanced local electronic concentration around the Fermi level is revealed via synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and theoretical calculations, which can not only significantly promote the transformation kinetics of polysulfides, but induce uniform Na deposition for dendrite&#8208;free Na anode. As a result, the obtained S cathode delivers a high initial reversible capacity of 1590&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, nearly the theoretical value. This work opens up a new avenue to facilitate the complete transformation of polysulfides for RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Carboxysome&#8208;Inspired Electrocatalysis using Enzymes for the Reduction of CO2 at Low Concentrations
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired approach using enzyme electrocatalysis for the efficient direct reduction of CO2 at low concentrations to formate using Carbonic Anhydrase co&#8208;immobilized with Formate Dehydrogenase in a mesoporous indium tin oxide electrode is described.







Abstract
The electrolysis of dilute CO2 streams suffers from low concentrations of dissolved substrate and its rapid depletion at the electrolyte&#8208;electrocatalyst interface. These limitations require first energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture and concentration, before electrolyzers can achieve acceptable performances. For direct electrocatalytic CO2 reduction from low&#8208;concentration sources, we introduce a strategy that mimics the carboxysome in cyanobacteria by utilizing microcompartments with nanoconfined enzymes in a porous electrode. A carbonic anhydrase accelerates CO2 hydration kinetics and minimizes substrate depletion by making all dissolved carbon available for utilization, while a highly efficient formate dehydrogenase reduces CO2 cleanly to formate; down to even atmospheric concentrations of CO2. This bio&#8208;inspired concept demonstrates that the carboxysome provides a viable blueprint for the reduction of low&#8208;concentration CO2 streams to chemicals by using all forms of dissolved carbon.

         <title>High Dielectric Poly(vinylidene fluoride)&#8208;Based Polymer Enables Uniform Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport in Solid&#8208;State Ionogel Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CTFE) shows lower adsorption energy on Pyr13+ from ionic liquids (ILs) than PVDF, which reduces the chance for Pyr13+ to occupy transport sites of Li+ and lower the Li+ migration barrier. In consequence, the Li+ transport in polymer phases is promoted, which narrows the gap of Li+ mobility between polymer phases with ILs and polymer&#8208;ILs interfaces, contributing to uniform Li+ flux to inhibit the lithium dendrites&#8217; growth.







Abstract
Ionic liquids (ILs)&#8208;incorporated solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (iono&#8208;SPEs) have high ionic conductivities but show non&#8208;uniform Li+ transport in different phases. This work greatly promotes Li+ transport in polymer phases by employing a poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CTFE), PTC] as the framework of ILs to prepare iono&#8208;SPEs. Unlike PVDF, PTC with suitable polarity shows weaker adsorption energy on IL cations, reducing their possibility of occupying Li+&#8208;hopping sites. The significantly higher dielectric constant of PTC than PVDF facilitates the dissociation of Li&#8208;anions clusters. These two factors motivate Li+ transport along PTC chains, narrowing the difference in Li+ transport among varied phases. The LiFePO4/PTC iono&#8208;SPE/Li cells cycle steadily with capacity retention of 91.5&#8201;% after 1000 cycles at 1&#8197;C and 25&#8201;&#176;C. This work paves a new way to induce uniform Li+ flux in iono&#8208;SPEs through polarity and dielectric design of polymer matrix.

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the periodic surface of catalysts by the inclusion of single atoms can help building atomic electric fields that highly promote the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. We show here that this is achieved by modulating the interfacial water orientation and by subsequently decreasing the active sites&#8208;hydrogen distance.







Abstract
The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00&#215;1010&#8197;N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M&#8722;H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Breaking the periodic surface of catalysts by the inclusion of single atoms can help building atomic electric fields that highly promote the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. We show here that this is achieved by modulating the interfacial water orientation and by subsequently decreasing the active sites-hydrogen distance.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Quantitative Point of Care Tests for Timely Diagnosis of Early&#8208;Onset Preeclampsia with High Sensitivity and Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>

Preeclampsia is a cardiovascular complication that can occur during the second half of pregnancy. Here, we developed a point&#8208;of&#8208;care test incorporating upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based lateral flow strips conjugated to novel vascular biomarkers including FKBPL and CD44 proteins, for timely and reliable diagnosis of preeclampsia during pregnancy that can improve the odds of preventing major maternal complications and possibly death.







Abstract
Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous and multiorgan cardiovascular disorder of pregnancy. Here, we report the development of a novel strip&#8208;based lateral flow assay (LFA) using lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies targeting two different biomarkers for detection of preeclampsia. We first measured circulating plasma FKBPL and CD44 protein concentrations from individuals with early&#8208;onset preeclampsia (EOPE), using ELISA. We confirmed that the CD44/FKBPL ratio is reduced in EOPE with a good diagnostic potential. Using our rapid LFA prototypes, we achieved an improved lower limit of detection: 10&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for FKBPL and 15&#8197;pg&#8201;ml&#8722;1 for CD44, which is more than one order lower than the standard ELISA method. Using clinical samples, a cut&#8208;off value of 1.24 for CD44/FKBPL ratio provided positive predictive value of 100&#8201;% and the negative predictive value of 91&#8201;%. Our LFA shows promise as a rapid and highly sensitive point&#8208;of&#8208;care test for preeclampsia.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrogenation of Trisubstituted Carbocyclic Olefins: An Access to Chiral Cyclic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral cyclic amides has been achieved via cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of the corresponding enamides with a high degree of enantioselectivity. This methodology extends the utilization of earth abundant metal catalysis in asymmetric synthesis.







Abstract
The enantioselective hydrogenation of cyclic enamides has been achieved using an earth&#8208;abundant cobalt&#8208;bisphosphine catalyst. Using CoCl2/(S,S)&#8208;Ph&#8208;BPE, several trisubstituted carbocyclic enamides were reduced with high activity and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;%) to the corresponding saturated amides. The methodology can be extended to the synthesis of chiral amines by base hydrolysis of the hydrogenation products. Preliminary mechanistic investigations reveal the presence of a high spin cobalt (II) species in the catalytic cycle. We propose that the hydrogenation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond proceeds via a sigma&#8208;bond&#8208;metathesis pathway.

         <title>A Tandem&#8208;Locked Fluorescent NETosis Reporter for the Prognosis Assessment of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) is developed for sensitive and specific NETosis detection. TNR1 activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, which are neutrophil granular proteases involved in NETs formation. TNR1 represents the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice.







Abstract
NETosis, the peculiar type of neutrophil death, plays important roles in pro&#8208;tumorigenic functions and inhibits cancer immunotherapy. Non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time imaging is thus imperative for prognosis of cancer immunotherapy yet remains challenging. Herein, we report a Tandem&#8208;locked NETosis Reporter&#8197;1 (TNR1) that activates fluorescence signals only in the presence of both neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CTSG) for the specific imaging of NETosis. In the aspect of molecular design, the sequence of biomarker&#8208;specific tandem peptide blocks can largely affect the detection specificity towards NETosis. In live cell imaging, the tandem&#8208;locked design allows TNR1 to differentiate NETosis from neutrophil activation, while single&#8208;locked reporters fail to do so. The near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 in tumor from living mice were consistent with the intratumoral NETosis levels from histological results. Moreover, the near&#8208;infrared signals from activated TNR1 negatively correlated with tumor inhibition effect after immunotherapy, thereby providing prognosis for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, our study not only demonstrates the first sensitive optical reporter for noninvasive monitoring of NETosis levels and evaluation of cancer immunotherapeutic efficacy in tumor&#8208;bearing living mice, but also proposes a generic approach for tandem&#8208;locked probe design.

         <title>Utilizing Cationic Vacancies and Spontaneous Polarization on Cathode to Enhance Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage and Inhibit Dendrite Growth in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic vacancies of nickel cobalt oxide (NCOV) and a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) at the heterojunction cathode are introduced to boost zinc&#8208;ion adsorption and transport in Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The growth of zinc dendrites is inhibited by a mitigating electrolyte concentration gradient resulting from the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization field (SPF). Consequently, the NCOV/BFO heterojunction//Zn cell exhibits a comparable specific capacity and delivers a competitive capacity retention of 83.3&#8201;% over 3000 cycles.







Abstract
High energy density and intrinsic safety are the central pursuits in developing rechargeable Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). The capacity and stability of nickel cobalt oxide (NCO) cathode are unsatisfactory because of its semiconductor character. Herein, we propose a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) approach by synergizing cationic vacancies and ferroelectric spontaneous polarization on cathode side to facilitate electron adsorption and suppress zinc dendrite growth on the anode side. Concretely, NCO with cationic vacancies was constructed to expand lattice spacing for enhanced zinc&#8208;ion storage. Heterojunction with BEF leads to the Heterojunction//Zn cell exhibiting a capacity of 170.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and delivering a competitive capacity retention of 83.3&#8201;% over 3000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. We conclude the role of spontaneous polarization in suppressing zinc dendrite growth dynamics, which is conducive to developing high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;safety batteries via tailoring defective materials with ferroelectric polarization on the cathode.

         <title>Crystal Structure of an i&#8208;Motif from the HRAS Oncogene Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a biologically relevant i&#8208;motif from the HRAS oncogene was solved to 1.8&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure is a dimer of two i&#8208;motifs formed by six C&#8722;C+ pairs. The structure contains 20 base pairs, of which only two are canonical. The extensive network of capping and connecting interactions is unprecedented and suggests that auxiliary interactions are essential for i&#8208;motif stability in vivo.







Abstract
An i&#8208;motif is a non&#8208;canonical DNA structure implicated in gene regulation and linked to cancers. The C&#8208;rich strand of the HRAS oncogene, 5&#8242;&#8208;CGCCCGTGCCCTGCGCCCGCAACCCGA&#8208;3&#8242; (herein referred to as iHRAS), forms an i&#8208;motif in vitro but its exact structure was unknown. HRAS is a member of the RAS proto&#8208;oncogene family. About 19&#8201;% of US cancer patients carry mutations in RAS genes. We solved the structure of iHRAS at 1.77&#8197;&#197; resolution. The structure reveals that iHRAS folds into a double hairpin. The two double hairpins associate in an antiparallel fashion, forming an i&#8208;motif dimer capped by two loops on each end and linked by a connecting region. Six C&#8722;C+ base pairs form each i&#8208;motif core, and the core regions are extended by a G&#8722;G base pair and a cytosine stacking. Extensive canonical and non&#8208;canonical base pairing and stacking stabilizes the connecting region and loops. The iHRAS structure is the first atomic resolution structure of an i&#8208;motif from a human oncogene. This structure sheds light on i&#8208;motifs folding and function in the cell.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Domain versus Single&#8208;Domain: A Magnetic Field is Not a Must for Promoting Spin&#8208;Polarized Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic catalyst in single&#8208;domain exhibits similar water oxidation performance in the absence of an external magnetic field as does a multi&#8208;domain counterpart under magnetization. The findings tell that an external magnetic field is not the only way to take the benefits of spin&#8208;polarized water oxidation. Reducing the particle size into the single&#8208;domain region can also achieve the same.







Abstract
The reaction kinetics of spin&#8208;polarized oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be enhanced by ferromagnetic (FM) catalysts under an external magnetic field. However, applying a magnetic field necessitates additional energy consumption and creates design difficulties for OER. Herein, we demonstrate that a single&#8208;domain FM catalyst without external magnetic fields exhibits a similar OER increment to its magnetized multi&#8208;domain one. The evidence is given by comparing the pH&#8208;dependent increment of OER on multi&#8208; and single&#8208;domain FM catalysts with or without a magnetic field. The intrinsic activity of a single&#8208;domain catalyst is higher than that of a multi&#8208;domain counterpart. The latter can be promoted to approach the former by the magnetization effect. Reducing the FM catalyst size into the single&#8208;domain region, the spin&#8208;polarized OER performance can be achieved without a magnetic field, illustrating an external magnetic field is not a requirement to reap the benefits of magnetic catalysts.

         <title>Rational Design of the &#946;&#8208;Bulge Gate in a Green Fluorescent Protein Accelerates the Kinetics of Sulfate Sensing
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The serendipitous discovery of an intrinsic fluorescent protein&#8208;based sensor for sulfate called SulfOFF&#8208;1 is reported. This function was unlocked by introducing mutations in a solvent&#8208;exposed region of the fluorescent protein mNeonGreen. An integrated approach encompassing in vitro spectroscopy and in silico modeling provides a comprehensive understanding of the sensor mechanism.







Abstract
Detection of anions in complex aqueous media is a fundamental challenge with practical utility that can be addressed by supramolecular chemistry. Biomolecular hosts such as proteins can be used and adapted as an alternative to synthetic hosts. Here, we report how the mutagenesis of the &#946;&#8208;bulge residues (D137 and W138) in mNeonGreen, a bright, monomeric fluorescent protein, unlocks and tunes the anion preference at physiological pH for sulfate, resulting in the turn&#8208;off sensor SulfOFF&#8208;1. This unprecedented sensing arises from an enhancement in the kinetics of binding, largely driven by position 138. In line with these data, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations capture how the coordinated entry and gating of sulfate into the &#946;&#8208;barrel is eliminated upon mutagenesis to facilitate binding and fluorescence quenching.

         <title>Construction of Chiral Quaternary Carbon Centers via Asymmetric Metal Carbene gem&#8208;Dialkylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines is reported, which leads to poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones with excellent enantioselectivity. This unprecedented metal carbene gem&#8208;dialkylation reaction features a cascade formal asymmetric allylation and aminomethylation process with concomitant construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using readily available materials.







Abstract
The catalytic asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters has received tremendous interest over the past decades, and numerous efficient protocols have been disclosed based on the formation of one C&#8722;C bond between two assembling reactants. However, the use of asymmetric multi&#8208;component reactions that build two C&#8722;C bonds on the same carbonic center with concomitant assembly of quaternary stereocenters is rare and remains challenging. Herein, we disclose an enantioselective three&#8208;component reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazo ketones with alkenes and 1,3,5&#8208;triazines under dirhodium/chiral phosphoric acid cooperative catalysis, which leads to a practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of poly&#8208;functionalized chiral ketones that bear a &#945;&#8208;quaternary stereocenter in generally good to high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. In comparison to the previous method for the construction of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters via carbene gem&#8208;difunctionalization reactions, this reaction features an unprecedented gem&#8208;dialkylation process via sequential installation of two C&#8722;C bonds on the carbene center in one reaction, providing an essential complement to the asymmetric construction of all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenters using common and readily available starting materials.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Aminocyclobutane Monoesters: Synthesis and Silylium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Annulation with Indoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminocyclobutanes are high potential building blocks but have been underexplored. A one&#8208;step synthesis to access them from commercial starting materials was developed. Using these new donor&#8208;acceptor systems, a (4+2) annulation was conducted with indoles using silylium catalysis. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either akuamma or malagasy alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction.







Abstract
A convenient one&#8208;step synthesis of &#946;&#8208;aminocyclobutane monoesters starting from commercially available reagents is reported.

&lt;p&gt;Aminocyclobutanes are high potential building blocks but have been underexplored. A one-step synthesis to access them from commercial starting materials was developed. Using these new donor-acceptor systems, a (4+2) annulation was conducted with indoles using silylium catalysis. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either &lt;i&gt;akuamma&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;malagasy&lt;/i&gt; alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convenient one-step synthesis of &#946;-aminocyclobutane monoesters starting from commercially available reagents is reported. The obtained strained rings undergo (4+2) dearomative annulation with indole partners using silylium catalysis. This organocatalyzed annulation provided tricyclic indolines with four new stereocenters in up to quantitative yield and &amp;gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5 diastereoselectivity and can proceed both intra- and intermolecularly. When performed intramolecularly, the tetracyclic structure of either &lt;i&gt;akuamma&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;malagasy&lt;/i&gt; alkaloids was obtained selectively depending on the temperature of the reaction.

         <title>A Dicyanomethyl Radical Conjugated with a Pyridylamino Group: Combining Radical&#8208;based Dynamic Covalent Chemistry and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group that combines dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) property based on a reversible radical coupling/cleavage reaction and coordination ability to metal ions for the first time. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.







Abstract
In this work, we aimed to develop a dicyanomethyl radical that undergoes both reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation and metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions to combine dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) based on organic radicals with coordination chemistry. We have previously reported a dicyanomethyl radical conjugated with a triphenylamine (1&#8901;) that exhibits a monomer/dimer equilibrium between the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (12). We designed and synthesized a novel dicyanomethyl radical with a pyridyl group as a coordination point (2&#8901;) by replacing the phenyl group of 1&#8901; with a 3&#8208;pyridyl group. We showed that 2&#8901; is also in an equilibrium with the &#963;&#8208;bonded dimer (22) in solution and has suitable thermodynamic parameters for application in DCC. 22 coordinates to PdCl2 in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio to selectively form a metallamacrocycle (22)2(PdCl2)2, and its structure was clarified by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Variable&#8208;temperature NMR, ESR, and electronic absorption measurements revealed that (22)2(PdCl2)2 also undergoes the reversible C&#8722;C bond formation/dissociation reaction. Ligand&#8208;exchange experiment showed that 22 was liberated from (22)2(PdCl2)2 by the addition of another ligand with a higher affinity for PdII. This work demonstrated that DCC based on dicyanomethyl radicals works orthogonally to metal&#8208;ligand coordination reactions.

         <title>Sodium Carbazolide and Derivatives as Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium carbazolide tetrahydrofuran derivatives, a new type of metalorganic&#8208;based materials intended for hydrogen storage, are fabricated and exhibit fast ionic conductivity as high as 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C, respectively, with excellent interfacial stability against Na electrodes. A &#8220;neutral ligand&#8208;assisted&#8221; cation migration mechanism is proposed, providing a new strategy for the design of superionic conductors.







Abstract
Replacing widely used organic liquid electrolytes with solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) could effectively solve the safety issues in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Efforts on seeking novel solid&#8208;state electrolytes have been continued for decades. However, issues about SSEs still exist, such as low ionic conductivity at ambient temperature, difficulty in manufacturing, low electrochemical stability, poor compatibility with electrodes, etc. Here, sodium carbazolide (Na&#8208;CZ) and its THF&#8208;coordinated derivatives are rationally fabricated as Na+ conductors, and two of their crystal structures are successfully solved. Among these materials, THF&#8208;coordinated complexes exhibit fast Na+ conductivities, i.e., 1.20&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 1.95&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C for Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;1THF and Na&#8208;CZ&#8208;2THF, respectively, which are among the top Na+ conductors under the same condition. Furthermore, stable Na plating/stripping is observed even over 400&#8197;h cycling, showing outstanding interfacial stability and compatibility against Na electrode. More advantages such as ease of synthesis, low&#8208;cost, and cold pressing for molding can be obtained. In situ NMR results revealed that the evaporation of THF may play an essential role in the Na+ migration, where the movement of THF creates defects/vacancies and facilitates the migration of Na+.

         <title>Organohydrogels with High&#8208;Speed Lubrication by Confining Polymer Chain Mobility by an Interpenetrated Heteronetwork</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement effect of an oleophilic network limits the mobility of hydrophilic polymer chains on the countersurfaces. This reduces the energy dissipation on stretching polymer chains during shearing, thus decreasing the frictional stress in the high velocity region.







Abstract
Hydrogels with pure hydrophilic network have received much attention due to their excellent low frictional behavior. However, the lubrication performance of hydrogels is not satisfied under high&#8208;speed condition due to the energy dissipation caused by adsorbed polymer chains as well as the failure of lubricating mechanisms accompanied by the transition of lubrication regime. In this work, interpenetrating double&#8208;network organohydrogels were constructed by combining hydrophilic and oleophilic polymer networks to modify the physiochemical properties of surface polymer chains, especially the chain mobility. The oleophilic polymer network spatially restricting the mobility of the swollen hydrophilic network in water, resulted in a low coefficient of friction (ca. 0.01) compared with conventional hydrogels at high speed (0.1&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1). Meanwhile, the organohydrogels had superior wear resistance, with almost no wear observed on the sliding track after 5&#8197;k&#8197;cycles of rubbing at high speed. The design concept of organohydrogels can be extended to a variety of low&#8208;wear, highly&#8208;lubricating materials.

         <title>Constructing Built&#8208;in Electric Field in Heterogeneous Nanowire Arrays for Efficient Overall Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By proposing and fabricating Ni2P&#8208;CoCH heterostructure with large &#916;&#934; as a model catalyst for overall alkaline water electrolysis, the introduction of a strong built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) is successfully realized to create the asymmetrical charge distributions on catalyst surfaces. The negative charge&#8208;enriched Ni2P and positive charge&#8208;enriched CoCH as active sites separately achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities.







Abstract
Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are key to water electrolysis. Herein, we report a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) strategy to fabricate heterogeneous nickel phosphide&#8208;cobalt nanowire arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP) with large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Impressively, Ni2P&#8208;CoCH/CFP exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to obtain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, the assembled lab&#8208;scale electrolyzer driven by an AAA battery delivers excellent stability after 50&#8197;h electrocatalysis with a 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Computational calculations combining with experiments reveal the interface&#8208;induced electric field effect facilitates asymmetrical charge distributions, thereby regulating the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during reactions.

&lt;p&gt;By proposing and fabricating Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P-CoCH heterostructure with large &#916;&#934; as a model catalyst for overall alkaline water electrolysis, the introduction of a strong built-in electric field (BEF) is successfully realized to create the asymmetrical charge distributions on catalyst surfaces. The negative charge-enriched Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P and positive charge-enriched CoCH as active sites separately achieve high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions are key to water electrolysis. Herein, we report a built-in electric field (BEF) strategy to fabricate heterogeneous nickel phosphide-cobalt nanowire arrays grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P-CoCH/CFP) with large work function difference (&#916;&#934;) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Impressively, Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P-CoCH/CFP exhibits a remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions to obtain 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Moreover, the assembled lab-scale electrolyzer driven by an AAA battery delivers excellent stability after 50&#8197;h electrocatalysis with a 100&#8201;% faradic efficiency. Computational calculations combining with experiments reveal the interface-induced electric field effect facilitates asymmetrical charge distributions, thereby regulating the adsorption/desorption of the intermediates during reactions. This work offers an avenue to rationally design high-performance heterogeneous electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Preparation of Solid Solution&#8208;Oxide Heterojunction Photocatalysts through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Transformation Induced Pre&#8208;nucleation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we develop a generally applicable strategy to prepare the solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunction through Metal&#8211;Organic Framework (MOF) transformation induced pre&#8208;nucleation. Our approach involved the transformation of MOFs possessing distinct topologies, leading to the pre&#8208;nucleation of the parent MOF in the form of an oxide within the pores of the daughter MOF. This transformative process was a pivotal step in synthesizing novel heterojunctions comprising solid solutions with significant variations of metal ions (Ce1&#8722;xTixO2) and rare earth oxide (CeO2).







Abstract
Solid solution&#8208;oxide heterostructures combine the advantages of solid solution and heterojunction materials to improve electronic structure and optical properties by metal doping, and enhance charge separation and transfer in semiconductor photocatalysts by creating a built&#8208;in electric field. Nevertheless, the effective design and synthesis of these materials remains a significant challenge. Here, we develop a generally applicable strategy that leverages the transformable properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to prepare solid solution&#8208;oxide heterojunctions with controllable structural and chemical compositions. The process consists of three main steps. First, MOFs with different topological structures and metal centers are transformed, accompanied by pre&#8208;nucleation of a metal oxide. Second, solid solution is prepared through calcination of the transformed MOFs. Finally, a heterojunction is formed by combining solid solution with another metal oxide group through endogenous overflow. DFT calculations and study on carrier dynamics show that the structure of the material effectively prevents electrons from returning to the bulk phase, exhibiting superior photocatalytic reduction performance of CO2. This study is expected to promote the controllable synthesis and research of MOF&#8208;derived heterojunctions.

         <title>Overcoming Diffusion Limitation of Faradaic Processes: Property&#8208;Performance Relationships of 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTP)2 for Reversible Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional MOF, (Cu3(HHTP)2), is synthesized with two different morphologies. Flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like shaped particles were evaluated to investigate the impact of the particle morphology of MOFs on electrochemical Li+ ion storage. By optimization of the particle morphology, diffusion limitation of the Faradaic process can be strongly reduced.







Abstract
Faradaic reactions including charge transfer are often accompanied with diffusion limitation inside the bulk. Conductive two&#8208;dimensional frameworks (2D MOFs) with a fast ion transport can combine both&#8212;charge transfer and fast diffusion inside their porous structure. To study remaining diffusion limitations caused by particle morphology, different synthesis routes of Cu&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (Cu3(HHTP)2), a copper&#8208;based 2D MOF, are used to obtain flake&#8208; and rod&#8208;like MOF particles. Both morphologies are systematically characterized and evaluated for redox&#8208;active Li+ ion storage. The redox mechanism is investigated by means of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and in situ XRD. Both types are compared regarding kinetic properties for Li+ ion storage via cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. A significant influence of particle morphology for 2D MOFs on kinetic aspects of electrochemical Li+ ion storage can be observed. This study opens the path for optimization of redox active porous structures to overcome diffusion limitations of Faradaic processes.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Anion&#8208;Binding Catalytic Living Cationic Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This contribution reports in&#8208;depth mechanistic insight into anion&#8208;binding catalytic living cationic polymerization in which the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalyst and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions in the whole catalytic cycle are elucidated through a combination of theoretical DFT study and experimental study.







Abstract
Exploiting non&#8208;covalent interactions to catalyze challenging ionic polymerizations is an ambitious goal but is in its infancy. We recently demonstrated non&#8208;covalent anion&#8208;binding catalysis as an effective methodology to enable living cationic polymerization (LCP) of vinyl ethers in an environmentally benign manner. Here, we further elucidate the structure&#8208;reactivity relationships of the elaborately designed seleno&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azanes catalysts and the roles of anion&#8208;binding interactions by a combined theoretical DFT study and experimental study. The investigation suggests that the distinct cis&#8208;cyclodiphosph(V)azane framework combined with &#8220;selenium effect&#8221; and electron&#8208;withdrawing 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2&#8208;Phenyl substitution pattern in catalyst enables a critical contribution to accessing excellent stability, anion affinity and solubility under polymerization conditions. Thus, the catalyst could leverage anion&#8208;binding interactions to precisely control reversible and transient dormant&#8208;active species equilibrium, allowing it to dynamically bind, recognize and pre&#8208;organize propagating ionic species and monomer, thereby facilitating efficient chain propagation and minimizing irreversible chain transfer events under mild conditions. The more in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism for anion&#8208;binding catalytic LCP reported herein should help to guide future catalyst design and to extend this concept to broader polymerization systems where ionic species serve as crucial intermediates.

         <title>Enhancing Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia over Cu Nanosheets via Facet Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheet catalyst was developed for electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction. Benefiting from the tandem catalysis of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets, a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. RHE as well as high stability of 700&#8197;h in a flow cell were achieved.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into ammonia (NH3) represents a potential way for achieving carbon&#8208;free NH3 production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high&#8208;performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH3 partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700&#8197;h with NH3 Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;88&#8201;% at 365&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as&#8208;prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO2&#8722; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH3 production.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) into ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) represents a potential way for achieving carbon-free NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production while balancing the nitrogen cycle. Herein we report a high-performance Cu nanosheets catalyst which delivers a NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; partial current density of 665&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 1.41&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a flow cell at &#8722;0.59&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. The catalyst showed a high stability for 700&#8197;h with NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;88&#8201;% at 365&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ spectroscopy results verify that Cu nanosheets are in situ derived from the as-prepared CuO nanosheets under electrochemical NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction reaction conditions. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations indicate that the high performance is attributed to the tandem interaction of Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets. The NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; generated on the Cu(100) facets is subsequently hydrogenated on the Cu(111) facets, thus the tandem catalysis promotes the crucial hydrogenation of *NO to *NOH for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Alcohols and Ketones via Cross&#8208;Coupling of Secondary Alcohols under Manganese Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols in a divergent synthesis of either &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols or &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is herein reported. A wide range of different alcohols could undergo the cross&#8208;coupling process smoothly and furnish the corresponding products by using the same catalyst, with overall moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A homogeneous manganese&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of two secondary alcohols for the divergent synthesis of &#947;&#8208;disubstituted alcohols and &#946;&#8208;disubstituted ketones is reported. Employing the well&#8208;defined Mn&#8208;MACHOPh as the catalyst, this novel protocol has a broad substrate scope with good functional group tolerance and affords a diverse library of valuable disubstituted alcohols and ketones in moderate to good yields. The strong influence of the reaction temperature on the selective formation of alcohol products was theorized in preliminary DFT studies. Studies have shown that the Gibbs free energy of the formation of alcohols is thermodynamically more favourable than corresponding ketones at a lower temperature.

         <title>Exploring Synthetic Strategies for 1H&#8208;Indazoles and Their N&#8208;Oxides: Electrochemical Synthesis of 1H&#8208;Indazole N&#8208;Oxides and Their Divergent C&#8722;H Functionalizations</title>

         <dc:description>
The study reports selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and N&#8208;oxides, where electrochemical outcomes were dictated by the cathode material (RVC=reticulated vitreous carbon). The adaptability of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides for various C&#8722;H functionalization reactions was showcased. Furthermore, 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were utilized to synthesize the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3), key intermediates for various drugs, and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
The selective electrochemical synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazoles and their N&#8208;oxides and the subsequent C&#8722;H functionalization of the 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides are described. The electrochemical outcomes were determined by the nature of the cathode material. When a reticulated vitreous carbon cathode was used, a wide range of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides were selectively synthesized, and the electrosynthesis products were deoxygenated to N&#8208;heteroaromatics, owing to cathodic cleavage of the N&#8722;O bond via paired electrolysis, when a Zn cathode was used. The scope of this electrochemical protocol is broad, as both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor substrates were tolerated. The potency of this electrochemical strategy was demonstrated through the late&#8208;stage functionalization of various bioactive molecules, making this reaction attractive for the synthesis of 1H&#8208;indazole derivatives for pharmaceutical research and development. Detailed mechanistic investigations involving electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry suggested a radical pathway featuring iminoxyl radicals. Owing to the rich reactivity of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides, diverse C&#8722;H functionalization reactions were performed. We demonstrated the synthetic utility of 1H&#8208;indazole N&#8208;oxides by synthesizing the pharmaceutical molecules lificiguat and YD (3); key intermediates for bendazac, benzydamine, norepinephrine/serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SAM&#8208;531, and gamendazole analogues; and a precursor for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Overcoming the Ambient Manufacturability&#8208;Performance Bottleneck in Perovskite Nanocrystal Emitters for Efficient Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crude large&#8208;scale synthesis strategy is proposed to overcome the ambient manufacturability&#8208;performance bottleneck to achieve high&#8208;quality perovskite nanocrystals with strong emission and narrow bandwidth, regardless of humidity or temperature. The resulting nanocrystals capped with PbSP&#8208;dominated shell have low trap and ligand density, facilitating charge&#8208;carrier hopping and tunneling.







Abstract
Colloidal perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have risen rapidly in luminescence efficiency and color purity. However, their high performance requires careful and complex pre&#8208;treatment of precursors and precise regulation of the reaction atmosphere; otherwise, their emission will be weak and broad. To overcome these limitations, we develop a facile ligand exchange method using a new type of bidentate ligand, which is obtained by reacting cheap sulfur with tributylphosphine (S&#8208;TBP). During ligand exchange, the double bond between P and S atoms breaks and a single bond is formed between them, after which S&#8208;TBP switches into a bidentate ligand and binds to a perovskite NC at two points. With short&#8208;chain S&#8208;TBP ligands that have high spatial position resistance, both NC spacing and surface ligand density can be reduced, thereby improving carrier injection and transport. On the NC surface after ligand exchange, halogen vacancies were substantially filled, leading to a PbSP (Pb, S, and P elements) component&#8208;dominated shell that greatly decreases trap density and enhances material stability. The resulting perovskite NCs are stable and bright with a photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;96&#8201;%, and an external quantum efficiency of 22&#8201;%. Note that our ligand&#8208;exchange strategy remains effective even when scaling up, which should accelerate commercialization.

         <title>Molten Salts&#8208;Driven Discovery of a Polar Mixed&#8208;Anion 3D Framework at the Nanoscale: Zn4Si2O7Cl2, Charge Transport and Photoelectrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanowires of the new oxychloride Zn4Si2O7Cl2 crystallize from molten salts as a polar three&#8208;dimensional tetrahedral framework. They exhibit strongly anisotropic charge carrier mobility, adjustable electrical properties, and photoelectrochemical properties for H2 production from water.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;anion compounds widen the chemical space of attainable materials compared to single anionic compounds, but the exploration of their structural diversity is limited by common synthetic paths. Especially, oxychlorides rely mainly on layered structures, which suffer from low stability during photo(electro)catalytic processes. Herein we report a strategy to design a new polar 3D tetrahedral framework with composition Zn4Si2O7Cl2. We use a molten salt medium to enable low temperature crystallization of nanowires of this new compound, by relying on tetrahedral building units present in the melt to build the connectivity of the oxychloride. These units are combined with silicon&#8208;based connectors from a non&#8208;oxidic Zintl phase to enable precise tuning of the oxygen content. This structure brings high chemical and thermal stability, as well as strongly anisotropic hole mobility along the polar axis. These features, associated with the ability to adjust the transport properties by doping, enable to tune water splitting properties for photoelectrocatalytic H2 evolution and water oxidation. This work then paves the way to a new family of mixed&#8208;anion solids

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Efficient Convergent Asymmetric Hydrogenation of E/Z&#8208;Enamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been developed, especially its convergent pattern for E/Z&#8208;substrates. Excellent enantioselectivity, wide substrate scope, and valuable applications were shown.







Abstract
Using the diphosphine&#8208;cobalt&#8208;zinc catalytic system, an efficient asymmetric hydrogenation of internal simple enamides has been realized. In particular, the Ph&#8208;BPE ligand can achieve convergent asymmetric hydrogenation of E/Z&#8208;substrates. High yields and excellent enantioselectivities were obtained for both acyclic and cyclic enamides bearing &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;aryl, and &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl substituents. Hydrogenated products can be applied for the synthesis of useful chiral drugs such as Arfromoterol, Rotigotine, and Norsertraline. In addition, reasonable catalytic mechanism and stereocontrol mode are proposed based on DFT calculations.

         <title>Ultrathin Niobium Carbide MXenzyme for Remedying Hypertension by Antioxidative and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXenzyme shows benign biocompatibility and multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, combatting neurogenic hypertension by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibiting inflammatory response.







Abstract
Hypertension, as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is associated with oxidative stress and impairment of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, but there is still a tremendous knowledge gap between hypertension treatment and nanomedicines. Herein, we report a specific nanozyme based on ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) niobium carbide (Nb2C) MXene, termed Nb2C MXenzyme, to fight against hypertension by achieving highly efficient reactive oxygen species elimination and inflammatory factors inhibition. The biocompatible Nb2C MXenzyme displays multiple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, involving superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and peroxidase, inducing cytoprotective effects by resisting oxidative stress, thereby alleviating inflammatory response and reducing blood pressure, which is systematically demonstrated in a stress&#8208;induced hypertension rat model. This strategy not only opens new opportunities for nanozymes to treat hypertension but also expands the potential biomedical applications of 2D MXene nanosystems.

         <title>Giant Molecule Acceptor Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Processed Using Non&#8208;halogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) EV&#8208;i and EV&#8208;o were synthesized and applied in non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed organic solar cells (OSCs). The EV&#8208;i based OSC exhibits suitable phase separation in active layer, which contributes to a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27&#8201;%, while the EV&#8208;o based OSCs show a poor PCE of 2.50&#8201;% due to its excessive aggregation.







Abstract
High efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs) based on A&#8208;DA&#8242;D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs) were mostly fabricated by toxic halogenated solvent processing, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the non&#8208;halogenated solvent processed OSCs is mainly restricted by the excessive aggregation of the SMAs. To address this issue, we developed two vinyl &#960;&#8208;spacer linking&#8208;site isomerized giant molecule acceptors (GMAs) with the &#960;&#8208;spacer linking on the inner carbon (EV&#8208;i) or out carbon (EV&#8208;o) of benzene end group of the SMA with longer alkyl side chains (ECOD) for the capability of non&#8208;halogenated solvent&#8208;processing. Interestingly, EV&#8208;i possesses a twisted molecular structure but enhanced conjugation, while EV&#8208;o shows a better planar molecular structure but weakened conjugation. The OSC with EV&#8208;i as acceptor processed by the non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) demonstrated a higher PCE of 18.27&#8201;% than that of the devices based on the acceptor of ECOD (16.40&#8201;%) or EV&#8208;o (2.50&#8201;%). 18.27&#8201;% is one of the highest PCEs among the OSCs fabricated from non&#8208;halogenated solvents so far, benefitted from the suitable twisted structure, stronger absorbance and high charge carrier mobility of EV&#8208;i. The results indicate that the GMAs with suitable linking site would be the excellent candidates for fabricating high performance OSCs processed by non&#8208;halogenated solvents.

         <title>Targeted Synthesis of a Highly Stable Aluminium Phosphonate Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Showing Reversible HCl Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protons make the difference. Highly acidic synthesis conditions were employed to synthesize porous MIII&#8208;phosphonates with different degrees of framework protonation. Rapid release of HCl in solution and re&#8208;adsorption from aqueous solution and from the gas phase is demonstrated and structural changes that accompany these processes are elucidated.







Abstract
A concept for obtaining isoreticular compounds with tri&#8208; instead of tetravalent metal cations using highly acidic reaction conditions was developed and successfully applied in a high throughput study using N,N&#8242;&#8208;piperazinebis(methylenephosphonic&#160;acid) (H4PMP), that resulted in the discovery of a new porous aluminium phosphonate denoted CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl. The high&#8208;throughput study was subsequently extended to other trivalent metal ions. Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60&#8901;6&#8201;HCl demonstrates reversible desorption of HCl (18.3&#8197;wt&#8201;% loading) with three distinct compositions observed with zero, four or six HCl molecules per formula unit. Structural changes were followed in detail by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, EDX analysis as well as IR spectroscopy. Rapid desorption of HCl in water within minutes and subsequent adsorption from the gas phase and from aqueous solution are shown. Furthermore, it is possible to adsorb HBr into the guest free Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;60 framework, demonstrating the high stability of this compound.

         <title>An Electrochemical Strategy to Synthesize Disilanes and Oligosilanes from Chlorosilanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Si&#8722;Si bonds is an important transformation in organic synthesis. Herein, we present a unified electrochemical strategy for the efficient and selective synthesis of disilanes, oligosilanes, and cyclosilanes&#8212;which are important precursors for the synthesis of functional organic and polymeric compounds&#8212;from readily available chlorosilanes.







Abstract
Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry.

&lt;p&gt;The formation of Si&#8722;Si bonds is an important transformation in organic synthesis. Herein, we present a unified electrochemical strategy for the efficient and selective synthesis of disilanes, oligosilanes, and cyclosilanes&#8212;which are important precursors for the synthesis of functional organic and polymeric compounds&#8212;from readily available chlorosilanes.

&lt;p&gt;Silanes are important compounds in industrial and synthetic chemistry. Here, we develop a general approach for the synthesis of disilanes as well as linear and cyclic oligosilanes via the reductive activation of readily available chlorosilanes. The efficient and selective generation of silyl anion intermediates, which are arduous to achieve by other means, allows for the synthesis of various novel oligosilanes by heterocoupling. In particular, this work presents a modular synthesis for a variety of functionalized cyclosilanes, which may give rise to materials with distinct properties from linear silanes but remain challenging synthetic targets. In comparison to the traditional Wurtz coupling, our method features milder conditions and improved chemoselectivity, broadening the functional groups that are compatible in oligosilane preparation. Computational studies support a mechanism whereby differential activation of sterically and electronically distinct chlorosilanes are achieved in an electrochemically driven radical-polar crossover mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrarapid Nanomanufacturing of High&#8208;Quality Bimetallic Anode Library toward Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alloy fabrication through tube furnace annealing (TFA) faces many limitations, such as uncontrolled coarsening and volatilization of constituent metals. In this work, we apply an ultrafast high&#8208;temperature radiation (HTR) method to realize the general fabrication of a family of high&#8208;quality bimetallic alloys. The rapid HTR approach could create a new and wide space for broad applications of nano&#8208;sized unique alloys.







Abstract
Bimetallic alloy nanomaterials are promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) due to their high electrochemical performance. The most well&#8208;adopted fabrication method for bimetallic alloy nanomaterials is tube furnace annealing (TFA) synthesis, which can hardly satisfy the trade&#8208;off among granularity, dispersity and grain coarsening due to mutual constraints. Herein, we report a facile, scalable and ultrafast high&#8208;temperature radiation (HTR) method for the fabrication of a library of ultrafine bimetallic alloys with narrow size distribution (&#8776;10&#8211;20&#8197;nm), uniform dispersion and high loading. The metal&#8208;anchor containing heteroatoms (i.e., O and N), ultrarapid heating/cooling rate (&#8776;103&#8197;K&#8201;s&#8722;1) and super&#8208;short heating duration (several seconds) synergistically contribute to the successful synthesis of small&#8208;sized alloy anodes. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the as&#8208;prepared BiSb&#8208;HTR anode shows ultrahigh stability indicated by negligible degradation after 800&#8197;cycles. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals the K+ storage mechanism of BiSb&#8208;HTR. This study can shed light on the new, rapid and scalable nanomanufacturing of high&#8208;quality bimetallic alloys toward extended applications of energy storage, energy conversion and electrocatalysis.

         <title>Defect Pyrochlore&#8208;Type Mott&#8211;Schottky Photocatalysts for Enhanced Ammonia Synthesis at Low Pressure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8722;x was synthesized with visible light absorption and extremely low work function. High&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic ammonia synthesis was achieved at low pressure with excellent catalytic activities. The pyrochlore structure exhibits amazing intrinsic activity, markedly enhances N2 dissociation on Ru, and is expected to be an ideal material for efficient ambient ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The ambient ammonia synthesis coupled with distributed green hydrogen production technology can provide promising solutions for low&#8208;carbon NH3 production and H2 storage. Herein, we reported Ru&#8208;loaded defective pyrochlore K2Ta2O6&#8722;x with remarkable visible&#8208;light absorption and a very low work function, enabling effective visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven ammonia synthesis from N2 and H2 at low pressure down to 0.2&#8197;atm. The photocatalytic rate was 2.8&#8197;times higher than that of the best previously reported photocatalyst and the photo&#8208;thermal rate at 425&#8197;K was similar to that of Ru&#8208;loaded black TiO2 at 633&#8197;K. Compared to perovskite&#8208;type KTaO3&#8722;x with the same composition, the pyrochlore exhibited a 3.7&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity due to a higher photoexcited charge separation efficiency and a higher conduction band position. The interfacial Schottky barrier and spontaneous electron transfer between K2Ta2O6&#8722;x and Ru further improve photoexcited charge separation and accumulate energetic electrons to facilitate N2 activation.

         <title>Photodissociative Modules that Control Dual&#8208;Emission Properties in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Organoborane Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diversity of triarylborane&#8208;based donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores has been increased by extensive tuning of the triarylborane moiety. Herein, ortho&#8208; P(=X)R2&#8208;substituted phenyl groups (X=O or S) are introduced onto a boron atom as a photodissociative module to impart the fluorophores with responsiveness to multiple stimuli or environmental parameters. Precise tuning of the substituents led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores that consist of an electron&#8208;donating amino group and an electron&#8208;accepting triarylborane moiety generally exhibit substantial solvatochromism in their fluorescence while retaining high fluorescence quantum yields even in polar media. Herein, we report a new family of this compound class, which bears ortho&#8208;P(=X)R2&#8208;substituted phenyl groups (X=O or S) as a photodissociative module. The P=X moiety that intramolecularly coordinates to the boron atom undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to dual emission from the corresponding tetra&#8208; and tricoordinate boron species. The susceptibility of the systems to photodissociation depends on the coordination ability of the P=O and P=S moieties, whereby the latter facilitates dissociation. The intensity ratios of the dual emission bands are sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solution polarity, and the viscosity of the medium. Moreover, precise tuning of the P(=X)R2 group and the electron&#8208;donating amino moiety led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Ring&#8208;Opening Hydrophosphinylation of Methylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of methylene cyclopropanes allowed for the synthesis of a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage (up to 96&#8201;% yield and up to 94&#8201;% ee). DFT calculations were performed to support the experimental results and to investigate the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrofunctionalization of methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) has presented a considerable challenge due to the difficult manipulation of regioselectivity and complicated reaction patterns. Herein, we report a straightforward Pd&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;opening hydrophosphinylation reaction of MCPs via highly selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage. This method allows for rapid and efficient access to a wide range of chiral allylic phosphine oxides in good yields and high enantioselectivities. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.

Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and the origin of enantioselectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Peptide Nanostructures Regulate Catalytic Efficiency and Selectivity</title>

Peptide&#8208;based supramolecular nanostructures can mimic the activity and 3&#8208;dimensional complexity of enzymes. We report three tetrapeptides with the same amino acids but in different orders that self&#8208;assemble into unique nanostructures, and we find that their supramolecular morphology influences enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations reveal how histidine residues clustered in hydrophobic pockets influence their catalytic activity.







Abstract
We report three constitutionally isomeric tetrapeptides, each comprising one glutamic acid (E) residue, one histidine (H) residue, and two lysine (KS) residues functionalized with side&#8208;chain hydrophobic S&#8208;aroylthiooxime (SATO) groups. Depending on the order of amino acids, these amphiphilic peptides self&#8208;assembled in aqueous solution into different nanostructures:nanoribbons, a mixture of nanotoroids and nanoribbons, or nanocoils. Each nanostructure catalyzed hydrolysis of a model substrate, with the nanocoils exhibiting the greatest rate enhancement and the highest enzymatic efficiency. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulations, analyzed with unsupervised machine learning, revealed clusters of H residues in hydrophobic pockets along the outer edge of the nanocoils, providing insight for the observed catalytic rate enhancement. Finally, all three supramolecular nanostructures catalyzed hydrolysis of the l&#8208;substrate only when a pair of enantiomeric Boc&#8208;l/d&#8208;Phe&#8208;ONp substrates were tested. This study highlights how subtle molecular&#8208;level changes can influence supramolecular nanostructures, and ultimately affect catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Dual Recycling of Depolymerization Catalyst and Biodegradable Polyester that Markedly Outperforms Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual recycling of the potent depolymerization catalyst PMA and biodegradable polyester PVL that largely outperforms commodity polyolefins has been achieved. The chemical recycling of PVL in bulk phase is performed under mild temperature of only 100&#8201;&#176;C, recovering the pure monomer in quantitative yield for closed&#8208;loop recycling and the depolymerization catalyst that can be reused repeatedly without loss of activity and efficiency.







Abstract
Chemically recyclable, circular polymers continue to attract increasing attention, but rendering both catalysts for depolymerization and high&#8208;performance polymers recyclable is a more sustainable yet challenging goal. Here we introduce a dual catalyst/polymer recycling system in that recyclable inorganic phosphomolybdic acid catalyzes selective depolymerization of high&#8208;ceiling&#8208;temperature biodegradable poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) in bulk phase, which, upon reaching suitable molecular weight, exhibits outstanding mechanical performance with a high tensile strength of &#8776;66.6&#8197;MPa, fracture strain of &#8776;904&#8201;%, and toughness of &#8776;308&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3, and thus markedly outperforms commodity polyolefins, recovering its monomer in pure state and quantitative yield at only 100&#8201;&#176;C. In sharp contrast, the uncatalyzed depolymerization not only requires a high temperature of &gt;310&#8201;&#176;C but is also low yielding and non&#8208;selective. Importantly, the recovered monomer can be repolymerized as is to reproduce the same polymer, thereby closing the circular loop, and the recycled catalyst can be reused repeatedly for depolymerization runs without loss of its catalytic activity and efficiency.

         <title>Electrically Conductive &#960;&#8208;Intercalated Graphitic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Containing Alternate &#960;&#8208;Donor/Acceptor Stacks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy afforded the first &#960;&#8208;intercalated 2D graphitic metal&#8211;organic framework (iGMOF) containing alternate &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor stacks of metal&#8208;coordinated &#960;&#8208;donor ligands and non&#8208;coordinatively intercalated planar &#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules, which displayed an impressive bulk electrical conductivity (&#8776;30&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1) thanks to its simultaneous in&#8208;plane through&#8208;bond and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane through &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor stacks charge transport capabilities.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional graphitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GMOF) often display impressive electrical conductivity chiefly due to efficient through&#8208;bond in&#8208;plane charge transport, however, less efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane conduction across the stacked layers creates large disparity between two orthogonal conduction pathways and dampens their bulk conductivity. To address this issue and engineer higher bulk conductivity in 2D GMOFs, we have constructed via an elegant bottom&#8208;up method the first &#960;&#8208;intercalated GMOF (iGMOF1) featuring built&#8208;in alternate &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor (&#960;&#8208;D/A) stacks of CuII&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) ligands and non&#8208;coordinatively intercalated &#960;&#8208;acidic hexacyano&#8208;triphenylene (HCTP) molecules, which facilitated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport while the hexagonal Cu3(HATP)2 scaffold maintained in&#8208;plane conduction. As a result, iGMOF1 attained an order of magnitude higher bulk electrical conductivity and much smaller activation energy than Cu3(HATP)2 (&#963;=25 vs. 2&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1, Ea=36 vs. 65&#8197;meV), demostrating that simultaneous in&#8208;plane (through&#8208;bond) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (through &#960;D/A stacks) charge transport can generate higher electrical conductivity in novel iGMOFs.

         <title>I3&#8722;/I&#8722; Redox Reaction&#8208;mediated Organic Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries with Accelerated Kinetics and Long Shelf Lives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox mediators (RMs) have been introduced in organic Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) to solve the sluggish kinetics and short shelf lives issues that have been plaguing ZABs long&#8208;lastingly. Based on the chemical oxidation of I3&#8722; and catalytic effect of I&#8722;, our ZABs show accelerated kinetics and long shelf lives in open air.







Abstract
The storage time of Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) for practical implementation have been neglected long&#8208;lastingly. ZABs based on organic solvents promise long shelf lives but suffer from sluggish kinetics. Here, we report a longly storable ZAB with accelerated kinetics mediated by I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox. In the charge process, the electrooxidation of Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#8901;H2O is accelerated by I3&#8722; chemical oxidation. In the discharge process, I&#8722; adsorbed on the electrocatalyst changes the energy level of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Benefitting from these advantages, the prepared ZAB shows remarkably improved round&#8208;trip efficiency (56.03&#8201;% vs. 30.97&#8201;% without the mediator), and long&#8208;term cycling time (&gt;2600&#8197;h) in ambient air without replacing any components or applying any protective treatment to Zn anode and electrocatalyst. After resting for 30&#8197;days without any protection, it can still directly discharge continuously for 32.5&#8197;h and charge/discharge very stably for 2200&#8197;h (440&#8197;cycles), which is evidently superior to aqueous ZABs (only 0/0.25&#8197;h, and 50/25&#8197;h (10/5&#8197;cycles) by mild/alkaline electrolyte replenishment). This study provides a strategy to solve both storage and sluggish kinetics issues that have been plaguing ZABs for centuries, opening up a new avenue to the industrial application of ZABs.

After resting for 30&#8197;days without any protection, it can still directly discharge continuously for 32.5&#8197;h and charge/discharge very stably for 2200&#8197;h (440&#8197;cycles), which is evidently superior to aqueous ZABs (only 0/0.25&#8197;h, and 50/25&#8197;h (10/5&#8197;cycles) by mild/alkaline electrolyte replenishment). This study provides a strategy to solve both storage and sluggish kinetics issues that have been plaguing ZABs for centuries, opening up a new avenue to the industrial application of ZABs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Essential Amino Acids from Nitric Oxide Using Atomically Dispersed Fe on N&#8208;doped Carbon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creative strategy is established to convert NOx from exhaust gas and nitrate&#8208;laden wastewater into amino acids by electrochemistry with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon. It is significantly important for NOx removal and efficient activated hydrogen utilization from water splitting directly to synthesize high&#8208;value nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds.







Abstract
How to transfer industrial exhaust gases of nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;values product is significantly important and challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an innovative method for artificial synthesis of essential &#945;&#8208;amino acids from nitric oxide (NO) by reacting with &#945;&#8208;keto acids through electrocatalytic process with atomically dispersed Fe supported on N&#8208;doped carbon matrix (AD&#8208;Fe/NC) as the catalyst. A yield of valine with 32.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;mgcat&#8722;1 is delivered at &#8722;0.6&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, corresponding a selectivity of 11.3&#8201;%. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and synchrotron radiation infrared spectroscopy analyses show that NO as nitrogen source converted to hydroxylamine that promptly nucleophilic attacked on the electrophilic carbon center of &#945;&#8208;keto acid to form oxime and subsequent reductive hydrogenation occurred on the way to amino acid. Over 6 kinds of &#945;&#8208;amino acids have been successfully synthesized and gaseous nitrogen source can be also replaced by liquid nitrogen source (NO3&#8722;). Our findings not only provide a creative method for converting nitrogen oxides into high&#8208;valued products, which is of epoch&#8208;making significance towards artificial synthesis of amino acids, but also benefit in deploying near&#8208;zero&#8208;emission technologies for global environmental and economic development.

         <title>Direct Arylation of Silicon Nanocrystals with Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;Derived Benzynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metal&#8208;free arylation reagents are reported for the functionalization of silicon nanocrystals. Benzyne derivatives formed via a hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction effectively cleave Si&#8722;H bonds and yield benzenoid&#8208;passivated silicon surfaces under mild conditions.







Abstract
Colloidal silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have garnered significant interest in optoelectronics and biomedical applications. Direct arylation provides pathways to enhance the solution processability of particles and manipulate the photophysical and electronic properties of SiNCs. Unfortunately, existing methods employed to prepare aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs are based on organometallic coupling or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed strategies, which require metal&#8208;based reagents for preactivation or the precursors and complicated post&#8208;treatment processes for product purification. Herein, we demonstrate a metal&#8208;free method that directly functionalizes SiNCs with aryl&#8208;based ligands. We design a series of benzyne derivatives formed from the thermal cyclization of predesigned alkynes, allowing efficient arylation on hydride&#8208;terminated silicon surfaces under mild conditions. These aryl&#8208;functionalized SiNCs exhibit strong blue emissions with nanosecond&#8208;scaled decay, suggesting the formation of a new radiative recombination channel on SiNC surfaces.

         <title>Trialkoxysilane Exchange: Scope, Mechanism, Cryptates and pH&#8208;Response</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exchange reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols typically requires very harsh conditions and has therefore not been used for the self&#8208;assembly of host&#8208;guest systems. In this work, unexpected solvent and salt effects are described, rationalized and exploited for the synthesis of degradable supramolecular hosts.







Abstract
The dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) of the Si&#8722;O bond holds unique opportunities, but has rarely been employed to assemble discrete molecular architectures. This may be due to the harsh conditions required to initiate exchange reactions at silicon in aprotic solvents. Herein, we provide a comprehensive experimental and computational account on the reaction of trialkoxysilanes with alcohols and identify mild conditions for rapid exchange in aprotic solvents. Substituent, solvent and salt effects are uncovered, understood and exploited for the construction of sila&#8208;orthoester cryptates. A sharp, divergent pH&#8208;response of the obtained cages renders this substance class attractive for future applications well beyond host&#8208;guest chemistry, for instance, in drug delivery.

         <title>&#945;&#8208;Lactam Electrophiles for Covalent Chemical Biology
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here an &#945;&#8208;lactam electrophile that is tolerant of aqueous buffers and reacts with biologically relevant nucleophiles. Additionally, the compound efficiently targets and inhibits the serine hydrolase enzymes CES1/2 in HepG2 cells and cell lysate. The unique reactivity of &#945;&#8208;lactams suggests many potential applications of this new warhead&#8208;class within covalent chemical biology.







Abstract
Electrophilic groups are one of the key pillars of contemporary chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. For instance, 3&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds&#8212;such as aziridines, azirines, and oxaziridines&#8212;possess unique electronic and structural properties which underlie their potential and applicability as covalent tools. The &#945;&#8208;lactams are also members of this group of compounds, however, their utility within the field remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate an &#945;&#8208;lactam reagent (AM2) that is tolerant to aqueous buffers while being reactive towards biologically relevant nucleophiles. Interestingly, carboxylesterases&#8197;1 and 2 (CES1/2), both serine hydrolases with key roles in endo&#8208; and xenobiotic metabolism, were found as primary covalent targets for AM2 in HepG2 liver cancer cells. All in all, this study constitutes the starting point for the further development and exploration of &#945;&#8208;lactam&#8208;based electrophilic probes in covalent chemical biology.

         <dc:description>
A method for the C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) of bromo(iodo)arenes with 3&#176;, 2&#176;, and 1&#176;alkyl bromides is reported. This mild XEC displays a broad scope with demonstrated functional group tolerance and finds use in the streamlined preparation of synthetically challenging bioactive compounds.

Despite several methodologies established for C(sp2)&#8722;I selective C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formations, achieving arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons by cross&#8208;coupling of tertiary alkyl precursors with bromo(iodo)arenes in a C(sp2)&#8722;I selective manner is rare. Here we report a general Ni&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;I selective cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) reaction, in which, beyond 3&#176; alkyl bromides (for constructing arene&#8208;flanked quaternary carbons), 2&#176; and 1&#176; alkyl bromides are also demonstrated to be viable coupling partners. Moreover, this mild XEC displays excellent C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and functional group compatibility. The practicality of this XEC is demonstrated in simplifying the routes to several medicinally relevant and synthetically challenging compounds. Extensive experiments show that the terpyridine&#8208;ligated NiI halide can exclusively activate alkyl bromides, forming a NiI&#8722;alkyl complex through a Zn reduction. Attendant density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal two different pathways for the oxidative addition of the NiI&#8722;alkyl complex to the C(sp2)&#8722;I bond of bromo(iodo)arenes, explaining both the high C(sp2)&#8722;I selectivity and generality of our XEC.

         <title>Electron Acceptor Molecule Doping Induced &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interaction to Promote Charge Transport Kinetics for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene is utilized to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to facilitate carrier transportation. It effectively reduces defect density and optimizes energy level alignment. As a result, the 2D/3D perovskite solar cell achieves a champion PCE of up to 24.01&#8201;% coupled with greatly strengthened environmental stability.







Abstract
Although the incorporation of 2D perovskite into 3D perovskite can greatly enhance intrinsic stability, power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2D/3D perovskite is still inferior to its 3D counterpart due to poor carrier transport kinetics resulted from the quantum and dielectric confinement of 2D component. To overcome this issue, the electron acceptor molecule 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) was introduced to trigger intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction in 2D perovskite along with the electronic doping of 2D/3D perovskite to improve charge transfer efficiency. By virtue of high electron affinity, TCNB can undergo electron transfer reaction and subsequently establish &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction with 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium (NMA) cations, greatly strengthening lattice rigidity and reducing exciton binding energy. Transmission electron microscopy results demonstrate that 2D phases are mainly distributed at grain boundaries, reducing defect density and weakening nonradiative recombination. Meanwhile, the p&#8208;type doping of perovskite by TCNB optimizes energy level alignment at perovskite/hole transport layer interface. Consequently, PCE of champion device is significantly boosted to 24.01&#8201;%. The unencapsulated device retains an initial efficiency close to 94&#8201;% after exposure to ambient environment for over 1000&#8197;h. This work paves a novel path for designing new mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite solar cells with high PCE and superior stability.

         <title>Kinetic Control via Binding Sites within the Confined Space of Metal Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Frameworks for Enhanced Shape&#8208;Selectivity Catalysis</title>

Shape&#8208;selective catalysis is enabled by a steric, kinetic&#8208;control strategy based on the substrate being anchored on the internal wall of an adjustable pore space in porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs).







Abstract
One striking feature of enzyme is its controllable ability to trap substrates via synergistic or cooperative binding in the enzymatic pocket, which renders the shape&#8208;selectivity of product by the confined spatial environment. The success of shape&#8208;selective catalysis relies on the ability of enzyme to tune the thermodynamics and kinetics for chemical reactions. In emulation of enzyme's ability, we showcase herein a targeting strategy with the substrate being anchored on the internal pore wall of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), taking full advantage of the sterically kinetic control to achieve shape&#8208;selectivity for the reactions. For this purpose, a series of binding site&#8208;accessible metal metalloporphyrin&#8208;frameworks (MMPFs) have been investigated to shed light on the nature of enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. They exhibit a different density of binding sites that are well arranged into the nanospace with corresponding distances of opposite binding sites. Such a structural specificity results in a facile switch in selectivity from an exclusive formation of the thermodynamically stable product to the kinetic product. Thus, the proposed targeting strategy, based on the combination of porous materials and binding events, paves a new way to develop highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for shifting selectivity.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Alkyne Hydrocyanation toward Ligand&#8208;Controlled Stereodivergent Synthesis of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;Trisubstituted Acrylonitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various trisubstituted E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitriles have been successfully synthesized from the same starting material via a ligand&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed stereodivergent hydrocyanation reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations indicate that Z&#8208;acrylonitriles were obtained by a sequential hydrocyanation/geometric isomerization (E to Z) pathway.







Abstract
We herein describe a palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of propiolamides for the stereodivergent synthesis of trisubstituted acrylonitriles. This synthetic method tolerated various primary, secondary and tertiary propiolamides. The cautious selection of a suitable ligand is essential to the success of this stereodivergent process. Control experiments indicate the intermediacy of E&#8208;acrylonitriles, which lead to Z&#8208;acrylonitriles via isomerization. The density functional theory calculations suggests that the bidentate ligand L2 enables a feasible cyclometallation/isomerization pathway for the E to Z isomerization, while the monodentate ligand L1 inhibits the isomerization, leading to divergent stereoselectivity. The usefulness of this method can be demonstrated by the readily derivatization of products to give various E&#8208; and Z&#8208;trisubstituted alkenes. In addition, the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;acrylonitrile products have also been successfully employed in cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Selective Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO Mediated by Silver Single Atoms Anchored on Tubular Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag single atoms anchored on hollow porous polygonal tubular carbon nitride (Ag1@PCN) form a catalyst with strong metal&#8211;support interactions. Ag&#8722;N3 exhibits enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity and high CO selectivity due to favorable *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, and the dynamic transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between PCN and the Ag single atoms.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into fuels and value&#8208;added chemical products. However, photocatalysts usually suffered from low activity and product selectivity due to the sluggish dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers. Herein, we describe anchoring of Ag single atoms on hollow porous polygonal C3N4 nanotubes (PCN) to form the photocatalyst Ag1@PCN with Ag&#8722;N3 coordination for CO2 photoreduction using H2O as the reductant. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag1@PCN exhibits a high CO production rate of 0.32&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (mass of catalyst: 2&#8197;mg), a high selectivity (&gt;94&#8201;%), and an excellent stability in the long term. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) reveal that the strong metal&#8211;support interactions (Ag&#8722;N3) favor *CO2 adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, and accelerate dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers between C3N4 and Ag single atoms, thereby accounting for the enhanced CO2 photoreduction activity with a high CO selectivity. This work provides a deep insight into the important role of strong metal&#8211;support interactions in enhancing the photoactivity and CO selectivity of CO2 photoreduction.

&lt;p&gt;Ag single atoms anchored on hollow porous polygonal tubular carbon nitride (Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;@PCN) form a catalyst with strong metal&#8211;support interactions. Ag&#8722;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction activity and high CO selectivity due to favorable *CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, *COOH generation and desorption, and the dynamic transfer of photogenerated charge carriers between PCN and the Ag single atoms.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial photosynthesis is a promising strategy for converting carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into fuels and value-added chemical products. However, photocatalysts usually suffered from low activity and product selectivity due to the sluggish dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers.

         <title>Selective Functionalisation of 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalisation of the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine is achieved by xanthone&#8208;catalysed photoredox catalysis. The specific nature of the functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine on ribonucleic acid (RNA) was used to install a Halo&#8208;Tag reactive handle which enabled the chemical enrichment of 5&#8208;methylcytosine containing RNA.







Abstract
The epigenetic modification 5&#8208;methylcytosine plays a vital role in development, cell specific gene expression and disease states. The selective chemical modification of the 5&#8208;methylcytosine methyl group is challenging. Currently, no such chemistry exists. Direct functionalisation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine would improve the detection and study of this epigenetic feature. We report a xanthone&#8208;photosensitised process that introduces a 4&#8208;pyridine modification at a C(sp3)&#8722;H bond in the methyl group of 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We propose a reaction mechanism for this type of reaction based on density functional calculations and apply transition state analysis to rationalise differences in observed reaction efficiencies between cyanopyridine derivatives. The reaction is initiated by single electron oxidation of 5&#8208;methylcytosine followed by deprotonation to generate the methyl group radical. Cross coupling of the methyl radical with 4&#8208;cyanopyridine installs a 4&#8208;pyridine label at 5&#8208;methylcytosine. We demonstrate use of the pyridination reaction to enrich 5&#8208;methylcytosine&#8208;containing ribonucleic acid.

         <title>Dual Microenvironment Modulation of Pd Nanoparticles in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PdCu2 nanoparticles are incorporated into isoreticular COFs, namely, MF&#8722;X (X=&#8722;CH3, &#8722;H, &#8722;CF3 and &#8722;CN), for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, where PdCu2@MF&#8722;CH3 exhibits the best catalytic performance. The dual modulation of the Pd microenvironment turns out to be crucial: the Cu species (primary microenvironment) improves the selectivity, while the engineered pore walls around PdCu2 sites (secondary microenvironment) optimize the activity.







Abstract
The chemical microenvironment modulation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) holds promise for tackling the long&#8208;lasting challenge of the trade&#8208;off effect between activity and selectivity in catalysis. Herein, ultrafine PdCu2 NPs incorporated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with diverse groups on their pore walls have been fabricated for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Cu species, as the primary microenvironment of Pd active sites, greatly improves the selectivity. The functional groups as the secondary microenvironment around PdCu2 NPs effectively regulate the activity, in which PdCu2 NPs encapsulated in the COF bearing &#8722;CH3 groups exhibit the highest activity with &gt;99&#8201;% conversion and 97&#8201;% selectivity. Both experimental and calculation results suggest that the functional group affects the electron&#8208;donating ability of the COFs, which successively impacts the charge transfer between COFs and Pd sites, giving rise to a modulated Pd electronic state and excellent catalytic performance.

         <dc:description>
A series of rare Co&#8722;Nb&#8208;based core&#8211;shell polyoxometalates containing 50, 54, 62 and 87 metal polyhedra is prepared. The cobalt oxide cores correspond to increasingly large molecular analogues of infinite cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. They are the largest cobalt polyoxoniobates and the polyoxometalates with the greatest number of Co ions and the highest&#8208;nuclearity cobalt clusters known thus far. They are shown to be efficient photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Only rarely have polyoxometalates been found to form core&#8211;shell nanoclusters. Here, we succeeded in isolating a series of rare giant and all&#8208;inorganic core&#8211;shell cobalt polyoxoniobates (Co&#8722;PONbs) with diverse shapes, nuclearities and original topologies, including 50&#8208;nuclearity {Co12Nb38O132}, 54&#8208;nuclearity {Co20Nb34O128}, 62&#8208;nuclearity {Co26Nb36O140} and 87&#8208;nuclearity {Co33Nb54O188}. They are the largest Co&#8722;PONbs and also the polyoxometalates containing the greatest number of Co ions and the largest cobalt clusters known thus far. These molecular Co&#8722;PONbs have intriguing and atomically precise core&#8211;shell architectures comprising unique cobalt oxide cores and niobate oxide shells. In particular, the encapsulated cobalt oxide cores with different nuclearities have identical compositions, structures and mixed&#8208;valence Co3+/Co2+ states as the different sized Co&#8722;O moieties of the bulk cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4, suggesting that they can serve as various molecular models of the cubic&#8208;spinel Co3O4. The successful construction of the series of the Co&#8722;PONbs reveals a feasible and versatile synthetic method for making rare core&#8211;shell heterometallic PONbs. Further, these new&#8208;type core&#8211;shell bimetal species are promising cluster molecular catalysts for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction.

A tough and self&#8208;healable elastomer is prepared through a strategy by combining quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxane dual crosslinks. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation and low&#8208;field solid state 1H&#8197;NMR confirmed the combined effect. Highly stretchable conductors based on the elastomers provide great potential for stretchable and tough electronic devices.







Abstract
Tough and self&#8208;healable substrates can enable stretchable electronics long service life. However, for substrates, it still remains a challenge to achieve both high toughness and autonomous self&#8208;healing ability at room temperature. Herein, a strategy by using the combined effects between quadruple H&#8208;bonding and slidable cross&#8208;links is proposed to solve the above issues in the elastomer. The elastomer exhibits high toughness (77.3&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), fracture energy (&#8776;127.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;m&#8722;2), and good healing efficiency (91&#8201;%) at room temperature. The superior performance is ascribed to the inter and intra crosslinking structures of quadruple H&#8208;bonding and polyrotaxanes in the dual crosslinking system. Strain&#8208;induced crystallization of PEG in polyrotaxanes also contributes to the high fracture energy of the elastomers. Furthermore, based on the dual cross&#8208;linked supramolecular elastomer, a highly stretchable and self&#8208;healable electrode containing liquid metal is also fabricated, retaining resistance stability (0.16&#8211;0.26&#8197;&#937;) even at the strain of 1600&#8201;%.

         <title>Reactive Polymer as Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interface for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive surrogate polymer containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties is developed, that can form an artificial polymeric SEI (APSEI) in situ with lithium metal anodes. This APSEI greatly facilitates the induction of uniform deposition of lithium ions while suppressing the growth of lithium dendrites. The APSEI significantly improved the performance of lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes have the highest theoretical capacity and lowest electrochemical potential making them ideal for Li metal batteries (LMBs). However, Li dendrite formation on the anode impedes the proper discharge capacity and practical cycle life of LMBs, particularly in carbonate electrolytes. Herein, we developed a reactive alternative polymer named P(St&#8208;MaI) containing carboxylic acid and cyclic ether moieties which would in situ form artificial polymeric solid electrolyte interface (SEI) with Li. This SEI can accommodate volume changes and maintain good interfacial contact. The presence of carboxylic acid and cyclic ether pendant groups greatly contribute to the induction of uniform Li ion deposition. In addition, the presence of benzyl rings makes the polymer have a certain mechanical strength and plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the symmetric Li||Li cell with P(St&#8208;MaI)@Li layer can stably cycle for over 900&#8197;h under 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 without polarization voltage increasing, while their Li||LiFePO4 full batteries maintain high capacity retention of 96&#8201;% after 930 cycles at 1C in carbonate electrolytes. The innovative strategy of artificial SEI is broadly applicable in designing new materials to inhibit Li dendrite growth on Li metal anodes.

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Unbiased C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds: Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of 1&#8208;Bromoalkynes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular insertion reaction of strictly unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is described. The reaction uses readily available starting materials and benefits from extremely simple reaction conditions. A library of structurally diverse scaffolds bearing a C(sp2)&#8722;Br bond has been obtained. In addition, an original reaction pathway in gold catalysis involving a concerted insertion on a gold&#8208;stabilized vinylcation has been disclosed.







Abstract
Selective functionalization of non&#8208;activated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is a major challenge in chemistry, so functional groups are often used to enhance reactivity. Here, we present a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of 1&#8208;bromoalkynes without any sort of electronic, or conformational bias. The reaction proceeds regiospecifically and stereospecifically to the corresponding bromocyclopentene derivatives. The latter can be readily modified, comprising an excellent library of diverse 3D scaffolds for medicinal chemistry. In addition, a mechanistic study has shown that the reaction proceeds via a so far unknown mechanism: a concerted [1,5]&#8208;H shift / C&#8722;C bond formation involving a gold&#8208;stabilized vinylcation&#8208;like transition state.

         <title>Yolk&#8208;Shell Nanostars@Metal Organic Frameworks as Molecular Sieves for Optical Sensing and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous yolk shells consisting of a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) were prepared. This configuration shows improved colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, displays interesting synergy with gold for application in photocatalysis and presents a strong optical activity for use as SERS sensors.







Abstract
Hybrid composites between nanoparticles and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been described as optimal materials for a wide range of applications in optical sensing, drug delivery, pollutant removal or catalysis. These materials are usually core&#8208;shell single&#8208; or multi&#8208;nanoparticles, restricting the inorganic surface available for reaction. Here, we develop a method for the preparation of yolk&#8208;shells consisting in a plasmonic gold nanostar coated with MOF. This configuration shows more colloidal stability, can sieve different molecules based on their size or charge, seems to show some interesting synergy with gold for their application in photocatalysis and present strong optical activity to be used as SERS sensors.

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Modified Covalent Organic Frameworks Enabling Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Generation via One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By accelerating the separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs, enhancing the protonation of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and promoting the O2 adsorption in a &#8220;side&#8208;on&#8221; Yeager&#8208;type with enhanced adsorption energy, FS&#8208;COFs alter the photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route to the one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; route, achieving efficient hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation.







Abstract
Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers a promising hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthetic strategy, especially the one&#8208;step two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) ORR route holds great potential in achieving highly efficient and selectivity. However, efficient one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR is rarely harvested and the underlying mechanism for regulating the ORR pathways remains greatly obscure. Here, by loading sulfone units into covalent organic frameworks (FS&#8208;COFs), we present an efficient photocatalyst for H2O2 generation via one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR from pure water and air. Under visible light irradiation, FS&#8208;COFs exert a superb H2O2 yield of 3904.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1, outperforming most reported metal&#8208;free catalysts under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron&#8208;hole (e&#8722;&#8208;h+) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O2 adsorption in the Yeager&#8208;type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR to the one&#8208;step one, thereby achieving efficient H2O2 generation with high selectivity.

Here, by loading sulfone units into covalent organic frameworks (FS-COFs), we present an efficient photocatalyst for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation via one-step 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR from pure water and air. Under visible light irradiation, FS-COFs exert a superb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 3904.2&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming most reported metal-free catalysts under similar conditions. Experimental and theoretical investigation reveals that the sulfone units accelerate the separation of photoinduced electron-hole (e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) pairs, enhance the protonation of COFs, and promote O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption in the Yeager-type, which jointly alters the reaction process from two-step 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR to the one-step one, thereby achieving efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation with high selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insertion of Chemical Handles into the Backbone of DNA during Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis by Oxidative Coupling of Amines to Phosphites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible and inexpensive method for linking chemical handles to the backbone of oligonucleotides during solid&#8208;phase synthesis was developed. Primary or secondary amines are linked to positions where a tert&#8208;butyl phosphoramidite is inserted by an oxidative coupling using iodine to obtain the desired phosphoramidate. With this method different functional groups such as azides, alkynes, amines were inserted as chemical handles.







Abstract
Conjugation of molecules or proteins to oligonucleotides can improve their functional and therapeutic capacity. However, such modifications are often limited to the 5&#8242; and 3&#8242; end of oligonucleotides. Herein, we report the development of an inexpensive and simple method that allows for the insertion of chemical handles into the backbone of oligonucleotides. This method is compatible with standardized automated solid&#8208;phase oligonucleotide synthesis, and relies on formation of phosphoramidates. A unique phosphoramidite is incorporated into a growing oligonucleotide, and oxidized to the desired phosphoramidate using iodine and an amine of choice. Azides, alkynes, amines, and alkanes have been linked to oligonucleotides via internally positioned phosphoramidates with oxidative coupling yields above 80&#8201;%. We show the design of phosphoramidates from secondary amines that specifically hydrolyze to the phosphate only at decreased pH. Finally, we show the synthesis of an antibody&#8208;DNA conjugate, where the oligonucleotide can be selectively released in a pH&#8197;5.5 buffer.

         <title>Fabrication of Photoprocessable Materials via Photopolymerization Using an Acid&#8208;Induced Photocleavable Platinum&#8208;Acetylide Crosslinker</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for the precise molding and tuning of polymer materials; however, they are incompatible with single materials because of their conflicting reactivity. Herein, the acid&#8208;induced photocleavage of a platinum&#8211;acetylide crosslinker allows the fabrication of materials via photopolymerization with 365&#8208;nm UV light as well as photoprocessing with 365&#8208;nm UV light under acidic conditions.







Abstract
Photopolymerization and photoprocessing are core technologies for molding and tuning polymer materials. However, they are incompatible with single materials owing to their contradictory photoreactivity. Herein, an acid&#8208;induced photocleavable crosslinker, a platinum&#8211;acetylide complex covered by permethylated cyclodextrins, enables the fabrication of photoprocessable materials via photopolymerization with N&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)acrylamide. The polymer networks are molded by 365&#8197;nm irradiation as well as softened and degraded by a cooperative reaction with HCl as an acidic additive under 365&#8197;nm UV light, or 470&#8197;nm visible light in the presence of a photosensitizer. Moreover, the crosslinker is applied to a photoadhesive triggered by 365&#8197;nm irradiation. The adhesion is detachable on&#8208;demand through acid&#8208;induced photodegradation with the same wavelength and intensity of irradiation. Thus, acid&#8208;induced photocleavage allows the integration of light&#8208;induced molding and processing under various lights of various wavelengths, opening up new strategies for polymer technologies.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Difunctionalization of Nonactivated Alkenes for Double meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>

The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes for double meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H transformations was achieved by metalla&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and &#963;&#8208;activation, featuring excellent site&#8208; and regio&#8208;selectivity, along with ample scope.







Abstract
Twofold distal C&#8722;H functionalization was accomplished by difunctionalization of nonactivated alkenes to provide rapid access to multifunctionalized molecules. The multicomponent ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed remote 1,n&#8208;difunctionalization (n=6,7) of nonactivated alkenes with fluoroalkyl halides and heteroarenes in a modular manner is reported. The meta&#8208;C(sp2)&#8722;H/C&#8208;6(sp3)&#8722;H distal functionalization featured mild conditions, unique selectivity, and broad substrate scope with a domino process for twofold remote C(sp2)&#8722;H/C(sp3)&#8722;H activation of the sequential formation of three different carbon&#8208;centered radicals. A plausible mechanism was proposed based on detailed experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Chemically Recyclable Dithioacetal Polymers via Reversible Entropy&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization
</title>

         <dc:description>
Polydithioacetals depolymerize to a mixture of macrocycles that regenerates the parent polymers via entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization. When crosslinked, they demonstrate covalent adaptable network (CAN) behavior at elevated temperatures. The swollen CANs are also depolymerizable to macrocycles, which are polymerized back to the CANs. Polydithioacetals are thus desirable candidates as chemically recyclable thermoplastics and thermosets.







Abstract
In a sustainable circular economy, polymers capable of chemical recycling to monomers are highly desirable. We report an efficient monomer&#8208;polymer recycling of polydithioacetal (PDTA). Pristine PDTAs were readily synthesized from 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzaldehyde and alkyl dithiols. They then exhibited depolymerizability via ring&#8208;closing depolymerization into macrocycles, followed by entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) to reform the virgin polymers. High conversions were obtained for both the forward and reverse reactions. Once crosslinked, the network exhibited thermal reprocessability enabled by acid&#8208;catalyzed dithioacetal exchange. The network retained the recyclability into macrocyclic monomers in solvent which can repolymerize to regenerate the crosslinked network. These results demonstrated PDTA as a new molecular platform for the design of recyclable polymers and the advantages of ED&#8208;ROP for which polymerization is favored at higher temperatures.

         <title>Hidden Lives. Early Childhood Care as an Academic: The Slow Burn</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hidden Lives series documents the &#8220;second jobs&#8221; of our colleagues, the invisible work that often goes unseen. In this first Viewpoint Article, we see the challenges of early childhood care set against the backdrop of societal shifts in caretaker roles and job responsibilities.







Abstract
As the inaugural entry in the new series Hidden Lives, this Viewpoint Article highlights challenges in early childhood care faced by academicians. Research centers must adapt to societal shifts in family structure, uncertainty around research funding, expanded job responsibilities and upheavals brought about by the pandemic. These problems represent opportunities for change at the technological, cultural and policy levels. It is crucial that we recognize those in need and help where we can.

Dual&#8208;emissive triarylborane&#8208;based donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solvent polarity, and viscosity of the medium, are reported by Shigehiro Yamaguchi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202303725). The intramolecularly coordinated B&#8211;X=P bond undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to bright emissions from the two different states. Precise tuning of the substituents led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.

Polydithioacetals , a new class of chemically recyclable thermoplastic and thermoset polymers, depolymerize to give a mixture of homologous macrocyclic monomers. Ying Yang and co&#8208;workers demonstrate in their Research Article (e202303039) that these monomers regenerate the virgin polymer via entropy&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening polymerization with high conversions at ambient temperatures.

A methyltransferase from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was identified and engineered for late&#8208;stage modifications of the carbon skeleton of terpenes. A variant with three changes in the amino acid sequence was able to produce methylated derivatives of linear terpenoids with high selectivity by C&#8208;methylation of an unactivated alkene. This opens new avenues for the modification of carbon scaffolds in various applications, as demonstrated by Bernhard Hauer et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202301601).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 26/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>

Alkaline water electrolysis is a promising technology for hydrogen production, but the slow water dissociation process limits the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In their Research Article (e202300873), Emiliano Cort&#233;s and co&#8208;workers designed an atomically asymmetric local electric field using IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to optimize the dissociation process by tuning the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation. As a result, IrRu DSACs exhibited an ultralow overpotential of 10&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2 current density in a single cell and a high stability over 300&#8197;h at 1&#8197;A/cm2 in a membrane electrode assembly.

         <title>Small Data Can Play a Big Role in Chemical Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite the paucity of reliable datasets, chemical discovery is enriched by machine learning techniques. Recent advances in data infrastructure management now prioritize high&#8208;quality data, which enable creative reinterpretation of information across contexts and disciplines. Likewise, insights resulting from analyzing small data can be fed back into big data workflows.







Abstract
The chemistry community is currently witnessing a surge of scientific discoveries in organic chemistry supported by machine learning (ML) techniques. Whereas many of these techniques were developed for big data applications, the nature of experimental organic chemistry often confines practitioners to small datasets. Herein, we touch upon the limitations associated with small data in ML and emphasize the impact of bias and variance on constructing reliable predictive models. We aim to raise awareness to these possible pitfalls, and thus, provide an introductory guideline for good practice. Ultimately, we stress the great value associated with statistical analysis of small data, which can be further boosted by adopting a holistic data&#8208;centric approach in chemistry.

Abstract
Machine learning (ML) algorithms are currently emerging as powerful tools in all areas of science. Conventionally, ML is understood as a fundamentally data&#8208;driven endeavour. Unfortunately, large well&#8208;curated databases are sparse in chemistry. In this contribution, I therefore review science&#8208;driven ML approaches which do not rely on &#8220;big data&#8221;, focusing on the atomistic modelling of materials and molecules. In this context, the term science&#8208;driven refers to approaches that begin with a scientific question and then ask what training data and model design choices are appropriate. As key features of science&#8208;driven ML, the automated and purpose&#8208;driven collection of data and the use of chemical and physical priors to achieve high data&#8208;efficiency are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of appropriate model evaluation and error estimation is emphasized.

         <title>Recent Development of SnII, SbIII&#8208;based Birefringent Material: Crystal Chemistry and Investigation of Birefringence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered SnII, SbIII&#8208;based birefringent crystals are systematically summarized in this review, including their structural chemistry, optical properties, as well as structure&#8208;properties relationships. The insight gained from this study provides guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.







Abstract
The combination of SnII or SbIII with &#960;, non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units has produced birefringent crystals with birefringence ranging from 0.005 to 0.468@1064&#8197;nm. It is proven that introducing SnII or SbIII into crystals is a feasible strategy to enlarge the birefringence, which not only promotes the miniaturization of fabricated devices, but also effectively modulates polarized light. Herein, recently discovered SnII, SbIII&#8208;based birefringent crystals with birefringence investigated are summarized, including their crystal structure and optical properties, especially birefringence. This review also presents the influence of SnII, SbIII with stereochemically active lone pair on the optical anisotropy. We hope that this work provides a clear perspective on the crystal chemistry of SnII, SbIII&#8208;based optical functional crystals and promotes the development of new birefringent crystals with large optical anisotropy.

         <title>Optimizing Membranes for Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ion&#8208;selective membrane is the key component in reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power harvesting techniques. This Minireview provides an overview of the balance between ion selectivity (voltage) and ion permeability (current) in osmotic ion transport and offers a set of design guidelines for material parameters to optimize membrane performance to maximize osmotic power generation.







Abstract
The design of ion&#8208;selective membranes is the key towards efficient reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power conversion. The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect. Lastly, a perspective on the future directions of membrane design to further maximize the efficiency of osmotic power conversion is outlined.

         <title>Localized Ligands Assist Ultrafast Multivalent&#8208;Cation Intercalation Pseudocapacitance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>

By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon ion intercalation.







Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent cation (Mvn+, n&gt;1) carriers are considered potentially low&#8208;cost alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high charge&#8208;density Mvn+ carriers generally lead to sluggish kinetics and poor structural stability in cathode materials. Herein, we report an Mvn+ storage via intercalation pseudocapacitance mechanism in a 2D bivalve&#8208;like organic framework featured with localized ligands. By switching from conventional intercalation to localized ligand&#8208;assisted&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance, the organic cathode exhibits unprecedented fast kinetics with little structural change upon intercalation. It thus enables an excellent power density of 57&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles for Ca2+ storage and a power density of 14&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a long cycling life over 45000 cycles for Zn2+ storage. This work may provide a largely unexploited route toward constructing a local dynamic coordination microstructure for ultrafast Mvn+ storage.

         <title>Discovery and Biosynthesis of Cihunamides, Macrocyclic Antibacterial RiPPs with a Unique C&#8722;N Linkage Formed by CYP450 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical analysis of volcanic&#8208;island&#8208;derived Streptomyces uncovered cihunamides, unique ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides with antibacterial activity. Genome mining, comparative bioinformatics, and heterologous co&#8208;expression revealed that the key step for cihunamide biosynthesis is the cytochrome&#8197;P450 mediated oxidative coupling of two tryptophan residues to form an endocyclic C&#8722;N bond.







Abstract
Cihunamides&#8197;A&#8211;D (1&#8211;4), novel antibacterial RiPPs, were isolated from volcanic&#8208;island&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. The structures of 1&#8211;4 were elucidated by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR, MS, and chemical derivatization; they contain a tetrapeptide core composed of WNIW, cyclized by a unique C&#8722;N linkage between two Trp units. Genome mining of the producer strain revealed two biosynthetic genes encoding a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme and a precursor peptide. Heterologous co&#8208;expression of the core genes demonstrated the biosynthesis of cihunamides through P450&#8208;mediated oxidative Trp&#8208;Trp cross&#8208;linking. Further bioinformatic analysis uncovered 252 homologous gene clusters, including that of tryptorubins, which possess a distinct Trp&#8208;Trp linkage. Cihunamides do not display the non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism shown in tryptorubins, which are the founding members of the &#8220;atropitide&#8221; family. Therefore, we propose to use a new RiPP family name, &#8220;bitryptides&#8221;, for cihunamides, tryptorubins, and their congeners, wherein the Trp&#8208;Trp linkages define the structural class rather than non&#8208;canonical atropisomerism.

         <title>Mixed Conductive, Injectable, and Fluorescent Supramolecular Eutectogel Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the first example of mixed ionic/electronic conductive eutectogel composites formed from low molecular weight gelators (LMWG) combined with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate (ChS) and glycine/choline chloride (Gly/ChCl) deep eutectic solvent (DES). Eutectogels exhibit fluorescence, high combined conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and biocompatible properties to be used as injectable materials for bioimaging.







Abstract
Eutectogels are an emerging family of soft ionic materials alternative to ionic liquid gels and organogels, offering fresh perspectives for designing functional dynamic platforms in water&#8208;free environments. Herein, the first example of mixed ionic and electronic conducting supramolecular eutectogel composites is reported. A fluorescent glutamic acid&#8208;derived low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) was found to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrillar networks in deep eutectic solvents (DES)/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT): chondroitin sulfate dispersions. These dynamic materials displayed excellent injectability and self&#8208;healing properties, high ionic conductivity (up to 10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), good biocompatibility, and fluorescence imaging ability. This set of features turns the mixed conducting supramolecular eutectogels into promising adaptive materials for bioimaging and electrostimulation applications.

         <title>Methylation of Unactivated Alkenes with Engineered Methyltransferases To Generate Non&#8208;natural Terpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpenoids are applied in various ways, in flavors and fragrances as well as in pharmaceuticals and plant protection. Through diversification of the carbon scaffold, non&#8208;natural terpenoids can be generated and screened for improved properties. The identification and engineering of methyltransferases for late&#8208;stage C&#8208;methylation of unactivated alkenes with high selectivity provided access to methylated derivatives of readily available terpenoids.







Abstract
Terpenoids are built from isoprene building blocks and have numerous biological functions. Selective late&#8208;stage modification of their carbon scaffold has the potential to optimize or transform their biological activities. However, the synthesis of terpenoids with a non&#8208;natural carbon scaffold is often a challenging endeavor because of the complexity of these molecules. Herein we report the identification and engineering of (S)&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine&#8208;dependent sterol methyltransferases for selective C&#8208;methylation of linear terpenoids. The engineered enzyme catalyzes selective methylation of unactivated alkenes in mono&#8208;, sesqui&#8208; and diterpenoids to produce C11, C16 and C21 derivatives. Preparative conversion and product isolation reveals that this biocatalyst performs C&#8722;C bond formation with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The alkene methylation most likely proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and regioselective deprotonation. This method opens new avenues for modifying the carbon scaffold of alkenes in general and terpenoids in particular.

         <title>Photochromic Polyoxoniobates with Photoinduced &#8220;D&#8208;f&#8208;A&#8221; Electron Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a general synthetic strategy for constructing a brand&#8208;new kind of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs), organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. Fascinatingly, such composite PONbs can be reduced by M&#8208;UV irradiation to form long&#8208;term stable heteropoly blues with visible color changes in air. More fascinatingly, a unique &#8220;donor&#8208;f&#8208;bridge&#8208;acceptor&#8221; electron transfer mechanism for the reduction of the novel PONbs has been proposed and evidenced.







Abstract
Compounds with redox activities have appealing applications in catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties, but the redox inert of polyoxoniobates (PONbs) significantly limits their applications for a long time. In this work, we are able to integrate organophosphate and lanthanide cluster into PONb to create the first family of inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid organophosphate&#8208;Ln&#8208;PONb composite clusters. These novel species not only present the first family of redox active PONbs that can be reduced to form long&#8208;lived &#8220;heteropoly blues&#8221; under ambient conditions, but also a new photochromic system. More importantly, the analyses of the electronic configurations and photochromic properties for a series of designed proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept PONbs models allow us to discover a D&#8208;f&#8208;A electron transfer mechanism, that is, photoinduced electron is transferred from a photosensitive organophosphate electron donor (D) to the NbV electron acceptor (A) through the unoccupied 4&#8201;f&#8208;orbitals of Ln (f). This work paves the way for developing diverse PONb&#8208;based redox materials and expanding the possibility of the applications of PONbs in the redox chemistry.

         <title>Self&#8208;Polarization Triggered Multiple Polar Units Toward Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethanol with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrical refinement structure with self&#8208;polarizing unit possesses benchmark electrocatalytic activity towards CO2 to ethanol reduction on Cu2O@MOF/CF electrodes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of CH3CHO* for the generation of ethanol.







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to highly valuable ethanol has been considered a intriguring strategy for carbon neutruality. However, the slow kinetics of coupling carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds, especially the low selectivity ethanol than ethylene in neutral conditions, is a significant challenge. Herein, the asymmetrical refinement structure with enhanced charge polarization is built in the vertically oriented bimetallic organic frameworks (NiCu&#8208;MOF) nanorod array with encapsulated Cu2O (Cu2O@MOF/CF), which can induce an intensive internal electric field to increase the C&#8722;C coupling for producing ethanol in neutral electrolyte. Particularly, when directly employed Cu2O@MOF/CF as the self&#8208;supporting electrode, the ethanol faradaic efficiency (FEethanol) could reach maximum 44.3&#8201;% with an energy efficiency of 27&#8201;% at a low working&#8208;potential of &#8722;0.615&#8197;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) using CO2&#8208;saturated 0.5&#8197;M KHCO3 as the electrolyte. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the polarization of atomically localized electric fields derived from the asymmetric electron distribution can tune the moderate adsorption of *CO to assist the C&#8722;C coupling and reduce the formation energy of H2CCHO*&#8208;to&#8208;*OCHCH3 for the generation of ethanol. Our research offers a reference for the design of highly active and selective electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 to multicarbon chemicals.

         <title>Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Embedded in Porphyrinoids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane bridgehead positions can easily be modified to carbinols under mild conditions to yield stable and simple to handle isostere building blocks. The versatility of this approach has been illustrated by creating a new family of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two rigid scaffold units.







Abstract
We report a two&#8208;step approach to obtain synthetically versatile bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) derivatives using Grignard reagents. This method allows the incorporation of BCP units in tetrapyrrolic macrocycles and the synthesis of a new class of calix[4]pyrrole analogues by replacing two bridging methylene groups with two BCP units. In addition, a doubly N&#8208;confused system was also formed in the presence of electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at the BCP bridgeheads. The pyrrole rings in BCP containing macrocycles exist in 1,3&#8208;alternate or &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946; conformations, as observed from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Pore Size Modulation in Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Enabling High Performance Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was used to modulate the pore size of MIL&#8208;88B, which enables to reveal the pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity of MOF materials for the first time.







Abstract
Pore size plays a critical role in determining the performance of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in catalysis, sensing, and gas storage or separation. However, revealing the pore&#8208;size/property relationship remains extremely challenging because ideal structure models possessing different pore sizes but having the same components are lacking. In this work, a solvent&#8208;coordination directed structure swelling method was developed for modulating the ratio between the large and narrow pore phases of a flexible MOF, MIL&#8208;88B. Pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent gas sensitivity and selectivity were studied for the first time in the MIL&#8208;88B samples. The optimized MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;20&#8201;% sample showed one of the best sensing performances among all the reported MOF&#8208;based H2S&#8208;sensing materials. This work not only provides a method to synthesize ideal structure models for revealing the relationship between pore&#8208;size and properties, but also may inspire the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensing materials.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Pillared Vanadate Via Chemical Pre&#8208;Intercalation Towards High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient NH4V4O10 (NVO) nanobelts with large interlayer spacing are fabricated as the cathode for stable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The pre&#8208;intercalated C3N4 acts as the &#8220;pillars&#8221; to enlarge the interplanar spacing for better structural stability and faster ion transfer. The abundant oxygen vacancies improve the conductivity of NVO. The obtained NVO cathode enables exceptional rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling in full cells.







Abstract
Vanadium based compounds are promising cathode materials for aqueous zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their high specific capacity. However, the narrow interlayer spacing, low intrinsic conductivity and the vanadium dissolution still restrict their further application. Herein, we present an oxygen&#8208;deficient vanadate pillared by carbon nitride (C3N4) as the cathode for AZIBs through a facile self&#8208;engaged hydrothermal strategy. Of note, C3N4 nanosheets can act as both the nitrogen source and pre&#8208;intercalation species to transform the orthorhombic V2O5 into layered NH4V4O10 with expanded interlayer spacing. Owing to the pillared structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, both the Zn2+ ion (de)intercalation kinetics and the ionic conductivity in the NH4V4O10 cathode are promoted. As a result, the NH4V4O10 cathode delivers exceptional Zn&#8208;ion storage ability with a high specific capacity of about 370&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, a high&#8208;rate capability of 194.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling performance of 10&#8201;000&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Atomically Precise Defective Copper Nanocluster Catalysts for Highly Selective C&#8722;C Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot method for the synthesis of defective [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28) nanoclusters (NCs) on a gram scale has been developed. The surface vacancy on one of the vertices of Cu28 was systematically investigated at the atomic level and Cu28 can act as an effective and selective catalyst for Sonogashira C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling reactions under visible&#8208;light irradiation.







Abstract
Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle's electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report the synthesis of novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu28H10(C7H7S)18(TPP)3] (Cu28; TPP: triphenylphosphine; C7H7S: o&#8208;thiocresol) with a defined defect in the gram scale via a one&#8208;pot reduction method. The Cu28 acts as a highly selective catalyst for C&#8722;C cross&#8208;couplings.

The surface vacancy on one of the vertices of &lt;b&gt;Cu28&lt;/b&gt; was systematically investigated at the atomic level and &lt;b&gt;Cu28&lt;/b&gt; can act as an effective and selective catalyst for Sonogashira C&#8722;C cross-coupling reactions under visible-light irradiation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point defects in nanoparticles have long been hypothesized to play an important role in governing the particle's electronic structure and physicochemical properties. However, single point defects in material systems usually exist with other heterogeneities, obscuring the chemical role of the effects. Herein, we report the synthesis of novel atomically precise, copper hydride nanoclusters (NCs), [Cu&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;S)&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;(TPP)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/b&gt; acts as a highly selective catalyst for C&#8722;C cross-couplings. The work highlights the potential of defective NCs as model systems for investigating individual defects, correlating defects with physiochemical properties, and rationally designing new nanoparticle catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Thioamide Peptides from Chiral Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward linking of natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane was established to construct various thioamide&#8208;containing peptides. The carbonyl group is replaced with a thiono group by sequential activation, and the chirality of the amino acid component is maintained in the products.







Abstract
Thioamide peptides were synthesized in a straightforward one&#8208;pot process via the linkage of diverse natural amino acids in the presence of thiolphosphonate and trichlorosilane, wherein carbonyl groups were replaced with thiono compounds with minimal racemization. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies demonstrated that the trichlorosilane enables the activation of carboxylic acids via intense interactions with the Si&#8722;O bond, followed by coupling of the carboxylic acids with thiolphosphonate to obtain the key intermediate S&#8208;acyl dithiophosphate. Silyl&#8208;activated quadrangular metathesis transition states afforded the thioamide peptides. The potential applications of these thioamide peptides were further highlighted via late&#8208;stage linkages of diverse natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and the thioamide moiety.

         <title>The Elusive Structure of Levocetirizine Dihydrochloride Determined by Electron Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Levocetirizine dihydrochloride is a widely known antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that is effectively used for the relief of allergic symptoms in patients of various age groups. Despite its usage in such medications for more than two decades, its crystal structure has yet to be determined unambiguously. Electron diffraction is used here to determine its crystal structure.







Abstract
Levocetirizine is an orally administrated, second&#8208;generation antihistaminic active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been used to treat symptoms of allergy and long&#8208;term hives for over 25&#8197;years. Despite the wide use of this compound, its crystal structure has remained unknown. Here we report the application of 3D electron diffraction (3D ED)/Micro&#8208;crystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to determine the crystal structure of Levocetirizine dihydrochloride directly from crystalline powders that were extracted from commercially available tablets containing the compound. We also showcase the utility of dynamical refinement to unambiguously assign absolute configuration. The results highlight the immense potential of 3D ED/MicroED for structure elucidation of components of microcrystalline mixtures that obviates the need to grow large&#8208;size single crystals and the use of complementary analytical techniques, which could be important for identification as well as for primary structural characterization.

         <title>Stiba&#8208;, Arsa&#8208; and Phosphastannenes: Syntheses and Reactivities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 26, June 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stibastannene featuring a Sn=Sb double bond together with homologous phospha&#8208; and arsastannene were synthesized by chloride abstraction from the respective pnictinidenes. The pnictastannene cations exhibit coordination at palladium phosphine fragments and can undergo cycloaddition reactions with dimethylbutadiene and phosphaalkyne.







Abstract
A facile synthesis for unprecedented stibastannene (10) featuring a Sn=Sb&#8208;double bond together with the homologous arsa&#8208; (9) and phosphastannenes (8) is presented. Chloride abstraction from respective stannyl pnictinidenes [E=P (5), As (6), Sb (7)], which were made accessible by reduction of ECl3 addition products at an intramolecular phosphine&#8208;stabilized stannylene, gave the pnictastannenes in moderate yields. The pnictastannenes coordinate Pd(PPh3)2 fragments (12&#8211;14) and the phosphastannene forms also a nickel coordination compound with the Ni(PPh3)2&#8208;fragment (11). 2,3&#8208;Dimethylbutadiene shows a [2+4]&#8208;cycloaddition (15&#8211;17) in reaction with the pnictastannenes (8&#8211;10). Products of a [2+2]&#8208;addition (18, 19) were isolated as the phosphaalkyne reaction products for 8 and 9. Addition of an O&#8722;H bond at the Sn=P&#8208;bond was found in reaction of water with phosphastannene 8. Reaction with ammonia afforded the NH3&#8208;adducts (21&#8211;23) at the tin atom for pnictastannenes 8&#8211;10. Only in the case of the arsastannene an azide reaction product featuring a three membered Sn&#8722;As&#8722;N&#8208;ring was obtained.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by the Applied Mass Spectrometry Team at the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS Mannheim) in Germany. They recently published an article together with Sirius Fine Chemicals SiChem GmbH and Bruker Daltonics. The work presents a novel concept for vacuum&#8208;stable&#8208;by&#8208;design MALDI matrices that enable long MALDI mass spectrometry measurements (e.g., for imaging) of at least 72&#8197;hours. Through the use of a photo&#8208;removable group, organic synthesis transformed the widely used, but unfortunately very volatile MALDI matrix 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyacetophenone (2,5&#8208;DHAP) into a vacuum&#8208;stable one. The protecting group can be uncaged by the MALDI laser in the ion source and then the matrix performs in the same way as the common matrix 2,5&#8208;DHAP. &#8220;A Caged In&#8208;Source Laser&#8208;Cleavable MALDI Matrix with High Vacuum Stability for Extended MALDI&#8208;MS Imaging&#8221;, Q.

         <title>Molecular orbital delocalization enhanced charge transfer in &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic semiconductors are promising materials for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)&#8208;active substrates based on the tunability of electronic structures and molecular orbitals. Herein, we investigate the effect of the temperature&#8208;mediated resonance structure transitions of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) in poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films on the interactions between substrate and probe molecules, thereby affecting the SERS activity. Absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations show that this effect occurs mainly due to delocalization of the electron distribution in molecular orbitals, effectively promoting the charge transfer between the semiconductor and probe molecules. In this work, we investigate for the first time the effect of electron delocalization in molecular orbitals on SERS activity, which will provide new design ideas for the development of highly sensitive SERS substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Purely Organic Fluorescence Afterglow: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Excitation, Inherent Mechanism, Tunable Color, and Practical Applications with Very Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convenient approach of constructing fluorescence afterglow materials triggered by visible light was presented. By dispersing fluorescent dyes with coplanar and rigid chemical structure into matrixes with multiple hydroxyl groups, bright and color tunable fluorescence afterglow was achieved after the cease of white light. The mechanism was investigated, and the aqueous solution of the dye was used for low&#8208;cost anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.







Abstract
Purely organic materials with visible light excitable fluorescence afterglow are promising for applications. Herein, fluorescence afterglow with various intensity and duration was observed on fluorescent dyes once being dispersed in polymer matrix, thanks to the slow reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) and long delayed fluorescence lifetime (&#964;DF) derived from the coplanar and rigid chemical structure of the dyes. To verify the mechanism, different polymers were used to tune singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy based on solvent effect. And commercial acriflavine (Acf) film showed blue shifted fluorescence compared to purified one, with slower kRISC (&#8776;100&#8197;s&#8722;1) and longer &#964;DF (0.6&#8197;s). Via energy transfer from Acf to rhodamine B, the afterglow color was further regulated, with the largest fluorescence quantum yield of 42.4&#8201;%. It was demonstrated that the materials worked on color tunable light sources, and low&#8208;cost ($2 for 50&#8201;000&#8197;labels) anti&#8208;counterfeit labels recognized by white light.

         <title>Easily Scalable Shell&#8208;Structured Copper Catalyst with High Activity and Durability for Carbon Dioxide Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous ceria shell was formed on small Cu nanoparticles with a size of &#8804;10&#8197;nm by promoting the surface oxygen transfer. This catalyst presented high activity and durability for CO2 hydrogenation. It could be easily scaled&#8208;up and applied in a bench&#8208;scale reactor, achieving a high CO production rate.







Abstract
Inducing strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) has been a useful way to control the structure of surface active sites. The SMSI often causes the encapsulation of metal particles with an oxide layer. Herein, an amorphous ceria shell was formed on Cu nanoparticles under a mild gas condition with high activity and durability for surface reaction. Cu&#8722;Ce solid solution promoted the transfer of surface oxygen species, which induced the ceria shell formation on Cu nanoparticles. This catalyst was used for CO2 hydrogenation, selectively producing CO with high low&#8208;temperature activity and good durability for operation at high temperature. CO2 activation and H2 spillover could occur at low temperatures, enhancing the activity. The shell prevented the sintering, assuring durability. This catalyst was applied to a bench&#8208;scale reactor without loss in performance, resulting in high CO productivity in all temperature ranges.

         <title>Conformationally Locked Cyclo[2]Dipyrrins Linked with Anthracene Subunits: Synthesis and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anthracene&#8208;containing helically locked &#8216;Figure of eight&#8217; expanded porphyrin has been obtained by a simple condensation strategy. The 3D crystal packing showed the presence of two helical enantiomers, which were stable enough to be separated in solution. The P,P and M,M enantiomers show moderate chiroptical properties (gabs ca.10&#8722;3 and glum=3.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at 700&#8197;nm) and are not interconvertible, presumably because of a high racemization barrier.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of anthracene&#8208;containing twisted cyclo[2]dipyrrin 1 by utilizing a non&#8208;planar building block, 1,5&#8208;dipyrrylanthracene (1,5&#8208;DPA). The non&#8208;planar nature of the macrocycle enhanced the solubility and helped in structural characterization. Macrocycle 1 adopts a twisted &#8216;figure of eight&#8217; conformation stabilized by strong intramolecular H&#8208;bonding interactions and exists as a pair of helical enantiomers, as revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. More importantly, the sterically locked structure enabled facile optical resolution using chiral HPLC. The (P,P) and (M,M) enantiomers show moderate chiroptical properties, such as absorption dissymmetry factors |gabs| in the order of 10&#8722;3, and luminescence dissymmetry factors |glum| of 3.8&#215;10&#8722;3 and 2.9&#215;10&#8722;3 at 702&#8197;nm, respectively.

         <title>Single Atom Bi Decorated Copper Alloy Enables C&#8722;C Coupling for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 into C2+ Products
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single atom Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu&#8208;SAA) was prepared for the first time to enable the C&#8722;C coupling, resulting in selective electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products with faraday efficiency of ca. 73&#8201;%.







Abstract
Single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have been recently explored for promotion of various heterogeneous catalysis, but it remains unexplored for selective electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products involving C&#8722;C coupling. Herein we report a single&#8208;atomic Bi decorated Cu alloy (denoted as BiCu&#8208;SAA) electrocatalyst that could effectively modulate selectivity of CO2 reduction into C2+ products instead of previous C1 ones. The BiCu&#8208;SAA catalyst exhibits remarkably superior selectivity of C2+ products with optimal Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 73.4&#8201;% compared to the pure copper nanoparticle or Bi nanoparticles&#8208;decorated Cu nanocomposites, and its structure and performance can be well maintained at current density of 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under the flow cell system. Based on our in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the BiCu&#8208;SAA is found to favor the activation of CO2 and subsequent C&#8722;C coupling during the electrocatalytic reaction, as should be responsible for its extraordinary C2+ selectivity.

         <title>Dissection of the Catalytic Mechanisms of Transmembrane Terpene Cyclases Involved in Fungal Meroterpenoid Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic function of the terpene cyclase AdrI, which cyclizes (6R,10&#8242;R)&#8208;epoxyfarnesyl&#8208;DMOA methyl ester (1) into andrastin&#8197;E (2), was investigated using its AlphaFold2&#8208;generated protein model. This revealed several amino acid residues that are required for reaction initiation and product selectivity. Moreover, a comparison of AdrI with homologues that also cyclize 1 afforded insight into how these cyclases yield diverse cyclized products.







Abstract
Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases are noncanonical transmembrane terpene cyclases involved in the biosynthesis of microbial meroterpenoids and catalyze diverse cyclization reactions. Despite the ubiquity of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases in microorganisms, their three&#8208;dimensional structures have never been experimentally determined. Herein, we focused on AdrI, the Pyr4&#8208;family enzyme for the andrastin A pathway, and its homologues, and performed a series of mutational experiments using their AlphaFold2&#8208;generated structures. Intriguingly, we found that AdrI and InsA7, which both accept the same substrate, use different amino acid residues for the initiation of the cyclization cascade. Furthermore, we obtained several AdrI variants with altered product selectivity, one of which dominantly yielded a new meroterpenoid species. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the catalytic functions of Pyr4&#8208;family terpene cyclases and will facilitate the engineering of these enzymes.

         <title>Beyond Solvothermal: Alternative Synthetic Methods for Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a comprehensive overview of the recent synthetic advancements of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with emphasis on the energy input required. These emerging strategies encompass microwave&#8208;assisted, sonochemical, mechanochemical, photochemical, plasma&#8208;promoted, electric field&#8208;induced, and electron beam&#8208;mediated synthesis. We also delve into the merits and limitations of these methods in comparison to the solvothermal approach.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are crystalline porous organic materials that hold a wealth of potential applications across various fields. The development of COFs, however, is significantly impeded by the dearth of efficient synthetic methods. The traditional solvothermal approach, while prevalent, is fraught with challenges such as complicated processes, excessive energy consumption, long reaction times, and limited scalability, rendering it unsuitable for practical applications. The quest for simpler, quicker, more energy&#8208;efficient, and environmentally benign synthetic strategies is thus paramount for bridging the gap between academic COF chemistry and industrial application. This Review provides an overview of the recent advances in alternative COF synthetic methods, with a particular emphasis on energy input. We discuss representative examples of COF synthesis facilitated by microwave, ultrasound, mechanic force, light, plasma, electric field, and electron beam. Perspectives on the advantages and limitations of these methods against the traditional solvothermal approach are highlighted.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CRISPR&#8208;based Amplification&#8208;free Viral RNA Electrical Detection platform (CAVRED) is reported for rapid and ultrasensitive detection and identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its variants. By combining CRISPR technology with highly sensitive field&#8208;effect transistor arrays, CAVRED demonstrated RT&#8208;PCR&#8208;equivalent sensitivity without preamplification and achieved simultaneous profiling of 9 critical RNA mutations associated with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants of concern at single&#8208;nucleotide resolution.







Abstract
Mass pathogen screening is critical to preventing the outbreaks and spread of infectious diseases. The large&#8208;scale epidemic of COVID&#8208;19 and the rapid mutation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) virus have put forward new requirements for virus detection and identification techniques. Here, we report a CRISPR&#8208;based Amplification&#8208;free Viral RNA Electrical Detection platform (CAVRED) for the rapid detection and identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants. A series of CRISPR RNA assays were designed to amplify the CRISPR&#8208;Cas system&#8216;s ability to discriminate between mutant and wild RNA genomes with a single&#8208;nucleotide difference. The identified viral RNA information was converted into readable electrical signals through field&#8208;effect transistor biosensors for the achievement of highly sensitive detection of single&#8208;base mutations. CAVRED can detect the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus genome as low as 1&#8197;cp&#8201;&#956;L&#8722;1 within 20&#8197;mins without amplification, and this value is comparable to the detection limit of real&#8208;time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Based on the excellent RNA mutation detection ability, an 8&#8208;in&#8208;1 CAVRED array was constructed and realized the rapid identification of 40 simulated throat swab samples of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants with a 95.0&#8201;% accuracy. The advantages of accuracy, sensitivity, and fast speed of CAVRED promise its application in rapid and large&#8208;scale epidemic screening.

         <title>A Cleavable Crosslinking Strategy for Commodity Polymer Functionalization and Generation of Reprocessable Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cleavable bis&#8208;diazirine crosslinkers can be used to upgrade commodity, aliphatic polymers into reprocessable thermosets. The method also provides a convenient means to introduce new functionality into polymers, through facile C&#8722;H insertion followed by hydrolysis.







Abstract
Covalently crosslinked polymeric materials, known as thermosets, possess enhanced mechanical strength and thermal stability relative to the corresponding uncrosslinked thermoplastics. However, the presence of covalent inter&#8208;chain crosslinks that makes thermosets so attractive is precisely what makes them so difficult to reprocess and recycle. Here, we demonstrate the introduction of chemically cleavable groups into a bis&#8208;diazirine crosslinker. Application of this cleavable crosslinker reagent to commercial low&#8208;functionality polyolefins (or to a small&#8208;molecule model) results in the rapid, efficient introduction of molecular crosslinks that can be uncoupled by specific chemical inputs. These proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept findings provide one potential strategy for circularization of the thermoplastic/thermoset plastics economy, and may allow crosslinked polyolefins to be manufactured, used, reprocessed, and re&#8208;used without losing value. As an added benefit, the method allows the ready introduction of functionality into non&#8208;functionalized commodity polymers.

However, the presence of covalent inter-chain crosslinks that makes thermosets so attractive is precisely what makes them so difficult to reprocess and recycle. Here, we demonstrate the introduction of chemically cleavable groups into a &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;-diazirine crosslinker. Application of this cleavable crosslinker reagent to commercial low-functionality polyolefins (or to a small-molecule model) results in the rapid, efficient introduction of molecular crosslinks that can be uncoupled by specific chemical inputs. These proof-of-concept findings provide one potential strategy for circularization of the thermoplastic/thermoset plastics economy, and may allow crosslinked polyolefins to be manufactured, used, reprocessed, and re-used without losing value. As an added benefit, the method allows the ready introduction of functionality into non-functionalized commodity polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Proximity&#8208;Induced Fluorogenic Reaction Triggered by Antibody&#8211;Antigen Interactions with Adjacent Epitopes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed a biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction by using two monoclonal antibodies to interact with different epitopes of an antigen. Accelerated reaction was observed using a fluorescence&#8208;based method and the importance of epitope selection was demonstrated.







Abstract
Proximity&#8208;induced chemical reactions are site&#8208;specific and rapid by taking advantage of their high affinity and highly selective interactions with the template. However, reactions induced solely by antibody&#8211;antigen interactions have not been developed. Herein, we propose a biepitopic antigen&#8208;templated chemical reaction (BATER) as a novel template reaction. In BATER, reactive functional groups are conjugated to two antibodies that interact with two epitopes of the same antigen to accelerate the reaction. We developed a method for visualizing the progress of BATER using fluorogenic click chemistry for optimal antibody selection and linker design. The reaction is accelerated in the presence of a specific antigen in a linker length&#8208;dependent manner. The choice of the antibody epitope is important for a rapid reaction. This design will lead to various applications of BATER in living systems.

         <title>Fast and Tunable Phosphorescence from Organic Ionic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence mechanism of crystalline diphosphonium iodide salts strongly depends on anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the case of iodide&#8211;&#960; charge transfer combined with electrostatically controlled packing effects, high quantum yields (&#934;em up to 0.75) and fast radiative rate constants (kr of up to 2.77&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) of phosphorescence have been realized at room temperature, which are exceptionally rare for metal&#8208;free systems.







Abstract
Crystalline diphosphonium iodides [MeR2P&#8208;spacer&#8208;R2Me]I with phenylene (1, 2), naphthalene (3, 4), biphenyl (5) and anthracene (6) as aromatic spacers, are photoemissive under ambient conditions. The emission colors (&#955;em values from 550 to 880&#8197;nm) and intensities (&#934;em reaching 0.75) are defined by the composition and substitution geometry of the central conjugated chromophore motif, and the anion&#8208;&#960; interactions. Time&#8208;resolved and variable&#8208;temperature luminescence studies suggest phosphorescence for all the titled compounds, which demonstrate observed lifetimes of 0.46&#8211;92.23&#8197;&#956;s at 297&#8197;K. Radiative rate constants kr as high as 2.8&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1 deduced for salts 1&#8211;3 were assigned to strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhanced by an external heavy atom effect arising from the anion&#8208;&#960; charge&#8208;transfer character of the triplet excited state. These rates of anomalously fast metal&#8208;free phosphorescence are comparable to those of transition metal complexes and organic luminophores that utilize triplet excitons via a thermally activated delayed fluorescence mechanism, making such ionic luminophores a new paradigm for the design of photofunctional and responsive molecular materials.

         <title>NIR Clusteroluminescence of Non&#8208;conjugated Phenolic Resins Enabled by Through&#8208;Space Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonconjugated luminescent materials derived from well&#8208;developed engineering plastic of phenolic resins could fluoresce from deep blue to the NIR region. This remarkable luminescence is attributed to through&#8208;space interactions (TSIs) and can be manipulated using two molecule&#8208;engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing D/A groups. The NIR emission endows phenolic resins with practical values as luminescence materials and is a breakthrough in clusteroluminescence from nonconjugated materials.







Abstract
Clusteroluminescence (CL) and through&#8208;space interactions (TSIs) of non&#8208;conjugated molecules have drawn more attention due to their unique photophysical behaviors that are different from largely conjugated luminogens. However, achieving red and even near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission from such systems is still challenging due to the intrinsic drawbacks of non&#8208;conjugated molecules and the lack of theories for structure&#8211;property relationships. In this work, six phenolic resins are designed and synthesized based on two molecule&#8208;engineering strategies: increasing the number of TSIs units and introducing electron&#8208;donating/&#8208;withdrawing groups. All phenolic resins are verified as luminogens with CL property (CLgens), and the first example of CLgens with NIR emission (maximum emission wavelength &#8805;680&#8197;nm) and high absolute quantum yield (47&#8201;%) is reported. Experiments and theoretical analysis reveal that two TSIs types, through&#8208;space locally excited state and through&#8208;space charge transfer state, play essential roles in achieving CL from these non&#8208;conjugated polymers, which could be manipulated via changing structural conformation and electron density or altering electron transition behaviors. This work not only provides an approach to manipulate TSIs and CL of non&#8208;conjugated polymers but also endows commercially available phenolic resins with high practical value as luminescence materials.

We developed a series of SMAs with pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline (PyQx) as new electron&#8208;deficient unit by combining with the strategy of cascade chlorination, namely Py1, Py2, Py3, Py4 and Py5. Py2&#8208;based device yields the best device performance due to the better molecular packing and aggregation behaviors induced by large dipole moments, small &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances and extended orbit overlap lengths in dimers.







Abstract
The central core in A&#8208;DA1D&#8208;A&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptor (SMAs) plays an important role in determining the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), while the principles governing the efficient design of SMAs remain elusive. Herein, we developed a series of SMAs with pyrido[2,3&#8208;b]quinoxaline (PyQx) as new electron&#8208;deficient unit by combining with the cascade&#8208;chlorination strategy, namely Py1, Py2, Py3, Py4 and Py5. The introduction of chlorine atoms reduces the intramolecular charge transfer effects but elevates the LUMO values. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that Py2 with ortho chlorine substituted PyQx and Py5 with two chlorine atoms yield larger dipole moments and smaller &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances, as compared with the other three acceptors. Moreover, Py2 shows the strongest light absorption capability induced by extended orbit overlap lengths and more efficient packing structures in the dimers. These features endow the best device performance of Py2 due to the better molecular packing and aggregation behaviors, more suitable domain sizes with better exciton dissociation and charge recombination. This study highlights the significance of incorporating large dipole moments, small &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; stacking distances and extended orbit overlap lengths in dimers into the development of high&#8208;performance SMAs, providing insight into the design of efficient A&#8208;DA1D&#8208;A&#8208;type SMAs for OSCs.

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of p&#8211;type Organics for Zinc Batteries with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular tailoring of p&#8208;type organics for zinc batteries is achieved by coupling a triphenylamine unit and a phenothiazine unit. The p&#8208;type organic electrodes reach excellent stability (2000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (1.3&#8197;V) and high capacity (145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1).







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic electrode materials are known for their high redox voltages and fast kinetics. However, single&#8208;electron p&#8208;type organic materials generally exhibit low capacity despite high operating voltage and stability, while some multi&#8208;electron p&#8208;type organic materials have high theoretical capacity but low stability. To address this challenge, we explore the possibility of combining single&#8208;electron and multi&#8208;electron units to create high&#8208;capacity and stable p&#8208;type organic electrodes. We demonstrate the design of a new molecule, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(10H&#8208;phenothiazine&#8208;3,7&#8208;diyl) bis (N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline) (PTZAN), which is created by coupling the triphenylamine molecule and the phenothiazine molecule. The resulting PTZAN||Zn battery shows excellent stability (2000&#8197;cycles), high voltage (1.3&#8197;V), high capacity (145&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and energy density of 187.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ analysis reveal that the charge storage of the PTZAN electrode is mainly driven by the redox of phenothiazine heterocycles and triphenylamine unit, accompanied by the combination/release of anions and Zn2+.

         <title>Ordered and Fast Ion Transport of Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Electrolyte with Regulated Coordination Strength for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the coordination strength of Li+ on the functional groups of a 3D network polymer and liquid solvent, the ionic conductivity of the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte can approach to that of liquid electrolytes in lithium metal batteries.







Abstract
Polymer based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSE) has attracted great attention due to its assurance for high safety of rechargeable batteries including lithium metal batteries (LMB). However, it faces the issue of low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface (SEI) layer between QSE and lithium anode. Herein, we firstly demonstrate that the ordered and fast transport of lithium ion (Li+) can be realized in QSE. Due to the higher coordination strength of Li+ on tertiary amine (&#8722;NR3) group of polymer network than that on carbonyl (&#8722;C=O) group of ester solvent, Li+ can diffuse orderly and quickly on &#8722;NR3 of polymer, significantly increasing the ionic conductivity of QSE to 3.69&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, &#8722;NR3 of polymer can induce in situ and uniform generation of Li3N and LiNxOy in SEI. As a result, the Li||NCM811 batteries (50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil) with this QSE show an excellent stability of 220&#8197;cycles at &#8776;1.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 5 times to those with conventional QSE. LMBs with LiFePO4 can stably run for &#8776;8300&#8197;h. This work demonstrates an attractive concept for improving ionic conductivity of QSE, and also provides an important step for developing advanced LMB with high cycle stability and safety.

</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes by reduction of spirocyclic oxetanyl nitriles was developed. The mechanism, scope, and scalability of this transformation were studied. The core was incorporated into the structure of the antihistamine drug Rupatidine instead of the pyridine ring, which led to a dramatic improvement in physicochemical properties.

         <title>Magnesium(I) Reduction of Aluminum(III) Hydride Complexes: Generation of Mixed Valence Aluminum (AlI/Al0) Hydride Cluster Compounds, [Al6H8(NR3)2{Mg(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate)}4]

         <dc:description>
Reductions of simple amido&#8208; and aryloxy&#8722;aluminum dihydride complexes with dimagnesium(I) reagents have afforded deep red mixed&#8208;valence aluminum hydride cluster compounds, which have an average Al oxidation state of +0.66 (see picture). These clusters extend the limited parallels that exist between the chemistry of aluminum hydrides and polyhedral boranes.







Abstract
Reduction of a range of amido&#8208; and aryloxy&#8208;aluminum dihydride complexes, e.g. [AlH2(NR3){N(SiMe3)2}] (NR3=NMe3 or N&#8208;methylpiperidine (NMP)), with &#946;&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) reagents, [{(ArNacnac)Mg}2] (ArNacnac=[HC(MeCNAr)2]&#8722;, Ar=mesityl (Mes) or 2,6&#8208;xylyl (Xyl)), have afforded deep red mixed valence aluminum hydride cluster compounds, [Al6H8(NR3)2{Mg(ArNacnac)}4], which have an average Al oxidation state of +0.66, the lowest for any well&#8208;defined aluminum hydride compound. In the solid&#8208;state, the clusters are shown to have distorted octahedral Al6 cores, having zero&#8208;valent Al axial sites and mono&#8208;valent AlH2&#8722; equatorial units. Several novel by&#8208;products were isolated from the reactions that gave the clusters, including the Mg&#8722;Al bonded magnesio&#8208;aluminate complexes, [(ArNacnac)(Me3N)Mg&#8722;Al(&#956;&#8208;H)3[{Mg(ArNacnac)}2(&#956;&#8208;H)]]. Computational analyses of one aluminum hydride cluster revealed its Al6 core to be electronically delocalized, and to possess one unoccupied, and six occupied, skeletal molecular orbitals.

&lt;p&gt;Reduction of a range of amido- and aryloxy-aluminum dihydride complexes, e.g. [AlH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;){N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}] (NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or N-methylpiperidine (NMP)), with &#946;-diketiminato dimagnesium(I) reagents, [{(&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac=[HC(MeCNAr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Ar=mesityl (Mes) or 2,6-xylyl (Xyl)), have afforded deep red mixed valence aluminum hydride cluster compounds, [Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(NR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{Mg(&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], which have an average Al oxidation state of +0.66, the lowest for any well-defined aluminum hydride compound. In the solid-state, the clusters are shown to have distorted octahedral Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; cores, having zero-valent Al axial sites and mono-valent AlH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; equatorial units. Several novel by-products were isolated from the reactions that gave the clusters, including the Mg&#8722;Al bonded magnesio-aluminate complexes, [(&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N)Mg&#8722;Al(&#956;-H)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[{Mg(&lt;sup&gt;Ar&lt;/sup&gt;Nacnac)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-H)]]. Computational analyses of one aluminum hydride cluster revealed its Al&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; core to be electronically delocalized, and to possess one unoccupied, and six occupied, skeletal molecular orbitals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Illustrating the Fate of Methyl Radical in Photocatalytic Methane Oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ Synchrotron Radiation Photoionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fleeting intermediates such as methyl radical (&#8901;CH3), methoxy radical and formaldehyde, were captured during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO by in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry, which sheds light on the overoxidation and self&#8208;coupling reaction mechanism of &#8901;CH3.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has emerged as an ideal method for the direct activation and conversion of methane under mild conditions. In this reaction, methyl radical (&#8901;CH3) was deemed a key intermediate that affected the yields and selectivity of the products. However, direct observation of &#8901;CH3 and other intermediates is still challenging. Here, a rectangular photocatalytic reactor coupled with in situ synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry (SR&#8208;PIMS) was developed to detect reactive intermediates within several hundred microseconds during photocatalytic methane oxidation over Ag&#8722;ZnO. Gas phase &#8901;CH3 generated by photogenerated holes (O&#8722;) was directly observed, and its formation was demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by coadsorbed oxygen molecules. Methoxy radical (CH3O&#8901;) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were confirmed to be key C1 intermediates in photocatalytic methane overoxidation to CO2. The gas&#8208;phase self&#8208;coupling reaction of &#8901;CH3 contributes to the formation of ethane, which indicates the key role of &#8901;CH3 desorption in the highly selective synthesis of ethane. Based on the observed intermediates, the reaction network initiated from &#8901;CH3 of photocatalytic methane oxidation could be clearly illustrated, which is helpful for studying the photocatalytic methane conversion processes.

         <title>Ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl Difluoride (EDSF) for SuFEx Click Chemistry: Synthesis of SuFExable 1,1&#8208;Bissulfonylfluoride Substituted Cyclobutene Hubs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl difluoride (EDSF) represents a novel SuFEx connector hub. Here, we demonstrate the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of EDSF with aryl acetylenes, which rapidly and regioselectively generates unique 1,1&#8208;bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes. Moreover, these products can selectively undergo SuFEx reactions with phenols, highlighting their potential for constructing complex molecular architectures.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;bis(fluorosulfonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium&#8208;1&#8208;yl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208;ide, a bench&#8208;stable precursor to ethene&#8208;1,1&#8208;disulfonyl difluoride (EDSF). The novel SuFEx reagent, EDSF, is demonstrated in the preparation of 26 unique 1,1&#8208;bissulfonylfluoride substituted cyclobutenes via a cycloaddition reaction. The regioselective click cycloaddition reaction is rapid, straightforward, and highly efficient, enabling the generation of highly functionalized 4&#8208;membered ring (4MR) carbocycles. These carbocycles are valuable structural motifs found in numerous bioactive natural products and pharmaceutically relevant small molecules. Additionally, we showcase diversification of the novel cyclobutene cores through selective Cs2CO3&#8208;activated SuFEx click chemistry between a single S&#8722;F group and an aryl alcohol, yielding the corresponding sulfonate ester products with high efficiency. Finally, density functional theory calculations offer mechanistic insights about the reaction pathway.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformations: Stepwise CO2 Insertions into Bridging Hydrides of [(NHC)CuH]2 Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) reactions of gaseous CO2 and solid [(NHC)CuH]2 dimers enabled the isolation of unusual dicopper formate species that are inaccessible by conventional solution reactions of CO2.







Abstract
Mechanistic studies of substrate insertion into dimeric [(NHC)CuH]2 (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes with two bridging hydrides have been shown to require dimer dissociation to generate transient, highly reactive (NHC)Cu&#8722;H monomers in solution. Using single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal (SC&#8208;SC) transformations, we discovered a new pathway of stepwise insertion of CO2 into [(NHC)CuH]2 without complete dissociation of the dimer. The first CO2 insertion into dimeric [(IPr*OMe)CuH]2 (IPr*OMe=N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;phenyl)imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) produced a dicopper formate hydride [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(&#956;&#8208;H). A second CO2 insertion produced a dicopper bis(formate), [(IPr*OMe)Cu]2(&#956;&#8208;1,3&#8208;O2CH)(&#956;&#8208;1,1&#8208;O2CH), containing two different bonding modes of the bridging formate. These dicopper formate complexes are inaccessible from solution reactions since the dicopper core cleanly ruptures to monomeric complexes when dissolved in a solvent.

         <title>Intermediate Formation of Macrocycles for Efficient Crystallization of 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient crystallization strategy is proposed for 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) involving intermediate formation of hexagonal macrocycles. COF&#8208;935 with 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt exhibits a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting when exposed to visible light. Even at a low loading of only 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt, COF&#8208;935 exhibits an average hydrogen evolution rate of 19.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have gained significant attention as key photocatalysts for efficient solar light conversion into hydrogen production. Unfortunately, the harsh synthetic conditions and intricate growth process required to obtain highly crystalline COFs greatly hinder their practical application. Herein, we report a simple strategy for the efficient crystallization of 2D COFs based on the intermediate formation of hexagonal macrocycles. Mechanistic investigation suggests that the use of 2,4,6&#8208;triformyl resorcinol (TFR) as the asymmetrical aldehyde build block allows the equilibration between irreversible enol&#8208;to&#8208;keto tautomerization and dynamic imine bonds to produce the hexagonal &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked macrocycles, the formation of which could provide COFs with high crystallinity in half hour. We show that COF&#8208;935 with 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt as cocatalyst exhibit a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for water splitting when exposed to visible light. More importantly, COF&#8208;935 exhibits an average hydrogen evolution rate of 19.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 even at a low loading of only 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt, which is a significant breakthrough in this field. This strategy would provide valuable insights into the design of highly crystalline COFs as efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.

We show that COF-935 with 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt as cocatalyst exhibit a high hydrogen evolution rate of 67.55&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for water splitting when exposed to visible light. More importantly, COF-935 exhibits an average hydrogen evolution rate of 19.80&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; even at a low loading of only 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% Pt, which is a significant breakthrough in this field. This strategy would provide valuable insights into the design of highly crystalline COFs as efficient organic semiconductor photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Styrenes by Platinum&#8208; Catalyzed Stereoselective Hydrosilylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydrosilylation of unactivated internal alkynes has been developed. Various styrene&#8208;type atropisomers with open&#8208;chained olefins were obtained with high stereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Hydrofunctionalization of alkynes is one of the most efficient ways to access axially chiral styrenes with open&#8208;chained olefins. While great advances have been achieved for 1&#8208;alkynylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ols and analogues, atroposelective hydrofunctionalization of unactivated internal alkynes lags. Herein we reported a platinum&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective hydrosilylation of unactivated internal alkynes for the first time. With monodentate TADDOL&#8208;derived phosphonite L1 used as a chiral ligand, various axially chiral styrenes were achieved in excellent enantioselectivities with high E&#8208;selectivities. Control experiments showed that the NH&#8208;arylamide groups have significant effects on both the yields and enantioselectivities and could act as directing groups. The potential utilities of the products were shown by the transformations of the amide motifs of the products.

         <title>Selective Terminal Functionalization of Linear Alkanes
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step sequential strategy, involving a biocatalytic dehydrogenation/remote hydrofunctionalization as a unified and versatile approach to selectively convert linear alkanes into a large array of valuable functionalized aliphatic derivatives is reported. The reaction goes through a site&#8208;selective functionalization at the unreactive primary C&#8722;H bonds of the linear alkane and avoids the use of linear &#945;&#8208;olefins.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step sequential strategy involving a biocatalytic dehydrogenation/remote hydrofunctionalization, as a unified and versatile approach to selectively convert linear alkanes into a large array of valuable functionalized aliphatic derivatives is reported. The dehydrogenation is carried out by a mutant strain of a bacteria Rhodococcus and the produced alkenes are subsequently engaged in a remote functionalization through a metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrometalation/migration sequence that subsequently react with a large variety of electrophiles. The judicious implementation of this combined biocatalytic and organometallic approach enabled us to develop a high&#8208;yielding protocol to site&#8208;selectively functionalize unreactive primary C&#8722;H bonds.
