         <title>Covalent Adaptable Networks with Mobile Cross&#8208;linking Points</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mobile cross&#8208;linking points enable consecutive energy dissipation and accelerate dynamic bond exchange, thereby enhancing mechanical performance while lowering the reprocessing temperature to overcome key challenges of covalent adaptable networks.








Abstract
Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have garnered increasing attention for their potential in sustainable materials. However, their material properties remain limited by interrelated challenges, particularly the need to ensure ease of processing while maintaining excellent mechanical performance. Herein, we report a class of polyrotaxane&#8208;based CANs (PRCANs) in which an axle containing dynamic boronic ester bonds is mechanically interlocked with two polymer chains, forming mobile dynamic cross&#8208;linking points. The mobile dynamic covalent bond cross&#8208;linking points simultaneously improve the mechanical performance of CANs while reducing the processing temperature. Under applied force, sliding occurs at both ends of the cross&#8208;linking points, creating an efficient pathway for energy dissipation. The representative PRCAN exhibits enhanced mechanical performance, showing twice the elongation at break (1160&#160;% versus 570&#160;%) and tensile strength (11.0&#160;versus 4.6&#160;MPa), and over four times the toughness (43.7&#160;versus 10.1 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) relative to the control with fixed dynamic covalent bond cross&#8208;linking points. At high temperatures, the mobility of the cross&#8208;linking points enhances the reaction probability for dynamic covalent bonds, thereby effectively reducing the processing temperature of CANs. The representative PRCAN can be processed at 110&#160;&#176;C for 10&#160;min, whereas the control sample requires 140&#160;&#176;C for 30&#160;min to reach a comparable reprocessing level.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence with Large Dissymmetry Factor over 10&#8722;1 Based on Flexible Point&#8208;Chirality via Programming at Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small spirocyclic chiral fluorophores (SCFs) with donor&#8211;acceptor hydrogen bonds enable point chirality transfer to induce intrinsic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), driven by significant steric effects. Luminescence intensity and color in SCFs can be tuned by modulating hydrogen bonding through solvent choice. Moreover, the highly twisted SCF framework promotes &#945;&#8208;Helix&#8208;like stacking in a programmable manner, yielding opposite CPL signals and enhancing the dissymmetry factor (glum) to 0.18.








Abstract
In this work, we report a series of small Spirocyclic Chiral Fluorophores (SCFs) with donor&#8208;acceptor type small&#8208;&#960; emitters. These SCFs induce mimic &#945;&#8208;helix supramolecular packing modes via adjustments at the molecular level (e.g., hydrogen bonding sites, positions of fused rings). This approach not only enhances circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) up to 0.18 in assembled materials but also enables inversion of the chiral signal. Moreover, unlike most CPL materials with a single point&#8208;chiral center that are CPL&#8208;silent at the molecular state, the spirocyclic configuration can enhance efficient point&#8208;chirality transfer to the fluorophores owing to the self&#8208;rigidified skeleton, consequently enable efficient CPL with the glum in the order of 10&#8722;3 even in the molecular solutions. The mechanistic insights are revealed by experimental investigation including the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal analysis, as well as DFT calculation. This study opens new avenues for developing organic CPL materials with large g values based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight flexible point&#8208;chiral fluorophores, offering great potential for future applications in biotechnology and circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs).

         <title>Photoinduced Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides for the Preparation of Cross&#8208;Linked Polypeptide Gels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ a photochemical approach for ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers to prepare covalently cross&#8208;linked synthetic polypeptide gels using a photobase and light, which offers significant advantages in the synthesis of polypeptides and holds great potential for applications requiring spatial and temporal control, such as additive manufacturing.








Abstract
Using light to activate chemical reactions is a powerful approach that allows spatiotemporal control over physicochemical transformations, commonly used in the polymerization and solidification of reactive liquids. Here, we employ a photochemical approach for ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of &#945;&#8208;amino acid N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers to prepare covalently cross&#8208;linked synthetic polypeptide gels using light. We apply 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl carbamate as a photocaged amine (base), where the switch in its activity after illumination is a key factor in controlling ROP. The released dibutylamine, as a basic species, can deprotonate the NCA and thereby initiate polymerization. We investigate the effects of 2&#8208;nitrobenzyl dibutyl carbamate on&#8197;&#947;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;glutamate NCA polymerization and apply this approach to prepare covalently cross&#8208;linked polypeptide gels. We demonstrate excellent 2D spatiotemporal control over gelation, further enhanced by the use of an acid inhibitor that prevents overcuring caused by diffusion of active species from the illuminated region. The development of photoinduced polymerization and cross&#8208;linking of NCAs offers significant advantages in polypeptide synthesis and holds great potential for further applications in additive manufacturing.

         <title>Operando Tracking of Hydrazine Intermediate Reveals the Gerischer&#8211;Marcus Pathway for Ammonia Electrooxidation on Oxygen&#8208;Deficient CuO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive AIE&#8208;ECL probe enables the direct capture and quantification of the elusive N2H4 intermediate. Combined with in situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, this operando tracking reveals that oxygen vacancies in CuO steer the ammonia electro&#8208;oxidation reaction exclusively via the Gerischer&#8211;Marcus pathway, unraveling the critical link between atomic&#8208;scale defects and electrocatalytic mechanism.








Abstract
The ammonia electrooxidation reaction (AOR) represents a pivotal process for sustainable energy technologies, yet its mechanism on non&#8208;precious metal catalysts remains ambiguous, primarily due to the elusive nature of key reaction intermediates. Specifically, the role of oxygen vacancies (Ov) in steering the AOR pathway is not well understood. Herein, we directly captured the hydrazine (N2H4) intermediate, which unequivocally confirms the operation of the Gerischer&#8211;Marcus (G&#8211;M) pathway on oxygen&#8208;deficient copper oxide (CuO). This breakthrough was enabled by an aggregation&#8208;induced emission electrochemiluminescence (AIE&#8208;ECL) probe, which allows quantitative, real&#8208;time detection of N2H4 with ultrahigh sensitivity (0.163&#160;nM). The direct visualization of probe consumption via fluorescence microscopy imaging provided orthogonal validation. Combined with in situ spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we establish that oxygen vacancies (Ov) act as a &#8220;steering wheel&#8221; to preferentially stabilize N2H4 and channel the reaction preferentially along the G&#8211;M route. A direct correlation between Ov concentration and N2H4 accumulation is demonstrated, linking atomic&#8208;scale defect structure to macroscopic catalytic performance. This work not only presents a paradigm for probing elusive electrocatalytic intermediates but also delivers a fundamental principle for influencing reaction pathways through defect engineering.

         <title>Chiral Gadolinium Halides with Narrow Ultraviolet B Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first chiral gadolinium halides with efficient circularly polarized luminescence in the ultraviolet B (UVB) region were constructed by coupling the 4f&#160;&#8722;&#160;4f transitions of Gd3+ with chirality. They exhibit high photoluminescent quantum yield, narrow bandwidth and high luminescent dissymmetry factor at 312&#160;nm. The fabricated circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes based on these chiral gadolinium halides also exhibit efficient UVB&#8208;CPL.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the ultraviolet B (UVB) region holds great potential applications in asymmetric catalysis, enantioselective polymerization, and polarization&#8208;based optical anticounterfeiting and information encryption. However, to date, the CPL materials in the UVB region remain unexplored. In this study, the first chiral gadolinium&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halides, (R/S&#8208;C3H7NF3)3GdCl6 (R/S&#8208;3F&#8208;Gd), were constructed, which exhibit efficient CPL in the UVB region. Owing to the unique 4f&#8208;4f transition of Gd3+ ions, R/S&#8208;3F&#8208;Gd shows a high photoluminescent quantum yield of 18%, a narrow full width at half maximum (&#8764;3&#160;nm) and a ultralong photoluminescence lifetime (&#8764;6.6&#160;ms). Additionally, their CPL can be further tuned by applying the external magnetic field. Then the light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) chips coated with R&#8208; or S&#8208;3F&#8208;Gd were also fabricated, which exhibit high dissymmetry factor of&#160;+&#160;9.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;8.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, further demonstrate their potential as circularly polarized light source in the UVB region. Our work offers a novel strategy for designing the chiral luminescent materials with efficient CPL response in the UVB region and broadens the family of chiral organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth halides.

         <title>Unraveling the Role of Molecular Flexibility in Enhancing Pyridine Based Defect Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study on two pyridine&#8208;based passivators, flexible 2PYET and rigid 2PYBEN, reveals how backbone flexibility dictates performance. The flexible core of 2PYET not only enhances defect&#8208;coordinating ability but, crucially, suppresses detrimental molecular aggregation. This facilitates a uniform, ordered passivation layer on the perovskite surface, which is key to achieving high performance and operational stability. 








Abstract
Molecular modulation of the perovskite/C60 interface to reduce defect density plays a decisive role in achieving high&#8208;efficiency and stable inverted perovskite solar cells. However, the impact of substituent flexibility on passivation performance remains insufficiently understood. Here, two structurally analogous pyridine&#8208;based molecules with distinct central substituents 1, 2&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl) ethane (2PYET) featuring a flexible alkyl chain and 1, 4&#8208;di(4&#8208;pyridyl) benzene (2PYBEN) possessing a rigid phenyl core are designed to elucidate the role of molecular flexibility in perovskite surface passivation. Our study reveals that the flexible central substituent significantly enhances the electron cloud density of the pyridine groups, thereby improving their passivation capability, while simultaneously suppressing molecular aggregation and promoting better interfacial contact. As a result, devices modified with 2PYET achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.03% for 0.09 cm2 devices and 24.45% for 1.0 cm2 devices.

         <title>Macrocyclic Molecular Glues for the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP Interaction: Affinity and Cooperativity in an Inverse Relationship</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles are effective molecular glues to stabilize the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP interaction. Linker length modulation uncovered an inverse correlation between the macrocycle binding affinity to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and its cooperativity in 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP stabilization. Co&#8208;crystal structures of these macrocycles in the composite 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP binding pocket revealed structural clues behind this affinity and cooperativity interplay.








Abstract
Molecular glues (MGs) stabilize protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) by simultaneously binding two or more proteins at their composite interface. Macrocycles present attractive properties as MGs, including large contact surfaces to address the often flat and undefined composite PPI interfaces, but their structure&#8208;based design has remained intangible. We have designed peptidomimetic macrocycles capable of enhancing the PPI between 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), a regulatory transcription factor. Biophysical characterization of these MGs revealed the importance of optimized linker length, displaying a reduced entropic cost compared to the linear counterparts, while preserving key contacts with 14&#8208;3&#8208;3. Binding assays demonstrated that the macrocycles selectively and cooperatively stabilized the 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP complex, with an intriguing inverse relationship between intrinsic binding affinity to 14&#8208;3&#8208;3 and cooperativity in PPI stabilization. Ternary co&#8208;crystal structures of the macrocycles binding at the composite 14&#8208;3&#8208;3/ChREBP interface provided a molecular rationale for the affinity and cooperativity differences. Overall, this study highlights structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic features that guide effective macrocyclic MG design and brings forward the crucial interplay of affinity and cooperativity in stabilizing PPIs.

         <title>Digital Decoding of Multicomponent Protein Systems via Nanocavity&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Molecule Raman Fingerprinting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A revolver&#8208;like nanocavity architecture, formed by assembling a gold nanoparticle with a submonolayer protein corona onto a gold film, isolates single proteins with intrinsic Raman fingerprinting. Combining high&#8208;throughput hyperspectral Raman imaging with a tailored machine learning algorithm, this platform enables spatially resolved, label&#8208;free identification of individual proteins in complex mixtures, culminating in addressable decoding maps.








Abstract
The ability to identify individual protein species within multicomponent systems remains a major challenge, yet is essential for next&#8208;generation molecular diagnostics and proteomic analysis. Here, we present a single&#8208;molecule Raman fingerprinting strategy for automatic digital decoding of protein compositions in complex systems. A dual&#8208;amplified, interface&#8208;coupled plasmonic nanocavity architecture synergistically integrates gap&#8208;mode coupling with surface plasmon resonance, generating ultralow&#8208;volume, highly enhanced hotspots that reproducibly confine and isolate single proteins, enabling acquisition of intrinsic Raman spectra free from spectral overlap. Using this platform, we achieve high&#8208;throughput hyperspectral Raman fingerprinting of seven representative proteins. A customized machine learning algorithm trained on single&#8208;molecule Raman datasets enables automatic identification and spatial mapping of individual protein species, yielding quantitative and addressable decoding maps. This broadly applicable strategy establishes an intelligent, data&#8208;driven framework for multiplexed protein analysis under ambient conditions, with far&#8208;reaching implications for molecular diagnostics, biosensing, and mechanistic studies of protein function.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Agent Based on a Confinement&#8208;Activated Fluorescent System in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;symmetric molecular barrel, LSMB, was used to get enhanced emission via confinement&#8208;induced structural rigidification of the TPH guest in water. This emissive host&#8211;guest system displayed efficient antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, specifically higher against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains than Gram&#8208;positive, even in dark conditions, collectively via membrane depolarization, membrane rupture, and intracellular ROS generation mechanism.








Abstract
The influence of host&#8211;guest interactions on the physical behavior of encapsulated species represents a compelling area of study. Research in this domain has predominantly centered on how these interactions affect catalytic activity and the photoluminescence properties of confined guest molecules. In contrast, their potential impact on antibacterial and antibiofilm activity has been rare. In this report, we present antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of a Pd8 low&#8208;symmetric molecular barrel (LSMB) based host&#8211;guest system (TPH&#8834;LSMB) in water. The new low&#8208;symmetric ligand (L) upon self&#8208;assembly with a cis&#8208;Pd(II) acceptor generated a tetrafacial low&#8208;symmetrical barrel (LSMB). Encapsulation of a guest TPH [1,4&#8208;bis(2,2&#8208;diphenylvinyl)benzene], which is otherwise non&#8208;emissive in dilute solution, by LSMB resulted in a remarkable increase in its emission intensity even in very dilute aqueous conditions. The host&#8211;guest complex (TPH&#8834;LSMB) shows better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity compared to the host (LSMB). More interestingly, TPH&#8834;LSMB shows better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains as compared to Gram&#8208;positive strains. This selectivity against Gram&#8208;negative strains provides a critical advancement in the rational design of supramolecular antibacterial and antibiofilm agents. The findings provide valuable insights for the development of next&#8208;generation, light&#8208;independent therapeutic systems specifically tailored to overcome the inherent challenges posed by Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.

&lt;p&gt;A low-symmetric molecular barrel, &lt;b&gt;LSMB,&lt;/b&gt; was used to get enhanced emission via confinement-induced structural rigidification of the TPH guest in water. This emissive host&#8211;guest system displayed efficient antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, specifically higher against Gram-negative bacterial strains than Gram-positive, even in dark conditions, collectively via membrane depolarization, membrane rupture, and intracellular ROS generation mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influence of host&#8211;guest interactions on the physical behavior of encapsulated species represents a compelling area of study. Research in this domain has predominantly centered on how these interactions affect catalytic activity and the photoluminescence properties of confined guest molecules. In contrast, their potential impact on antibacterial and antibiofilm activity has been rare. In this report, we present antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of a Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; low-symmetric molecular barrel (&lt;b&gt;LSMB&lt;/b&gt;) based host&#8211;guest system (&lt;b&gt;TPH&#8834;LSMB&lt;/b&gt;) in water. The new low-symmetric ligand (&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;) upon self-assembly with a &lt;i&gt;cis-&lt;/i&gt;Pd(II) acceptor generated a tetrafacial low-symmetrical barrel (&lt;b&gt;LSMB&lt;/b&gt;). Encapsulation of a guest &lt;b&gt;TPH&lt;/b&gt; [1,4-bis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)benzene], which is otherwise non-emissive in dilute solution, by &lt;b&gt;LSMB&lt;/b&gt; resulted in a remarkable increase in its emission intensity even in very dilute aqueous conditions. The host&#8211;guest complex (&lt;b&gt;TPH&#8834;LSMB)&lt;/b&gt; shows better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity compared to the host (&lt;b&gt;LSMB&lt;/b&gt;). More interestingly, &lt;b&gt;TPH&#8834;LSMB&lt;/b&gt; shows better antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against Gram-negative bacterial strains as compared to Gram-positive strains. This selectivity against Gram-negative strains provides a critical advancement in the rational design of supramolecular antibacterial and antibiofilm agents. The findings provide valuable insights for the development of next-generation, light-independent therapeutic systems specifically tailored to overcome the inherent challenges posed by Gram-negative pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Coupling Mechanism for High Rate Electrosynthesis of Urea on Sulfur&#8208;Coordinated Adjacent Copper Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work prepared a Cu&#8208;based coordination polymer with S&#8208;coordinated adjacent highly active Cu sites, which can promote C&#9472;N coupling and protonation, ultimately achieving ultra&#8208;high urea FE (84.9&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1%) and production rate (0.34&#160;&#177;&#160;0.012&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1).








Abstract
The co&#8208;electrolysis of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize urea can satisfy the comprehensive needs of carbon footprint closure, waste valorization, and sustainable urea production. However, designing efficient electrocatalysts to promote the electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling process and achieve efficient urea production remains a challenge. Here, we design a copper (Cu)&#8208;based coordination polymer catalyst, which can achieve the dual function of promoting C&#9472;N coupling and protonation through sulfur (S)&#8208;coordinated adjacent Cu sites. Through the unique Continuous Coupling Mechanism (CCM) of low Gibbs free energy of reaction intermediates (*CO2&#160;+&#160;*NO to *CO2NO to *ONCO2NO), the resulting catalyst achieved ultra&#8208;high Faradaic efficiency (FE) (84.9&#160;&#177;&#160;3.1%) and production rate (0.34&#160;&#177;&#160;0.012&#160;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1). Moreover, the FE and production rate of urea did not change noticeably during at least 90 cycles of testing.

         <title>Practical Synthesis of Allylic Heteroaromatic Amines via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidative Amination of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidative amination enables direct coupling of heteroaryl amines with alkenes to deliver linear allylic heteroaryl amines. This method solves the challenge of catalyst deactivation caused by excessive metal coordination with heteroaryl amines, offers broad substrate scope, and provides a practical route for late&#8208;stage functionalization of bioactive molecules.








Abstract
Heteroaryl amines are prone to over coordination in the transition metal&#8208;catalyzed olefin oxidation reaction system, which hinders the smooth catalytic reaction. Herein, we report a general method for the direct C&#9472;N coupling between inactive olefins and primary and secondary heterocyclic aromatic amines under palladium catalysis, which is an important transition that has not yet been revealed. By employing commercially available palladium catalysts, quinone oxidants, and inexpensive monodentate phosphine ligands, the oxidative amination of diverse heteroaryl amines proceeds smoothly, delivering a broad range of allyl heteroaryl amines with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Notably, this strategy enables the late&#8208;stage modification of challenging biologically relevant molecules such as adenine and adenosine, further highlighting the practicality and synthetic utility of this reaction.

         <title>Pyroglutamate PTMs as Bioorthogonal Reactive Handles: Ru/Ni Photoredox Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel photoredox catalytic system enables site&#8208;selective C&#8211;N arylation of N&#8208;terminal pyroglutamate residues in peptides and proteins under mild aqueous conditions. This work establishes pyroglutamate as a new, bioorthogonal handle for bioconjugation and expands the scope of photoredox chemistry in biomolecular modification.








Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs) play essential roles in living systems. However, the biological roles of some PTMs, such as N&#8208;terminal pyroglutamate, are poorly understood due to a dearth of chemical and/or biological tools to label, quantify, or identify pyroglutamate residues. In this report, we describe a photoredox catalysis process that enables direct pyroglutamate N&#8211;H arylation in peptides and proteins, using (hetero)aryl bromide reagents. The reactivity demonstrates the potential for multi&#8208;point binding to recognize peptide backbone structures for exquisitely chemoselective modifications in complex polyfunctional environments. The results provide the first chemical tool to modify pyroglutamate residues within complex polypeptides in biocompatible aqueous environments.

         <title>Pulse&#8208;Constructed Cu&#948;+/CuOx Reduces the C&#9472;Cl Dipole Moment to Enable Complete Deuterodechlorination of Trichloroacetic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed electrolysis enables the in situ construction of Cu&#948;+/CuOx dual sites while maintaining their stability, which promotes the coadsorption of the C&#9472;Cl bond and &#9472;COOH group, significantly reducing the C&#9472;Cl dipole moment and thereby promoting complete dechlorination. Over 70&#160;h of electrosynthesis of 20&#160;g of CD3COOH in D2O and the boosted performance of hydrogenation and deuteration of other chlorides, highlighting the prospects of this strategy.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic deuterodechlorination of trichloroacetic acid with D2O provides a high single&#8208;pass deuterium ratio avenue for the synthesis of acetic&#8208;d3 acid at room temperature. However, increasing C&#9472;Cl dipole moments via stepwise dechlorination, and gradual active site deactivation make active and stable complete dechlorination highly challenging. Here, metastable Cu&#948;+/CuOx dual sites are constructed in situ and maintained under pulsed electrolysis, enabling 70&#160;h of stable electrosynthesis of acetic&#8208;d3 acid with a 97% deuterium ratio. Surface copper oxides are formed in situ and then convert to Cu&#948;+/CuOx when the oxidation and reduction potentials are intermittently applied, which enhances C&#9472;Cl adsorption to promote electron transfer to Cl atoms and attracts &#9472;COOH to increase the electronegativity of the C atom of C&#9472;Cl, remarkably reducing the C&#9472;Cl dipole moment and promoting complete dechlorination. The fast electrosynthesis of 20&#160;g of CD3COOH with applications in the deuterium labeling of drugs and DNA bases and markedly increased yields in the hydrogenation/deuteration of other chlorides and bromides demonstrate the methodology's potential.

A novel genetically programmable strategy is developed for in&#8208;situ synthesis of functional quantum dots (QDs) in live mammalian cells with designed protein&#8208;tag&#8208;level spatial precision. This approach enables the site&#8208;specific integration of desired functional inorganic nanomaterials at target protein molecules, even including delicate viral internal components such as nucleoproteins.








Abstract
Molecular&#8208;scale integration of non&#8208;natural functional components into living systems for precise manipulation, monitoring, and enhancement of organisms remains a great challenge. Here, we achieved the geneticable synthesis of functional inorganic nanomaterials with molecular&#8208;level spatial precision within live mammalian cells. By genetically encoding a cysteine&#8208;rich protein tag named 1DFS, and tuning its intracellular inherent metabolic pathways, organic molecules can be precisely synergized with inorganic molecules at a specific site of the protein of interest within live cells to grow a single inorganic semiconductor nanocrystal&#8208;specifically quantum dot (QD). This, in turn, endows the protein with unique fluorescent functions for precise and stable protein labeling even after multiple cell passages. This approach is flexible and universal, and QD can not only integrate into the specific protein in live cells but also synchronously grow on the delicate viral nucleoprotein (NP) during the natural replication and assembly of virions in the host cells. The labeled NPs then accurately assemble into viral ribonucleoproteins deep inside virions, resulting in fluorescent virions with full infectivity that exceeds capabilities of conventional genetic manipulation. This work provides a programmable platform for geneticable growth of inorganic nanomaterials at specific molecular sites, opening a new frontier in precise inorganic&#8208;enabled synthetic biology.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Photoreduction via Ligand&#8208;Engineered Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Sites in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Co sites in bithiazole&#8208;based COF (Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF) enable efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO (16.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 96% selectivity) through enhanced charge transfer and lowered energy barriers versus bipyridine analogue, demonstrating ligand&#8208;engineered secondary&#8208;sphere effect.








Abstract
The microenvironment of single&#8208;atom active sites plays a pivotal role in determining the activity and selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we report a highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalyst, Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF, featuring Co(II)&#8208;bithiazole N motifs that achieve exceptional CO2 photoreduction performance (16.4&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 96% selectivity) under visible light irradiation in the presence of&#160;a photosensitizer and a sacrificial agent. Through isoreticular design maintaining identical Co&#8208;N2O2 primary coordination, Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF exhibits 2.8&#8208;fold higher activity than its bipyridine analogue Co&#8208;Bpy&#8208;COF with Co(II)&#8208;bipyridine N motifs (5.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Systematic characterization reveals the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiazole ligand significantly enhances charge transfer efficiency and reduces the activation energy barrier for *COOH intermediate formation (0.79&#160;eV versus 1.14&#160;eV). Bader charge analysis demonstrates stronger electron donation from Co sites to CO2 (0.63 e for Co&#8208;DABT&#8208;COF versus 0.58 e for Co&#8208;Bpy&#8208;COF), facilitating CO2 activation. This work demonstrates a ligand&#8208;engineering strategy for precisely tuning the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom active sites to achieve efficient CO2 conversion.

         <title>Unlocking the Secrets of Divergent Sodium Storage Performances in Sb and Bi Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi and Sb form alloys with sodium that exhibit similar crystal structures and identical stoichiometries, while their electrochemical behaviors demonstrate significant differences. For Sb anodes, poor volume change tolerance, interfacial instability and sluggish Na+ transport kinetics collectively lead to a Na+ blockade effect, which disrupts the sequential phase transitions and consequently deteriorates the electrochemical performance. While the sequential phase transitions in Bi anodes, mediated by ultrafast sodium&#8208;ion diffusion, exhibit remarkable reversibility during (de)intercalation processes.








Abstract
Alloy&#8208;type anode materials have garnered significant interest for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high theoretical capacity. However, the underlying mechanisms affecting their rate capability and cycling stability remain inadequately elucidated. In this study, we systematically compare the electrochemical performance of Sb and Bi anodes, which belong to group VA and exhibit analogous sodium alloy composition. The results reveal that the marked performance disparity arises from a &#8220;blockade effect&#8221; of Na+ within the Sb alloy intermediate phase, which impedes the phase transformation kinetics. This not only deteriorates rate capability but also induces structural degradation during cycling. In contrast, the Bi anode undergoes a sequential phase transition that enables rapid Na+ diffusion and promotes the formation of a thin and uniform solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). As a result, the Bi anode delivers a high capacity of 325.1 mAh g&#8722;1 even at an ultrahigh current rate of 155.8C (1C = 385&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and maintains a specific capacity of 323 mAh g&#8722;1 (88% retention) after 2500 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, significantly outperforming the Sb anode. The phase transition mechanism uncovered in this work provides valuable insights for the rational design of advanced alloy&#8208;based anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.

         <title>Accessing Molecular Complexity from Methane and Other Gaseous Alkanes via Photocatalytic Cascade Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the cascade cyclization of N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;benzoyl acrylamides promoted by methane and other gaseous alkanes is reported. The current protocol provides an efficient platform for the conversion of feedstock gaseous alkanes into complex and medicinally relevant N&#8208;heterocycles.








Abstract
The direct transformation of simple and abundant feedstocks into structurally complex molecules remains a central challenge in modern organic synthesis. Herein, we report a method for the oxidative cascade cyclization of N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;benzoyl acrylamide derivatives, promoted by methane and other gaseous alkanes. This transformation is enabled by a readily available iron catalyst in combination with N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) as the oxidant, proceeding under mild conditions to afford a diverse array of N&#8208;heterocyclic frameworks in high yields. Late&#8208;stage functionalization studies highlight the utility of methane in the synthesis of biologically relevant scaffolds. Moreover, the Fe/NFSI system facilitates a radical sampling regime that enables the selective functionalization of less reactive primary C&#9472;H bonds. Overall, this work establishes a sustainable and versatile platform for constructing molecular complexity directly from gaseous alkanes.

         <title>Pd/Cu Single Atom Alloys for Selective Alcohol Dehydrogenation: From Single Crystalline to Nanostructured Model Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Model Pd/Cu single atom alloy catalysts were prepared in nanostructured form and structurally characterized. They show an outstanding performance in dehydrogenating butanol to butanal with 100% selectivity &#8211; the property that cannot be reproduced over simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. It is one of the first evidences that the catalytic performance of single atom alloys can be greatly enhanced due to their nanoscopic nature.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on Single Atom Alloys (SAA) play a significant role in numerous technical processes. The fundamental working principles of these systems, however, remain poorly understood, especially the aspects related to the nanoscopic nature of bimetallic particles and the associated structure&#8208;reactivity relationships. In this study, we developed for the first time well&#8208;defined SAA catalysts consisting of Pd atomically dispersed in Cu nanoparticles prepared under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions on model Al2O3/NiAl(110) support. Employing a unique combination of surface sensitive techniques &#8211; scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), molecular beams &#8211; and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we performed detailed structural characterization of these systems at the microscopic level. We demonstrate that Pd disperses atomically in Cu nanoparticles and becomes partly negatively charged. Importantly, these Pd/Cu nanostructured systems show an outstanding catalytic performance in selective dehydrogenation of butanol and exhibit 100% selectivity toward butanal over a broad range of Pd loadings &#8211; the property that cannot be reproduced employing simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. The developed approach for preparation and characterization of these nanostructured SAA&#8208;catalysts lays a foundation for further fundamental&#8208;level catalytic studies on this important class of materials and their rational design for practical applications.

Importantly, these Pd/Cu nanostructured systems show an outstanding catalytic performance in selective dehydrogenation of butanol and exhibit 100% selectivity toward butanal over a broad range of Pd loadings &#8211; the property that cannot be reproduced employing simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. The developed approach for preparation and characterization of these nanostructured SAA-catalysts lays a foundation for further fundamental-level catalytic studies on this important class of materials and their rational design for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile and Selective Biomolecule Pulldown with Combinatorial DNA&#8208;Crosslinked Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a programmable smart polymer system for universal, sequence&#8208;selective bioseparation under native conditions. Polymer phase separation is achieved through combinatorial DNA crosslinking, enabling the capture of DNA, RNA, or proteins in a homogeneous solution with high pulldown efficiency and near&#8208;zero background binding. This method reduces biases in ribosomal RNA depletion for RNA&#8208;seq, while offering long&#8208;term stability and cost&#8208;efficiency.








Abstract
Current methods for sequence&#8208;selective biomolecule isolation suffer from high cost, off&#8208;target effects, and limited flexibility. Here, we introduce LASSO (crossLink&#8208;Assisted Sequence&#8208;Selective isOlation), a versatile platform using programmable polymer phase separation to capture biomolecules under native conditions. LASSO relies on combinatorial crosslinker libraries&#8212;diverse mixtures of DNA strands that collectively trigger the formation of highly swollen polymer agglomerates with near&#8208;zero background binding. We demonstrate&#160;&gt;80% pulldown efficiency for diverse targets, including DNA, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA, and human thrombin. LASSO provides 8&#8211;20x higher binding capacity (4&#160;nmol mg&#8722;1 polymer) than commercial microbeads. In RNA&#8208;seq workflows, LASSO depleted ribosomal RNA with 86% efficiency, while yielding up to 7x fewer off&#8208;target outliers versus state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art magnetic beads and enzyme&#8208;based methods. Thrombin was captured via switchable aptamers with 90% efficiency, and a gentle release mechanism allowed the subsequent isolation of 98% enzymatically active proteins from the polymer. LASSO's cost&#8208;effectiveness ($0.96/sample versus $46&#8211;$51 for commercial kits), long&#8208;term stability (7&#160;+&#160;years), simple usage, and modularity position it to advance diagnostics, transcriptomics, and bionanotechnology workflows.

         <title>A Stable Triindenobenzotrithiophene Triradical with Equilateral Ferromagnetic Spin Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;shell molecular scaffold of triindenobenzotrithiophene is rationally designed to construct carbon&#8208;based oligoradicals having a high&#8208;spin ground state with optimal air stability. By tuning the spin delocalization and distribution features to improve the inherent stability while synergistically exploiting the steric shielding effects to counter the dimerization tendency, a novel quartet triradical showing long persistence in ambient air is successfully accomplished, and its outstanding quantum spin addressability is illustrated.








Abstract
Persistent carbon&#8208;centered polyradicals with high&#8208;spin ground states have received increasing attention for their unique magnetic and quantum technological applications. Yet, balancing the high spin density, favoring robust ferromagnetic (FM) coupling, with chemo&#8208;stability presents a significant challenge. Here, a molecule featuring a central benzotrithiophene fused with three indeno&#8208;radicals is designed to address this dilemma. The initially synthesized trianthryl&#8208;substituted triradical (TR1) undergoes rapid cyclo&#8208;dimerization and yields a stable &#963;&#8208;dimeric diradical. Upon further structural modifications to enhance the steric blocking effect, dimerization is successfully prevented, and a new persistent triradical TR2 is achieved, exhibiting a half&#8208;life time of 191&#160;h in air&#8208;saturated solution and 398&#160;h in solid state. The continuous&#8208;wave (cw) and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, along with superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry, unambiguously verify a quartet (S&#160;=&#160;3/2) ground state with &#916;ED&#8722;Q of 0.41&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. Notably, TR2 exhibits a zero&#8208;field splitting parameter |D| of up to 115&#160;MHz, affording well&#8208;resolved and individually addressable spin transitions, as confirmed by nutation experiments. These features offer a viable organic platform for quantum spin&#8208;manipulation studies.

         <title>Dispersion&#8208;Enhanced Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Photocatalysis of the Direct Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;centered acridine photocatalysts for direct hydrogen atom transfer have been developed, leveraging dispersion interactions to enhance photocatalytic activity. This approach enables diverse functionalization reactions of strong C&#9472;H bonds even under cryogenic conditions and provides a new strategy for boosting the efficiency of direct HAT photocatalysis. 








Abstract
The development of structurally distinct and modular photocatalysts for direct hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has emerged as a key frontier in radical&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H functionalization of strong carbon&#8211;hydrogen bonds. Despite the largely untapped potential across the fields of organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science, few classes of direct HAT photocatalysts are currently known, and the approaches to enhancing their photocatalytic activity remain underdeveloped. We report herein the development of nitrogen&#8208;centered direct HAT photocatalysts based on the acridine framework, which leverage a C9&#8208;ortho&#8208;biaryl substituent for enhancing the photocatalytic activity through stabilizing dispersion interactions with the substrate as the key steering effect. The acridine direct HAT photocatalysis enables an array of carbon&#8211;carbon and carbon&#8211;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions in diverse structural and experimental settings, including cryogenic conditions. It also provides a blueprint for enhancing the photocatalytic activity of direct HAT catalysts by leveraging photocatalyst&#8208;substrate dispersion interactions.

         <title>Facilitating the Construction of Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction via Accelerating the Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) profoundly regulates the performance of supported metal catalysts, but the conventional construction method, high&#8208;temperature reduction in H2, may sinter metal species. This work develops a universal strategy for promoting SMSI by accelerating the hydrogen catalysis kinetics. Through strategically introducing Pt single atoms, the SMSI formation temperature for Ru/TiO2 and Pd/TiO2 is decreased by 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) critically regulates the catalytic performance of supported metal catalysts. Conventionally, a high&#8208;temperature reduction (HTR) in H2 is required to construct this state, a process that involves H2 dissociation, spillover, and support activation. However, while a high temperature is indispensable to initiate SMSI, it also risks sintering the metal species, presenting a fundamental dilemma. Here, we demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by accelerating the hydrogen catalysis kinetics through strategically manipulating active metal sites. As a proof of concept, by introducing Pt single atoms, the HTR temperature required to construct SMSI between Ru nanoparticles and TiO2 is reduced from 600 to 400&#160;&#176;C. The key is that the Pt sites substantially promote the hydrogen spillover from Ru to TiO2, which is inherently sluggish due to an over&#8208;strong Ru&#8211;H interaction. Both experimental and theoretical results confirm the accelerated support activation with the presence of Pt. The general effectiveness of this strategy is further validated by promoting SMSI formation in a Pd/TiO2 system. The results highlight the significant role catalysis plays in SMSI manipulation and provide deeper insights into the SMSI formation mechanism, which is vital to the advancement of supported metal catalysts and beyond.

         <title>Designing Nuclease&#8208;Resistant Enzyme&#8208;Mimicking Assemblies of Oligonucleotides Through Supramolecular Conjugation with Platinum(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional hierarchical supramolecular assembly was formed between nucleotides and a platinum(II) complex through a salt&#8208;bridge interaction. These superstructures, called &#8220;nucleozymes&#8221;, exhibited photoresponsive oxidase&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like function, enabling on&#8208;demand switching of the activity, and showed resistance to nucleases with unaltered catalytic activity.

The utility of oligonucleotides has evolved beyond merely delivering genetic information to playing a transformative role in functional nanotechnology. Specifically, the enzyme&#8208;like properties of catalytic oligonucleotides, including ribozyme, DNAzyme, and their mimics, offer unique opportunities in bioengineering. A primary challenge in leveraging these catalytic oligonucleotide structures in biomedical applications is their susceptibility to degradation by nucleases. Herein, we introduce a high&#8208;affinity (107&#160;M&#8722;1) salt&#8208;bridge interaction&#8208;mediated generalized noncovalent fabrication strategy to construct arrays of oligonucleotide&#8208;templated metal complexes, producing catalytically active hierarchical assemblies displaying resistance to nucleases in human serum. The one&#8208;dimensional isodesmic polymeric growth of the supramolecular structures between oligonucleotides and guanidinium containing Pt(II)&#8208;complex generates Pt&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt interactions imparting luminescence enhancement (8&#8211;10 fold) with long&#8208;lived (&#8764;30&#160;ns) excited states. Consequently, light&#8208;mediated singlet oxygen generation enables efficient catalytic oxidation of substrates. Notably, the catalytic activity exclusively resembles oxidases, which function in the absence of H2O2 (an essential component of peroxidases), unlike conventional nucleotide&#8208;based enzyme mimics. The assembly showcases light&#8208;dependent anticancer activity in vitro, with excellent biocompatibility. Overall, the ease of production and robustness of functional oligonucleotide&#8208;based higher&#8208;order materials, coupled with on&#8208;demand photoactivation of exclusive oxidase enzyme&#8208;like activity, makes the new supramolecular platform a promising candidate for practical biomedical applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Hydride Shift Reactions Catalyzed by Chiral Aluminium Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric intramolecular hydride shift reaction has been developed that is catalyzed by Al Lewis acids in conjunction with a chiral BINOL&#8208;derived ligand. Racemic THP substrates are transformed into cyclohexene products via an intermediate prochiral enone; which undergoes a key 1,5&#8208;hydride shift reaction. This reaction works well on a gram scale, the desired products are formed with very high enantioselectivity (up to&#160;&gt;98:2 e.r.) and the chiral ligand is easy to recover. Importantly, the cyclohexene products contain functionality that can be easily derivatized as exemplified in the paper.








Abstract
An asymmetric intramolecular hydride shift reaction has been developed that is catalyzed by Al Lewis acids in conjunction with a chiral BINOL&#8208;derived ligand. Racemic THP substrates are transformed into cyclohexene products via a prochiral intermediate ring opened enone; which then undergoes a key 1,5&#8208;hydride shift reaction. This reaction is operationally simple, works well on a gram scale, and the desired products are formed with very high enantioselectivity (up to&#160;&gt;98:2 e.r.). Importantly, the cyclohexene products contain functionality that can be easily derivatized and this is exemplified in the paper. Finally, a model is presented for the enantioselective hydride shift that is based on previous DFT studies.

         <title>The Zintl&#8211;Klemm Concept in the Amorphous State: A Case Study of Na&#8211;P Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;established Zintl&#8211;Klemm concept can be applied to amorphous materials just as well &#8212; as is shown here for disordered Na&#8211;P phases that are relevant for sodium&#8208;ion battery anodes. Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven, quantum&#8208;mechanically accurate simulations yiel insights into structure and bonding, and unlock the atomistic modeling of structural changes during battery operation.








Abstract
The Zintl&#8211;Klemm concept has long been used to explain and predict the bonding, and thereby the structures, of crystalline solid&#8208;state materials. We apply this concept to the amorphous state, examining as an example the diverse disordered Na&#8211;P phases that can form in sodium&#8208;ion battery anodes. Using first&#8208;principles computations combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning methods, we provide atomic&#8208;scale insights into the structures and energetics of amorphous Na&#8211;P phases. We showcase the applicability of the Zintl&#8211;Klemm rules in the amorphous state and discuss implications for future&#160;work.

         <title>Hydrophobic Association Enabled Salt&#8208;Concentrated all&#8208;Cellulose Hydrogel Electrolytes for High&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylcellulose and cotton cellulose are combined to create a hydrogel electrolyte containing concentrated ZnCl2. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic association effect that enhances the matrix. At high temperatures, the hydrogel electrolyte provides mechanical and electrochemical stabilization, enabling a zinc&#8208;ion capacitor with a 10,000 cycle lifetime and 85.4% capacity retention.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes have great potential in electrochemical energy storage devices due to their high flexibility, conductivity, and safety. However, at high temperatures, the mechanical stability and ionic conductivity of hydrogel electrolytes are compromised due to water evaporation and unstabilization of polymer matrix. Herein, we propose a salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel electrolyte with its matrix showing hydrophobic association effect upon heating for achieving high&#8208;temperature adaptability. The cotton cellulose supports a stable homogeneous polymer&#8208;salt phase in the hydrogel electrolytes. The methylcellulose works through temperature&#8208;dependent hydrophobic interactions, maintaining the stability of the salt&#8208;concentrated hydrogel over a wide temperature range. An all&#8208;biobased hydrogel with both mechanical and conductive stability is realized at high temperatures (more than 60&#160;&#176;C). We have demonstrated a zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor with a high specific capacity of 250.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 120&#160;&#176;C and 85.4% retention for 10,000 cycles at 60&#160;&#176;C. This work is expected to provide a general strategy to achieve high&#8208;temperature hydrogel electrolyte.

         <title>Reversible Na+/I&#8722; Dual&#8208;Ion Chemistry by Electrolyte Engineering Enables High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Lifespan Energy Storage Device</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible Na+/I&#8208;dual&#8208;ion chemistry enables a high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;lifespan energy storage device. The solvation engineering strategy was performed through the introduction of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaOTf), reducing the desolvation energy barrier by approximately 40%. Therefore, the Na&#8208;I2 batteries achieve a high capacity of 105 mAh g&#8722;1 for 20,000 cycles with 79.2% capacity retention at the current density of 5 A g&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Aqueous battery energy storage systems have driven extensive attention owing to safety, low&#8208;cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the dendrite growth, poor reversibility, and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) hinder their commercial utilization. To address these issues, we first developed a dual&#8208;ion sodium&#8208;iodine (Na&#8208;I2) battery system, incorporating a carbon&#8208;coated Fe0.5Ti2(PO4)3 anode coupled with an activated carbon cathode. This system demonstrates dendrite&#8208;free behavior, superior durability, and excellent reversibility. Impressively, a Na&#8208;ion solvation engineering strategy was performed through electrolyte optimization of sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaOTf), in which OTf&#8722; replaces the H2O in Na+ solvation sheath. Breaking the hydrogen&#8208;bond network of H2O molecules and reducing the desolvation energy barrier by approximately 40% is confirmed by MD simulations, as well as enhancing ionic conductivity and charge transfer kinetics. Accordingly, the Na&#8208;I2 batteries achieve a high capacity of 105 mAh g&#8722;1 for 20,000 cycles with 79.2% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1. Pouch cells with a capacity of 56 mAh achieve a long cycling lifespan up to 500 cycles with the retention of 92.3% at the current of 50&#160;mA. Extended to 1.1 Ah, it also presents outstanding charging&#8211;discharging performance. This work offers a transformative framework for the development of high&#8208;performance aqueous Na&#8208;I2 batteries.

         <title>A Multimodal Ensemble Framework for Optimal Mutant Prediction and Computational Enzyme Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present GEMS, a robust framework for enzyme engineering that leverages the ensemble zero&#8208;shot capabilities of multiple modalities. By integrating evolutionary, structural, and sequence&#8208;based constraints, GEMS effectively models the sequence&#8211;structure&#8211;function relationship and predicts beneficial variants.








Abstract
Exploring mutational landscape of proteins to engineer improved enzymes remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional methods, whether reliant on high&#8208;throughput experimentation, direct evolution, or on computational prediction, often face challenges to effectively model the complex epistatic and long&#8208;range interactions that related to protein function. To address this, we present GEMS, a robust framework for enzyme engineering that leverages the ensemble zero&#8208;shot capabilities of multiple modalities. By integrating evolutionary, structural, and sequence&#8208;based constraints, GEMS effectively models the sequence&#8211;structure&#8211;function relationship and predicts beneficial variants. Benchmarking against state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art (SOTA) methods revealed that GEMS achieves competitive performance in ranking beneficial variants, generates highly informative initial variant libraries, highlighting its strength in capturing long&#8208;range functional constraints. We rigorously evaluated GEMS on five diverse enzyme engineering cases under both pure enzyme (Caulobacter segniscarotenoid cleavage dioxygenase from Marine gamma proteobacterium (MgpCSO), aldehyde dehydrogenase from Dickeya parazeae (DpADA)) and whole&#8208;cell conditions (CYP105A3 from Streptomyces carbophilus (P450 Sca&#8208;2), O&#8208;methyltransferase 1 from Cnidium monnieri (CmOMT1), prenyltransferase from Pastinaca sativa (PsPT2)). Our results demonstrate that GEMS successfully identifies activity&#8208;enhancing mutations, with single variants exhibiting 1.1 to 3.2&#8208;fold improvements in catalytic efficiency. Collectively, our findings prove GEMS as a powerful and versatile tool for advanced enzyme engineering.

         <title>Spiro&#8208;fluoreno&#8208;imidazole (SFI) Emitters Efficiently Harvesting Hot Excitons for Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIEy Below 0.046</title>

         <dc:description>
A rigid spiro&#8208;fluoreno&#8208;imidazole (SFI) scaffold enables a new class of deep&#8208;blue hot exciton emitters. Tailored SFI derivatives exhibit capabilities of ultrafast high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing and efficient hot triplet exciton harvesting. Devices based on tCz&#8208;SFI deliver the remarkable 12.55% external quantum efficiency and CIE coordinates of (0.161, 0.043), establishing a benchmark for deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Hot exciton emitters have emerged as promising candidates for efficient deep&#8208;blue fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), by enabling triplet exciton harvesting through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing. However, limited molecular catalogues impede comprehensive mechanistic investigations and device performance elevations. Here, for the first time, we introduced a novel rigid and steric spiro&#8208;fluoreno&#8208;fused imidazole (SFI) skeleton to engineer high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue hot exciton emitters. Three derivatives, Cz&#8208;SFI, tCz&#8208;SFI, and 3Cz&#8208;SFI, were strategically designed to modulate donor&#8208;acceptor orbital overlap and hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer character. Detailed theoretical calculations and transient absorption spectra clearly revealed the dominant channel of high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing, with a rapid rate constant up to 3.36&#160;&#215;&#160;109 s&#8722;1. Remarkably, the tCz&#8208;SFI&#8208;based OLED device achieved deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with an exciton utilization efficiency of 83.2% and an unprecedented external quantum efficiency of 12.55% by efficiently harvesting hot triplet excitons. The device exhibited stable electroluminescence peaking at 410&#160;nm, corresponding to Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of (0.161, 0.043), setting a new benchmark for deep&#8208;blue hot&#8208;exciton OLEDs.

         <title>Structural Symmetry and Mixed&#8208;anion Engineering in Halopnictides for Extraordinary Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report, for the first time, a synergistic structural symmetry and mixed&#8208;anion engineering strategy in halophosphides, which drives a continuous series of space group transitions in the [Cd4P2][MX4](M = Zn, Mn, Mn/Cd; X = Cl, Br, Cl/I) family and dramatically enhances the second&#8208;harmonic generation response up to 6.6&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2 at 1700&#160;nm.








Abstract
Achieving high nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficients in NLO materials remains a significant challenge. Herein, based on the [Cd4P2] flexible host pore framework, through the structural symmetry and mixed&#8208;anion engineering, different tetrahedral units as the guest are selected as structural directing agents for embedding, resulting in host&#8208;guest halopnictides [Cd4P2][ZnCl4] (space group P21, 1), [Cd4P2][MnCl4] (P212121, 2), [Cd4P2][ZnBr4] (Pna21, 3), [Cd4P2][Mn0.6Cd0.4Br4] (Pna21, 4), and [Cd4P2][ZnCl3I] (Pna21, 5). Notably, we enhance sharply second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) responses (0&#8764;6.6&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2@1700&#160;nm) by synergistically disrupting local symmetry through host framework porosity tuning (54.1% to 63.1%) and constructing polarizable polyhedra via mixed&#8208;anion modulations. Furthermore, millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal (3.0&#160;&#215;&#160;5.0&#160;&#215;&#160;8.0 mm3) 3 is successfully obtained, and possesses a strong SHG response (2.5&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2), a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (3.0&#160;&#215;&#160;AgGaS2@1064&#160;nm), and broad infrared transmittance (2.5&#8211;14.9&#160;&#181;m), indicating the possible promise as a NLO material. This work offers valuable insights for the development of NLO materials through combined structural symmetry and mixed&#8208;anion engineering.

         <title>Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Complexes Based on Terpyridine Bi&#8208;Functionalization for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving precise control over donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) stacking and optimizing through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) for efficient photocatalysis remains great challenging. Herein, we develop and utilize a novel terpyridine bi&#8208;functionalization strategy to construct two non&#8208;noble metal Zn&#8208;coordinated complexes, enabling finely tunable D&#8211;A stacking. The distinct intramolecular stacking modes lead to markedly different TSCT behaviors and photocatalytic performances in hydrogen peroxide production.








Abstract
To achieve precise spatial control of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) stacking and optimize through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) for efficient photocatalysis, we develop a novel terpyridine bi&#8208;functionalization strategy, which utilizes the dissymmetrical 6&#8208; and 4&#8242;&#8208;functionalization of 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) scaffold with triphenyltriazine (acceptor) and triphenylamine (donor) units. Using this strategy, we designed and synthesized two ligands, L1 and L2, differing by a single phenylene unit in length. Upon coordination with Zn(II), the D and A units in the resulting complexes S1 and S2 are precisely edited at the molecular level, giving rise to distinct stacking geometries: slip&#8208;stacked S1 and co&#8208;facially S2. S2 significantly enhances TSCT, resulting in improved visible&#8208;light absorption, prolonged charge carrier lifetime, superior charge separation efficiency and achieves a photocatalytic efficiency (2063 &#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) for H2O2 production that is twice that of S1 without the need for sacrificial agents. This work demonstrates the unique advantages of terpyridine bi&#8208;functionalization strategy in constructing photocatalytic materials with tunable TSCT, providing new insights for the design and functional development of supramolecular systems.

Upon coordination with Zn(II), the D and A units in the resulting complexes &lt;b&gt;S1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;S2&lt;/b&gt; are precisely edited at the molecular level, giving rise to distinct stacking geometries: slip-stacked &lt;b&gt;S1&lt;/b&gt; and co-facially &lt;b&gt;S2&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;S2&lt;/b&gt; significantly enhances TSCT, resulting in improved visible-light absorption, prolonged charge carrier lifetime, superior charge separation efficiency and achieves a photocatalytic efficiency (2063 &#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production that is twice that of &lt;b&gt;S1&lt;/b&gt; without the need for sacrificial agents. This work demonstrates the unique advantages of terpyridine bi-functionalization strategy in constructing photocatalytic materials with tunable TSCT, providing new insights for the design and functional development of supramolecular systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Plastic Waste to Pharmaceutical Precursors: PET Upcycling Through Ruthenium Catalyzed Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new catalytic process that converts real&#8208;life PET waste into ethyl 4&#8208;hydroxymethylbenzoate (EHMB), which serves as a valuable intermediate for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, an insecticide, and a novel polyester.








Abstract
We report here the upcycling of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) waste via semihydrogenation to make ethyl 4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzoate. The reaction is catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer catalyst at 80 &#176;C in bioderived solvents &#8211; a combination of 2&#8208;methyl THF and ethanol. A detailed mechanistic investigation through organometallic and kinetic studies, as well as chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR spectroscopy, provides insights into the nature of active species and factors that promote and inhibit the catalytic hydrogenation of PET. Using this mechanistic knowledge, a record high turnover number of&#160;&gt;30&#160;000 was achieved for the hydrogenative depolymerization of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PET waste (e.g., bottles and textiles). The semihydrogenation product, ethyl 4&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)benzoate, was utilized to make precursors of various known pharmaceutical drugs, an agrochemical, as well as a new and recyclable polyester. A cradle&#8208;to&#8208;gate life cycle assessment demonstrated that using PET waste as a feedstock for EHMB production significantly reduces the environmental footprint compared to the conventional route from p&#8208;toluic acid.

         <title>Combined In&#8208;Solution and On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Fully Fused Cross&#8208;Shaped Phthalocyanine Pentamer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phthalocyanine (Pc) pentamer was obtained through the combination of in&#8208;solution and on&#8208;surface synthesis under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. The resulting Pc&#8208;based nanostructure presents an exact 4:1 ratio of two different metal ions with precise positional control. Furthermore, the pentamer shows a transport gap of 1.15&#160;eV, which is significantly reduced with regard to ZnPc, indicating excellent &#960;&#8208;conjugation over all five Pc moieties.








Abstract
Phthalocyanines (Pcs) are a class of technologically relevant tetrapyrrolic macrocycles that offer rich photophysical properties as well as excellent tunability by means of chemical functionalization. Among such functionalization strategies, the synthesis of multinuclear, fully fused Pcs &#8211; adjacent macrocycles seamlessly fused through a shared aromatic ring into a continuous &#960;&#8208;system &#8211; is particularly appealing for the preparation of new, exotic, atomically precise carbon frameworks. However, the notoriously low solubility of Pcs typically impedes the synthesis of oligomers beyond trimers. In addition, the positional control for specific units in large low&#8208;symmetry frameworks is particularly challenging. In this work, taking advantage of the benefits of on&#8208;surface synthesis under ultra&#8208;high vacuum (UHV) conditions, we present a strategy that allows the on&#8208;surface synthesis of cross&#8208;shaped Pc pentamers. This pentamer, which bears two different metal ions with pre&#8208;defined positional control, shows a small transport gap of 1.15&#160;eV on Au(111).

         <title>Bandgap&#8208;Regulation for Directly Solar Energy Conversion in Zinc&#8208;Air Battery with 4.55% PCE</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;level bandgap&#8208;engineering modulation method based on nitrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (N&#8208;GDYs) was reported for application in photo&#8208;coupled rechargeable batteries. Bandgap modulation created tailored electronic structures of N&#8208;GDYs, enhancing the separation and migration ability of photo&#8208;generated carriers. Bandgap matching triggered the system to exhibit enhanced light utilization.








Abstract
Direct conversion of solar energy in zinc&#8208;air batteries (SZABs) represents a promising direction for energy storage with huge market potential. However, the key issue to be overcome is the pronounced photo&#8208;generated carrier recombination and a mismatch in optoelectronic&#8208;catalytic properties. Here, we report an atomic&#8208; level bandgap&#8208;engineering regulation method to unlock high&#8208;efficiency solar energy harvesting and catalytic activation in SZABs based on nitrogen&#8208;substituting graphdiyne (N&#8208;GDYs). The bandgap&#8208;regulation creates tailored electronic structures of N&#8208;GDYs, which not only extends the light absorption range, but also enhances the ability of separation and migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers. Interestingly, the 2N&#8208;GDY demonstrates superior photocatalytic performance, due to its optimal matching bandgap structure. The resulting SZABs device employing 2N&#8208;GDY achieves exceptional battery efficiency of 96.8% under visible light illumination, accompanied by a remarkably low voltage gap of 0.04&#160;V. Notably, under monochromatic light excitation, the system demonstrates enhanced light utilization through wavelength&#8208;selective absorption, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 4.55%. This work fundamentally advances the rational design of 2D catalytic materials, offering a critical pathway toward high&#8208;efficiency solar rechargeable energy systems that bridge the gap between sustainable energy harvesting and storage.

         <title>Intact Proteoform Analysis by Capillary Electrophoresis&#8211;Mass Spectrometry. Are We There Yet?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometry (MS) and top&#8211;down proteomics (TDP) have emerged as powerful tools to decipher proteoform&#8208;level information, advancing biological insight and translational research. This study unites leaders in capillary electrophoresis (CE) and MS from multiple institutions across the globe to showcase the reproducibility, unique information, and predictability of CE&#8208;MS for TDP analysis for a diverse set of platforms.








Abstract
Mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based top&#8211;down proteomics (TDP) has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing proteoforms to advance both fundamental and translational research. TDP requires high&#8208;efficiency liquid&#8208;phase separation, high&#8208;resolution MS, and tandem MS. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)&#8208;MS has been proposed as a promising analytical technique for protein analysis decades ago because of its unique and valuable features, including high separation efficiency and high detection sensitivity. However, CZE&#8208;MS has not been widely adopted by the proteomics community, mainly due to concerns with its robustness and reproducibility. Here, we hypothesized that CZE&#8208;MS is sufficiently robust and reproducible for broad adoption due to the continued efforts of the community over the last three decades. In this work, for the first time, research teams from around the world validated the robustness, repeatability, and reproducibility of CZE&#8208;MS for TDP in both simple and complex model proteoform mixtures employing a full spectrum of commercially available capillary electrophoresis (CE)&#8208;MS interfaces, instrumentation, and compared CZE&#8208;MS performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art liquid chromatography (LC)&#8208;MS methods. This study offers the research community an informative resource of ready&#8208;to&#8208;use experimental CE&#8208;MS techniques and a better understanding of the CZE&#8208;MS approach and its potential in TDP, accelerating the broad adoption of CZE&#8208;MS in proteoform research.

         <title>An Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Nonporous Adaptive Framework Enables Photo&#8208;Regulated Desorption of Iodine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel nonporous adaptive frameworks (NAFs) featuring with bridged&#8208;azobenzene (b&#8208;Azo) units exhibits a remarkable iodine adsorption capacity (5.8&#160;g/g). The adsorbed iodine molecules can be readily released through UV irradiation, allowing for facile regeneration and reuse of the adsorbents. Mechanistic studies reveal that photo&#8208;regulated iodine molecules release is attributed to the transformation of b&#8208;Azo from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;configuration.








Abstract
Adsorption is one of the most convenient and efficient techniques for capturing and enriching various molecules. However, current strategies for the absorbent regeneration still face the challenges of labor&#8208;intensive and/or environmentally unfriendly procedures. In this study, a novel nonporous adaptive framework (NAF) was constructed through rigid &#960;&#8208;stacked azobenzene (Azo) bridges and flexible non&#8208;stacked amino joints. The precisely tuned flexibility of this framework enables adaptive and accessible pores, and sensitively photo&#8208;responsive behavior. The results demonstrate that Azo&#8208;NAF exhibits a remarkable iodine adsorption capacity up to 5.8&#160;g/g. Notably, the adsorbed iodine molecules can be readily released by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, allowing for facile regeneration and reuse of Azo&#8208;NAF. Mechanistic studies reveal that iodine molecules interact more strongly with cis&#8208;Azo&#8208;NAF than trans&#8208;Azo&#8208;NAF. Thus, accompanying the UV&#8208;induced transition from cis&#8208; to trans&#8208;configuration of Azo units, the trapped iodine molecules are released from the framework. Moreover, this unique feature of Azo&#8208;NAF enables remote regulation of iodine&#8208;catalyzed organic reactions. Our finding thus provides a new design strategy for dynamic frameworks and establish how their switchable configurations can be harnessed for a tunable adsorption and desorption performance.

         <title>Networked Porous Organic Cage Membranes for Precision Separation of Pharmaceutical Ingredients</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we developed a series network membrane with ordered pore structures via interfacial polymerization, using nucleophilic substitution reactions between POCs and diverse secondary&#8208;amine monomers. These membranes showed high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in separating APIs and GTIs within 100&#8211;350&#160;g mol&#8722;1. 








Abstract
Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) membranes play a crucial role in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The synthesis process of APIs typically contains low molecular weight genotoxic impurities (GTIs) that compromise product quality. However, current OSN membranes face significant technical challenges in separating high&#8208;value APIs with molecular weights (MW) below 350&#160;g mol&#8722;1 due to their lack of precisely controlled pore structures. Porous organic cages (POCs), a class of discrete organic molecules with permanent three&#8208;dimensional cavities, feature ordered pore structures, good processability and modularity, making them ideal candidates for fabricating membranes with highly tunable pore structures for precise separations. Here, we report the fabrication of porous network membranes via nucleophilic substitution reactions of POCs. These membranes, with retaining incorporated cavities, exhibit high methanol permeance and excellent dye rejection (&gt;94% for APIs with MW above 368&#160;g mol&#8722;1), outperforming commercial OSN membranes. Importantly, they achieve a selectivity of 13 in removing GTIs from APIs, thereby producing high&#8208;purity APIs. This work highlights the great potential of the POCs&#8208;based membranes for precision pharmaceutical separations.

         <title>A Radical Cascade with Double Intramolecular Hydrogen Atom Transfer for the Generation of Bisfunctionalized Cyclopentanes from Linear Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical cascade process involving the activation of two aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds in a series of five elementary steps converts readily available terminal alkynes into functionalized cyclopentylmethyl arylsulfones. The methodology delivers flexible synthetic intermediates and was applied to the preparation of diquinanes and triquinanes possessing a rare trans ring junction.








Abstract
Radical cascade reactions represent a powerful synthetic tool for the preparation of complex molecules from easily assembled starting materials. The incorporation of an intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer step in the cascade enhances considerably the level of complexity that can be achieved in a single synthetic operation. We describe here an efficient radical cascade process that involves the activation of two aliphatic C&#8211;H bonds in a series of five elementary steps. It converts efficiently readily available terminal alkynes into functionalized cyclopentylmethyl arylsulfones, which are highly valuable and flexible synthetic intermediates, as demonstrated by the preparation of diquinanes and triquinanes possessing a rare trans ring junction. This work illustrates also the unique reactivity of &#945;&#8208;sulfonylated alkyl radicals in C&#8211;H bond activation processes.

         <title>Differential Adsorption on Synergistic Cu&#9472;Cd Sites Enables Direct Hydrogenation in Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic Cu&#8211;Cd sites enable differentiated adsorption of *C and *H intermediates, promoting the proton&#8208;direct&#8208;coupling pathway for selective CO evolution in acidic CO2 reduction. The Cu&#8211;Cd catalyst delivers 98.6% Faradaic efficiency for CO in pH 1.2 electrolyte and sustains high energy efficiency in a PEM electrolyzer for &gt;250&#160;h.








Abstract
The direct involvement of proton in acidic CO2 reduction is key to boosting energy efficiency and preventing carbonate formation. However, the competitive adsorption of proton at low overpotential limits CO production by inhibiting the activation and hydrogenation of CO2 to form the key intermediates, *COOH. To address this challenge, we developed a Cu&#9472;Cd alloy catalyst, which optimizes the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway through a synergistic regulation between dual Cu and Cd active sites. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that Cd incorporation enhances *CO2 adsorption and lowers the energy barrier for *COOH formation. By proving direct electrochemical hydrogenation, our catalyst achieved a remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.6% at&#160;&#8722;1.12&#160;V versus RHE, and operated for over 250&#160;h at a total current of 0.4&#160;A under a voltage of 2.55&#160;V in a proton exchange membrane electrode assembly. This research presents a powerful new insight for high&#8208;performance acidic CO2 electrolysis in proton&#8208;abundant electrolyte environments.

         <title>Plasmonic Hot&#8208;Carrier Redox Enables Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer at C&#9472;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic hot carriers provide unprecedented control over coupled electron&#8211;proton transfer, enabling visible&#8208;light activation of strong C&#9472;H bonds. Using an energy&#8208;filter electrode, we reveal a stepwise electron&#8208;then&#8208;proton pathway and directly tune the underlying driving forces. This work positions plasmonic nanostructures as a powerful new platform for uncovering fundamental reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) enables the activation of strong X&#9472;H bonds (X&#160;=&#160;C, N, O) under mild conditions, yet mechanistic interrogation remains challenging due to limited control over electron and proton energetics. Here, we demonstrate that plasmon&#8208;driven photocatalysis provides a powerful platform to disentangle these contributions. Using gold nanoparticles supported on an engineered energy&#8208;filter substrate as photoelectrodes, we achieve oxidative C&#9472;H bond activation in 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydronicotinamide via multi&#8208;site PCET under visible&#8208;light excitation. Photocurrent kinetics and energetics zone analysis reveal an electron&#8208;then&#8208;proton transfer (ET&#8211;PT) pathway that requires pre&#8208;association of the base. The average plasmonic oxidation potential is estimated at &#8764;0.64&#160;V versus Fc&#8314;/Fc, corresponding to hot&#8208;hole energies of &#8764;0.52&#160;eV. These findings establish plasmonic materials not only as versatile light absorbers for photoredox catalysis but also as mechanistic probes for resolving fundamental PCET pathways.

         <title>Molecular Integration Strategy Enables Simultaneous Modulation of Crystal Growth and Interfacial Energy Loss for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Molecular&#8208;integrated PDA(AcSH)2 enables field&#8208;effect passivation via PDA2+ at the perovskite/C60 interface, while AcSH&#8211; mediates crystal growth and trap passivation. Reducible &#9472;SH in AcSH&#8211; converts I2/I3&#8211; to I&#8211;, forming reversible S&#9472;S dimers for self&#8208;healing and stability. The device achieves 26.88% efficiency (certified 26.4%) with a minimal non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of only 64 mV.








Abstract
Severe interfacial energy loss and inferior crystal quality remain key limitations for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report a multifunctional molecule, 1,3&#8208;propanediamine dimercaptoacetate (PDA(AcSH)2), designed through a molecular&#8208;integration strategy to address these challenges simultaneously. The PDA2+ cations preferentially accumulate at the perovskite/C60 interface, establishing a field&#8208;effect passivation that suppresses interfacial contact induced non&#8208;radiative recombination. Meanwhile, the AcSH&#8211; anions are homogeneously distributed throughout the perovskite layer, mediating crystal growth and passivating charged traps via dual binding of &#9472;SH and &#9472;COO&#8211; groups. The reducible &#9472;SH groups in AcSH&#8211; also convert photo&#8208;thermally generated I2/I3&#8211; species into I&#8211;, forming reversible S&#9472;S dimers that photodecompose under UV light illumination to regenerate &#9472;SH groups. This enables a self&#8208;sustaining redox cycle for dynamic defect healing and enhances both precursor and film stability. Consequently, the optimized small&#8208;area (0.09&#8208;cm2) device achieves impressive efficiency of 26.88% and a non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of only 64&#160;mV. The strategy is readily scalable, delivering efficiencies of 24.92% and 22.73% for 1&#8208;cm2 device and 12.96&#8208;cm2 mini&#8208;module, respectively. This work highlights the effectiveness of rational molecular design in mitigating both bulk and interfacial energy losses, paving the way for the next generation of high&#8208;performance, stable, and scalable PSCs.

         <title>Pulsed Electrolysis Promotes CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products by Suppressing Electrolyte Flooding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
At industrial current densities (&gt;0.4 A cm&#8722;2), pulsed CO2 reduction (p&#8208;CO2RR) in flow&#8208;cell gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) achieves 82.7% C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) by suppressing hydrogen evolution. We identify flooding suppression through dynamic wettability control (instead of CuxO formation) as the key mechanism. Combined experimental and simulation evidence reveals how alternating potentials modulate interfacial wettability to retard flooding for high CO2 mass transfer.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) converts CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals using renewable electricity. Pulsed CO2RR(p&#8208;CO2RR) has been proposed to enhance the selectivity of multicarbon products (C2+), yet mechanistic clarity at industrially relevant rates remains limited by the complex gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid microenvironment of gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (GDEs). Here, we investigate p&#8208;CO2RR in GDE flow&#8208;cells operating at industrially&#8208;relevant current densities. Under cathodic potentials where conventional constant&#8208;potential CO2 electrolysis yields&#160;&gt;&#160;70% H2 (Faradaic efficiency, FE), pulsed operation achieves a maximum C2+ FE of 82.7% at current densities above 0.4 A cm&#8722;2. Operando Raman and UV&#8211;visible spectroscopy indicates that formation of CuxO only weakly perturbs the coverage of *CO intermediates, suggesting that redox restructuring is not the principal driver of pulse&#8208;enhanced C2+ production. Instead, ex situ scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (SEM&#8208;EDS) mapping reveals a strong correlation between reduced electrolyte intrusion and improved C2+ selectivity, with pulsing stabilizing the gas&#8211;liquid interface, suppressing electrolyte penetration, and enhancing CO2 mass transfer. These experimental findings are supported by numerical simulations of electrochemical capillary&#8208;pressure dynamics, which confirm that alternating cathodic and anodic potentials modulate interfacial wettability to retard flooding. These mechanistic insights contribute to the design principles for industrial p&#8208;CO2RR systems, emphasizing hydrodynamic management over traditional catalyst engineering approaches.

         <title>Stability Thresholds of Atomically Dispersed Platinum Catalysts for Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work identifies a critical dispersion threshold for Pt single&#8208;atom photocatalysts. Below this limit, isolated Pt sites remain stable under illumination and deliver up to 82&#8208;fold higher hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity than Pt nanoparticles. Exceeding the threshold triggers irreversible light&#8208;driven clustering following first&#8208;order kinetics. This results in an exponential loss of isolated sites and a sharp rise in activation free energy, defining an optimal window for solar fuel production.








Abstract
The structural fluidity of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts under illumination challenges conventional assumptions about catalytic identity, prompting a reevaluation of what defines and sustains active sites. Here, we show that the site density of atomically dispersed Pt on TiO2 nanoparticles dictates their structural evolution and photocatalytic performance during the H2 evolution reaction (HER). There is a critical dispersion threshold that separates the stable single&#8208;atom state from the aggregative regime with less reactive multi&#8208;atom ensembles. Under optimized conditions, isolated Pt sites resist light&#8208;enhanced agglomeration and deliver HER activities (0.246 s&#8722;1) up to 82&#8208;fold higher than those of Pt nanoparticles (0.003 s&#8722;1), achieving an apparent quantum yield of 9.1%. Beyond this threshold, atomic dispersion deteriorates through a first&#8208;order aggregation process, resulting in an exponential loss of isolated sites and a sharp rise in the activation free energy &#916;&#916;G&#8225; up to 17.1&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses quantify the transition in catalyst architecture and activity, revealing a structure&#8211;stability&#8211;activity relationship. This framework defines a reactivity window governed by the interplay between spatial isolation and structural fragility in single&#8208;atom catalysis.

         <title>Twist and Shine: The Impact of Halogen Substitution on Thiele Hydrocarbon's Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogenation in Thiele hydrocarbons strongly influences structure and excited&#8208;state dynamics. Depending on substitution, &#8220;boat&#8221; folded forms show large Stokes shifts and strong solvatochromism, while planar &#8220;butterfly&#8221; derivatives exhibit near&#8208;unity photoluminescence yields. Halogen substitution thus enables precise tuning of charge separation and responsiveness in functional materials.








Abstract
In this work, two new mixed&#8208;halide Thiele hydrocarbons were synthesized and characterized to elucidate the influence of halogenation patterns on their photophysical properties, addressing the role exerted by steric constraints and electronic effects. Interestingly, their interplay governed a unique spectroscopic behavior that is driven by pronounced geometric rearrangements upon photoexcitation. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations revealed that derivatives with limited diradical character, and correspondingly shorter exocyclic C&#9552;C bonds, are likely to adopt a folded boat&#8208;like conformation in the ground state, a structural motif not previously observed in Thiele hydrocarbons. Upon photo&#8208;excitation, these exocyclic bonds were subject to a significant elongation, facilitating mixing between the bright singly excited (SE) state and the dark, doubly excited (DE) state. These interactions enabled the formation of a zwitterionic excited state, a finding that is consistent with recent observations for halogenated derivatives. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed this mechanism, which provides a promising strategy for designing fluorophores with exceptionally large Stokes shifts (more than 2&#160;eV) and tailored photophysical and electronic properties. In addition, a pronounced mechanofluorochromic response has been observed for the first time in the case of folded derivative, opening the way to the use of these species as multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular materials.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Shift&#8208;Engineered Pt Single&#8208;Atom/Cluster Synergy Boosts Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
Isomeric COFs with identical topology but distinct nitrogen locations enable atomic&#8208;level control of metal&#8208;anchoring environments. Shifting N sites from node to linker reveals their impact on metal&#8208;support interactions and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Imine&#8208;linked COFs stabilize Pt2+/Pt0 dual sites with superior charge transfer, outperforming alkene&#8208;linked single&#8208;atom systems and establishing a general paradigm for active&#8208;site design.








Abstract
Achieving atomic&#8208;level precision in anchoring metal catalysts onto optimal support sites remains challenging due to surface heterogeneity, and the impact of local coordination on dispersion and photocatalysis is unclear. We address this by designing four isomeric COFs (imine/alkene&#8208;linked pairs) with identical topologies but distinct N&#8208;anchoring sites within hexagonal channels. For photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE), Pt anchored on imine&#8208;linked COFs exhibit superior activity compared to those on alkene&#8208;based COF. The optimal PHE rate of COF&#8208;I2&#8208;Pt reaches 26.72&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 which is 6.1&#8208;fold higher than alkene&#8208;linked counterpart. The apparent quantum efficiency of COF&#8208;I2&#8208;Pt reaches 12.1% at 420&#160;nm, representing one of the best performances reported among COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Multimodal characterization confirms imine COFs stabilize dual&#8208;active sites (Pt2+ species and metallic clusters), whereas alkene COFs predominantly host Pt single atoms. The imine system's superior activity arises from synergistic inter&#8208;site charge transfer between Pt clusters and isolated atoms, optimizing proton adsorption and reduction kinetics. Density functional theory calculations reveal the Pt adsorption energy on distinct nitrogen anchoring sites, the excited electron dispersion situation, and the underlying PHE mechanism. This work establishes constitutional isomerism as a platform to decouple anchoring site geometry from chemical composition, providing design principles for atomically precise photocatalyst supports.

         <title>Molecular Cages as Probes in Indicator Displacement Assays: The Case of Scopolamine Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, we show the concept of molecular cages as probes in indicator displacement assays, focusing on scopolamine detection, a drug often used in drug&#8208;facilitated sexual assaults. Drug sensing occurs via the drug&#8208;induced transformation of non&#8208;emissive [Fluorescein2&#8834;Cage] complex into [Scopolamine&#8834;Catenane] and highly emissive free fluorescein. These results open the way to molecular cage&#8208;based sensors for the detection of target analytes.








Abstract
A study of the Pd&#8208;based molecular cage C1 host&#8211;guest properties against fluorescein and the drug scopolamine is reported. C1 forms an interpenetrated structure C12 in the presence of&#160;&#8805;40% water in H2O/DMSO solvent mixtures. The presence of fluorescein (FL) induces the disassembly of the C12 structure to form the [FL2&#8834;C1] complex. Moreover, the addition of scopolamine (SCOP, a drug typically involved in drug&#8208;facilitated sexual assaults) to [FL2&#8834;C1] results in fluorescein release and the formation of [SCOP&#8834;C12], obtaining a fluorescence signal proportional to the concentration of scopolamine with a limit of detection as low as 59.4&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1. A good selectivity for scopolamine against other drugs such as MDMA, cocaine, GBL, and ketamine is observed. This is the first scopolamine detection method described to date using a molecular cage and one of the very few examples of the use of cages in indicator displacement assays. Similar concepts could be applied to the design of other molecular cage&#8208;based sensors for the detection of target analytes.

         <title>Programmable Antigen&#8208;Specific Immunity via Self&#8208;Adjuvanting Nanovaccines Co&#8208;Delivering Immune Modulators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccine&#8212;comprising a covalent conjugate of antigen and adjuvant&#8212;was formulated into cationic lipid nanoparticles smaller than 100&#160;nm to facilitate uptake by immune cells, with supplemental adjuvants incorporated to modulate immune responses. Notably, these nanovaccines exhibited potent immunogenicity in humanized mouse models, underscoring their translational potential as next&#8208;generation self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines.








Abstract
Cancer peptide vaccines harness the host immune system to generate tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, offering potential for treating metastatic cancers and preventing recurrence. However, the limited immunogenicity of peptide antigens restricts their clinical efficacy, necessitating strategies to enhance their potency. One promising approach involves the conjugation of antigens with adjuvants to elicit antigen&#8208;specific immune responses, thereby creating self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccines. In this study, we developed an improved platform for such vaccines. Specifically, the antigenic CH401 peptide was conjugated with the adjuvant (Pam3CSK4) and formulated into cationic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) smaller than 100&#160;nm to facilitate uptake by immune cells, with supplemental adjuvants incorporated to modulate immune responses. Notably, the microflow device iLiNP enabled precise, size&#8208;controlled LNP formulation from various components, supporting the systematic evolution of the self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccine platform. These vaccine candidates demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity, enabling precise modulation of immune responses in an antigen&#8208;specific manner. Notably, these vaccines elicited potent immune responses in humanized mouse models. Overall, this strategy represents a next&#8208;generation self&#8208;adjuvanting vaccine platform, capable of both enhancing and fine&#8208;tuning antigen&#8208;specific immune responses, holding great promise for innovative vaccine development.

         <title>Understanding the Entropy Decoupling for Ion Transport in Ordered Biomimetic Materials Toward Durable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The entropy is decoupled into configurational entropy (Sconf) and excess entropy (Sex) in ordered biomimetic materials, which is expected to promote uniform reaction and high reaction activity simultaneously. The whole ion transport process, from electrolyte phase, interfacial electric double layer to electrode bulk phase, was discussed in detail from the perspective of entropy to enable the highly durable aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) have emerged as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage system, while their development is still challenged by zinc dendrite, gas production, and cathode degradation. Essentially, these issues mainly originate from disordered ion transport behaviors, which is regarded as entropy&#8208;induced side reactions. Entropy is typically decoupled into configurational entropy and excess entropy, which contributes to ionic and electronic distribution, respectively. Uniform ionic distribution with low configurational entropy can alleviate local by&#8208;products, while uneven electronic distribution with high excess entropy will improve reaction activity. However, these both aspects are difficult to be compatible in most cases. As an ideal carrier, the biomimetic materials with specific structure, leveraging the orderliness in morphological structure, molecular arrangement, and charge distribution, exhibit intrinsic advantages in modifying ionic behaviors. This review proposed the significant importance of entropy decoupling dominated by biomimetic materials for regulating ion behaviors. The entire process of ion transport, from electrolyte phase, interfacial electric double layer to electrode bulk phase, was discussed in detail from the perspective of entropy. Furthermore, the mechanism of entropy decoupling for achieving electrodes with both dynamics and stability is systematically analyzed. Finally, we provide outlooks on entropy&#8208;design concepts to enable durable AZMBs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization in Rigid/Soft Layered Oxide Catalyst Regulates Key Intermediates for Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid&#8208;flexible layered CuInAlO4 comprises a rigid Al&#8211;O framework and soft Cu&#8211;O units. Unpaired electrons in Cu dz2 orbitals yield spin polarization, transferring to In3+ via 3d(Cu)&#8722;2p(O)&#8722;5s/5p(In) superexchange. Enhanced spin polarization promotes metal&#8722;*OCHO spin&#8208;orbit coupling, forming an In&#8211;O&#8211;CH&#8211;O&#8211;Cu bridge to boost formate efficiency. Al&#8211;O stabilizes metal&#8208;oxygen bonds, inhibits oxygen dissolution, and accelerates kinetics via spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer.








Abstract
Precise control of metal oxidation states is pivotal in regulating the adsorption energetics of *OCHO intermediate during CO2 electroreduction. However, the stabilization of oxidation states to enable effective intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption behavior remains a critical challenge for enhancing formate yield. Herein, we synthesize a rigid/soft layered oxides (CuInAlO4) with rigid Al&#8211;O framework and soft Cu&#8211;O active units.

&lt;p&gt;The rigid-flexible layered CuInAlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; comprises a rigid Al&#8211;O framework and soft Cu&#8211;O units. Unpaired electrons in Cu dz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbitals yield spin polarization, transferring to In&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; via 3d(Cu)&#8722;2p(O)&#8722;5s/5p(In) superexchange. Enhanced spin polarization promotes metal&#8722;*OCHO spin-orbit coupling, forming an In&#8211;O&#8211;CH&#8211;O&#8211;Cu bridge to boost formate efficiency. Al&#8211;O stabilizes metal-oxygen bonds, inhibits oxygen dissolution, and accelerates kinetics via spin-polarized charge transfer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise control of metal oxidation states is pivotal in regulating the adsorption energetics of *OCHO intermediate during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. However, the stabilization of oxidation states to enable effective intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption behavior remains a critical challenge for enhancing formate yield. Herein, we synthesize a rigid/soft layered oxides (CuInAlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) with rigid Al&#8211;O framework and soft Cu&#8211;O active units. Spin-polarized electrons derived from the unpaired electrons in the dz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; orbital of CuO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; units transfer to the empty 5s/5p orbitals of In&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; via the superexchange interaction of 3d(Cu)&#160;&#8722;&#160;2p(O)&#160;&#8722;&#160;5s/5p(In). The enhanced spin polarization promotes spin-orbit coupling between metal sites (Cu, In) and *OCHO intermediates (O), forming In&#9472;*O&#9472;CH&#9472;O*&#9472;Cu electronic bridge and greatly improving the formation efficiency of formate. CuInAlO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieves exceptional formate selectivity (faradaic efficiency of 95% at 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, energy efficiency of 80.3%, overpotential of 180&#160;mV), outperforming conventional In&#9472;O*&#9472;CH&#9472;O*&#9472;In pathways by reducing the *OCHO-to-HCOOH energy barrier by 1.31&#160;eV.

         <title>Aromatic Pentaamide Macrocycles as High&#8208;Affinity Sulfate Binders and Efficient Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles c5 exhibit high affinities for sulfate binding in organic solvents, which remain significant in water. Macrocycles c5a and c5b bearing hydrophobic side chains facilitate efficient and selective sulfate transport across bulk CHCl3 phases and lipid bilayers.








Abstract
The binding and transport of the highly hydrophilic sulfate ion pose a significant challenge. Receptors capable of both strong sulfate binding and efficient transport are rare. Macrocycles c5, featuring a constrained aromatic amide backbone that convergently locks multiple amide NH and phenyl NH donors, along with five large amide dipoles, create a preorganized, electropositive cavity that binds sulfate in a 1:1 stoichiometry, with affinities (Ka&#8217;s) from 108 to 1013 M&#8722;1 in solvents of low to high polarity. The water&#8208;soluble c5c binds sulfate, forming a 4:1 complex in aqueous solution. Macrocycles c5a and c5b with hydrophobic sidechains serve as carriers that mediate efficient sulfate transport across both a bulk chloroform phase and lipid bilayers. With their synthetic tunability, macrocycles c5 can be tailored to media of different properties, yielding effective sulfate binders and carriers with broad applicability.

         <title>Switchable Reactivities of Metalated Phosphasilenes Regulated by Reversible 1,2&#8208;Metal Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop novel strategies for the facile synthesis of anionic phosphasilenes in the forms of both P&#8208;metalation and Si&#8208;metalation. The P&#8208;metalated phosphasilene displays a pronounced &#960;&#8208;bond&#8208;driven reactivity toward robust inert molecules, whereas the Si&#8208;metalated analogue behaves as a silylene equivalent via a retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;silver migration. 








Abstract
Anionic reagents with silicon&#8208;containing double bonds, M(R)Si&#9552;ERn (E&#160;=&#160;main group elements), have garnered significant interest owing to their unique metal&#8208;mediated reactivity and their potential in transferring the Si&#9552;E unit. Within this domain, the intriguing field of Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes remains uncharted. Herein, we present a novel strategy for the efficient synthesis of P&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes and their subsequent transformation into Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes via a distinctive phosphinosilylene intermediate formed during a metal&#8208;mediated skeletal rearrangement. While P&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes exhibit a pronounced &#960;&#8208;bonding character in the Si&#9552;P linkage, the skeletal rearrangement attenuates both the Si&#9552;P and Si&#9472;M bonds in the resulting Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilenes, rendering them effective silylene equivalents. Moreover, formal transmetallation of Si&#8208;metalated phosphasilene with dimetal carbonyl complexes provides access to a broader array of Si&#8208;metalated analogues. This transmetallation proceeds through the phosphinosilylene intermediate, as evidenced by the isolation of a silylene&#8211;dimanganese complex, thereby revealing an uncharted mechanistic manifold for this class of transformations.

         <title>Chemical Reactions in Cellular Microenvironments Directed by Conjugated Polymers Toward Biomedical Advances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on chemical reactions in cellular microenvironments directed by conjugated polymers (CPs) for biomedical advances. CPs enable in situ biophotocatalytic reactions, precise phototherapies, and dynamic supramolecular regulation of cell signaling. These strategies facilitate targeted cancer therapy, inflammation resolution, and precision cell modulation, offering innovative platforms for next&#8208;generation personalized medicine.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers exhibit unique structural and optoelectronic properties, enabling precise modulation of chemical reactions within cellular microenvironments. This review highlights recent advances in CP&#8208;directed biomedical strategies, focusing on their roles in light&#8208;driven biophotocatalysis, photodynamic and photothermal therapies, and precision cellular regulation. By facilitating targeted redox transformations, gas generation, and supramolecular interactions, CPs provide spatiotemporal control over complex biological processes. The integration of CPs into dynamic assemblies and biointerfaces enables responsive, minimally invasive interventions for cancer, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunctions. Furthermore, emerging approaches that combine artificial intelligence with molecular design are accelerating the development of CP&#8208;based platforms for personalized medicine. These interdisciplinary innovations underscore the transformative potential of CPs in therapeutic modulation, diagnostic enhancement, and the development of next&#8208;generation biomedical devices.

Abstract
Aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs), utilizing redox&#8208;active organic materials as energy storage materials, represent a promising frontier for sustainable long&#8208;duration energy storage. This review highlights&#160;recent advances in redox&#8208;active molecule design, analyzing how molecular structures govern electrochemical behavior and degradation pathways critical to stability. We categorize systems by positive and negative electrolyte pairings, examining performance and lifetime challenges across configurations. We explore molecular engineering approaches and full&#8208;cell assembly principles to extend battery lifetime. By introducing representative studies within each category of redox couples, we outline state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments and establish rational design and pairing principles. This framework proposes guidelines for selecting compatible electrolyte pairs based on molecular properties of organic redox&#8208;active species, which may contribute to advancing stable materials and higher&#8208;performance AORFBs.

         <title>Chiral Plasmonic Sensors: Fundamentals and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript illustrates various chiral plasmonic sensor modalities, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photoluminescence (PL) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Leveraging chemical and physical chiral imprinting strategies, these platforms achieve nanoscale chirality, enabling highly enantioselective molecular recognition and signal amplification across all detection formats.








Abstract
Chiral plasmonic sensors have emerged as powerful tools for the enantioselective detection of biomolecules, addressing key limitations of conventional techniques such as circular dichroism (CD), chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In this review, we introduce a unifying framework based on physical and chemical chiral imprinting strategies to design nanostructures with tailored chiroptical activity. We explore the fabrication of both discrete and assembled plasmonic architectures through methods including top&#8208;down lithography, DNA&#8208;guided assembly, soft templates, and chiral molecule&#8208;directed growth. These platforms have enabled highly sensitive chiral sensing via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)&#8208;based CD, colorimetry, surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photoluminescence (PL), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). We describe the underlying sensing mechanisms, detection limits, and the influence of nanostructure geometry and composition on chiral signal generation. Recent applications in biosensing, disease diagnostics, and asymmetric catalysis monitoring are also highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;This manuscript illustrates various chiral plasmonic sensor modalities, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photoluminescence (PL) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Leveraging chemical and physical chiral imprinting strategies, these platforms achieve nanoscale chirality, enabling highly enantioselective molecular recognition and signal amplification across all detection formats.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral plasmonic sensors have emerged as powerful tools for the enantioselective detection of biomolecules, addressing key limitations of conventional techniques such as circular dichroism (CD), chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In this review, we introduce a unifying framework based on physical and chemical chiral imprinting strategies to design nanostructures with tailored chiroptical activity. We explore the fabrication of both discrete and assembled plasmonic architectures through methods including top-down lithography, DNA-guided assembly, soft templates, and chiral molecule-directed growth. These platforms have enabled highly sensitive chiral sensing via localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-based CD, colorimetry, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), photoluminescence (PL), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). We describe the underlying sensing mechanisms, detection limits, and the influence of nanostructure geometry and composition on chiral signal generation. Recent applications in biosensing, disease diagnostics, and asymmetric catalysis monitoring are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future directions for integrating chiral plasmonic sensors into practical analytical systems, offering a comprehensive overview of their conceptual foundations, fabrication strategies (with emphasis on chiral imprinting), and application landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd&#9472;N4 Sites in MOFs Modulate Oxygen Reduction Pathways for 100% Selective Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion from Oxygenated Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd&#9472;N4 site engineering in MOFs enable modulation of the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during photocatalytic CO2 reduction in oxygenated flue gas. Such CO&#8208;mediated oxygen scavenging mechanism not only mitigates the competition for electrons and protons by ORR but also purifies CO2 reduction products, thereby achieving selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion under aerobic conditions.








Abstract
Direct photocatalytic CO2 reduction in flue gas is significantly challenged by the thermodynamically favored oxygen reduction reaction. While conventional approaches showed promise, the inherent O2 affinity of transition and noble metals prevented full suppression of O2 adsorption and activation, severely constraining the multi&#8208;step proton&#8208;coupled electron transfers required for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway. We therefore envisioned a CO&#8208;mediated oxygen scavenging mechanism by modulating oxygen reduction pathways. Via Pd&#9472;N4 site engineering, the resulting Pd/Cu3(HITP)2/TiO2 composite effectively suppressed competitive oxygen reduction reaction, enabling selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion under aerobic conditions. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations revealed that the Pd&#9472;N4 sites steered oxygen reduction toward CO&#8208;mediated pathways&#8212;thermodynamically and kinetically favored over conventional oxygen reduction reaction, thereby mitigating competitive effects and simultaneously purifying the product. Consequently, such composite exhibited complete CH4 selectivity at 6.7 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under simulated industrial flue gas conditions (15 vol% CO2, 3 vol% O2, 5 vol% H2O, balanced N2). Our work highlights catalytic site modulation and advances a new strategy for photocatalytic CO2 reduction in oxygenated flue gas via pathway&#8208;selective oxygen reduction.

         <title>Pendent No More: Direct Backbone Integration of Stenhouse Salt Enables Multi&#8208;Responsive Commodity Polyurethanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stenhouse salt&#8208;based polyurethanes yield stretchable smart elastomers with rapid color changes (&#916;E&#160;&gt;&#160;50) in response to acids, bases, amines, and nerve agent mimics. These materials retain high elasticity (strain 1100% to 2200%) and enable micrometer&#8208;scale photopatterning via photoacid generators, offering broad utility in sensing and display applications. 








Abstract
While donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) have shown exceptional photochromic properties at the molecular level, their integration into polymeric materials has been limited to pendent group architectures that compromise both switching efficiency and materials performance. Here, we report a versatile strategy to overcome these limitations by leveraging the symmetric design of Stenhouse salts&#8212;structural analogues of DASAs&#8212;for direct backbone integration into polyurethane backbones. This approach overcomes the synthetic hurdles and performance compromises typical of pendent DASA systems, producing mechanically robust materials with strain&#8208;to&#8208;break exceeding 1100% and tensile strengths up to 44&#160;MPa, while delivering fully reversible colorimetric responses (&#916;E&#160;&gt;&#160;50) to trace amounts of acids, bases, amines, and nerve agent mimics. Integrating the chromophores into the polymer backbone eliminates leaching and ensures high reproducibility alongside excellent mechanical properties. Moreover, incorporating photoacid generators allows for micrometer&#8208;scale photolithographic patterning, enabling precise spatial and temporal control of chromophore switching under solar or UV light. These backbone&#8208;integrated Stenhouse salt polyurethanes mark a significant advancement over pendent chromophore systems, transforming conventional elastomers into versatile, responsive materials for applications ranging from food packaging and security to protective gear and medical devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Engineered DPP Polymers: Synergistic Hydrogen Bonding and Ring&#8208;Fusion for High&#8208;Mobility Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;B) enhances intermolecular interaction, enabling localized ordered molecular packing. Ring fusion (R&#8208;F) further intensifies this effect while extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation and optimizing energy levels. As a result, polymer P&#8208;HF (featuring both H&#8208;B and R&#8208;F effects) achieves an outstanding &#956;h of 5.02&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing that of H&#8208;B&#8208;only polymer P&#8208;H (2.13&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and reference polymer P&#8208;B (0.71&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). This performance ranks P&#8208;HF among the highest reported for DPP&#8208;based polymers.








Abstract
Developing simple and effective molecular design strategies to optimize charge transport mobility remains a key challenge in high&#8208;performance organic semiconductors. In this study, we integrate&#160;hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;B)&#160;and&#160;ring&#8208;fusion (R&#8208;F)&#160;into a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer, yielding a novel material,&#160;P&#8208;HF. For comparison, a reference polymer (P&#8208;B) and a hydrogen&#8208;bonded analogue (P&#8208;H) were synthesized. The synergistic effects of H&#8208;B and R&#8208;F dramatically not only enhance both inter&#8208; and intramolecular charge transport but also optimize the frontier orbital levels; H&#8208;B strengthens intermolecular interactions, enabling localized ordered molecular packing and tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, while R&#8208;F further amplifies these effects meanwhile improving backbone planarity, extending &#960;&#8208;conjugation, and optimizing frontier orbital levels. As a result, P&#8208;HF achieves an outstanding hole mobility of 5.02&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing P&#8208;B (0.71&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and P&#8208;H (2.13&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), placing it among the highest&#8208;performing DPP&#8208;based polymers reported. This work demonstrates that combining R&#8208;F and H&#8208;B offers a viable strategy for designing high&#8208;mobility conjugated materials, potentially advancing organic semiconductor development. This dual&#8208;engineering strategy is particularly suitable for &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers containing both hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and ring&#8208;fused backbones.

The synergistic effects of H-B and R-F dramatically not only enhance both inter- and intramolecular charge transport but also optimize the frontier orbital levels; H-B strengthens intermolecular interactions, enabling localized ordered molecular packing and tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, while R-F further amplifies these effects meanwhile improving backbone planarity, extending &#960;-conjugation, and optimizing frontier orbital levels. As a result, P-HF achieves an outstanding hole mobility of 5.02&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing P-B (0.71&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and P-H (2.13&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), placing it among the highest-performing DPP-based polymers reported. This work demonstrates that combining R-F and H-B offers a viable strategy for designing high-mobility conjugated materials, potentially advancing organic semiconductor development. This dual-engineering strategy is particularly suitable for &#960;-conjugated polymers containing both hydrogen-bonding sites and ring-fused backbones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Sandwich&#8208;Based Particle Nanoswitch for Continuous Protein Monitoring at Picomolar Concentrations with Automated Calibration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible particle nanoswitch sensor enables continuous protein monitoring by forming transient sandwich complexes in the presence of analyte molecules. Site&#8208;specific conjugations ensure optimal antibody fragment orientation. Demonstrated for lactoferrin, the sensor achieves picomolar sensitivity with &#8764;12&#160;min time delay and continuous measurements over more than 12&#160;h. Automated calibration keeps deviations below 10%, suitable for long&#8208;term bioprocess monitoring.








Abstract
Continuous monitoring of specific proteins is essential for understanding the dynamics of biological systems and for enabling real&#8208;time measurement&#8208;and&#8208;control strategies in bioprocesses. Ideally, sensors for continuous monitoring should be intrinsically reversible and able to perform accurate measurements over long time spans. Here, we present a particle nanoswitch sensor containing two different antibody fragments that bind reversibly to a protein of interest and thus form transient sandwich complexes. The antibody fragments are incorporated into the sensor using site&#8208;specific conjugation strategies to achieve optimal antibody orientation. Short&#8208;lived sandwich complexes are detected with single&#8208;molecule resolution, by tracking the motion of tethered particles. The sensing concept is demonstrated for lactoferrin, an iron&#8208;binding and immune&#8208;modulating protein. We show continuous measurements of picomolar concentrations, with a delay time of less than 12&#160;min, over a monitoring period of more than 12&#160;h. Automated calibration strategies are described that result in a mean absolute relative difference below 10% compared to reference measurements. These results demonstrate how rapid continuous protein sensing at picomolar concentrations can be achieved using reversible sandwich&#8208;based particle nanoswitches, enabling long&#8208;term monitoring of dynamic bioprocesses.

         <title>Targeting Aurora Kinases as Essential Cell&#8208;Cycle Regulators to Deliver Multi&#8208;Stage Antimalarials Against Plasmodium Falciparum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we repurposed human Aurora kinase&#8208;specific inhibitors to identify potential antimalarial agents. Two inhibitors, hesperadin and TAE684, exhibited sub&#8208;micromolar activity across multiple parasite stages, with hesperadin demonstrating significant potency and selectivity by specifically targeting PfArk1. Inhibition of PfArk1 resulted in anaphase&#8208;like abnormalities, pointing to its role as the primary PfArk for cell division in malaria parasites.








Abstract
Kinases play critical roles in the development and adaptation of Plasmodium falciparum and present novel opportunities for chemotherapeutic intervention. Mitotic kinases that regulate the proliferation of the parasites by controlling nuclear division, segregation, and cytokinesis. We evaluated the potential of human Aurora kinase (Aur) inhibitors to prevent P. falciparum development by targeting members of the Aurora&#8208;related kinase (Ark) family in this parasite. Several human AurB inhibitors exhibited multistage potency (&lt; 250&#160;nM) against all proliferative stages of parasite development, including asexual blood stages, liver schizonts, and male gametes. The most potent compounds, hesperadin, TAE684, and AT83, exhibited&#160;&gt;&#160;1000x selectivity towards the parasite. Importantly, we identified PfArk1 as the principal vulnerable Ark family member, with specific inhibition of PfArk1 as the primary target for hesperadin. Hesperadin's whole&#8208;cell and protein activity validates it as a unique PfArk1 tool compound. Inhibition of PfArk1 results in the parasite's inability to complete mitotic processes, presenting with unsegregated, multi&#8208;lobed nuclei caused by aberrant microtubule organization. This suggests PfArk1 is the main Aur mitotic kinase in proliferative stages of Plasmodium, characterized by bifunctional AurA and B activity. This paves the way for drug&#8208;discovery campaigns based on hesperadin targeting PfArk1.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Pyritide&#8208;Inspired Macrocycles Featuring Bipyridine Motifs</title>

A pyritide&#8208;inspired build/couple/pair strategy yields a diverse macrocycle library. This approach expands chemical space and enables the discovery of 6paW, a potent anti&#8208;ferroptotic agent.








Abstract
Macrocycles represent a promising class of drug&#8208;like scaffolds with unique structural features and the ability to engage challenging targets such as protein&#8211;protein interactions. Inspired by structural characteristics of pyritides, we constructed a library of 27 diverse macrocycles via a build/couple/pair approach, enabled by efficient synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;based triaryl building blocks through azaindole cleavage. Kinetic and cheminformatic analyses confirmed both reactivity trends and structural diversity. From this library, we identified a potential ferroptosis inhibitor, 6paW, with clear structure&#8211;activity relationships, validating our diversity&#8208;oriented synthesis platform. This strategy offers a robust approach to macrocycle library design, expanding opportunities for targeting previously inaccessible biological space.

         <title>Achieving Charge&#8208;Transfer from the Boron&#8208;Vertices of o&#8208;Carborane: Dual&#8208;Emission with a Shift of 505 nm (2.1&#160;eV)</title>

         <dc:description>
For a long time, it has been believed that the boron&#8208;verticals of o&#8208;carborane are inert to electron communication between carborane and &#960;&#8208;substituents. Herein, we demonstrate the 9,12&#8208;boron vertices of o&#8208;carborane can be engineered to participate in intense charge&#8208;transfer transitions, leading to unprecedented dual emission in the UV and NIR regions, with a gap of up to 505&#160;nm (2.1&#160;eV) between bands.








Abstract
The boron&#8208;vertices of o&#8208;carborane have long been considered to be inert in conjugation with &#960;&#8208;substituents. Herein, we demonstrate that the boron vertices of o&#8208;carborane can be engineered to participate in intense charge&#8208;transfer (CT) transitions. Through strategic design&#8212;appending electron&#8208;donating carbazoles at the boron vertices&#8212;we synthesized three 9,12&#8208;substituted o&#8208;carboranes (1, 2a, and 2b). While 1 only shows LE emission, compounds 2a and 2b, which contain phenyl groups at the carbon vertices, show unprecedented dual emission with a colossal gap of up to 505&#160;nm (2.1&#160;eV) between bands. Photophysical and theoretical studies reveal that photoexcitation triggers a unidirectional conversion from a locally excited (LE) state to a CT state, yielding the first direct evidence of CT from a boron&#8208;functionalized donor into the carborane cage. This CT emission is highly sensitive to environment, exhibiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement with quantum yields reaching 80%. Our findings disrupt the longstanding carbon&#8208;centric view of carborane&#8208;based luminescence, unveiling a new strategy to activate boron&#8208;vertex participation in electronic conjugation, opening a pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;emissive materials based on o&#8208;carborane.

Photophysical and theoretical studies reveal that photoexcitation triggers a unidirectional conversion from a locally excited (LE) state to a CT state, yielding the first direct evidence of CT from a boron-functionalized donor into the carborane cage. This CT emission is highly sensitive to environment, exhibiting aggregation-induced emission enhancement with quantum yields reaching 80%. Our findings disrupt the longstanding carbon-centric view of carborane-based luminescence, unveiling a new strategy to activate boron-vertex participation in electronic conjugation, opening a pathway for the development of high-performance dual-emissive materials based on &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Rapid Moisture&#8208;Driven Actuation and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an ionic covalent organic framework membrane that responds to humidity within1 s, enabling reversible bending, sensing, and switching behaviors. The integration of guanidinium linkers enhances water affinity and structural adaptability. With high mechanical resilience and environmental responsiveness, the membrane offers promising potential for smart actuators, soft electronics, and moisture sensing applications.








Abstract
The development of smart materials capable of rapid and reversible responses to ambient humidity is essential for next&#8208;generation sensors, monitoring systems, and adaptive devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with their tunable porosity and designable architectures, represent a promising class of materials for such stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, yet practical implementation remains limited. In this study, we report a self&#8208;standing ionic COF membrane, synthesized by integrating hydrogen&#8208;bonding ionic functionalities into the framework backbone. This rational design endows the membrane with exceptional moisture&#8208;driven actuation and sensing behavior. The unique hydrogen bonding interactions within the framework facilitate rapid water uptake and release, enabling a rapid response time of&#160;1&#160;s. The membrane demonstrates excellent mechanical flexibility, high water sorption capacity, and robust cycling durability. Results from DFT calculations and MD simulations revealed that water molecules could strongly adsorb onto the membrane via hydrogen bonding to modulate its micropore structure and facilitate its responsive behavior. Furthermore, its responsive behavior to subtle humidity changes makes it suitable for applications such as human&#8208;interfacing soft actuators, smart switches, and soil moisture sensors. This study highlights the utility of ionic COF membranes as a versatile platform for creating next&#8208;generation intelligent materials.

         <title>Functionalization of Polyolefins via Catalytic Nitrene Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the strategy of metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer for the formation of carbon&#8211;nitrogen bonds onto polybutadienes as polyolefin models. This post&#8208;functionalization methodology is not only efficient but also provides the control of the degree of functionalization. The latter nicely correlates with polymer properties such as the Tg. The process occurs without affecting the polymer structure, with no chain scission nor cross&#8208;linking side reactions.








Abstract
The post&#8208;polymerization functionalization of polyolefins has emerged as a key tool for obtaining new materials with enhanced properties. With an array of approaches being already reported, the incorporation of N&#8208;containing fragments en route to the generation of amino groups in yet scarce and not disclosed for the metal&#8208;catalyzed nitrene transfer strategy. Here we introduce such tactics employing silver&#8208;based catalysts for the incorporation of nitrene NTs (Ts&#160;=&#160;p&#8208;toluenesulfonyl) groups to commercially available polybutadienes. The process occurs at room temperature without appreciable chain scission or cross&#8208;linking processes and enables precise control of the degree of functionalization. Thermal analyses demonstrate a correlation between such degree and the Tg values of the functionalized polymers.

         <title>Elucidating Ligand&#8208;Dependent Selectivities in Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8211;H Activations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies to understand ligand effects on regioselectivities of C&#8211;H activation processes were investigated using an alkynylation of thiophenes as a model system. The results shed light on the role of dispersion models for the correct prediction of reaction outcomes and propose new roles for the solvent and silver additive. The utility of multivariate linear regression in predicting selectivities across mechanistic regimes is demonstrated.








Abstract
Achieving regioselectivity in C&#8211;H activation remains a major challenge. Controlling or even reversing the regioisomeric outcome through the choice of ligand is even harder to achieve, let alone to predict. In this study, we investigated ligand effects in the regioselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed alkynylation of thiophenes using multivariate linear regression to build predictive models that offer deeper insight into the structural factors driving regioselectivity and enabled the discovery of a more selective ligand. Combining experimental and DFT studies, we propose a Curtin&#8211;Hammett scenario between the C&#8211;H activation and migratory insertion as the origin of the ligand&#8208;controlled selectivities. A detailed investigation of solvent effects uncovered an inadequate description of solvent&#8208;solute dispersion interactions by implicit solvation models. The crucial role of the solvent in substrate coordination is further evidenced by an inverse solvent kinetic isotope effect. Additionally, the often poorly understood role of silver was scrutinized, showing that it serves to mitigate a detrimental side reaction. This study provides generalizable insights for the computational description of challenging regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities and is expected to aid future mechanistic investigations in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation that holistically consider the role of all reaction components.

         <title>Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Layered CuGe2Se3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly discovered CuGe2Se3 adopts a layered structure with surprisingly short Cu&#9472;Ge and Ge&#9472;Ge contacts, characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and solid&#8208;state (SS) NMR. Electronic structure analysis rationalizes the stability of this unique structural framework. CuGe2Se3 exhibits promising thermoelectric (TE) performance, with a high Seebeck coefficient (&#8764;374 &#181;V&#183;K&#8722;1) and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.35 W&#183;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1) at 755&#160;K. 








Abstract
Unraveling the relationship between thermodynamic factors, interatomic interactions, and electronic structure remains a crucial yet elusive challenge in the discovery of novel materials in solid&#8208;state (SS) chemistry. In the quest for new thermoelectric (TE) materials, we overcame that fundamental problem for the case of CuGe2Se3, whose synthesis, unique crystal structure, and transport properties are reported herein. The giant two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure of CuGe2Se3, consisting of Se/(Cu&#9472;Ge)/Se and Se/(Ge&#9472;Ge)/Se slabs stacked along the c&#8208;axis, exhibits short Cu&#9472;Ge and Ge&#9472;Ge interactions, as evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and SS NMR spectroscopic studies. These homopolar bonds might be surprising, as such interactions are rarely observed in group IV&#8208;chalcogenides. The compound is thermally stable up to &#8764;823&#160;K. Transport properties measurements revealed a high Seebeck coefficient (&#8764;373.6 &#181;V&#183;K&#8722;1) and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.35 W&#183;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1) at 755&#160;K, ascribed to its weak bonding interactions. We followed up with a theoretical analysis to gain insight into its structural peculiarities, focusing on vibrational properties and the nature of chemical bonding. The formation of Ge&#9472;Ge bonds is favored in light of the presence of multicenter bonds, which receive contributions from stereochemically non&#8208;active Ge lone pairs.

         <title>Deep Depolymerization of Lignin via Reductive Acidolysis Yielding Copious Aromatics Thoroughly Revealed by NMR Chromatography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep depolymerization via reductive acidolysis of real lignins as well as a relatively large set of model compounds was achieved to a satisfactory level in a reaction medium consisted of [Bmim]I/organic acids, resulting in a conversion rate near completion for model compounds and a yield up to 81&#160;wt% of depolymerized products for real lignins.








Abstract
Depolymerization is the cornerstone of lignin valorization. Although this field of research has advanced significantly in the past decade, there are still obstacles preventing large&#8208;scale application. The high cost of precious metal catalysts and the use of pressurized hydrogen gas account for some of the limitations. In this work, it is designed to synergize the reductive acidolytic power of hydrogen iodide and the advantageous physicochemical properties of ionic liquids (ILs) as green solvents for the deep depolymerization of real lignin. The results showed that nearly 100% of model compounds were converted in the reaction medium comprising 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3 methylimidazolium iodide ([Bmim]I) plus organic acids and a yield up to 81&#160;wt% of depolymerized products of low molecular weights was achieved for real lignins. In addition, a detailed structural assignment of the products was made straightforward by nuclear magnetic resonance chromatography. The advantages of the [Bmim]I/organic acids demonstrated in this study are featured by mild reaction conditions, easy scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, paving the way toward the democratization of lignin&#8208;derived products.

         <title>Four Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Mediate Oxidation Cascades in the Biosynthesis of Cephalotane&#8208;Type Diterpenoids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel cytochrome P450 enzymes, CsCYP1&#8211;CsCYP4, were functionally characterised for catalysing the formation of the characteristic 13,17&#8208;lactone, 5,19&#8208;lactone, and tropone moieties in the biosynthesis of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids. Accordingly, the co&#8208;expression of these characterised CYP450 enzymes along with cephalotene synthase (CsCTS) in Nicotiana benthamiana enables the production of a wide range of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids.








Abstract
Cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids, a class of natural products exclusively found in Cephalotaxus plants, are well known for their attractive structures and potent biological activities. However, their low natural abundance and intricate cage&#8208;like structures hinder their accessibility. Recently, the identification of a cephalotene synthase (CsCTS) has addressed the first committed step in the biosynthesis. However, the enzymes involved in the complex post&#8208;modification of the cephalotene core into structurally diverse cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids remain obscure. In this study, we functionally characterised four novel cytochrome P450 enzymes from C. sinensis. These enzymes demonstrate multiple oxidative functions and cooperatively catalyse a cascade of oxidation reactions, including the formation of signature 13,17&#8208;lactone, 5,19&#8208;lactone, and tropone. We further co&#8208;expressed the characterised CYP450 enzymes in combination with CsCTS to produce a variety of cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids, including hainanolidol (2), mannolide C (3), mannolide A (4), and cephinoid H (5), in Nicotiana benthamiana. Subsequently, harringtonolide (1) was chemically converted from hainanolidol (3.9&#160;&#181;mol with 10 equiv of Pb(OAc)4) in 87.5% yield. In this study, the biosynthetic pathways of representative cephalotane&#8208;type diterpenoids were elucidated and reconstructed, thereby establishing a foundation for their sustainable production through biosynthesis and/or chemo&#8208;biosynthesis, highlighting the remarkable efficiency of merely five Cephalotaxus&#8208;specific enzymes in assembling such structurally complex natural products.

         <title>A&#8208;Site Cation&#8208;Regulated Operando Restructuring of Cu&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides for Selective Carbon Monoxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>

Tunable Cu&#8208;based perovskites demonstrate that A&#8208;site chemistry dictates catalyst reconstruction and CO reduction selectivity. Alkaline&#8208;earth A&#8208;sites induce Cu clustering to promote C2+ formation, whereas rare&#8208;earth A&#8208;sites stabilize Cu+ species favoring CH4. Operando spectroscopy and DFT highlight A&#8208;site&#8211;dependent Cu&#8211;O interactions as the governing design principle.








Abstract
Understanding the correlation between surface catalytic motifs and electrochemical reaction pathways is crucial for the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts, yet remains hindered by the dynamic reconfiguration of active sites under operating conditions. In this study, we establish a tunable platform based on a series of Cu&#8208;based perovskite oxides with systematically varied A&#8208;site cations to investigate how A&#8208;site chemistry regulates the structural dynamics of Cu and its interplay with the carbon monoxide reduction (COR) pathway. Operando spectroscopic analyses reveal that those perovskites with alkaline&#8208;earth A&#8208;site cations promote Cu clustering into metallic states, favoring multicarbon product formation. In contrast, rare&#8208;earth A&#8208;site perovskites stabilize surface Cu+ species through strong Cu&#8211;O interactions, thereby enhancing the selectivity of methane. Complementary theoretical calculations further demonstrate that the Cu&#9472;O bond strength&#8212;modulated by A&#8208;site composition&#8212;dictates the electrochemical stability of Cu active sites. These findings underscore the pivotal role of local coordination environments in steering catalyst reconstruction and product distribution, and provide guiding principles for A&#8208;site engineering in perovskite&#8208;based COR catalysts.

         <title>Mechanical Constraints Promote Noncanonical Base&#8208;Pairing Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA nanobenders were designed to introduce mechanical constraints to single&#8208;stranded DNA/RNA by forming loop structures, allowing modulation of mechanical parameters and visualization of weak interactions via multivalent cooperative binding. Results suggest that mechanical constraints promote noncanonical base&#8208;pairing, likely through entropy compensation and hydrophobic exposure. 








Abstract
Mechanical perturbations profoundly influence nucleobase interactions in cells, serving as key modulators of fundamental cellular processes such as transcriptional regulation. However, their precise roles remain elusive due to methodological limitations. Here, we have developed a DNA origami&#8208;based nanobender system that probes base&#8211;base interactions under mechanical constraints. This system imposes tunable geometric and mechanical constraints on single&#8208;stranded DNA/RNA by pulling its two ends together while adjusting its contour length, and enables the assessment of weak interactions between bases through the detection of DNA origami dimerization. Combining experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we speculate that mechanical constraints promote stacking&#8208;driven noncanonical base&#8208;pairing via entropy compensation and favorable nucleobase orientation (hydrophobic exposure), advancing our understanding of base recognition diversity. Customizable nanobender parameters allow investigation of the effects of geometric and mechanical constraints on hybridization thermodynamics across DNA&#8208;DNA, RNA&#8208;RNA, DNA&#8208;RNA, and epigenetically modified nucleotides. Notably, we suggest that entropy modulation mediated by mechanical constraints enables fine&#8208;tuning of binding free energy, thereby expanding material assembly applications while conferring environmental sensitivity.

We propose a novel strategy based on multifunctional hole transport interface molecules, which integrate hole&#8208;transporting groups with defect&#8208;passivating units. This dual&#8208;function design enables effective defect passivation, improved energy level alignment, and efficient carrier extraction, leading to an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 25.83% and excellent operational stability, highlighting its far&#8208;reaching significance for the long&#8208;term advancement of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Interface engineering has emerged as an effective strategy to address interface defects and energy level misalignment between the perovskite and hole transport layer (HTL). Herein, three novel multifunctional hole interface molecules with distinct substituents were designed to passivate defects at the perovskite/HTL interface. These molecules integrate hole&#8208;transporting groups with passivating units, enabling effective defect passivation, improved energy level alignment, and facilitating efficient carrier extraction. Among the three hole transport interface molecules (HTIMs), the 3&#8208;(3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(bis(4&#8208;(methylthio)phenyl)amino)phenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)hexan&#8208;1&#8208;amine hydroiodide (MeS&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cbz&#8208;HAI), comprising &#8208;MeS and HAI units, exhibited superior interface passivation capability and greater chemical compatibility with 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;Tetrakis (N,N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamine)&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD), leading to a reduction in defect density and enhanced hole transport. Consequently, the device based on MeS&#8208;TPA&#8208;Cbz&#8208;HAI achieved a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.83%. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained 94% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours of continuous operation under ambient conditions (30%&#8211;65% relative humidity), demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term stability. This design strategy for hole interface molecules presents a promising avenue for achieving both high efficiency and operational stability in perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Mechanically Robust Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase Enabled by Sequential Decomposition Mechanism for High&#8208;Performance Micron&#8208;Sized SiOx Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbonate electrolyte with low&#8208;cost trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additives forms a bilayer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) (Li3PO4&#8208;rich outer layer and lithium fluoride [LiF]&#8208;rich inner layer) on micron&#8208;SiOx. This structure suppresses volume expansion, shields against side reactions, and enables fast&#8208;charging (3 C), which achieves 88% capacity retention after 200 cycles and &gt;81% after 1000 cycles in the pouch cell. 








Abstract
Micron&#8208;sized Si&#8208;based materials are promising anodes due to their high capacity, low cost, and ease of production, yet in application they suffer from severe volume expansion upon lithiation, which puts mechanical stress on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that leads to premature capacity decay. Constructing a robust SEI with high Li+ conductivity is crucial in addressing this challenge, but most SEI regulation strategies for Si&#8208;based anodes come at the expense of manufacturability and cost. A novel and low&#8208;cost combination of additives comprised of 3 wt% trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and 5 wt% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in carbonate electrolyte (BE&#8208;TF) was used to generate a bilayer SEI architecture specifically tailored for Si&#8208;based anodes by a sequential decomposition mechanism, where the lithium fluoride (LiF)&#8208;rich inner layer suppresses the volume expansion and the Li3PO4&#8208;rich outer layer forms a barrier that shields inner particles from detrimental side reactions. A high capacity retention of 88% after 200 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 can be achieved in a battery with a micron&#8208;sized SiOx (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x&#160;&lt;&#160;2) anode using BE&#8208;TF electrolyte. Additionally, an industrial&#8208;grade 3.5 Ah NCM||Gr&#8208;micron&#8208;sized SiOx pouch cell using BE&#8208;TF electrolyte could maintain long&#8208;term stability after 1000 cycles with high&#8208;capacity retention of &gt;81% at a high charging rate of 3 C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Interface Reconstruction over Black Phosphorus Complex for Wide&#8208;Temperature and Fast&#8208;Charging Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
BP nanospheres encapsulated within the hollow nanoreactor and aniline derivative (PBS) bearing the synergistic advantages of the multi&#8208;secondary bonds mediation have been conceptualized and designed to showcase high efficiency in potassium storage. This is attributed to the anion&#8208;aggregated solvation structure via Zn2+ and C4H9O&#8722;, rapid K+ transport highways via amphipathic ions and the redox medium of SO3H&#8722;. This design yields reconciled fast charging, wide&#8208;temperature operation, and long&#8208;term stability based on dynamic volume/kinetics compensation over IRSM strategy.








Abstract
Black phosphorus (BP), exhibiting a large spatial layer and high theoretical capacity, has been heralded as a promising candidate for K+ storage. Nevertheless, the unpredictability of the structural/interfacial reconstruction guides the arduous kinetics and poor stability, especially conferring to high current density and wide&#8208;temperature operation. To address these challenges, self&#8208;adaptive interface reconstruction with a multiple secondary bonds mediation (IRSM) strategy is adopted for amphipathic BP complex to improve kinetics and stability, wherein BP nanospheres encapsulated into a sacciform B&#8208;doped carbon matrix (BC) are further grafted with polybromoisobutyryloxy benzenesulfonic (PBBS), which undergoes in situ polymerization and is transformed into metal&#8208;organic bromoisobutyrylox supramolecular (PBS). Consequently, combining the flexibility/rigidity advantage of organic moiety and the stability advantage of inorganic moiety, BC@BP@PBS manifests excellent fast charging behaviors, a wide&#8208;temperature operation from &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C to 80&#160;&#176;C, and an extended cycle life of up to 1300 cycles. This work builds an ingenious protocol for leveraging the trade&#8208;off between fast charging, wide&#8208;temperature operation, and long life span for high&#8208;performance cell devices.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Enriched Solvation Engineering of Ester&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Sodium Metal Batteries at &#8722;40 &#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address poor low&#8208;temperature performance of ester&#8208;based electrolytes in sodium metal batteries, we introduce phosphate ester (trimethyl phosphate, TEP) as a co&#8208;solvent. With low melting point, low viscosity, and low&#160;polarity, TEP modifies the solvation structure at &#8722;40 &#176;C, reducing de&#8208;solvation energy barriers and improving interfacial stability. This electrolyte enables Na||Na symmetric cells to cycle stably for 1500 h and&#160;Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells to retain 98.4% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 0.5C under &#8722;40 &#176;C.








Abstract
Sodium metal batteries (SMBs) are recognized for their high theoretical capacity, abundant availability, and low electrochemical potential. However, the slow Na+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and the poor solid electrolyte interface (SEI) of commercial electrolytes hinder their application at low temperatures. Herein, we propose a novel ultralow&#8208;temperature, non&#8208;flammable ester&#8208;based electrolyte system incorporating trimethyl phosphate (TEP), which exhibits a low melting point, low viscosity, and low polarity. The results of theoretical calculations indicate that the addition of TEP significantly alters the proportions of aggregates (AGGs) solvated structures and reduces the de&#8208;solvation energy barrier for sodium ions. Additionally, research on interface structure reveals that the increase in AGGs configurations promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer. Consequently, the TEP&#8208;based electrolyte enables stable cycling for over 1500 h in symmetric cells at &#8722;40 &#176;C, while achieving a capacity retention rate of 98.4% after 500 cycles at 0.5 C in Na||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells.

         <title>Tungstotellurate(VI)&#8208;Based Nanocomposite Inhibits Breast Cancer Proliferation and Metastasis by Enhancing Cuproptosis and Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>

A novel sandwich&#8208;type tungstotellurate(VI) Na[(CH3)2NH2]13H[Sc3(H2O)2Te2W24O90]&#183;92H2O (Sc3Te2W24) was synthesized via a simple bottom&#8208;up approach. The Sc3Te2W24 cluster was subsequently encapsulated in responsive Cu&#8208;SS nanocarriers tailored for the tumor microenvironment. The POM/Cu&#8208;SS@HA nanocomposite efficiently halts breast cancer proliferation and metastasis through enhanced cuproptosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
Cuproptosis, characterized by the accumulation of copper (Cu) ions and mitochondrial respiration modulation, holds great potential in cancer therapy. As a newly defined mode of cell death regulation, the mechanisms of copper efflux and high intracellular levels of reducing substances may impair cuproptosis efficacy. To address this, a nanocomposite designated POM/Cu&#8208;SS@HA was constructed, comprising sandwich&#8208;type polyoxometalate (POM) Na[(CH3)2NH2]13H[Sc3(H2O)2Te2W24O90]&#183;92H2O (Sc3Te2W24), disulfide&#8208;bridged copper&#8208;based complexes (Cu&#8208;SS), and hyaluronic acid (HA) for targeted delivery. This system induces cuproptosis through copper accumulation, leading to lipoylated protein aggregation and iron&#8211;sulfur cluster protein depletion, while concurrently facilitating photothermal therapy (PTT) and apoptosis. The POM (Sc3Te2W24) cluster exhibited potent antitumor effects via p53&#8208;dependent apoptotic pathway reactivation. In vitro studies demonstrated over 85.6% inhibition rate against 4T1 breast cancer cells when combining POM/Cu&#8208;SS@HA with 808&#160;nm NIR irradiation. In vivo results showed 92.8% tumor growth suppression compared to the controls. Transcriptome analysis further identified altered expression profiles in glutathione (GSH) metabolism and mitochondrial function&#8208;related genes, confirming the dual induction of cuproptosis and apoptosis. These findings establish a synergistic nanotherapeutic strategy with enhanced efficacy for breast cancer treatment.

         <title>Smart Adaptive Artificial Channels Triggered by Hypoxia for Highly Selective Apoptosis in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of adaptive artificial channels activatable under hypoxic conditions were developed. Hypoxia&#8208;induced bioreduction triggers the rapid release of channel&#8208;forming units, which dimerize into chloride channels or further evolve into nanopores at high concentrations in the presence of cholesterol, exhibiting exceptional selectivity in killing liver cancer cells.








Abstract
In nature, hypoxia&#8208;sensitive ion channels regulate the ion transport in response to oxygen levels, which are critical for cellular adaptation to low&#8208;oxygen environments. However, this intriguing stimuli&#8208;responsive property has yet to be replicated in artificial ion channels designed to mimic the essential functions of their natural counterparts. Herein, we introduce a novel class of adaptive artificial channels activatable under hypoxic conditions in cancer cells. Reductase&#8208;mediated reduction of nitro and/or azo groups triggers the rapid release of channel&#8208;forming units, which dimerize into chloride channels or further assemble into nanopores of varying cavity sizes at high concentrations in the presence of cholesterol. Upon activation, the most sensitive channel, C1, demonstrates an 18.1&#8208;fold enhancement in cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 of 2.9&#160;&#181;M. Remarkably, C1 exhibits exceptional selectivity for liver cancer cells over normal liver cells, with a selectivity index of 17.9, surpassing that of doxorubicin by 44.8 folds while maintaining comparable anticancer efficacy.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Mechanically Planar Chiral Rotaxanes by an Asymmetric Povarov Reaction&#8208;Enabled Desymmetrization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient enantioselective desymmetrization method was developed for the asymmetric synthesis of mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes by using chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed Povarov reaction followed by aromatization, yielding various quinoline&#8208;containing MPC rotaxanes with high enantioselectivities, including a complex MPC [3]rotaxane. Extensive control studies were conducted to elucidate the origin of mechanical planar chirality.








Abstract
Mechanically planar chiral (MPC) rotaxanes are a type of chiral mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) characterized by their unique chiral structures and dynamic motion properties, which have shown significant potential in various chiral science research fields. However, the exploration of efficient catalytic enantioselective methods for synthesizing these chiral molecules is still largely underexplored. We here report an efficient method for asymmetric synthesis of MPC rotaxanes through an enantioselective desymmetrization strategy. By employing the chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Povarov reaction, the symmetry of prochiral rotaxanes with a rotationally symmetric macrocycle was broken, which was followed by a one&#8208;pot oxidative aromatization step to yield various MPC rotaxanes with good yields and high enantioselectivities. Moreover, in cases where the one&#8208;pot procedure did not provide satisfactory enantioselectivities, a stepwise protocol was employed to produce both enantiomers of MPC rotaxanes with excellent enantioselectivities, highlighting the practicability of this method. Extensive studies were performed to elucidate the origin of mechanical planar chirality within this method, which was postulated to arise from the synergistic interplay between the excellent enantioselectivity in generating point stereogenicity during the asymmetric Povarov reaction and the preferential selection of the mechanical geometric conformer of substrates during this process.

         <title>Bioorthogonal RNase L Recruitment Enables Targeted Inducible Degradation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioorthogonal RIsBOTAC (boRIBOTAC) platform enables chemically gated, inducible degradation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA. A cleavable cage masks the RNase L recruiter in ProRIBOTAC, which is reactivated by Staudinger decaging to restore antiviral activity. The system achieves spatiotemporal control of RNA degradation with reduced cytotoxicity, demonstrating conditional activation of RNA&#8208;targeting therapeutics in cells.








Abstract
RIBOTAC (Ribonuclease Targeting Chimera) is a strategy that employs small molecules to selectively bind disease&#8208;associated RNA and recruit endogenous RNase L for targeted RNA degradation. This study advances the concept of bioorthogonal cleavage reactions to develop a novel &#8220;bioorthogonal RIBOTAC&#8221; (boRIBOTAC). Focusing on SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA, we engineered a cleavable &#8220;cage&#8221; protective group into a critical site within the RIBOTAC molecule, rendering it inactive as ProRIBOTAC in its untriggered state. When therapeutic intervention becomes necessary or disease progression demands it, a bioorthogonal cleavage reaction selectively removes the protective group, activating the RIBOTAC and thus facilitating inducible degradation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA. This research not only validates the feasibility of this boRIBOTAC and the inducible SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA degradation strategy but also demonstrates that the boRIBOTAC approach is poised to construct a controllable and effective RNA degradation platform. This platform is anticipated to provide significant technical reserves and practical prospects for addressing potential viral pandemics, chronic infections, and complex disease progressions, while also offering critical insights for future RNA&#8208;targeted drug design.

         <title>Recoverable Fluorination Accelerates Ring&#8208;Opening Copolymerisation and Enables Post&#8208;Polymerisation&#8208;Modification of Polyesters</title>

A fluorinated polyester is introduced via ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation of pentafluorostyrene oxide and phthalic anhydride. Pendant C6F5 groups accelerate catalysis through fluorine&#8208;specific interactions, enabling access to high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight materials. These groups serve as reactive handles for efficient post&#8208;polymerisation and surface modification, allowing property tuning while preserving degradability and enabling fluoride recovery.








Abstract
Fluorination of polymers is a powerful strategy to enhance chemical or material properties yet integrating these benefits into degradable polymers remains underexplored. Here, we report a new class of fluorinated polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation of pentafluoro styrene oxide with phthalic anhydride. The pendant C6F5 groups accelerate catalysis through fluorine&#8208;specific &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and improve obtained molecular weights compared to the non&#8208;fluorinated variant giving access to high weight materials (Mn,max. &gt; 100&#160;kg&#160;mol&#8722;1) with thermal and mechanical properties competitive with commodity plastics. These C6F5 groups then act as reactive handles in the material for efficient post&#8208;polymerisation modification (PPM) in solution, allowing fine&#8208;tuning of thermal, mechanical, optical, and solubility properties. PPM can even be performed on material surfaces, films and fibres can be selectively modified without dissolution. Lastly, degradation enables quantitative recovery of fluorine centres as sodium fluoride, offering a sustainable end&#8208;of&#8208;life option for the incorporated fluorine. Our work demonstrates how targeted fluorination of degradable polyesters can simultaneously enhance catalysis and unlock advanced material functionality.

         <title>Miniature Photoenzyme Enables Organelle&#8208;Specific Cellular Control via Deboronative Hydroxylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>

Genetically encoded miniature photoenzyme miniSOG (12 kDa) enables&#160;spatiotemporally controlled bioorthogonal deboronative hydroxylation of 27 diverse organoboronates in live cells&#160;via localized superoxide radical anion O2&#8226;&#8722; generation.








Abstract
Artificial photoenzymes hold transformative potential for in vitro biocatalysis, but their translation to live&#8208;cell environments demands minimal cellular perturbation and aerobic compatibility. Here, we present miniSOG, a 12&#160;kDa miniature photoenzyme that enables bioorthogonal deboronative hydroxylation via superoxide radical anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation under blue light irradiation. Leveraging the inherent photochemistry of flavins, miniSOG facilitates the photoactivation of 27 structurally diverse organoboronates&#8212;including aryl/alkyl boronates, fluorophores, anticancer agents, and epigenetic modulators&#8212;through a unified O2&#8226;&#8722;&#8208;mediated mechanism. This system achieves spatiotemporally precise photocatalysis in live cells, where miniSOG's compact size and subcellular targeting enable organelle&#8208;specific localization and confined reactivity due to short&#8208;range O2&#8226;&#8722; diffusion (&#8764;0.2&#160;&#181;m). We demonstrate its utility in light&#8208;gated cellular modulation: i) mitochondrial depolarization via localized release of 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenol (DNP) to disrupt energy metabolism, and ii) nuclear m6A methylation enhancement to epigenetically upregulate autophagy. By repurposing miniSOG's photochemistry for bioorthogonal deboronative hydroxylation, this work establishes a versatile, genetically encoded platform for manipulating fundamental cellular pathways with minimal off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Scalable Production of Ultra&#8208;Stable Alkyl MOF Featuring Single&#8208;Molecule C3H6 Trap for Record Capture of Trace C3H6 from C2H4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule C3H6 trap based on a low&#8208;polarity aliphatic ultra&#8208;stable Al&#8208;CDC with the opposite dual hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dense alkyl sites is established, which presents a record uptake at trace level, Henry coefficient, initial adsorption heat difference, adsorption kinetics for C3H6 and C2H4 productivity with one of the highest IAST selectivity and initial C3H6 adsorption heat. Scalable production and shaped pellets of Al&#8208;CDC have also been achieved with the highest STY and lowest production cost.








Abstract
Highly efficient capture of trace C3H6 from C2H4 by physisorbents remains an enormous challenge to combine top&#8208;rank separation performance with excellent stability and economical scalability. We, herein, built a single&#8208;molecule C3H6 trap that bears an opposite series of oxygen and dense alkyl groups distributed in an ultramicroporous [Al(OH)(trans&#8208;CDC)] (Al&#8208;CDC, trans&#8208;H2CDC&#160;=&#160;trans&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid). The ultra&#8208;stable trap with well&#8208;matched pore size and pore chemistry enables a record uptake (40.8 cm3(STP) g&#8722;1) at ultralow concentration, Henry coefficient (12685.5 cm3(STP) g&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1), initial adsorption heat difference (27.2&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1), adsorption kinetic (0.49 min&#8722;1) and kinetic selectivity (3.1) for C3H6 with one of the highest initial C3H6 adsorption heats (50.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1) and selectivity (16.3), establishing a novel benchmark for capture of trace C3H6. The C3H6 adsorption mechanism is deciphered to be thermodynamically driven owing to the synergism of multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding and van der Waals (vdW) forces. Breakthrough tests validate that Al&#8208;CDC owns a record C2H4 productivity (&#8805;99.999%) of 410.5 cm3(STP) g&#8722;1 for trace C3H6 capture with excellent reproducibility. The cost&#8208;effective scalable production with the cheapest cost (508.9 $ kg&#8722;1) and highest space&#8208;time yield (4564.8&#160;kg m&#8722;3 day&#8722;1) and shaping of Al&#8208;CDC is realized with unaffected structural property and capture performance.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Hydroxide&#8208;Porphin Framework Membrane for Almost Perfectly Selective Li+ Retention</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;porphin framework (MHOPF) membrane was fabricated, enabling selective Li&#8314; retention and the passage of all major competing cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+). Through experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the ion&#8208;selective transport mechanism was elucidated, revealing the porphin in the MHOPF could effectively recognize ions. This work suggests that separating Li+ by selective retainment may pave the way toward membrane&#8208;based direct lithium extraction technologies.








Abstract
Membrane separation of Li+ from other ions, particularly alkaline ions, offers a green way toward direct lithium extraction from various brines. Here we report a metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;porphin framework membrane, allowing the passage of all major competing cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) while only retaining Li+. The crystalline nature of the membrane allows periodically arranged porphin molecules, enabling stable molecular recognition effect. By density functional theory calculations, we found that the porphin molecules had a strong interaction with Li+ and prevented their translocation through the porphin cavity. As a result, the membrane allows Na+ and K+ transport but rejects the transport of Li+ completely. Notably, due to the much higher mobility of divalent ions, the membrane also allows the passage of Ca2+ and Mg2+ while still retaining Li+ under a low external voltage (0.8&#160;V). We expect that this work establishes metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;porphin framework membrane as a promising and versatile platform for ion sieving studies and applications.

         <title>A Universal pH Regulation Principle for HER Suppression in Aqueous Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal electrolyte's pH value design principle is proposed to suppress the severe HER in aqueous metal batteries (AMBs). The value is correlated with the equilibrium between metal cations and their precipitation, validated in multiple systems (Zn/Mn/Mg). An integrated in situ EQCM&#8208;GC&#8208;EW platform is further developed to elucidate the pH&#8208;dependency of corrosive/catalytic&#8208;HER. Therefore, these fundamental insights guide the rational design of pH&#8208;stabilized electrolytes, effectively suppressing HER and enabling stable cycling of AMBs. 








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) pose a formidable challenge to rechargeable aqueous metal batteries (AMBs), causing flammable gas accumulation and interfacial instability. While conventional buffer&#8208;based electrolytes partially mitigate HERs, there lacks a rational pH regulation principle. Herein, we propose a universal pH regulation principle rooted in the equilibrium between soluble metal cations and their hydroxide precipitates, governed by the solubility product (Ksp). Moreover, an analytical platform is designed to quantify the pH&#8208;dependent HER kinetics and distinguish the corrosive and catalytic H2 production by decoupling the evolution of mass, hydrogen gas, and charge. Under this platform, we can identify the optimized pH values (herein, 5.40 in 1&#160;M Zn&#8208;based electrolytes) by adding a selective buffer to synchronously suppress both corrosive and catalytic&#8208;HERs, leading to evident enhancement of cycling stability. The universality of this principle is also demonstrated in other AMB systems with more serious HER, such as Mn and Mg metal batteries. A more than eightfold increase in cycling lifespan is achieved with tailored buffers in both Mn and Mg AMBs. This work highlights the essential role of pH in aqueous electrolytes and also establishes a thermodynamic foundation for pH optimization and HER mitigation.

         <title>Chiral Discrimination of all Proteinogenic Amino Acid Enantiomers by Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
All proteinogenic amino acid enantiomers can be discriminated by MspA&#8208;NTA&#8208;Ni nanopore, which yields distinct chiral&#8208;dependent signal features. This capability further enables the identification of constituent amino acids from hydrolysates of D&#8208;peptides, L&#8208;peptides, D&#8208;, L&#8208;peptide mixtures, or D, L&#8208;chiral peptides.








Abstract
D&#8208;amino acids, the stereoisomers of the more prevalent L&#8208;forms, are ubiquitously distributed across microorganisms, plants, and mammalian systems. Recent advances have uncovered their indispensable roles in biological processes, yet direct, single&#8208;molecule detection of D&#8208;amino acids has long been understudied. The simultaneous discrimination of all amino acid enantiomers remains a formidable analytical challenge. Here, we report a nickel&#8208;ion chelated hetero&#8208;octameric Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) (MspA&#8208;NTA&#8208;Ni) nanopore sensor that achieves simultaneous identification of all 19 D&#8208;amino acids corresponding to proteinogenic L&#8208;isomers. By integrating supervised machine learning algorithms, this system demonstrated an overall recognition accuracy of 99.5%. The method was further validated in analyzing acid&#8208;hydrolyzed D&#8208;peptide products, yielding clear compositional profiles of amino acid enantiomers. Notably, the technology enables simultaneous sensing of all 39 amino acid enantiomers with an overall accuracy of 98.9%. This approach not only allows direct characterization of DL&#8208;amino acid mixtures but also provides a critical sensor component for nanopore&#8208;based exo&#8208;sequencing of D&#8208;peptides and D&#8208;proteins.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Automated Synthesis of Polysubstituted Gentisaldehydes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CASP&#8208;guided retrosynthesis enabled streamlined construction of polysubstituted gentisaldehydes (PGAs) via automated flow 6&#8208;endo cyclization of cyclobutenedione and propargyl diacetal derivatives. DFT studies reveal diradical intermediates and 1,5&#8208;H transfer as key steps. Rapid and gram&#8208;scale PGA libraries highlight scalable and industrially relevant synthesis.








Abstract
Gentisaldehyde is a fundamental motif with broad applications in pharmaceuticals. However, the construction of such molecules is time&#8208; and cost&#8208;intensive with low step efficiency. The development of a disruptive retrosynthetic method is therefore highly necessary to enhance ring&#8208;formation capability and reduce redundancy in synthetic strategies. Herein, guided by cutting&#8208;edge computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms, synthetic routes were systematically deduced toward polysubstituted gentisaldehydes (PGAs). An automated flow system was subsequently developed to implement the streamlined synthesis via selective 6&#8208;endo cyclization of cyclobutenedione derivatives and propargyl diacetal moieties. DFT computational studies further revealed the involvement of diradical intermediates, rather than the conventional zwitterionic mechanism, and identified the 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process as the key driving force. The rapid and collective construction of a gram&#8208;scale library of PGAs highlights the industrial potential for scalability and application. This work demonstrates the synergistic interplay among computational retrosynthetic analysis, mechanistic elucidation, and flow processing, establishing an innovative model for universally integrated molecule library construction.

         <title>In Situ Polymerization&#8208;Assisted Crystallization of Open&#8208;Air Blade&#8208;Coated Perovskite Films for Efficient Solar Cells and Mini&#8208;Modules</title>

A synergistic in situ polymerization strategy was developed to construct a functional bottom interface layer and an embedded bulk polymer network within the perovskite layer in air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells. This approach controls crystallization, passivates defects, and suppresses I&#8722; oxidation and lead leakage. The resulting devices deliver a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 20.78% for mini&#8208;modules (5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 cm2).








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology, yet their commercialization is hindered by challenges related to scalability and potential lead leakage. Here, we successfully developed an in situ polymerization strategy that constructs a functional bottom interface layer and a bulk polymer network, enabling controlled crystallization and defects passivation of air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated perovskite film. Specifically, 2&#8208;aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (2&#8208;Amh) was employed as a monomer and deposited on the substrate, where it polymerized during thermal annealing. Upon blade&#8208;coating the 2&#8208;Amh&#8208;incorporated perovskite precursor, a synergistic interaction between the bottom polymer interfacial layer and the in situ formed polymer network within the bulk during thermal annealing significantly enhanced the film uniformity and crystallinity. Moreover, the embedded polymer network effectively mitigates lead leakage from damaged devices and suppresses the oxidation of the I&#8208; to I2 by Ni3+. Consequently, the devices based on air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated perovskite films achieve a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 20.78% for 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5 cm2 mini&#8208;modules (10.80 cm2). For comparison, spin&#8208;coated devices utilized the same strategy also demonstrated high PCEs, though they were not the focus of this work. These findings offer a promising solution for scalable perovskite photovoltaics, addressing both performance and environmental sustainability.

These oscillations transform Cu nanoparticles into self&#8208;propelled active matter that dynamically balances sintering and self&#8208;regeneration via particle splitting, offering a new strategy for stable catalyst design.








Abstract
Structural dynamics govern the catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles (NPs), yet their atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms remain unclear. Using in situ transmission electron microscopy, we reveal redox&#8208;driven lattice&#8208;coherent Cu&#8596;Cu2O phase oscillations in individual Cu NPs during hydrogen oxidation conditions. These oscillations generate active Brownian particles, wherein asymmetric H2 oxidation leads to directional motion that results in particle collisions and sintering. Crucially, the same active Brownian motion also triggers particle splitting, counteracting surface area loss and deactivation. Such active matter behavior arises from the formation of a head&#8211;tail morphology at critical H2:O2 ratios (e.g., 5:1), featuring a metallic&#8208;rich head and an oxide&#8208;dominated tail, with their volumetric balance dynamically shifting through competitive oxidation&#8208;reduction cycles. Quantitative analysis establishes a direct correlation between migration velocity and redox dynamics, revealing that the oxidation process significantly enhances particle mobility while the followed reduction process slows the velocity. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate that particle elongation and oxide tail fragmentation, accompanying particle migration, can be explained by asymmetric adhesion forces between the metallic/oxide phases and the silicon nitride support, alongside the redox reactions occurring on the particles. This work provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into catalyst dynamics under operando redox conditions, offering foundational knowledge for designing stable, high&#8208;performance catalytic systems.

         <title>Three&#8208;Segment Protein Labeling Using a Highly Efficient and Cysteine&#8208;Less Split Intein Identified with Computational Prediction of Aggregation Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Tandem protein trans&#8208;splicing (PTS) assembles a protein from three segments. Expanding this technology to individually treat cysteines in each segment, for example, for chemical labeling using thiol bioconjugation, the authors identify a second, highly efficient cysteine&#8208;less split intein. Using computational, sequence&#8208;based analysis of new split intein candidate genes, they streamline the split intein discovery process for the first time by eliminating candidates with a high aggregation propensity that have poor splicing yields.








Abstract
Split inteins are versatile tools in protein engineering. We envisaged a new tandem protein trans&#8208;splicing (PTS) scheme to assemble a protein from three segments, of which each can be individually treated with regard to its cysteine oxidation or chemical labeling status. However, only a single highly efficient cysteine&#8208;less split intein has been reported so far. Split intein activities are currently not predictable and require time&#8208;consuming biochemical characterizations. We aimed to accelerate the discovery of novel split inteins with high splicing efficiency by computational sequence analysis. Inspired by our previous finding that linked reduced splicing efficiency of characterized split intein fragments to soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich amyloid&#8208;like aggregates, we confirmed the inverse correlation between predicted aggregation propensity and splicing efficiency for new intein candidates by size&#8208;exclusion chromatography and biochemical analysis. The LCGC14 intein emerged as a second available cysteine&#8208;less split intein with virtually quantitative splicing efficiency, significantly expanding protein engineering opportunities independent of thiol chemistries or in oxidizing conditions. We exploit the orthogonality to the cysteine&#8208;less CLm intein to assemble proteins from three selectively labeled segments, as demonstrated for a trimodular non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The prediction of split intein efficiency from their sequence is a significant advancement to streamline future discovery processes.

         <title>Hemi&#8208;Indigiosin: A pH and Red&#8208;Light Responsive Transmembrane HCl Transporter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hemi&#8208;indigo&#8208;based transmembrane HCl transporter is presented, showing similar selectivity and pH&#8208;responsivity as the natural product prodigiosin. In addition, visible&#8208;light irradiation of the active Z&#8208;isomer gives high conversion to the inactive E&#8208;isomer. This light response could diminish undesired side effects in potential therapeutic applications and avoid ecological impact after excretion of the molecule into the environment.








Abstract
Synthetic anion transporters have emerged as promising therapeutic agents. However, their targeting ability is still low. Herein, we present hemi&#8208;indigiosin, which is structurally related to prodigiosin&#8212;a well&#8208;studied natural product exhibiting a wide range of biological activities. Our hemi&#8208;indigiosin is shown to have similar HCl transport selectivity and pH&#8208;dependent activity as prodigiosin, while in addition it can be deactivated by irradiation with visible light. This deactivation is effective due to high photoconversion from the active chloride&#8208;binding Z&#8208;isomer to the inactive E&#8208;isomer, not exposing a chloride&#8208;binding site. Transport activity is thus controlled by both pH change and light, which will allow improved targeting of pathological sites and prevent ecological impact after drug excretion into the environment.

         <title>Rapid Fabrication of Defective CuInP2S6 Nanosheets for Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Conversion over Wide Current Densities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>

We demonstrate the facile synthesis of lithium &#8208; intercalated CuInP2S6 through a one&#8208;step chemical vapor transport method, which facilitates the rapid fabrication of ultrathin CuInP2S6 enriched with S vacancies. Benefiting from the structural and electronic features, the Li&#8208;CuInP2S6 catalyst achieves &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency for formate production across broad current densities, signifying the robustness under fluctuating renewable energy input. 








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce value&#8208;added chemicals offers a promising approach to mitigate global warming and address the energy crisis. However, the development of highly selective and durable catalysts that perform reliably across varying operational conditions remains challenging. In this work, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;intercalated CuInP2S6 (Li&#8208;CIPS) with a layered structure via a one&#8208;step chemical vapor transport method. Compared to pristine CuInP2S6, lithium intercalation in Li&#8208;CIPS facilitates the rapid production of ultrathin CuInP2S6 nanosheets through simple soaking in water. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that these ultrathin Li&#8208;CIPS nanosheets contain abundant sulfur vacancies (Vs), which can substantially enhance the CO2RR activity while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. As a result, the Li&#8208;CIPS catalyst achieves over 90% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate production across wide current densities ranging from 100 to 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and it maintains stable operation over 100&#160;h at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study highlights a promising and selective AMP2X6&#8208;based electrocatalyst for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion in practical applications.

         <title>Cooperative Br&#248;nsted Acid and Photo&#8208;Promoted Stereoselective Synthesis of Substituted Piperidones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Br&#248;nsted acid cooperates with a photoexcited carbonyl triplet to promote stereoselective C&#9472;C bond formation in disubstituted piperidones through a chromophore&#8208;activator strategy. The Br&#248;nsted acid lowers the excitation energy gap, directs selective C&#9472;N bond cleavage over C&#9472;C fragmentation after H&#8208;atom transfer, and enables enantioselective C&#9472;C bond construction.








Abstract
Saturated nitrogen heterocycles are highly prevalent in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and material science. Despite extensive research to access substituted piperidines and related compounds, there remains a strong demand for new stereoselective approaches. We present a Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;promoted, light&#8208;induced formal ring&#8208;insertion strategy for the efficient synthesis of piperidone and pyrrolidone derivatives. This method enables the efficient construction of thermodynamically disfavored cis&#8208;disubstituted piperidone and pyrrolidone derivatives. A key aspect of this strategy is the use of an acyl imidazole as a uniquely capable chromophore activator, in cooperation with the Br&#248;nsted acid, which controls both reactivity and stereoselectivity without the need for photosensitizers. The unique properties of the in situ generated carbonyl triplet diradical enable a selective 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process, followed by C&#9472;N bond cleavage and a subsequent Mannich reaction, offering broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of this methodology was exemplified by the preparation of key intermediates for the synthesis of neurokinin 1 antagonist drug candidates.

&lt;p&gt;A Br&#248;nsted acid cooperates with a photoexcited carbonyl triplet to promote stereoselective C&#9472;C bond formation in disubstituted piperidones through a chromophore-activator strategy. The Br&#248;nsted acid lowers the excitation energy gap, directs selective C&#9472;N bond cleavage over C&#9472;C fragmentation after H-atom transfer, and enables enantioselective C&#9472;C bond construction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturated nitrogen heterocycles are highly prevalent in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and material science. Despite extensive research to access substituted piperidines and related compounds, there remains a strong demand for new stereoselective approaches. We present a Br&#248;nsted acid-promoted, light-induced formal ring-insertion strategy for the efficient synthesis of piperidone and pyrrolidone derivatives. This method enables the efficient construction of thermodynamically disfavored &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted piperidone and pyrrolidone derivatives. A key aspect of this strategy is the use of an acyl imidazole as a uniquely capable chromophore activator, in cooperation with the Br&#248;nsted acid, which controls both reactivity and stereoselectivity without the need for photosensitizers. The unique properties of the in situ generated carbonyl triplet diradical enable a selective 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer process, followed by C&#9472;N bond cleavage and a subsequent Mannich reaction, offering broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility of this methodology was exemplified by the preparation of key intermediates for the synthesis of neurokinin 1 antagonist drug candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond van der Waals: Modular Identification of 2D Materials in Strongly Bonded Layered Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular decoding strategy unveils thousands of hidden 2D materials in strongly bonded non&#8208;van der Waals crystals, overcoming limitations of conventional algorithms. Guided by thermodynamic screening, the method enables the first proton&#8208;exchange exfoliation of HxRuO3 nanosheets from Na2RuO3, confirming the reliability of the modularity strategy.








Abstract
Top&#8208;down exfoliation of layered solids has revolutionized materials innovation by enabling unprecedented access to atomically thin architectures. To expand the frontier of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, it is imperative to systematically identify non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) layered systems with strong interlayer bonding. While conventional atomic distance&#8208;based algorithms effectively identify vdW materials, they are considerably limited when applied to chemically bonded non&#8208;vdW systems due to their inherent bonding complexity. Here, we introduce a structural modularity paradigm that resolves dimensional identification challenges by removing specific elements from strongly bonded crystals to construct artificial substructures from residual atoms. Coupled with the appropriate layer&#8208;recognition algorithms for vdW lattices, this approach reveals 8,889 hidden 2D modules across 30,147 ternary compounds, of which 80.6% are undetectable by traditional layer&#8208;detection approaches. These findings show that non&#8208;vdW layered solids significantly outnumber vdW counterparts (1,383), highlighting a vast chemical space for 2D materials exploration. High&#8208;throughput thermodynamic screening of 15,312 ternary oxides identifies 1,083 chemically stable 2D modules exfoliable via a proton exchange&#8208;assisted method. Validation against 15 experimentally reported 2D oxide nanosheets, along with the first synthesis of ultrathin HxRuO3 nanosheets from non&#8208;vdW Na2RuO3 crystal, confirms the reliability and predictive strength of this method for both known and previously unexplored systems.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Adsorptive and Catalytic Reactions from Controllable Distributions of Metal Cations (Pd, Pt, Ni, Cr, Cu) as [M&#8208;OH]+1/1Al or M+2/2Al in Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>

Selective anchoring of divalent metal ions (Pd, Pt, Ni, Cr, Cu) in zeolites as either M2&#8314;/2Al or [M&#9472;OH]2&#8314;/1Al enables direct comparison of their distinct catalytic roles. Combining reactive test, spectroscopy, and DFT reveals divergent reactivities in ethylene dimerization, Wacker oxidation, SCR, NO adsorption, and methane oxidation. 








Abstract
Anchoring divalent metal ions in the same zeolite framework with similar Si/Al ratio selectively as zeolite&#8208;bound M+2 or [M+2&#8208;OH]+1 cationic species enables critical comparison of the species&#8217; intrinsic reactivity for industrially and fundamentally relevant reactions. H&#8208;BEA zeolites with similar Si/Al ratios but differing framework Al siting were used to anchored multiple divalent metal cations (Ni, Pd, Pt, Cr, Cu) in the zeolite micropores. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art infrared (IR) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements, including two&#8208;dimensional pulsed HYSCORE EPR, extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations together provide unambiguous evidence for the selective formation of divalent metal cations as M+2/2Al species (for H&#8208;BEA prepared in the conventional hydroxide media), and [M+2OH]+1/1Al species for H&#8208;BEA prepared in HF. Solid&#8208;state proton&#8208;decoupled triple&#8208;quantum magic&#8208;angle spinning (3Q MAS) NMR measurements confirmed contrasting Al distributions in the two H&#8208;BEA zeolites, which led to a contrasting divalent cation speciation. The reactivities of the two cationic species were explored for catalytic and adsorptive applications in both organometallic homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. This work demonstrates their divergent reactivity in ethylene dimerization, ethylene oxidation (Wacker process), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO, NO adsorption, and methane oxidation. Both M+2/2Al and [M+2OH]+1/1Al cations are both active for ethylene dimerization, but [M+2OH]+1/1Al species show higher reaction rates for each Pd, Ni, Pt. [M+2OH]+1/1Al is active for acetaldehyde formation in Wacker ethylene oxidation. A new active site for ethylene oligomerization is proposed that possesses a terminal OH group (Cr&#8208;OH) in Phillips catalysts evident by a nearly inactive isolated Cr+2/2Al species that contrast an active Cr&#9472;OH motif.

         <title>Hydroxylamine Cation as B&#8208;Site with Radius and Dipole Moment Modulation for Metal&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite to Enhance X&#8208;ray Detection Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functional mechanism of B&#8208;site radius and dipole moment modulation in metal&#8208;free halide perovskites was innovatively explored. The NH3OH+ cation with larger radius and dipole moment can strengthen the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, stabilize the lattice structure, and suppress ion migration. Using this modulation strategy, the X&#8208;ray detector achieved ultralow dark current drift (1.86&#215;10&#8722;7 nA cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1).








Abstract
Nowadays, metal&#8208;free halide perovskites (MFHPs) with good structural tunability, biocompatibility, and light weight have been studied in the X&#8208;ray field. Unlike the strong ionic bonds in metal halide perovskites, weak hydrogen bonds play a significant role in the stability and performance of MFHPs. However, as a critical component in the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, the B&#8208;site cation (NH4+) exhibits spatial, geometric, and symmetry conflicts with the octahedral framework, constraining the viable material and structure compositions in MFHPs. In this study, the NH3OH+ cation with larger radius and dipole moment is successfully incorporated into MFHPs to explore the functional mechanisms of B&#8208;site design. Theoretical simulations and experiments reveal that the NH3OH+ cation can regulate octahedral composition and structural dimensionality of MFHPs, thereby optimizing bandgap and carrier transport capacity. Importantly, hydroxyl groups in NH3OH+ can increase hydrogen&#8208;bond sites and strength, reinforcing the hydrogen&#8208;bond networks to stabilize the lattice structure and inhibit ion migration, thereby optimizing the device stability. Finally, the designed DABCO&#8208;NH3OHCl3 detector exhibited exceptional stability and sensitivity (1460 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 200&#160;V bias) under prolonged X&#8208;ray irradiation, achieving ultralow dark current drift (1.86&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7 nA cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). Hence, the reported NH3OH+ cation will offer design guidelines for future MFHPs optimization.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Biphenomycin Family of Potent Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The complete biosynthetic pathway of the biphenomycin antibiotics is elucidated, revealing a unique enzymatic machinery featuring a bifunctional MNIO, a regioselective arginase, a B12&#8208;dependent rSAM for C,C coupling, hydroxylation enzymology, and a metalloprotease with dual&#8208;specificity. These findings uncover new enzyme functions in RiPP biosynthesis and establish biocatalytic tools for future antibiotic discovery and engineering. 








Abstract
Peptide natural products are important molecules for the development of efficient drugs for human health applications. The biphenomycins are bacterial macrocyclic peptides characterized by unique ortho&#8208;tyrosine (oTyr) residues connected by biaryl linkages. Biphenomycins possess potent antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive pathogens at low doses with no eukaryotic toxicity. Despite their initial discovery in 1967, their biosynthetic pathway has remained elusive. Within this work, we identified the ribosomal biosynthetic origin of biphenomycins and elucidated all enzymatic maturation steps by in&#8208;depth functional characterization in vivo and in vitro. Key steps include selective ortho&#8208;hydroxylation events at two phenyl alanine residues catalyzed by a bifunctional multinuclear nonheme iron&#8208;dependent oxidase yielding the oTyr functionalities, biaryl cross coupling by a B12&#8208;dependent radical SAM enzyme, amino acid side&#8208;chain modifications by a highly regioselective arginase and by dedicated hydroxylases, as well as a stepwise proteolytic processing by a TldD&#8208;type but self&#8208;sufficient protease. These findings clarify the molecular basis of biphenomycin assembly, reveal unprecedented enzymatic dual functions, and provide the foundation for the targeted discovery of novel biphenomycins and for the development of bioengineering strategies to enhance yields and develop antibiotics with further increased potency, addressing the urgent need for new antimicrobial agents.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Ru1Au6(TBBT)6(PPh3)6 Cluster Catalyst for Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we synthesize an atomically precise Ru1Au6(TBBT)6(PPh3)6 cluster consisted of one central Ru atom and six peripheral Au(TBBT)PPh3 complexes bridged by the S atoms. This cluster shows a high efficiency for the reduction of nitrate to ammonia, since the Ru site and six Au sites match well in this reaction.








Abstract
Only one active site in a catalyst is not able to handle a deal of multitasking at once to facilitate distinct elementary steps in a catalytic cycle. To overcome this, a multi&#8208;functional system is required by two or more functional units combined in one catalyst, with each unit playing a complementary role. Here we find that the Au site of Au(TBBT)PPh3 (TBBT&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzenethiol) complex not only activates water but also reduces nitrate to ammonia, resulting in a low efficiency for the electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate. To decouple the responsibility of the Au site, we synthesize a Ru1Au6(TBBT)6(PPh3)6 cluster consisted of one Ru atom and six Au(TBBT)PPh3 complexes bridged by the S atoms, in which the water dissociation is mostly undertaken on the Ru site for the steady supply of proton, while the nitrate is sequentially reduced on the Au sites. More notably, the hopping of proton from Ru to Au is readily proceeded over the S bridge, giving rise to positively cooperative couple of one Ru site and six Au sites among this cluster, and thereby 19&#8208;fold efficiency increase is observed in comparison to this complex catalyst.

         <title>Stereodivergent Alkylation of Unstrained C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two protocols for stereodivergent allylic C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bond alkylation are established for the construction of unnatural amino acids bearing two continuous stereocenters and carbonyl compounds containing a fully substituted fluorinated stereocenter. Synergistic Pd/Cu catalysis enables access to all four stereoisomers of corresponding motifs.








Abstract
Asymmetric functionalization of C&#9472;C &#963; bond is a straightforward way to edit molecule backbones but heavily relies on strained rings. The related process with unstrained structure is highly challenging, and only several cases are reported. However, these examples can just achieve related enantiomers through C&#9472;C &#963; bond activation. The stereodivergent C&#9472;C &#963; bond functionalization for precise access to all stereoisomers is unknown. Here we have established two catalytic systems to show the feasibility of unstrained C&#9472;C &#963; bond functionalization as an efficient pathway in stereodivergent synthesis. Both unnatural amino acid derivatives bearing two vicinal stereocenters and carbonyl compounds containing a tertiary fluoride are constructed in good yields with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities. Stereodivergent access to all these chiral skeletons is demonstrated possible with simple dictation of ligand configurations. Mechanistic studies unveil the resolution pathway of racemic allyl substrates through diene formation instead of typical metal interconversion and C&#9472;C formation as rate&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Organic Microemulsion Electrolytes for Advanced Metal Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced organic microemulsion electrolytes (OMEs) have been engineered through phase&#8208;optimized emulsification of high&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio electrolytes with nonpolar solvents and amphiphilic surfactants. The pouch cells with as&#8208;prepared LiFSI&#8208;TMP/TFEP/PFPN OME demonstrate intrinsic safety and robust cycling stability, while exhibiting excellent low&#8208;temperature performance and passing rigorous nail penetration. The proposed OME design paradigm demonstrates broad applicability across various secondary battery systems, significantly expanding the selection range of compatible diluents and providing critical insights for engineering next&#8208;generation advanced electrolytes.








Abstract
Current carbonate electrolytes encounter a bottleneck for high&#8208;performance lithium rechargeable batteries due to their potential safety issues, narrow operating temperature range, limited electrochemical windows, and chemical instability. Herein, advanced organic microemulsion electrolytes (OMEs) are developed by emulsifying the high&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio electrolytes to decrease the viscosity and molarity with nonpolar solvents and surfactants. The as&#8208;prepared nonflammable LiFSI&#8208;TMP/TFEP/PFPN OME shows intrinsic safety and high stability toward the graphite anode and LiCoO2 cathode. The pouch cells with this OME demonstrate long&#8208;term cycling stability of 200 cycles, along with excellent low&#8208;temperature performance, and meanwhile pass the nail penetration safety test. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;OME&#8221; can be extended to prepare other electrolyte systems with compatible electrochemical properties for different battery systems at extreme conditions, which opens a new avenue in electrolyte development by extending the choice of solvents for broadening the application fields of advanced rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transition Nanoparticles Enable Fluorescence Self&#8208;Reporting for Close&#8208;Loop Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reporting photodynamic therapy platform is achieved through combining a twisted intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced emission (TICT&#8208;AIE) photosensitizer (OTPA&#8208;DCPP) and phase&#8208;change material (PCM). The initial solid and high&#8208;polar environment maximizes ROS generation of OTPA&#8208;DCPP via TICT and AIE effects. The heat buildup during laser irradiation triggers phase transition, restoring fluorescence while halting ROS generation. The emerged fluorescence acts as a real&#8208;time theranostic dosimeter, signaling to cease irradiation for close&#8208;loop photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces a fundamental limitation of the intrinsic energy utilization competition between fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, while conventional &#8220;open&#8208;loop&#8221; protocols with pre&#8208;determined irradiation parameters risk overtreatment damage. To circumvent both challenges, we herein report phase transition nanoparticles (PTNPs) that enable self&#8208;regulated, self&#8208;reported, close&#8208;loop PDT via switching photosensitizers&#8217; molecular conformation. PTNPs were fabricated by co&#8208;encapsulating a twisted intramolecular charge transfer&#8208;aggregation&#8208;induced emission (TICT&#8208;AIE) photosensitizer (OTPA&#8208;DCPP) and the phase&#8208;change material n&#8208;docosane (C22, Tm &#8776; 44.4 &#176;C) into lipid&#8208;PEG nanoparticles. With TICT effect to reduce the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and AIE effect to suppress nonradiative dissipation, OTPA&#8208;DCPP exhibits polarity&#8208;enhanced type I ROS generation. C22 initially creates a rigid and polar microenvironment that stabilizes OTPA&#8208;DCPP's TICT and AIE effects, maximizing ROS generation. During PDT progress, PTNPs consumed oxygen and accumulated heat, the melted C22 above Tm created a nonpolar microenvironment, restoring the intense fluorescence while halting ROS generation. The emerged fluorescence serves as a real&#8208;time indicator of OTPA&#8208;DCPP's functional status, providing an unambiguous cue to cease irradiation to avoid energy waste and excessive heat buildup.

     alt="Phase-Transition Nanoparticles Enable Fluorescence Self-Reporting for Close-Loop Photodynamic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-reporting photodynamic therapy platform is achieved through combining a twisted intramolecular charge transfer-aggregation-induced emission (TICT-AIE) photosensitizer (OTPA-DCPP) and phase-change material (PCM). The initial solid and high-polar environment maximizes ROS generation of OTPA-DCPP via TICT and AIE effects. The heat buildup during laser irradiation triggers phase transition, restoring fluorescence while halting ROS generation. The emerged fluorescence acts as a real-time theranostic dosimeter, signaling to cease irradiation for close-loop photodynamic therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) faces a fundamental limitation of the intrinsic energy utilization competition between fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, while conventional &#8220;open-loop&#8221; protocols with pre-determined irradiation parameters risk overtreatment damage. To circumvent both challenges, we herein report phase transition nanoparticles (PTNPs) that enable self-regulated, self-reported, close-loop PDT via switching photosensitizers&#8217; molecular conformation. PTNPs were fabricated by co-encapsulating a twisted intramolecular charge transfer-aggregation-induced emission (TICT-AIE) photosensitizer (OTPA-DCPP) and the phase-change material &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-docosane (C22, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776; 44.4 &#176;C) into lipid-PEG nanoparticles. With TICT effect to reduce the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and AIE effect to suppress nonradiative dissipation, OTPA-DCPP exhibits polarity-enhanced type I ROS generation. C22 initially creates a rigid and polar microenvironment that stabilizes OTPA-DCPP's TICT and AIE effects, maximizing ROS generation. During PDT progress, PTNPs consumed oxygen and accumulated heat, the melted C22 above &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; created a nonpolar microenvironment, restoring the intense fluorescence while halting ROS generation. The emerged fluorescence serves as a real-time indicator of OTPA-DCPP's functional status, providing an unambiguous cue to cease irradiation to avoid energy waste and excessive heat buildup. As such, PTNPs circumvent excited-state energy reallocation challenges, which also serve as a self-reported, close-loop PDT system for safe and precise phototheranostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Structure&#8208;Induced d&#8208;Orbital Splitting Boosts Highly Active and Stable Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work adopts spinel as a model via substituting cobalt in Co3O4 with Fe/Cu ions to induce varying degrees of structural asymmetry and decipher the relationship between local structural asymmetry and electronic structure reconfiguration. The highly asymmetric structure of Cu&#8208;Co3O4 significantly triggers charge redistribution and d&#8208;orbital spin splitting, which effectively enhances catalytic activity and stablity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries provide an extremely feasible strategy for sustainable development and carbon neutrality. However, due to the sluggish kinetics and complex interfacial reactions, Li&#8208;CO2 batteries are limited by low output voltage and poor cycling stability. Developing efficient and durable catalysts remains an urgent challenge. Transition metal oxides have gained significant attention owing to their availability and stability for electrocatalytic reactions, but their catalytic activity remains unsatisfactory toward Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, this work proposes an asymmetric Fe/Cu&#8208;incorporated Co3O4 tactic system to tune charge distribution for motivating efficient electrocatalysis and decipher the mechanism of asymmetric structure modulation on the promotion of catalytic activity and stability. It is unraveled that d&#8208;orbital spin splitting induces the modification of nondegenerate state, which enhances catalyst durability, while simultaneously increasing electron occupancy in dxz/yz orbitals. This higher electron occupancy facilitates the hybridization with the p orbitals of reactants and intermediates via &#960; bonding, thereby strengthening the adsorption activity. In consequence, the Li&#8208;CO2 battery with Cu&#8208;Co3O4 cathode demonstrates a low overpotential of 0.73&#160;V and high Coulombic efficiency of 96%, outperforming batteries with Co3O4 and Fe&#8208;Co3O4. This work offers a unique insight for electronic structure regulation strategy and displays a high&#8208;performance catalyst for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Microemulsion Engineering Reconciles Propylene Carbonate Electrolytes and Graphite Anodes for All&#8208;Climate Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This study leverage microemulsion engineering to achieve compatibility of propylene carbonate (PC)/graphite (Gr) system. Insoluble glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and amphiphilic tetrahydrofuran (THF) self&#8208;assemble into core&#8208;shell micelles in the PC electrolyte medium. At the Gr anode, adsorbed GMS@THF micelles create a solvophobic barrier and effectively suppress the Li+&#8208;PC co&#8208;intercalation. This design enables Gr||LiFePO4 batteries operate from &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C to 100 &#176;C, providing a novel strategy for incompatible electrolyte/electrode systems and all&#8208;climate batteries.








Abstract
Propylene carbonate (PC)&#8208;based electrolytes are promising for all&#8208;climate lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their wide liquid range. However, detrimental Li+&#8208;PC co&#8208;intercalation causes severe graphite (Gr) anode exfoliation, remaining the biggest barrier for their practical application. Although the issue can be mitigated via solvation regulation, complex interfacial chemistry limits long&#8208;term cycling ability. Herein, we designed a PC&#8208;based microemulsion electrolyte to achieve PC/Gr compatibility through interfacial manipulation. Specifically, insoluble glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and amphiphilic tetrahydrofuran (THF) are introduced into the PC&#8208;based electrolyte. GMS self&#8208;assembles in THF to form core&#8208;shell GMS@THF micelles dispersed in the continuous PC electrolyte medium. This microemulsion structure generates abundant liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial tension at micelle/electrolyte interfaces, spontaneously directing micelles to the electrode interfaces during operation. At the Gr anode, adsorbed GMS@THF micelles leverage solvophobic effects to synergistically form PC&#8208;poor Li+ solvation sheaths and block free PC, effectively suppressing detrimental PC co&#8208;intercalation. This design enables Li||Gr cells achieve a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.8% and supports 1 Ah Gr||LiFePO4 pouch cells to operate over 4000 cycles. Remarkably, the pouch cells work well across extreme temperatures (&#8722;40&#8764;100 &#176;C cycling; &#8722;60&#8764;100 &#176;C operation), demonstrating exceptional all&#8208;climate capability. This microemulsion engineering establishes a universal paradigm for optimizing electrolyte/electrode interphases in the PC/Gr system.

         <title>Optimizing *CO/CO Supply by Atomically Dispersed Fe Sites for High&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 Conversion Under Visible Light</title>

This study demonstrates that constructing Fe&#8211;N active sites in a Fe&#8208;decorated nanoflower&#8208;shaped Fe0.2/H&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 catalyst effectively lowers the energy barrier for *COOH to *CO conversion. Meanwhile, the enhanced CO adsorption provides sufficient *CO/CO for the C&#8211;C coupling reaction, thereby significantly increasing the production rate of C2H4.








Abstract
Visible light driven carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to ethylene (C2H4) is a promising pathway to obtain renewable fuels and valuable chemicals. However, the insufficient supply of *CO/CO severely limits the rate of C&#8211;C coupling toward C2H4. Herein, we present a synergistic engineering strategy to construct a Fe0.2/H&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 composite catalyst by anchoring high&#8208;density iron single atoms sites (Fe SAs) onto a pyridinic nitrogen rich metal&#8211;organic framework (H&#8208;MOF&#8208;1). Under visible light, the catalyst achieves an exceptional C2H4 yield of 1056.2 &#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This performance surpasses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems for visible light driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4. The X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis, CO adsorption experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the Fe&#8208;N active sites in the Fe0.2/H&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 catalyst not only significantly reduce the energy barrier from *COOH to *CO but also maintain abundant *CO/CO for C&#8211;C coupling through strong CO adsorption, thus efficiently promoting the rapid generation of C2H4. This study provides insights into the rapid generation of C2H4 through photocatalytic CO2 reduction, paving the way for visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction reactions.

TmT1&#946;H, a novel taxane C1&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase belonging to the &#945;&#8208;KG/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from Taxus&#160;&#215;&#160;media cell cultures that catalyzes 1&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1) to form a major product baccatin IV (1a) and its isomer (1b). Tm576, a novel dedicated &#945;&#8208;KG/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase that was able to convert 1 to 1b specifically. A mechanism that the 5/7/6&#8208;membered carbon framework arises from prototypical 6/8/6&#8208;type taxane skeleton via radical rearrangement was proposed.








Abstract
Here, we report the discovery and functional characterization of one novel taxane C1&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase (TmT1&#946;H), belonging to the &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate (&#945;&#8208;KG)/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase family from Taxus&#160;&#215;&#160;media cell cultures. The incubation of recombinant TmT1&#946;H with 1&#946;&#8208;dehydroxybaccatin IV (1) as a substrate led to the production of a major C1&#8208;hydroxylated product, baccatin IV (1a), and a minor product, 15&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;11(15&#8594;1)abeo&#8208;baccatin IV (1b), a non&#8208;classical 5/7/6&#8208;type taxane. Moreover, in vitro biochemical assays, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation combined with site&#8208;directed mutagenesis revealed the critical amino acid residues for TmT1&#946;H catalysis. Substrate specificity investigations revealed that TmT1&#946;H preferred taxoids with high oxygenation level. Notably, we have also discovered a novel specific enzyme (Tm576) belonging to &#945;&#8208;KG/Fe(II)&#8208;dependent dioxygenase that was able to convert 1 to 1b independently. A mechanism that the 5/7/6&#8208;membered carbon framework arises from prototypical 6/8/6&#8208;type taxane skeleton via radical rearrangement was proposed based on DFT calculations. More importantly, we artificially reconstructed the biosynthetic pathway of two important taxanes, baccatin IV, and baccatin VI, from GGPP in tobacco system. This work not only fully characterizes the role of C1&#946;&#8208;hydroxylase of taxoids, but also offered new insights into the formation of taxane structural diversity.

A post&#8208;leaching strategy of NiFeSe catalyst generates nanoscale roughened surfaces, promoting rapid oxygen bubble detachment, enhance mass transport, and accelerate OER kinetics, enabling efficient anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis.








Abstract
Developing efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is critical for advancing anion exchange membrane water electrolysers (AEM&#8208;WE) for green hydrogen production driven by solar or wind power. This study explored the impact of the selenium (Se) modification on the OER performance of nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide&#8208;based catalysts (i.e., NiFeSe), focusing on micro&#8208;bubble formation/detachment and its role in optimizing mass transport. The introduction of Se influenced the surface and interface properties of the NiFeSe, including enhanced surface roughness, facilitated rapid nucleation and detachment of smaller oxygen bubbles, and reduced bubble&#8208;induced diffusion limitations. As a result, the NiFeSe catalyst achieved a low overpotential of 190&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and demonstrated a high durability beyond 2000 h in 1&#160;M KOH. In the practical AEM&#8208;WE device, it reached 8800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#160;V and worked continuously for over 3000&#160;h at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. These findings highlight the crucial role of selenium&#8208;induced micro&#8208;bubble formation/detachment in improving mass transport and catalytic efficiency, providing new insights for next&#8208;generation OER catalysts in industrial water electrolysis.

The catalytic nano&#8208;reactor engineering with Fe&#8208;N4 catalytic site and the adjacent PO chemical group as synergistic catalytic site was first proposed for remarkably accelerating sulfur redox in Li&#8208;S batteries, revealing the enormous potentiality of catalytic nano&#8208;reactor engineering for energy storage and conversion devices.








Abstract
Precisely constructing atomic engineering of catalytic site and thus accelerating sulfur redox kinetics are meaningful but challenging for energy storage and conversion. Herein, the catalytic nano&#8208;reactor engineering containing Fe&#8208;N4 catalytic site and the adjacent PO chemical group as synergistic catalytic site (Fe&#8208;N4/CNPO) was first designed for Li&#8208;S batteries with remarkably improved performance. The adjacent PO chemical group of Fe&#8208;N4 site in catalytic nano&#8208;reactor simultaneously strengthened the adsorption of lithium polysulfides and facilitated the fracture of Li&#9472;S bonds by Li&#9472;O interaction, thus lowering the free energy change of potential&#8208;determining step and accelerating sulfur redox kinetics, which was further verified via density functional theory calculation. The optimized Fe&#8208;N4/CNPO modified separator exhibited much higher battery capacity of 1322.1&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;C and enhanced long&#8208;term stability (low capacity decay of 0.08% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1.0&#160;C). This work demonstrated the enormous potentiality of catalytic nano&#8208;reactor engineering containing metal single&#8208;atom catalytic site and chemical group as synergistic catalytic site for accelerating sulfur redox in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Accelerating Medicinal Chemistry: A C(sp3)&#8208;Rich Fragment Toolbox for Redox&#8208;Neutral Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is introduced in this report a unified toolbox comprising of 15 sulfonyl hydrazide reagents that enable the redox&#8208;neutral radical cross&#8208;coupling of 14 distinct C(sp3)&#8208;rich small fragments onto (hetero)arenes, providing a modular, efficient, and operationally simple platform for installing diverse small fragments. The platform has the potential to accelerate medicinal chemistry campaigns, enables late&#8208;stage modifications, and positions it as a useful resource for drug discovery.








Abstract
The hit&#8208;to&#8208;lead phase of drug discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the time&#8208;consuming, iterative synthesis of analogs, especially when incorporating small C(sp3)&#8208;rich fragments such as methyl, cyclopropyl, or oxetanyl groups&#8212;moieties known to improve drug solubility, bioactivity, and metabolic stability. Conventional approaches like Suzuki or Negishi couplings make use of unstable reagents, high costs, and harsh reaction conditions, while many modern radical&#8208;based methods rely on exogenous redox agents or costly metal catalysts. To overcome these limitations, a toolbox of 15 sulfonyl hydrazide reagents is disclosed to facilitate redox&#8208;neutral, nickel&#8208;catalyzed radical cross&#8208;coupling of 14 distinct small fragments onto (hetero)arenes under mild conditions. These crystalline, bench&#8208;stable reagents are straightforward to synthesize from accessible precursors and require no additional oxidants, reductants, or precious metals, offering a modular and operationally simple platform. Demonstrated across a diverse set of over 60 (hetero)aryl halides, the method exhibits exceptional substrate scope and functional group tolerance, accommodating complex, medicinally relevant scaffolds. Comparative studies with existing techniques underscore its advantages, including a 51% yield for trideuteromethylation of a MET kinase inhibitor precursor (versus a precedented 14% via Kumada coupling) and a streamlined one&#8208;step cyclobutylation of an NLRP3 inhibitor intermediate at 41% yield (versus a known&#160;&lt;&#160;5% over a four&#8208;step sequence).

Comparative studies with existing techniques underscore its advantages, including a 51% yield for trideuteromethylation of a MET kinase inhibitor precursor (versus a precedented 14% via Kumada coupling) and a streamlined one-step cyclobutylation of an NLRP3 inhibitor intermediate at 41% yield (versus a known&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;5% over a four-step sequence).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Energy Density Heterostructured Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes Enabled by Mechanical&#8208;Chemical Coupling Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the design of P2/O3 heterostructure cathode with mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effect, problems such as poor air stability, poor structural stability, and slow Na+ transport kinetics in layered oxide cathode have been alleviated. Additionally, the intrinsic mechanism underlying the superior performance of P2/O3 heterostructure cathode has been innovatively elucidated from a mechanical stress perspective. Therefore, this P2/O3 core&#8208;shell structure design with mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effects will provide new insights for the future development of sodium&#8208;based oxide cathode.








Abstract
Designing cobalt&#8208;free manganese&#8208;based oxide cathode materials with high energy density and excellent stability is of great significance and a challenge. Here, we construct a P2/O3 core&#8211;shell heterostructured layered oxide cathode material with a mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effect to achieve precise structural modulation and superior electrochemical performance. Using O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 as the core material, the P2/O3 core&#8211;shell heterostructured cathode was obtained by accurately regulating the epitaxial layer. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the O3 bulk phase and P2 shell layer, this heterostructured cathode shows a high energy density (587.34 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1, based on cathode active materials), excellent structure, superior air stability, and full cell performance. The phase transition mechanism of the cathode as well as the atomic arrangement characteristics were analyzed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and spherical aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), respectively. Most importantly, it was verified using stress simulation calculations that the P2 shell layer can share the mechanical stress of the internal O3 bulk phase on a micro&#8208;scale, suppressing the plastic yielding and structural degradation of the material during electrochemical processes, and dramatically enhancing the structural stability. The heterostructured cathode with the mechanical&#8208;chemical coupling effect designed in this study will provide new insights for the optimization of other electrode materials.

         <title>Breaking Solubility Limitation via Molecule Design to Build Localized Ultrahigh&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of localized ultrahigh&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LUCEs) with the molar ratio of Li+ and solvent (nLi+/nSol.) as high as 1.8 have been achieved, in which one solvent by two Li+ (2Li+&#8208;Sol.) structure greatly enhances Li+ transference number (LTN), the anion rich solvation structures facilitate the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with Coulombic efficiency (CE) up to 99.97%, and the scarce free solvents largely elevate the high&#8208;voltage stability.








Abstract
The increase in salt concentration of electrolytes has been known as a simple but effective approach to restrain solvent activity and regulate solvation structure, thus enabling the long&#8208;term interfacial stability of batteries. Nevertheless, the ion electrostatic intercalations and finite coordination states have frustrated the efforts to further elevate the salt solubility. Here, we break the upper limit of lithium&#8208;salt dissolution through a molecule engineering strategy, in which the solvent with three ether&#8208;oxygen groups provides multi&#8208;coordination sites and the intrinsically inert diluents with low steric hindrance are activated to shield electrostatic repulsion. As a result, a series of localized ultrahigh&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LUCEs) are prepared with a molar ratio of Li+ to the solvent as high as 1.8. The LUCEs are endowed with high Li+ transference number&#160;of 0.682, high Coulombic efficiency for lithium plating/stripping up to 99.97%, and high oxidation stability over 6.5&#160;V. Meanwhile, the scarce free solvent promotes the formation of a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interphase on both the lithium anode and a high&#8208;voltage cathode, which enables the operation of Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries over 180 cycles (&gt;80% capacity retention) under a lean lithium source (20&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;loading cathode (3.885 mAh cm&#8722;2). Our work elucidates the underlying mechanism of salt dissolution chemistry and offers an affordable method for stabilizing energy&#8208;dense electrochemical storage devices.

         <title>A Probe Design Strategy Based on Cholesterol&#8208;Induced Differential Cellular Uptake for Cancer Cells Specific Penetration and Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comparative LogP analysis of various compounds, we confirmed the existence of molecules with LogP values within the range of 1.48&#8211;1.62 that are capable of distinguishing cancer cells. TO&#8208;Ac was successfully applied to in vivo early cancer imaging and guided the surgical resection of tumors. This study proposes an innovative &#8220;passive targeting&#8221; strategy that operates independently of targeting ligand modifications and offers a novel molecular design framework for the development of broad&#8208;spectrum tumor diagnostic tools.








Abstract
Cancer metastasis and postoperative recurrence continue to pose significant challenges in the treatment of advanced&#8208;stage cancer, highlighting the urgent necessity for early diagnosis and precise intraoperative identification of lesions. In this study, we synthesized a series of molecules derived from the traditional nucleic acid probe thiazole orange (TO), by incorporating alkyl chains of varying lengths and hydrophilic functional groups. Among them, the specific lipophilicity of TO&#8208;Ac (a derivative of TO) enables its penetration into cancer cells, where it binds to nucleic acids and generates intense fluorescence, while being effectively excluded by normal cell membranes. The differential cholesterol content in cell plasma membranes was confirmed to influence the selective uptake of molecules in cancer cells. Accordingly, we established a quantitative design criterion (LogP&#160;=&#160;1.48&#8211;1.62) that predicts cancer cell specificity based on oil&#8208;water partition coefficients. Finally, TO&#8208;Ac was successfully applied for detection of early&#8208;stage colon cancer, enabling complete tumor resection via fluorescence imaging while identifying lesions that would otherwise remain undetected. This passive targeting strategy fundamentally challenges the conventional paradigm of ligand&#8208;modified probes, offering a transformative approach for the development of universal tumor identification systems.

         <title>Tailoring Na&#8314; Chelation Dynamics for Expedient Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,1&#8208;diethoxyethane (CDEE) molecule, characterized by its weak chelation effect, diminishes its interaction with Na&#8314; ions and promotes the formation of an aggregation&#8208;dominated solvation sheath. This solvation environment demonstrates remarkable compatibility with both sodium&#8208;metal anode and sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode, ultimately enabling Na&#8211;S batteries to achieve superior cycling performance under low&#8208;temperature conditions.








Abstract
Sodium&#8211;sulfur (Na&#8211;S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical energy density and the abundant natural availability of sodium and sulfur. However, sluggish kinetics of sulfur conversion, slow Na&#8314; transport, and interfacial instability at low temperatures pose significant challenges for their operation and limit their practical application. Herein, three solvents with well&#8208;designed molecular configurations are examined. We systematically investigate the impact of chelation effect on the desolvation behavior, sulfur conversion process, ion dynamics, and Na&#8314; plating/stripping behavior. Compared with conventional linear ether solvents, the incorporation of methyl groups not only weaken the chelation capability and tailors the inner solvation sheath, but also reduces the energy barrier for Na&#8314; transport, thus promoting enhanced sulfur conversion kinetics under low temperature conditions. This work elucidates the relationship among solvent molecules, Na&#8314; desolvation behavior, and sulfur reaction kinetics, and offers a strategy for rational design of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature metal&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Effective Coordination Promoted Carbene N&#9472;H Bond Insertion on Heterogeneous Cu Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we develop a heterogeneous copper catalyst for carbene N&#9472;H insertion reactions between diazo esters and challenging aliphatic amines including monoethanolamine. Mechanistic studies reveal that effective coordination of the amine to a Cu site adjacent to the carbene&#8208;binding metal center enhances the reactivity of carbene N&#9472;H insertion while avoiding catalyst deactivation by amine poisoning.








Abstract
In this study, we present a rationally designed Cu nanowire (NW) catalyst for carbene N&#9472;H bond insertion, addressing the challenges associated with highly coordinative aliphatic amines. The heterogeneous Cu NW catalyst with well&#8208;defined structures efficiently catalyzed carbene insertion reactions between various &#945;&#8208;aryl diazoesters and aliphatic amines including monoethanolamine (MEA), achieving moderate to high yields. Infrared spectroscopy analysis and theoretical studies confirm the strong coordination of MEA on the surface of the Cu NW. Comprehensive kinetic studies reveal that both the two substrates and Cu NW were involved in the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS). Notably, the observed second&#8208;order dependence on Cu NW suggests that two identical Cu atoms participated in the RDS, one coordinating with the carbene carbon and the other binding with the amine nitrogen. A Hammett&#8208;plot study with 4&#8208;substituted benzylamines reveal that amines bearing electron&#8208;donating groups reacted significantly more slowly than those bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, supporting a concerted N&#9472;H carbene insertion mechanism. Collectively, these findings elucidate the exceptional catalytic performance of Cu NW in carbene N&#9472;H bond insertion reactions, further underscoring the significance of heterogeneous catalysts in organic transformations.

         <title>Unconventional Inverse Size&#8208;Effects Enable Efficient C&#8211;N Coupling on Copper Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional inverse size effect has been discovered in the electrocatalytic C&#8211;N coupling reaction for oxime synthesis on metal Cu materials. Exposed coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) on Cu particles promote the over&#8208;reduction of key coupling intermediates, namely *NH2OH and *Ph&#8211;CHO. Since the density of CUS decreases with increasing geometric size, Cu foil, possessing few CUS, was selected to achieve high&#8208;yield synthesis of diverse oximes.








Abstract
Exposed coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) with the reducing geometrical sizes of catalysts commonly offers significant advantages in heterogeneous electrocatalytic processes. However, this empirical rule might be unsuitable for the innovative electrocatalytic C&#8211;N coupling reaction, as one of the parallel reactions. In this study, we observe an inverse size&#8208;effect in the electrocatalytic synthesis of benzaldehyde oximes (BAO) from nitrates and benzaldehyde. Cu nanocatalysts with more exposed CUS thermodynamically favor the over&#8208;reduction of coupling intermediates, i.e., adsrobed hydroxylamine (*NH2OH) and benzaldehyde (*Ph&#8208;CHO), leading to a low BAO yield. Notably, Cu foil with few CUS enables the enrichment of *NH2OH and *Ph&#8208;CHO, achieving a BAO yield of 91%. Moreover, this electrosynthesis strategy on Cu foil demonstrates versatility and broad applicability for producing various oximes. This work highlights the significant potential of inverse size effects in guiding the design of catalysts for electrocatalytic C&#8211;N coupling reactions.

         <title>Harnessing Halogen Bonds in Porous Molecular Crystals for Efficient SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a triptycene&#8208;based porous molecular crystal in which crystal dislocation exposes &#963;&#8208;holes to the pore surface, enabling strong halogen&#8208;bonding interactions with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and achieving high SF6/N2 selectivity. This study showcases the remarkable potential of halogen bonding in gas separation and in the discovery of novel porous materials.








Abstract
Halogen bonding offers a directional and tunable noncovalent interaction that remains underexplored in the design of porous molecular materials. Here, we report FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#946;, a porous molecular crystal that uniquely integrates permanent porosity, high thermal stability, solution processability, and halogen bonding capability. Upon desolvation, FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#945; undergoes a structural transformation into the denser FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#946; phase, featuring distorted 1D channels lined with exposed &#963;&#8208;holes on bromine atoms. This architecture enables selective halogen bond&#8208;mediated interactions with fluorinated gases. FPMC&#8208;1&#8208;&#946; exhibits a sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)/N2 selectivity of 178.6 at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar&#8212;setting a new record among all reported porous molecular crystals and soluble porous materials. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the high selectivity arises from strong F&#8943;Br halogen bonding with SF6, in contrast to the weak, nonspecific interactions observed for N2.

         <title>Engineering Nanoscale Interfacial Solvation Inner&#8208;Outer Configuration via Multi&#8208;Group Synergy for Practical Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study clearly elucidates the interfacial solvation inner&#8208;outer configuration of aqueous electrolyte for the first time. Trace multifunctional group biomolecular additive (DP) contributes to formation of the positively charged Zn2+ solvation shell in outer Helmholtz layer and additive&#8208;involved and H2O/anion&#8208;less shell in inner Helmholtz layer, which affords long&#8208;lifespan practical aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Rational design of interfacial solvation structures in electric double layer (EDL) remains a critical challenge for aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Herein, an efficient multi&#8208;group synergy strategy has been proposed to precisely regulate the interfacial solvation structure at nanoscale, which affords long&#8208;lifespan AZMBs under high depth of discharge (DOD) and low temperature. Through combined in situ experiments and theoretical simulations, we demonstrate trace multifunctional group biomolecular additive cannot alter electrolyte solvation structure, but contributes to formation of the positively charged Zn2+ solvation shell in outer Helmholtz layer (OHL) and additive&#8208;involved and H2O/anion&#8208;less solvation shell in inner Helmholtz layer (IHL). This synergistic configuration enables an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid interface that simultaneously suppresses hydrogen evolution, accelerates desolvation, offers pH buffering capacity, and regulates Zn2&#8314; deposition orientation. Zn anodes deliver high coulombic efficiency of 99.65%, long&#8208;lifespan over 6500 h, and stable operation under low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C and high DOD of 85.4%. Furthermore, under practical condition of high mass loading (27&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) and limited N/P ratio of 3.5, Zn||VO2 battery delivers a superhigh surface capacity of 8.1&#160;mAh&#183;cm&#8722;2 and remains stable over 800 cycles, and pouch batteries can stably operate for almost 500 cycles.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalytic direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDM) has been proposed for the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of alcohols to aldehyde compounds. Such a mechanism has been demonstrated and validated on Pt/Co3O4/CC catalyst developed for efficient glycolaldehyde dimer synthesis, which features a FE of as high as &#8764;100.0%, a selectivity of 99.0% and a productivity of 204.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, ranking among the highest of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts in neutral electrolyte.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic upgrading of low&#8208;value carbon sources has been widely regarded as a green approach for synthesizing diverse chemicals and promising route to attain carbon neutrality goals. However, according to the prevailing reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated mechanism (ROSMM), these reactions suffer from harsh reaction conditions (strong basic electrolyte) and high energy costs (high reaction potential, especially under neutral conditions). Here, a novel electrochemical direct dehydrogenation mechanism (DDM) has been proposed. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept, Pt/Co3O4/CC catalyst has been developed to accelerate the dehydrogenation reaction for efficient upgrading of ethylene glycol to glycolaldehyde dimer. Impressively, an ultralow potential of 0.4&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of 3.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100.0%, a selectivity of 99.0% and an extra&#8208;high productivity of 204.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in neutral electrolyte have been obtained, which are among the highest of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts ever reported. Various value&#8208;added aldehydes can be obtained by similar approach. The proposed direct dehydrogenation mechanism offers novel perspectives for electrocatalyst design, reaction pathway modulation, and energy consumption reduction in the syntheses of high&#8208;value chemicals by electrocatalytic upgrading reactions.

         <title>Uphill Anion Transporters with Ultrahigh Efficiency Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal complexes with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands enable highly efficient and selective anion transport across lipid bilayers, exhibiting remarkable activity with an EC50 as low as 3.6 pM. Moreover, these NHC&#8208;based organometallic transporters can drive uphill ion transport, reminiscent of proton pumps and ATPases.








Abstract
Essential to the function of living systems, transmembrane ion transport in nature has inspired synthetic mimics that advance therapeutics, separations, sensing, and bioelectronics. Here, we report highly efficient and selective anion transport mediated by simple N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organometallic compounds. Using ruthenium (Ru) as the central metal and ion binding site, we systematically investigated seven classes of organoruthenium scaffolds and found that NHC&#8208;based Ru complexes demonstrated exceptionally high activity and selectivity. Extending the study to more metals, NHC complexes of Pd, Ag, and Cu also exhibited remarkable transport efficiency, with the iPrPh&#8208;NHC organocopper compound achieving an EC50 as low as 3.6 pM, surpassing one of the most active ion transporters, prodigiosin. Notably, NHC&#8208;based organometallic transporters leverage distinct kinetics of ligand binding and membrane diffusion to generate transmembrane potentials, and drive uphill ion transport reminiscent of proton pumps and ATPases. This work provides foundations for further development of organometallic ion transporters with high efficiency, tunable selectivity, and unique functions.

         <title>A Multiply and Long&#8208;Chain Branched Polyolefin with Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)&#8208;Like Properties Containing Two Types of Functional Groups</title>

The combination of coordinative chain transfer polymerization of ethylene and branched alpha&#8208;olefins, ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization and hydrogenation catalysis yield a highly flexible catalytic synthesis of multiply and long&#8208;chain branched polyolefins under mild conditions with two types of functional groups.








Abstract
Low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) is an important material or plastic, which, unfortunately, is synthesized under very harsh conditions and challenging to recycle. We report here on a highly flexible catalytic synthesis of multiply branched and long&#8208;chain branched polyolefins under mild conditions. We combine coordinative chain transfer polymerization of ethylene and branched alpha&#8208;olefins with ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization and hydrogenation catalysis. Our plastic contains two types of functional groups: olefins and esters. The olefin functional groups can be used to enable closed&#8208;loop recycling, and the ester groups permit faster decomposition than LDPE to potentially reduce the micro&#8208;plastic formation or enable a second depolymerization pathway. Our material matches key properties of LDPE, such as the melting point, rheology and stress&#8211;strain behavior.

Engineered DNA crystals provides a platform to regularly arrange guest molecules for crystallographic study. Herein, the 3D structure of T&#8208;junction, a commonly used motif in DNA nanotechnology, was revealed.








Abstract
Engineering DNA crystals is the primary motivation for structural DNA nanotechnology. Among many potential applications, such crystals promise as a platform to precisely (in terms of both location and orientation) organize biomolecules into 3D crystals for X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies of the guest biomolecules. The crystal formation depends on rationally designed DNA frameworks instead of unpredictable interactions between the guest molecule themselves; thus, avoiding the crystallization problem of biomolecules. This approach was proposed 40 years ago, however, has not been realized so far. Herein, we report an effort along this direction to study DNA T&#8208;junction, a common DNA structure used in DNA nanoconstruction. This study is an initial demonstration of the feasibility of the 40&#8208;year&#8208;old proposal. We expect that it would be quickly adapted to study many other molecules, particularly nucleic acids (e.g., aptamers, catalytic DNAs/RNAs, ribozymes, and ribonucleoproteins) that are, otherwise, difficult to be studied.

         <title>A Theory&#8208;Driven Moderation Strategy for Electrolyte Design Unlocks Stable Aqueous Zinc Deposition</title>

Guided by the Sabatier principle and theoretical calculations, this work establishes a non&#8208;extremum model for additive screening to balance the relationship between additive theoretically properties and the solvation/interface stability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. Using alcohol molecules as a model system, 1,6&#8208;hexanediol with balanced interfacial parameters enables highly reversible Zn deposition.








Abstract
How theoretically screened solvation characteristics of additives affect zinc deposition behavior has emerged as a critical question of both scientific and practical relevance. Here, using a series of structurally analogous alcohol&#8208;based molecules as a model system and guided by theoretical calculations, we establish a non&#8208;extremum empirical model for additive screening to balance the relationship between additive theoretically properties and the solvation/interface stability in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery electrolytes. Solvation capability, adsorption strength, and interfacial electrostatic properties were calculated to directly probe the critical role of a balanced set of molecular parameters in modulating Zn2+ coordination structure and interface stability. As a result, 1,6&#8208;hexanediol, exhibited a set of balanced and non&#8208;extremum molecular parameters, significantly enhanced the reversibility of zinc deposition/stripping, delivered the best electrochemical performance that extending the cycling lifespan to 2&#160;600&#160;h, which is consistent with the Sabatier principle. This study provides a new theoretical perspective for the rational screen of electrolyte additives and highlights the importance of expanding the selection criteria for optimizing interfacial stability.

A series of novel hybrid manganese bromide glasses was developed by structurally engineering pyridinium&#8208;based cations. The optimized (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy)2MnBr4 (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpyridinium) combines efficient luminescence with exceptional glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA), serving as a high&#8208;resolution scintillator (18&#160;lp mm&#8722;1) for X&#8208;ray imaging. Its robust GFA also enables the fabrication of two&#8208;component glasses for visual radiation detection. 








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide (OIMH) glasses represent a promising class of functional materials due to their facile synthesis, high transparency, and composition tunability. However, a significant gap persists in the diversity of applicable glassy material systems and the availability of well&#8208;defined structural design guidelines compared to their crystalline counterparts. Herein, we synthesized a series of pyridine&#8208;based OIMH crystals exhibiting efficient luminescence and exceptional melting properties. Through systematic benzyl functionalization and phenyl substitution on the pyridinium cation, we have optimized both luminescence efficiency and glass&#8208;forming ability (GFA). Among them, (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy)2MnBr4 (1&#8208;Bz&#8208;3&#8208;PhPy&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;3&#8208;phenylpyridinium) displays the lowest melting temperature (Tm&#160;=&#160;111.9&#160;&#176;C) and the highest glass transition temperature (Tg&#160;=&#160;50.3&#160;&#176;C), yielding excellent GFA as indicated by a high Tg/Tm ratio of 0.84. The exceptional GFA is further demonstrated by the glass's remarkable stability, retaining an amorphous state even after annealing at 80&#160;&#176;C for 8 weeks. It also allows for co&#8208;melting with other easily crystallizable components, which facilitates the preparation of two&#8208;component glasses with precisely tunable radioluminescence properties. These advanced glassy materials provide opportunities for practical X&#8208;ray imaging and real&#8208;time visualization of multicolor radiation detection, further establishing new design paradigms for OIMH scintillators.

         <title>Ether&#8208;Anchored MOFs Enable Stable Pseudosuspension Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;chain ether&#8208;functionalized MOF (S@MOF) was engineered to form a pseudosuspension electrolyte that efficiently tailors Li+ coordination and reconstructs the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, yielding durable interfacial ion&#8208;transport kinetics and accelerating bulk ion transport. The S@MOF electrolyte delivers outstanding cycling stability from &#8722;10 to 60 &#176;C under lean&#8208;electrolyte (25 &#181;L) and thin&#8208;lithium (50 &#181;m) conditions, and it also maintains high electrochemical performance in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells and sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Rational electrolyte design, capable of simultaneously accelerating bulk ion transport and stabilizing&#160;interfacial chemistry, is indispensable for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, we demonstrate that short&#8208;chain ether&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic frameworks (S@MOFs) meet these requirements by efficiently tailoring Li&#8314; coordination and reconstructing the electrode/electrolyte interphase, achieving durable interfacial ion transport kinetics. Synergistic experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the S@MOF&#8208;based electrolyte features distinctive pseudosuspension characteristics, harnessing ether chemistry that affords Li&#8208;metal compatibility and Li&#8208;salt coordination in concert with MOF's abundant binding sites and ordered rigid frameworks. The resultant S@MOF&#8208;based electrolyte delivers robust thermodynamic stability across &#8722;10 to 60&#160;&#176;C, even in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li full&#8208;cell configurations. Under lean&#8208;electrolyte and 50&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick Li&#8208;metal configurations, it achieves 92.40% capacity retention for LiCoO2||Li after 1000 cycles. Remarkably, 90.70% for quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state NCM811||Li (500 cycles), and 93.21% for Na3V2(PO4)3||Na (3000 cycles) were obtained, confirming its broad applicability across alkali&#8208;metal battery chemistries.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Directed C&#9472;C Coupling inside Three&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks for CO2 Electroreduction to C2 Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;dimensional (3D) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) was designed for transforming CO2 to C2 products within its channels. The unique spatial arrangement of the neighboring Fe sites facilitates the C&#9472;C coupling reaction of the *OCH2 intermediates, promoting the formation of CH3CH2OH and C2H4.








Abstract
The CO2 electroreduction reaction to fuels and chemicals is a promising strategy for storing intermittent energy (such as sunlight and wind power) and closing the carbon cycle. Producing multi&#8208;carbon oxygenates and hydrocarbons (C2+) with broader applicability is highly desirable. However, the difficulty of the C&#9472;C coupling reaction hinders the conversion of CO2 to C2+ products with high energy input, low reaction rate, and poor selectivity. Here, we construct a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Fe&#8208;quinoxalinedithiol (Fe&#8208;QDT)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) featuring dual Fe sites within its ordered channel walls, enabling efficient interwall electrocatalysis for C2 coupling reactions. We found that dual Fe sites can co&#8208;catalyze the dimerization of *OCH2 to *OCH2CH2O*, thus facilitating the generation of C2 products. The free energy changes for the potential&#8208;limiting steps in the electroreduction of C2 species are &#8722;0.010 and 0.045&#160;eV for CH3CH2OH and C2H4, respectively, which are significantly lower than those for other C2 products. Consequently, the Fe&#8208;QDT MOFs demonstrate high activity and selectivity in converting CO2 to CH3CH2OH and C2H4. This work designs a novel and efficient active site for C&#9472;C coupling and provides valuable insights into the design principles of electrocatalysts for C2 products.

         <title>Stabilizing Configurational Entropy in Spinel&#8208;type High Entropy Oxides during Discharge&#8211;Charge by Overcoming Kinetic Sluggish Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically investigates the phase evolution pathways in spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxides, revealing that the high entropy&#8208;mediated kinetic sluggish diffusion results in incomplete transformations of the rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like intermediate phase during discharge, ultimately causing unfavorable entropy&#8208;state transitions. However, reducing the solid&#8208;state diffusion length effectively overcomes these kinetic limitations, thereby preserving the desirable high&#8208;entropy state.








Abstract
Spinel&#8208;type high entropy oxides (HEOs) have emerged as promising next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes owing to exceptional electrochemical performance. However, suppressing irreversible phase transformations caused by high&#8208;entropy to low&#8208;entropy state transitions during discharge&#8211;charge has remained challenging. The core issue stems from an insufficient understanding of phase evolution pathways and the key thermodynamic/kinetic driving forces, which is due to current methodological limitations in analyzing highly disordered structures. Further complicating this challenge is the elusive impact of nanosized effects on both thermodynamic and kinetic processes. This study addresses these challenges through three synergistic approaches: 1) investigating phase evolution mechanisms across different particle sizes to delineate nanosized effects; 2) resolving complex local structures by pair distribution function analyses and 7Li magic&#8208;angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; 3) elucidating influences of high entropy on phase evolution via DFT calculations. Comprehensive results reveal a complex phase evolution process governed by the thermodynamic&#8208;kinetic interplay. The incomplete phase transformations of the rock&#8208;salt&#8208;like intermediate phase during discharge, which are attributable to high entropy&#8208;mediated kinetic sluggish diffusion, account for the transition from high&#8208;entropy to low&#8208;entropy states.

     alt="Stabilizing Configurational Entropy in Spinel-type High Entropy Oxides during Discharge&#8211;Charge by Overcoming Kinetic Sluggish Diffusion"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study systematically investigates the phase evolution pathways in spinel-type high entropy oxides, revealing that the high entropy-mediated kinetic sluggish diffusion results in incomplete transformations of the rock-salt-like intermediate phase during discharge, ultimately causing unfavorable entropy-state transitions. However, reducing the solid-state diffusion length effectively overcomes these kinetic limitations, thereby preserving the desirable high-entropy state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinel-type high entropy oxides (HEOs) have emerged as promising next-generation lithium-ion battery anodes owing to exceptional electrochemical performance. However, suppressing irreversible phase transformations caused by high-entropy to low-entropy state transitions during discharge&#8211;charge has remained challenging. The core issue stems from an insufficient understanding of phase evolution pathways and the key thermodynamic/kinetic driving forces, which is due to current methodological limitations in analyzing highly disordered structures. Further complicating this challenge is the elusive impact of nanosized effects on both thermodynamic and kinetic processes. This study addresses these challenges through three synergistic approaches: 1) investigating phase evolution mechanisms across different particle sizes to delineate nanosized effects; 2) resolving complex local structures by pair distribution function analyses and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; 3) elucidating influences of high entropy on phase evolution via DFT calculations. Comprehensive results reveal a complex phase evolution process governed by the thermodynamic-kinetic interplay. The incomplete phase transformations of the rock-salt-like intermediate phase during discharge, which are attributable to high entropy-mediated kinetic sluggish diffusion, account for the transition from high-entropy to low-entropy states. By shortening the solid-state diffusion lengths, the kinetic limitations can be overcome, as demonstrated by nanosized spinel-type HEOs achieving reversible phase transformations during discharge-charge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hyperbranched Oxime&#8208;Ester Covalent Adaptive Network for Recyclable Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric Epoxy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation&#8208;tunable dendrimer crosslinkers yield recyclable epoxy printed circuit board with ultralow dielectric constant/loss (2.02/0.005), excellent mechanical robustness and flame retardancy. By sterically restricting the dipolar relaxation losses of dynamic oxime&#8208;ester bonds and regulating free volume, the coral&#8208;like rigid hyperbranched topology reconciles the tradeoff between circularity and high&#8208;frequency performance in sustainable electronics.








Abstract
Epoxy thermosets are indispensable in high&#8208;frequency (5G/6G) electronics, but their permanent crosslinks hinder recyclability and worsen e&#8208;waste. Although covalent adaptable networks (CANs) offer recyclability, their polar dynamic bonds exacerbate dielectric losses at gigahertz (GHz) bands due to dipolar relaxation. Here, we develop generation&#8208;tunable dendritic dynamic crosslinkers that yield recyclable epoxy&#8208;based printed circuit board (PCB) with ultralow dielectric performance. O&#8208;acylation reaction of a vanillin&#8208;derived tetrahedral aldoxime with phthalic anhydride affords precise control over generations, branching degree, and nanomorphology of the crosslinkers. This controlled synthesis yields porous coral&#8208;like architecture, which in turn produces graded&#8208;branched epoxy CANs with enhanced free volume and steric confinement. Within the rigid constrained topology, the network containing spherically distributed oxime&#8208;ester motifs exhibits restricted dipolar relaxation and achieves low dielectric loss in GHz bands, while remaining acid&#8208;cleavable for closed&#8208;loop recycling at 80&#160;&#176;C. The resulting PCB exhibits a record&#8208;low dielectric constant/loss (2.02/0.005@10&#160;GHz), 71.53% improved X&#8208;band impedance matching, a tensile strength of 256&#160;MPa, and V&#8208;0 flame retardancy, alongside a 98.9% reduction in ecotoxicity after recycling. This work demonstrates how precision dendrimer synthesis and topology regulation can reconcile the tradeoff between circularity and high&#8208;frequency performance in sustainable electronics.

         <title>Complete Recycling of Polyester Wastes with Dialkyl Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PET can be completely depolymerized into dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) using dimethyl carbonate (DMC) catalyzed by [N4444]Cl at 80&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. Based on this reaction, highly efficient and complete degradation of PET in various blended textiles has been achieved, yielding DMT while preserving the structural integrity of other components, including both natural and synthetic fibers.








Abstract
Chemical and biological recycling of spent polyesters is of great significance for solving problems caused by their accumulation, but generally suffering from requirements for high temperature, specific catalysts or enzymes, and incomplete depolymerization in most cases. Here, we report a novel strategy for complete depolymerization of polyesters (e.g., poly(ethylene terephthalate), PET) with dialkyl carbonates (e.g., dimethyl carbonate, DMC) into monomers over halide salts (e.g., tetrabutylammonium chloride, [N4444]Cl) under mild conditions. We demonstrate that PET can be completely degraded into dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) using DMC over [N4444]Cl at temperatures of 80&#8764;120 &#176;C. Based on this reaction, we have achieved highly efficient and complete depolymerization of PET in various PET blend textiles into DMT while preserving the structural integrity of other components including natural and synthetic components. Mechanistic studies reveal the key role of methoxy anion derived from DMC in cleaving the acyl C&#9472;O bond of polyesters. Techno&#8208;economic assessment for recycling of spent PET wastes demonstrates excellent economic profit.

         <title>Proton Alloying in an Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Material Enables Unusual Dynamic Birefringence and Martensitic Actuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, we have successfully synthesized a novel hydrogen&#8208;proton alloyed organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, characterized by two distinct protonated Cyclen cations within its lattice. This unique structural paradigm gives rise to an asynchronous orientation mechanism, enabling outstanding martensitic phase transition and multimodal dynamic birefringence behaviors.








Abstract
Alloying is widely recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing or unlocking material properties by combining different elements. Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials (OIHMs) allow for chemical modification at the molecular level, bringing new opportunities and enormous potential to alloying strategies. Hydrogen protons in molecules are essential for structural design and crystal engineering, however, valuable role of proton alloying in OIHMs remains largely unexplored. Herein, for the first time, we present a proton alloying OIHM [Cyclen4+Cyclen2+]Sb2Cl12 (Cyclen&#8208;1D), which exhibits exceptional martensitic actuation behaviors, including jumping, bending and a significant raising effect with a large expansion up to 50%. Meanwhile, Cyclen&#8208;1D also possesses unusual multi&#8208;mode dynamic birefringence featuring continuous modulation and switching mutation, showing an excellent birefringence change (&#916;n&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.044). This interesting integration of mechanical and optical channels originates from the asynchronous orientations of distinct protonated Cyclen cations as well as cooperative transformation with inorganic octahedron through hydrogen bonding. This work reveals the great potential of proton alloying in OIHMs, opening new avenues for designing dynamically stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>A General Strategy to Develop Intramolecular Spirocyclic Boron Dipyrromethene Fluorophores for Self&#8208;Blinking Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for first&#8208;in&#8208;class, spontaneously blinking BODIPY fluorophores via intramolecular spirocyclization is developed. Tuning the electrophilic core enables a controllable open/closed equilibrium, providing broad pKa tunability (1.8&#8211;12.0) and revealing pKa&#8208;structure&#8208;activity relationships. These probes facilitate buffer&#8208;free, self&#8208;blinking live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution imaging under low laser power. 








Abstract
Intramolecular spirocyclic fluorophores, with their controllable on&#8208;off switching, have enabled diverse stimuli&#8208;responsive probes and serve as cornerstones of self&#8208;blinking super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, their design has been largely restricted to Rhodamine frameworks, while boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, renowned for their superior photostability, brightness, and near&#8208;infrared tunability, remain underutilized due to the inherent rigidity of the indacene core. To overcome this limitation, we developed a general molecular engineering strategy to confer BODIPY with spirocyclic functionality: Introducing 2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)phenyl or 2&#8208;carboxyphenyl groups at the meso&#8208;position as intramolecular nucleophiles, coupled with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at &#945;/&#946;&#8208;positions to modulate core electron density and enhance meso&#8208;carbon's electrophilicity. We present the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure of a spirocyclized BODIPY, unambiguously confirming the closed form and its blinking mechanism. By tuning this system, we established a clear pKa&#8208;structure&#8208;activity relationship, enabling precise prediction and customization of the open&#8208;closed equilibrium. The resulting spirocyclization&#8208;capable BODIPYs exhibited exceptional brightness up to &#8764;87,122 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, and enable self&#8208;blinking super&#8208;resolution imaging of mitochondria and lysosomes in living cells under low&#8208;power laser density (&#8805;32&#160;W cm&#8722;2) without requiring imaging&#8208;enhancing buffers. This work pioneers the extension of intramolecular spirocyclization to the BODIPY scaffold, establishing a general design strategy for a new class of high&#8208;performance, stimuli&#8208;responsive probes.

However, their design has been largely restricted to Rhodamine frameworks, while boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes, renowned for their superior photostability, brightness, and near-infrared tunability, remain underutilized due to the inherent rigidity of the indacene core. To overcome this limitation, we developed a general molecular engineering strategy to confer BODIPY with spirocyclic functionality: Introducing 2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl or 2-carboxyphenyl groups at the &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-position as intramolecular nucleophiles, coupled with electron-withdrawing groups at &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-positions to modulate core electron density and enhance &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-carbon's electrophilicity. We present the first single-crystal X-ray structure of a spirocyclized BODIPY, unambiguously confirming the closed form and its blinking mechanism. By tuning this system, we established a clear &lt;i&gt;pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-structure-activity relationship, enabling precise prediction and customization of the open-closed equilibrium. The resulting spirocyclization-capable BODIPYs exhibited exceptional brightness up to &#8764;87,122 M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and enable self-blinking super-resolution imaging of mitochondria and lysosomes in living cells under low-power laser density (&#8805;32&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) without requiring imaging-enhancing buffers. This work pioneers the extension of intramolecular spirocyclization to the BODIPY scaffold, establishing a general design strategy for a new class of high-performance, stimuli-responsive probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Bridged Biphasic Molybdenum Carbide Interfaces: A Synergistic Catalyst for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>

This work highlights the effectiveness of the synergistic adsorption/desorption/catalysis mechanism in enabling a solid&#8211;solid conversion pathway for Li&#8211;Se batteries. This article not only addresses the issue of solid&#8211;solid conversion kinetics in Li&#8211;Se batteries, but also realizes a paradigm shift from material design to reaction pathway through the &#8220;atomic bridging&#8208;multiphase synergy&#8221; strategy, opening up a new direction for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.








Abstract
Transition metal catalysts are key to developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8208;Se) batteries. Herein, we report a rationally designed Ni&#8208;bridged biphasic molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) with a multi&#8208;interface structure that exposes abundant active sites and significantly enhances the electrochemically reversibility of Li&#8211;Se batteries under high current operation. The synergistic integration of catalytic and conductive functions facilitates the rapid deposition and conversion of Se/Li2Sex, effectively preventing electrode passivation caused by inactive accumulation during high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;term cycling. Furthermore, Ni serves dual roles as a structural bridge to link Mo2C lattice and an electronic modulator to optimize the d&#8208;orbital configuration of Mo, thereby maximizing the catalytic efficiency of functionalized Mo2C. The synergistic effects of adsorption, desorption, and catalysis enable the rationally designed metal carbide/Se electrode to promote not only the rapid conversion of long&#8208;chain Li2Sen species but also the solid&#8211;solid transformation of Li2Se2 into Li2Se. As a result, the electrode achieves full&#8208;process catalytic conversion in Li&#8211;Se batteries, delivering excellent cycling stability and high&#8208;rate performance. Even under high Se loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the electrode delivers an initial capacity of 400&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C. These results highlight the effectiveness of the synergistic adsorption/desorption/catalysis mechanism in enabling a fast solid&#8211;solid conversion pathway for Li&#8211;Se batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbenoid Allylic C&#9472;H Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Olefins Using Tailored Chiral Indenyl&#8208;Rhodium Catalysts</title>

This study introduces an efficient method for asymmetric allylic C&#9472;H activation of &#945;&#8208;olefins using chiral indenyl&#8208;rhodium complexes, achieving high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity through carbene transfer.








Abstract
Alpha (&#945;)&#8208;olefins represent cornerstone feedstocks in the chemical industry, offering a versatile platform for enhancing molecular complexity from readily available precursors. While remarkable strides have been made in the asymmetric functionalization of olefinic double bonds, the selective activation of allylic C&#9472;H bonds remain a formidable challenge. Herein, we unveil a catalytic asymmetric allylic C&#9472;H activation of &#945;&#8208;olefins through carbene transfer, leveraging highly active and synthetically accessible indenyl&#8211;rhodium complexes. These complexes, featuring indenyl ligands prepared via a streamlined, one&#8208;step Pd&#8208;catalyzed atropisomeric Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling, enable precise control over chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. This method exhibits exceptional versatility, accommodating a diverse array of olefins, ranging from bulk industrial products to those adorned with various functional groups. A comprehensive series of experiments was conducted to illustrate the wide&#8208;ranging applicability of the asymmetric C&#9472;H activation reaction. Mechanistic investigations elucidate critical factors governing rhodium carbenoid formation, branch selectivity, and enantioselectivity during the C&#9472;H activation process.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Terphenyl Radicals and Anions: Tuning Stability and Redox Properties via Substituent Patterning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two series of C2&#8208;terphenylated derivatives of three N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have been reported. The para&#8208;terphenylated species exhibit three stable (reversible) redox states (e.g., [2b]+, [2b]&#9679; and [2b]&#8722;), while for the meta&#8208;terphenylated derivatives only cationic and neutral states (i.e., [3b]+ and [3b]&#9679;) are reversible.








Abstract
Herein, we report the influence of C2&#8208;terphenyl substitution patterns (i.e., p&#8208;terphenyl versus m&#8208;terphenyl) on the redox behavior and stability of the corresponding radicals and anions derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). Three well&#8208;known NHCs; SIPr (1a), IPr (1b), and Me&#8208;IPr (1c) (SIPr&#160;=&#160;C{N(Dipp)CH2}2, IPr&#160;=&#160;C{N(Dipp)CH}2; Me&#8208;IPr&#160;=&#160;C{N(Dipp)CCH3}2; Dipp&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3); were functionalized at the C2 position using 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;p&#8208;terphenyl (p&#8208;TerBr) and 5&#8242;&#8208;bromo&#8208;m&#8208;terphenyl (m&#8208;TerBr) under nickel catalysis, yielding the corresponding cations [(NHC)p&#8208;Ter]Br (2a&#8211;c) and [(NHC)m&#8208;Ter]Br (3a&#8211;c), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of 2a&#8211;c reveal two distinct reversible redox events, while 3a&#8211;c exhibit one reversible and one irreversible or quasi&#8208;reversible wave. Reduction of 2a&#8211;c and 3a&#8211;c with KC8 readily affords stable radicals [(NHC)p&#8208;Ter]&#9679; (4a&#8211;c) and [(NHC&#8208;m&#8208;Ter]&#9679; (5a&#8211;c), isolated as crystalline solids. Further reduction of 4a&#8211;c produces diamagnetic anions [(NHC)p&#8208;Ter]K (6a&#8211;c&#8208;K), consistent with the electrochemical data. In contrast, 5b and 5c are unreactive toward KC8 under similar conditions, while 5a (derived from the more electrophilic NHC 1a) can be reduced to the corresponding anion [(SIPr)m&#8208;Ter]K (7a&#8208;K). Selected compounds have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, with computational studies supporting the experimental findings. The results highlight how the NHC and the C2&#8208;terphenyl substituent influence the properties and stability of the resulting species.

         <title>Access to Inherently and Centrally Chiral Calix[4]Arenes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#9472;H Activation and Insertion into Diverse Olefins and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed desymmetrizative C&#8211;H activation allows enantioselective synthesis of calix[4]arenes with inherent chirality (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and with integrated inherent and central chirality (all&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1 dr, up to 97% ee) via C&#9472;C coupling with alkenes, alkynes, and 1,3&#8208;enynes.








Abstract
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes are important scaffolds in asymmetric catalysis and sensing, yet their enantioselective synthesis remains challenging due to limited synthetic methodology and lengthy synthetic routes. By resorting to rhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation of calix[4]arene&#8208;based carboxamides, atom&#8208;economical construction of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes has been realized with alkenes, alkynes, and 1,3&#8208;enynes as the coupling partner. Several classes of calix[4]arenes with inherent chirality (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and integrated inherent and central chirality (up to 97% ee, &gt;20:1 dr) have been readily accessed under nearly unified conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and diverse downstream transformations demonstrated the scalability and broad utility of this methodology to access other calix[4]arene&#8208;fused heterocycles, such as isoquinoline and isoindolinone. Representative products exhibit promising fluorescence properties, suggesting potential applications in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Pentagonal/Heptagonal&#8208;Lock Strategy Enables Narrowband Red Multiple Resonance Emitters Through Temperature&#8208;Controlled Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward pentagonal/heptagonal &#960;&#8208;extension strategy was implemented on a multiple&#8208;resonance framework using temperature&#8208;controlled Scholl reactions. This approach enables an efficient narrowband red fluorescent emitter, achieving a significant emission redshift of 116&#160;nm while retaining a small full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 30&#160;nm.








Abstract
Although &#960;&#8208;extension has shown considerable success in achieving red&#8208;shifted emission in multiple resonance (MR) emitters, it often induces substantial spectral broadening, thereby limiting its utility for developing high&#8208;performance red MR materials. Herein, we report a straightforward naphthalene&#8208;based pentagonal/heptagonal&#8208;lock &#960;&#8208;extension strategy that enables a significant redshift of 116&#160;nm while maintaining a narrow emission bandwidth. By controlling the Scholl reaction at different temperatures, we achieved precise &#960;&#8208;extension through sequential pentagonal and heptagonal ring formation, enabling broad color tuning via fine adjustment of frontier molecular orbital energy gaps. As a result, a red fluorescent emitter was obtained, exhibiting an emission peak at 600&#160;nm and a narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 30&#160;nm. Furthermore, the corresponding OLED devices exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 21.3% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Azobenzene/Triptycene&#8208;Based Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Dopants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral, photoswitchable dopants composed of triptycene and azobenzene exhibit exceptionally large helical twisting powers that change dramatically upon isomerization when incorporated into the liquid crystal (LC) host 5CB. By modulating the cholesteric pitch of the LC through light irradiation at different wavelengths, and reversing the effect thermally, the reflected light wavelength can be precisely tuned, yielding reversible, multicolored displays.








Abstract
The noncovalent interactions in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) can be modulated using switchable chiral dopants resulting in the phototuning of the reflected structural color. The nature of the interactions between the CLC and dopant, and how the latter can effectively transfer chiral information to the former is still somewhat of a black box. To gain insights into the nature of these interactions, we conducted structure&#8211;property analysis of five photoswitchable chiral dopants comprised of triptycene as the chiral core and azobenzene as the switchable unit. Our findings show that this combination results in high (e.g., 127&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1) helical twisting power (&#946;&#160;) values (i.e., extent of chiral information transfer between dopant and host), with dispersion interactions and/or electron deficient aromatic units playing a crucial role in determining the&#160;value. The large change in &#946; values upon E/Z photoswitching enabled us to devise multicolor, high contrast LC films that reflect across the UV to infrared light range.

         <title>Ultrawideband Emission of Bi3+ Ions Spanning Visible to Near&#8208;Infrared Spectral Regions (400 nm&#8211;1700 nm)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing Bi3+&#8208;activated K2MgGeO4, ultrawideband luminescence from 400 to 1700&#160;nm is achieved. This achievement overcomes the longstanding challenge of reabsorption&#8208;induced instability, a critical limitation that has persistently hindered the performance of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped broadband emitters designed for 400&#8211;1700&#160;nm ultrawideband emission when coupled with other visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting components.








Abstract
Although Bi3+ ions exhibit exceptional luminescent properties and spectral tunability, their potential as activators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) ultrawideband emission remains underexplored, while transition metal ions such as Ni2+, Fe3+, and Cr3+/4+ have long been the predominant candidates in this demanding research area. Herein, we demonstrate ultrawideband emission from 400 to 1700&#160;nm in K2MgGeO4:Bi3+ (KMGO:Bi3+), achieving an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 88.02% and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 66.41%. The emission spectrum features interconnected visible and NIR bands, peaking at 614 and 1125&#160;nm, respectively. Notably, the full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of the NIR band exceeds 340&#160;nm, significantly broader than most of the conventional phosphors doped with transition metal ions. Through a comprehensive combination of experimental investigations and crystal structure analysis, we elucidate the underlying mechanism of this ultra&#8208;broadband emission, attributing it to Bi3+ centers formed by the substitution of K+ and Mg2+ sites. This work expands the role of Bi3+ ions as activators in the second NIR (NIR&#8208;II) region, offering new insights into the design of ultra&#8208;broadband&#8208;emitting materials and introducing the only known phosphor capable of spanning the full 400&#160;nm to 1700&#160;nm spectrum, thereby filling a longstanding gap in this field.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Lewis acid/base&#8208;SalBinamAl&#8221; catalytic system was employed to achieve efficient DKRP of thiolactones with full monomer conversion and allowed access to chiral polythioesters with perfectly isotacticities (Pm up to 0.99). This dynamic kinetic resolution polymerization provides a new conceptual strategy to guide and inspire the synthesis of chiral polymers from racemic monomers.








Abstract
Chiral polymers are fundamentally important and interesting in nature and scientific research. For the preparation of chiral polymers, the standard kinetic resolution polymerization (KRP) of racemic monomers could only afford a 50% yield of chiral polymers with 50% unreacted monomer leftover. In this contribution, we have developed a dynamic kinetic resolution polymerization (DKRP) strategy to synthesize chiral polymers with complete conversion and improved isoselectivity from racemic monomers. A &#8220;Lewis acid/base&#8208;SalBinamAl&#8221; catalytic system was employed to achieve efficient DKRP of thiolactones with full monomer conversion and allowed access to chiral polythioesters with perfectly isotacticities (Pm up to 0.99). The formation of chiral polythioesters was confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and optical rotation testing. Detailed kinetic investigation supported a DKRP mechanism. This work represented the very first example of dynamic kinetic resolution ring&#8208;opening polymerization and could provide a new conceptual strategy to guide and inspire the synthesis of chiral polymers from racemic monomers.

         <title>&#8220;Noninnate&#8221; Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective 1,4&#8208;Polymerization of Alkynylcyclopropanes</title>

For ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of a given monomer, main&#8208;chain connectivity is typically predetermined regardless of polymerization mechanism. Leveraging &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium intermediates, we override the innate 1,5&#8208;addition pathway in the ROP of strained propargylic electrophiles, producing a conjugated diene&#8208;containing backbones with high stereoselectivity via 1,4&#8208;addition.








Abstract
In ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), main&#8208;chain connectivity is largely dictated by the inherent electronic and steric properties of the monomer. As a result, even when different polymerization mechanisms are employed, the same backbone structure is obtained. Here, we report catalyst&#8208;controlled, noninnate connectivity in the ROP of alkynylcyclopropane dicarboxylates (ACPs). Leveraging &#960;&#8208;propargyl palladium intermediates, we redirect the reactivity from the electronically favored 1,5&#8208;addition to a noninnate 1,4&#8208;addition pathway, furnishing a conjugated diene&#8208;based backbone with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The polymerization exhibits controlled characteristics under optimized conditions. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that a strategically positioned quaternary carbon center enforces high configurational rigidity in the organopalladium intermediate, thereby suppressing undesired cyclization and enabling rapid, stereospecific &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. This work demonstrates overriding the innate connectivity in ROP by precisely controlling the fate of organometallic intermediates.

         <title>Artificial Decision Tree Guided Screening of Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Cocrystals with Locally Excited States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial decision tree assisted by theoretical calculations has been proposed for the design and preparation of charge transfer ultralong room temperature phosphorescent cocrystals. The cocrystals can also be applied to visual and digital information encryption and time&#8208;gated optical waveguide systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput screening of ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) systems is essential for advancing photofunctional materials. Among molecular solids, charge&#8208;transfer (CT) cocrystals offer great potential due to the wide range of electron donors and acceptors with tunable energy levels. However, realizing RTP in CT systems remains difficult, as intricate orbital interactions in donor&#8211;acceptor pairs often lead to spin&#8208;forbidden singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet transitions. To overcome this challenge, we developed an artificial&#8208;decision&#8208;tree method guided by theoretical calculations and introduced an energy&#8208;based descriptor (E) to streamline the design of RTP&#8208;active cocrystals. This descriptor enables CT&#8208;dominated singlet emission alongside locally excited triplet emission, effectively promoting intersystem crossing. Applying this strategy, we predicted and experimentally validated new cocrystals (TP&amp;1,2&#8208;TFP and TP&amp;1,4&#8208;TFP), which achieved RTP lifetimes up to&#160;1.223&#160;s, the longest reported among current CT cocrystals. We further demonstrated the versatility of this strategy by identifying additional RTP&#8208;active systems (TP&amp;1,2&#8208;TCP and TP&amp;1,4&#8208;TCP). Owing to their tunable emission and time&#8208;resolved RTP, these materials were successfully employed in digital and visual information encryption and time&#8208;gated optical logic gate applications. Therefore, this work presents a robust framework that combines machine learning&#8208;driven prediction with experimental validation, offering a systematic and efficient alternative to traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods in the discovery of luminescent materials.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Axial Electric Field&#8208;Driven Electron&#8208;Rich Monomolecular Co Sites for Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to CO Over Ultrawide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, for the first time, p&#8208;type monomolecular CoPc were carefully anchored on n&#8208;type ZnOv support with rich oxygen vacancies, in which a strong axial BEF at the heterointerface could promote the electron transfer from ZnOv to CoPc, thus leading to electronic and geometric asymmetry of electron&#8208;rich molecular Co&#8208;N4 sites. Remarkably, this electrocatalyst showed an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 to CO over ultrawide potential window. 








Abstract
Using renewable electricity to convert CO2 into CO offers a sustainable route to producing a versatile intermediate to synthesize various chemicals and fuels. However, the conversion at scale is largely constrained owing to the lack of potential&#8208;universal feasibility. Here, we developed an electrocatalyst featuring CoPc anchored ZnO with rich oxygen vacancies (CoPc@ZnOv), thus improving the activity and selectivity of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Notably, the FEco of CoPc@ZnOv remains above 90% over an ultrawide potential window of 1.3&#160;V (&#8722;0.7 to &#8722;2.0&#160;V versus RHE) in H&#8208;type cell, 1.40&#160;V (&#8722;0.4 to &#8722;1.8&#160;V versus RHE) in flow cell and 1.0&#160;V (low cell voltages of 2.0&#8211;3.0&#160;V) in the MEA device, surpassing those of previously reported molecular CoPc&#8208;based electrocatalysts and even most single metal site materials. Density functional theory calculations combined with in&#8208;situ spectroscopies reveal that the built&#8208;in axial electric field arising from the p&#8211;n junction rectification effect could drive electron&#8208;rich single Co&#8208;N4 sites with asymmetric charge distribution and geometric curvature, which promotes *COOH formation (i.e., strong CO2 adsorption, rapid H2O dissociation and proton supply), *CO desorption and as well suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO via CO2RR over ultrawide potential windows. This work presents a novel catalyst design strategy of asymmetrical monomolecular Co&#8208;N4 sites based on the built&#8208;in axial electric field theory, as well as a new way to tune the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization for improved catalytic performance.

         <title>A Sonosensitive Heterometallic Polyoxometalate for Highly Efficient Chemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare sonosensitive polyoxometalate (ErSbW) with excellent water solubility, biocompatibility, and highly efficient catalytic activities was developed. Significantly, ErSbW demonstrates outstanding potential as a CSDT agent, showing a threefold enhancement in ROS generation efficiency in the TME upon ultrasound irradiation compared to CDT alone. Most notably, in vivo experiments demonstrated that ErSbW&#8208;mediated CSDT achieved complete regression of deep&#8208;seated melanoma tumors, highlighting its significant potential as a highly effective CSDT agent for cancer treatment. 








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;sonodynamic synergistic therapy (CSDT) integrates the advantages of both chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), including specificity, non&#8208;invasiveness, high penetration, and controllability, and it is especially suitable for deep&#8208;seated tumors.

&lt;p&gt;A rare sonosensitive polyoxometalate (ErSbW) with excellent water solubility, biocompatibility, and highly efficient catalytic activities was developed. Significantly, ErSbW demonstrates outstanding potential as a CSDT agent, showing a threefold enhancement in ROS generation efficiency in the TME upon ultrasound irradiation compared to CDT alone. Most notably, in vivo experiments demonstrated that ErSbW-mediated CSDT achieved complete regression of deep-seated melanoma tumors, highlighting its significant potential as a highly effective CSDT agent for cancer treatment.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Driven Interfacial Charge Redistribution in TiO2&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Photoanodes for Formate Production From Plastics and CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon interlayer promotes interfacial charge redistribution on photoanodes (Ni(OH)2/C/TiO2), enabling efficient photoelectrochemical coupling of waste plastic reforming and CO2 reduction. This PEC tandem cell achieves selective formate production without external bias, offering a sustainable route for simultaneous waste plastic valorization and greenhouse gas conversion.








Abstract
Coupling photoelectrochemical (PEC) waste plastic reforming with CO2 utilization to co&#8208;produce value&#8208;added chemicals offers a promising strategy to mitigate plastic pollution and carbon emissions. Yet, achieving high selectivity still requires highly active plastic&#8208;reforming photoanodes and effective integration with CO2 reduction photocathodes. Here, an ultrathin carbon interlayer was introduced into Ni(OH)2&#8208;TiO2 (named Ni(OH)2/C/TiO2) photoanode to modulate its interfacial electronic structure, thereby converting alkaline&#8208;pretreated polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into formate. The optimized photoanode delivered a formate yield 2.7 times that of bare Ni(OH)2/TiO2 with a stable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.2% across 0.4&#8211;1.2&#160;V versus RHE. The enhancement mechanism of the carbon layer was elucidated by in situ characterization and theoretical calculations. The carbon layer modulated interfacial charge distribution at the photoanode, which not only facilitates charge transfer but also strengthens adsorption of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol and stabilizes key intermediates, achieving high selectivity for formate. Additionally, a stable PEC tandem cell was assembled that co&#8208;converted PET and CO2 to formate without external bias, attaining a formate FE of 171.1% (FEmax&#160;=&#160;192.2% at 0.3&#160;V). This study provides insights into the role of carbon layers in optimizing interfacial reactions, guiding the development of an integrated PEC cell for simultaneous valorization of plastics and CO2.

         <title>A Picolyl&#8208;Based Cys Caging/Uncaging Strategy Facilitates Protein Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cysteine (Cys), with a reactive thiol group, is key for site&#8208;specific bioconjugation and chemical protein synthesis like native chemical ligation (NCL). We developed a picolyl&#8208;based photolabile protecting group (PPG) for Cys, enabling pH/wavelength&#8208;controlled caging/uncaging and photoorthogonal activation in the presence of a nitrobenzyl group. Its use in synthesizing glycoproteins such as tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) advances complex protein synthesis.








Abstract
Endowed with a reactive thiol group, cysteine (Cys) provides a versatile handle for site&#8208;specific bioconjugation and serves as a cornerstone of chemical protein synthesis, particularly in native chemical ligation (NCL). Extensions such as expressed protein ligation (EPL)&#8208;desulfurization have significantly broadened access to challenging proteins. However, they require orthogonal caging/uncaging protecting groups to enable selective desulfurization in the presence of native cysteines, a process that is crucial for synthetic applications. Photolabile protecting groups (PPGs), which are cleaved via irradiation, offer a simpler and less disruptive approach to protein assembly compared to traditional thiol protecting groups. However, current commercially available PPGs are not compatible with orthogonal protection and EPL&#8208;desulfurization. To address this challenge, we developed a novel and simple picolyl&#8208;based PPG for Cys caging/uncaging, which enables rapid orthogonal caging of thiols and their subsequent uncaging via pH and wavelength control. Notably, the picolyl group undergoes photoorthogonal activation in the presence of a nitrobenzyl group. The efficient synthesis of interleukin&#8208;4 (IL&#8208;4) via one&#8208;pot iterative ligation and tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) via EPL&#8208;desulfurization further highlights how this strategy significantly advances the synthesis of complex proteins.

Remarkably, copper allylic allenylidenes are proven to be compatible with NHC&#8208;bound intermediates, facilitating efficient, regioselective, and stereoselective intermolecular C&#9472;C bond formation at distant sites.

         <title>The Weakened Super&#8208;Exchange Interaction Realizes the Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;lon Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 51, December 15, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing the Na atom into the tetrahedral sites of the rock&#8208;salt phase, the electronic distribution of the bridging oxygen anion is altered and the magnetic moments of Ni elements are reduced, thereby weakening the linear super&#8208;exchange interactions, which ultimately facilitates the transformation from a rock&#8208;salt structure that hinders Li+ transport to a layered structure favorable for Li+ migration.








Abstract
The direct regeneration of cathodes is an effective technique to address resource waste and environmental pollution caused by spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, Li+ migration within the rock&#8208;salt phase of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes follows an energetically unfavorable 2&#8208;transition metal (2&#8208;TM) transport pathway (tetrahedral sites between face&#8208;sharing octahedra), creating a kinetic barrier that fundamentally limits direct regeneration. A Na&#8208;based molten salt pretreatment is applied to introduce Na atoms into the unoccupied tetrahedral sites of the rock&#8208;salt phase, which alters the electronic state distribution of bridged oxygen anions and reduces super&#8208;exchange interactions between TM atoms in adjacent layers, thereby triggering a phase transformation from rock&#8208;salt to targeted layered structure. Consequently, the Li+ migration pathway shifts from a high&#8208;energy 2&#8208;TM route to a more favorable low&#8208;barrier 1&#8208;TM route, enabling efficient lithiation and complete restoration of the cathode. The regenerated materials exhibit high structural uniformity and excellent electrochemical performance, achieving 78% capacity retention after 500 cycles.

     alt="The Weakened Super-Exchange Interaction Realizes the Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium-lon Battery Cathodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By introducing the Na atom into the tetrahedral sites of the rock-salt phase, the electronic distribution of the bridging oxygen anion is altered and the magnetic moments of Ni elements are reduced, thereby weakening the linear super-exchange interactions, which ultimately facilitates the transformation from a rock-salt structure that hinders Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport to a layered structure favorable for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The direct regeneration of cathodes is an effective technique to address resource waste and environmental pollution caused by spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration within the rock-salt phase of degraded LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes follows an energetically unfavorable 2-transition metal (2-TM) transport pathway (tetrahedral sites between face-sharing octahedra), creating a kinetic barrier that fundamentally limits direct regeneration. A Na-based molten salt pretreatment is applied to introduce Na atoms into the unoccupied tetrahedral sites of the rock-salt phase, which alters the electronic state distribution of bridged oxygen anions and reduces super-exchange interactions between TM atoms in adjacent layers, thereby triggering a phase transformation from rock-salt to targeted layered structure. Consequently, the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration pathway shifts from a high-energy 2-TM route to a more favorable low-barrier 1-TM route, enabling efficient lithiation and complete restoration of the cathode. The regenerated materials exhibit high structural uniformity and excellent electrochemical performance, achieving 78% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This study provides an insightful perspective on direct LIB recycling by regulating super-exchange interactions within the degraded cathode structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Channel with Side Pockets for Rapid Diffusion and Efficient C2H2 Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar&#8208;layered MOF (JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3) featuring one&#8208;dimensional channels with orthogonally arrayed side pockets enables dense packing of C2H2 while maintaining rapid diffusion, achieving gas&#8208;cylinder collection of high&#8208;purity C2H2 (&gt;99.9%) from C2H2/CO2 mixtures.








Abstract
Efficiently separating acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) has been a long&#8208;standing challenge due to their similar molecular dimensions and physical properties. Herein, we report a series of isostructural pillar&#8208;layered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), named JNU&#8208;13, JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3, and JNU&#8208;13&#8208;(CH3)2. These MOFs feature one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels integrated with orthogonally arrayed side pockets, enabling dense packing of C2H2 molecules while maintaining rapid diffusion pathways. Specifically, JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3 achieves a high C2H2 packing density of 360 g L&#8722;1, a low adsorption enthalpy of 31.61 kJ mol&#8722;1, and adsorption/desorption coefficients one to two orders of magnitude higher than other benchmark MOFs. Breakthrough experiments reveal a high C2H2 capture capacity of 3.46 mmol g&#8722;1 from an equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixture at 298 K and 1 bar, even under humid conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate the scale&#8208;up synthesis of JNU&#8208;13&#8208;CH3 and gas&#8208;cylinder collection of high&#8208;purity C2H2, achieving &gt;99.9% from a C2H2/CO2 (95/5) mixture and &gt;99.7% from a C2H2/CO2/CH4 (95/2.5/2.5) mixture. Overall, this study highlights the effectiveness of orthogonal&#8208;arrayed side pockets for balancing dense packing and mass transport, offering a promising strategy for energy&#8208;efficient C2H2 purification.

         <title>Pendant Group Design Toward Molecular Packing of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets in Micrometer&#8208;Scale for Photo&#8208;Thermal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of two&#8208;dimensional Cu3&#8208;based mental organic frameworks ultrathin nanosheets (i.e., 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt NSs)) in micrometer&#8208;scale has been prepared through the pendant group design of ligands with side chain induction effect and successfully applied in efficient photo&#8208;thermal catalysis.








Abstract
Attempts that can fabricate metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) into large&#8208;scale nanosheets with high crystallinity and multi&#8208;functions are much desired for their extended applications. Here, through the pendant group design of ligands, we have successfully prepared a kind of two&#8208;dimensional MOFs (i.e., 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt)) and a contrast three&#8208;dimensional Cu3&#8208;based MOFs (i.e., 3D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;H)) via different side chain induction effects. Interestingly, 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) can be easily exfoliated into micrometer&#8208;scale nanosheets (i.e., 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) NSs), while 3D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;H) is hard to exfoliate under similar conditions. Notably, the obtained 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) NSs possesses high crystallinity, porous structure, ultrathin thickness (&#8764;1.3&#160;nm) and abundant functional units that can be successfully applied in photo&#8208;thermal catalysis, demonstrating much better performance than 2D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;NHEt) and 3D&#8208;Cu(NDI&#8208;H). The structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relationships and possible mechanisms have been revealed by various characterizations coupled with theoretical calculations. These findings offer key understanding of molecular assembly in fabrication of MOFs into large&#8208;scale nanosheets for efficient photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Isolation of Germyliumylidene&#8208;Stabilized Heteronuclear Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the synthesis of a germyliumylidene&#8208;embedded monoanionic species exhibiting ambiphilic reactivity toward nucleophilic and electrophilic metal complexes. Subsequent reactions with metalates allow access to heterobimetallic complexes featuring Au&#9472;M (M&#9552;Mn, Co, W) bonds, demonstrating the capability of the germyliumylidene as an ancillary supporting ligand.








Abstract
Heterobimetallic complexes featuring heavier tetrylenes and tetryliumylidenes are scarce due to their limited stabilization capability stemming from the inert pair effect. Herein, we report that the incorporation of a chlorogermyliumylidene into a dianionic B6 cluster&#8208;based diphosphine ligand allows access to the germyliumylidene&#8208;containing unit carrying a monoanionic charge. This molecule exhibits ambiphilic reactivity toward nucleophilic KFeCp(CO)2 and electrophilic AuCl&#183;SMe2, rendering the iron&#8208;substituted germyliumylidene and inorganic macrocycle via molecular self&#8208;assembly, respectively. The latter is found to serve as a precursor, by reacting with metalates, for the construction of heterobimetallic complexes featuring Au&#9472;M (M&#9552;Mn, Co, W) bonds. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and computational studies elucidate that those heterobimetallic fragments are stabilized by s&#8208;donation from the Ge atom, demonstrating the capability of the germyliumylidene as an ancillary supporting ligand.

         <title>Mechanochemical Activation Switches the Chemoselectivity of the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling to Give Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that using mechanochemistry in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling alters chemoselectivity from traditional C&#9472;C coupling to C&#9472;N coupling, achieving the solvent&#8208;free synthesis of valuable non&#8208;symmetric azobenzenes under ball milling. This simple and rapid method exhibits broad substrate compatibility and overcomes key synthetic challenges.








Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction is considered as a crucial technique in the field of organic chemistry. Traditionally, the reaction between aryl diazonium salts and arylboronic acids in solution predominantly facilitates carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#9472;C) bond formation. However, our research reveals that mechanochemical techniques can shift the chemical selectivity in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling, resulting in the generation of non&#8208;symmetric azobenzene compounds under neat milling conditions. Azobenzenes have progressed from being merely textile dyes to multifunctional molecular systems critical for advanced technologies; however, the synthetic challenges associated with non&#8208;symmetric azo derivatives remain significant. Here, we present an innovative methodology that eliminates the use of conventional solvents while demonstrating exceptional substrate compatibility and short reaction time under ambient conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations suggest that mechanochemical conditions alter the reaction pathway by selectively promoting carbon&#8211;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) coupling.

Traditionally, the reaction between aryl diazonium salts and arylboronic acids in solution predominantly facilitates carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#9472;C) bond formation. However, our research reveals that mechanochemical techniques can shift the chemical selectivity in Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross-coupling, resulting in the generation of non-symmetric azobenzene compounds under neat milling conditions. Azobenzenes have progressed from being merely textile dyes to multifunctional molecular systems critical for advanced technologies; however, the synthetic challenges associated with non-symmetric azo derivatives remain significant. Here, we present an innovative methodology that eliminates the use of conventional solvents while demonstrating exceptional substrate compatibility and short reaction time under ambient conditions. Detailed mechanistic investigations suggest that mechanochemical conditions alter the reaction pathway by selectively promoting carbon&#8211;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of Corannulene&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Helicenes: Highly Integrated Curvature/Planarity for Enhanced CPL Brightness and Solid&#8208;State Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bowl&#8208;shaped corannulene and planar HBC were maximally hybridized, showcasing the temperature&#8208;controlled product selectivity. One of hybrid resembles a propeller structure, while the other features an incomplete propeller combined with a nonagon. The curved core significantly enhances molecular strain, improving chiral response and BCPL, while suppressed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking alleviates solid&#8208;state fluorescence quenching.








Abstract
Corannulene and hexabenzocoronene (HBC), as archetypal bowl&#8208;shaped and planar nanographene, have attracted considerable interest. Highly integrating these complementary motifs into a single architecture, however, remains a challenge owing to considerable intramolecular strains. Here, we report a temperature&#8208;controlled synthesis that enables selective hybridization between corannulene and multiple HBC&#8208;like motifs, yielding the anticipated quintuple [8]helicene (Cor&#8208;5H) and an unexpected triple [8]helicene (Cor&#8208;4H) incorporating a rare nonagon, likely involving a phenyl shift rearrangement mechanism. DFT calculations provide insights into the preferential formation of Cor&#8208;5H at lower temperatures, while Cor&#8208;4H predominates at elevated temperatures. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms their hybrid bowl&#8211;helix topologies, in which a central corannulene is fused with four (Cor&#8208;4H) or five (Cor&#8208;5H) HBC&#8208;like blades. The significant steric constraint imposed by the curved core results in high strain energies. This synergistic integration of curvature and planarity endows both compounds with intense deep&#8208;red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence; enhanced chiroptical responses and high circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) brightness; as well as unusual solid&#8208;state fluorescence due to suppressed &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. As the largest &#960;&#8208;extended corannulene&#8208;based multiple [n]helicenes reported to date, Cor&#8208;5H and Cor&#8208;4H demonstrate the powerful potential of fusing curved and planar nanographene motifs to design materials with advanced chiroptical functions.

         <title>Investigation of Intercellular Trafficking of Global Glycosylphosphatidylinositol&#8208;Anchored Proteins Using Cell Metabolic Engineering and Transwell Coculture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method to explore intercellular GPI&#8208;anchored protein trafficking using metabolically engineered donor cells containing azide&#8208;labelled GPIs for Transwell coculture with recipient cells was developed to directly demonstrate GPI&#8208;anchored protein transfer between cells through exosomes, the influences of cell membrane cholesterol and other factors, and preferred trafficking of GPI&#8208;anchored proteins from cancer to normal cells.








Abstract
Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are essential for GPI&#8208;anchored proteins (GPI&#8208;APs), as the loose association of GPIs with the cell membrane is thought to facilitate GPI&#8208;AP shedding and intercellular trafficking, which dictates cell communication. To explore this property, a novel method was developed based on metabolic engineering of GPI&#8208;APs in live cells and coculture of labelled donor cells along with recipient cells in a Transwell system for straight observation of intercellular GPI&#8208;AP transfer. Studies using this method have provided direct proof of intercellular GPI&#8208;AP trafficking and its dependence on cell types. Notably, there is a preference for GPI&#8208;AP transfer from cancer to normal cells. Lipid raft&#8208;mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis play a critical role in GPI&#8208;AP trafficking and incorporation, with extracellular vesicles (EVs) involved as GPI&#8208;AP transporters. It is further revealed that depleting cholesterol in the donor cell can enhance GPI&#8208;AP shedding and trafficking. The method also allowed for in&#8208;depth studies to gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of GPI&#8208;AP trafficking, such as its association with phospholipase A2 (PLA2), EV biogenesis, and membrane&#8208;adjacent Ras and Rho signaling pathways. The results are important not only for understanding GPI biology but also for its biomedical applications, for example, GPI&#8208;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Deactivation of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit high activity and selectivity. However, they are dynamic and can be deactivated by the aggregation of metal atoms into nanoparticles (NPs). We argue that NP formation is one of the primary deactivation pathway, where NPs &#8220;poison&#8221; the SAC by capturing active atoms. Using experimental data, we conceptualize SACs and NPs as a dynamic system and propose strategies for suppressing aggregation, making it a key criterion for the development of stable catalysts.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent a pinnacle of atomic efficiency and catalytic precision. Their remarkable activity and selectivity arise from isolated, low&#8208;coordinate metal centers that engage directly in bond&#8208;forming events. However, under realistic reaction conditions, SACs are far from static. Increasing evidence reveals that single atoms undergo dynamic evolution over the reaction time. In this perspective, we challenge the conventional dichotomy that views SACs and nanoparticles (NPs) as fundamentally distinct catalytic systems. We propose that NPs, rather than acting as parallel or cooperative catalysts, may function as catalytic poisonants for SACs by trapping active metal atoms. This transformation results in loss of activity, reduced selectivity, and degradation of the catalytic system. Drawing on mechanistic studies, thermodynamic data, and experimental observations across diverse reaction classes, including hydrogenation, oxidation, and cross&#8208;coupling, we show that the aggregation of SACs into NPs is not merely a side process but rather a limitation to their stability and utility. We further outline thermodynamic and kinetic strategies to suppress this deactivation pathway and propose design principles that elevate NP suppression from a synthetic challenge to a foundational criterion in catalyst development. This perspective reframes the SAC&#8211;NP relationship as a dynamic continuum and emphasizes the importance of stabilizing isolated active sites in next&#8208;generation catalytic technologies.

         <title>Harnessing the Hofmeister Effect for Simultaneous Strengthening and Toughening of Cellulosic Triboelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing a hydrogen bond dynamic pre&#8208;crosslinking network and Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced aggregation/crystallization to form a crystal domain network, the strength, toughness and triboelectricity of the cellulosic triboelectric material used in wearable electronic products can be simultaneously enhanced






.

Abstract
Flexible film materials often experience a decline in toughness while pursuing high strength. This challenge of balancing strength and toughness restricts their application in fields such as tissue engineering, soft robotics, and wearable electronic products. Inspired by the multilevel structures of natural materials, this study proposes a hydrogen&#8208;bond network restructuring strategy based on &#8220;multilevel crosslinking&#8221; to simultaneously enhance the tensile strength and toughness of cellulosic triboelectric films. During the reconstruction of the hydrogen bonding network, MXene nanosheets first form a dynamically pre&#8208;crosslinked network with polymer chains via hydrogen bonds. Subsequently, the Hofmeister effect enhances hydrogen bond interactions, inducing aggregation/crystallization to build domain networks and establish a multi&#8208;level crosslinked structure. This yields flexible cellulosic triboelectric films with enhanced strength and toughness, capable of withstanding loads exceeding 22,700 times their own weight. Simultaneously, the aggregation/crystallization of molecular chains induces rearrangement of surface functional groups, thereby altering surface potential and enhancing the material's electron&#8208;donating capacity, ultimately improving the triboelectric properties. This strategy offers novel insights for designing and fabricating high&#8208;performance flexible films required in next&#8208;generation flexible electronic devices, wearable technology, and related fields.

Atomically dispersed Ni sites embedded in a boron/nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon nanotube matrix (Ni&#8208;BNC) steer the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) toward H2O2 with high efficiency. Ni&#8208;BNC delivers &gt;90% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2 at current densities up to &#8764;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and reaches a production rate of 31.13&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The results highlight atomic&#8208;level B&#8208;N&#8208;Ni synergy as a decisive lever for industrially relevant peroxide electrosynthesis beyond conventional single&#8208;heteroatom designs.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble metals for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR); however, their practical application in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis remains limited by persistent trade&#8208;offs among activity, selectivity, and stability. Herein, we demonstrate that synergistic integration of atomically dispersed Ni and B, N co&#8208;dopants within a carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;BNC) effectively regulates the 2e&#8722; ORR for efficient H2O2 production. The Ni&#8208;BNC catalyst delivers&#160;&gt;90% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2&#160;at current densities up to &#8764;&#8722;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and critically maintains this high selectivity for over 50&#160;h at &#8722;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, achieving a maximum production rate of 31.13&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. In situ infrared spectroscopy and kinetic analysis revealed that B, N&#8208;coordination facilitates electron transfer from adjacent single Ni atoms, electronically modulating the *OOH adsorption energy and lowering the kinetic barrier. The practical viability is further demonstrated in a porous solid electrolyte reactor, which continuously produces pure, salt&#8208;free H2O2 (&gt;1,400&#160;ppm) for 100&#160;h. This work highlights the effectiveness of atomic&#8208;level synergy for designing advanced electrocatalysts beyond sole active&#8208;site engineering.
