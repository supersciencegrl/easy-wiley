         <title>Caylobolide B: Structure Revision, Total Synthesis, Biological Characterization, and Discovery of New Analogues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marine polyhydroxylated macrolides&#8217; drug discovery potential is limited by structural complexity and scarce material supply, hindering structure assignment, synthesis, and biological studies. Here, we present an integrated workflow that combines chemogenomic profiling, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution NMR&#8208;guided structural revision and stereochemical assignment, and modular total synthesis to enable comprehensive interrogation of the caylobolide B family.








Abstract
The unique potential of marine polyhydroxylated macrolides in chemical biology and drug discovery has long been constrained by their structural complexity and limited material availability, frustrating efforts in stereochemical assignment, synthesis, and mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action elucidation. Here, we establish an integrated workflow, combining chemogenomic profiling, ultra&#8208;high&#8208;resolution NMR, and modular total synthesis, for the comprehensive functional and structural interrogation of this challenging natural product class. Applying this approach to caylobolides, natural products isolated from scarce samples of Okeania sp., we performed structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealing that acetylation at C29 markedly reduces both cytotoxicity and antifungal activity, pinpointing a key pharmacophore. Mechanistic profiling suggests that these macrolides disrupt membrane integrity, similar to amantelide A. Using natural compound samples, we simultaneously revised the structure of caylobolide B through 1H, 1D&#8208;selective TOCSY and HSQC NMR, and developed a modular fragment&#8208;based synthesis of these compounds. By providing a unified methodology for genetic sensitivity profiling, precise structure and stereochemistry determination, and modular total synthesis, this work unlocks new opportunities for the discovery and rational design of potent marine&#8208;derived therapeutics.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of X&#8208;Vinylbenziodoxol(on)es and One&#8208;Pot Conversion to Complex Alkenes**</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a wide range of complex 1,2&#8208;di(heteroatom)&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;alkenes is achieved through a mechanochemical one&#8208;pot reaction of ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO) with a variety of heteroatom nucleophiles. The mechanochemical activation enables synthesis of a range of novel vinylbenziodoxol(on)es (VBX/VBO) whose synthesis is inefficient under solution&#8208;phase. 








Abstract
Densely functionalized alkenes are often utilized as excellent tools for further functionalization of molecules. Recent progress in their synthesis includes nucleophilic addition to vinylbenziodoxolones (VBX) and vinylbenziodoxoles (VBO) to reach alkenes with complete regio&#8208; and stereocontrol. In this work, we leverage the inherent properties of mechanochemistry to enable an efficient transition metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot route to 1,2&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;substituted (Z)&#8208;alkenes directly from ethynylbenziodoxol(on)es (EBX/EBO), avoiding the isolation of VBX/VBO. We demonstrate a high&#8208;yielding synthesis of a large variety of N/O/S&#8208;VBX reagents, which, combined with a telescoped nucleophilic addition, delivers a wide range of novel, complex (Z)&#8208;alkenes. This one&#8208;pot strategy would be challenging to develop in solution due to a mismatch in reaction solvents, and the unique mechanochemical activation offered by solventless, solid&#8208;state mixing also enables formation of products whose synthesis is inefficient with solvent&#8208;based methods.

         <title>Enantioselective Syntheses of Secondary Alkylboronates via Asymmetric Regioselective Reduction of 1,3&#8208;Dienylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report herein the development of catalytic asymmetric synthesis of secondary alkyl boronates. Under the optimal conditions, Cu&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;substituted 1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadienes forms secondary alkyl boronates with excellent regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. With H2O as the source of hydrogen, the reaction proceeds through a protoboration and protodeboration cascade reaction sequence to generate the desired boronates. By using a slightly modified protocol, the process allows for access to enantioenriched deuterium&#8208;labeled secondary alkyl boronates.

         <title>Spatially Orchestrated Oxygen Motifs Decouple Ion Dissociation/Migration in Liquid Crystal Elastomer for High&#8208; Performance Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially orchestrated oxygen coordination within a multi&#8208;crosslinked liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;elastomer (LCE) electrolyte enables a cooperative &#8220;anchor&#8211;relay&#8221; mechanism for Li+ transport. Carbonyl oxygens act as stationary anchors for Li&#8208;salt dissociation, while ether oxygens function as dynamic relays for rapid ion hopping through ordered mesophases. This programmable coordination network achieves high ionic conductivity (4.05 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1), a Li+ transference number of 0.78, and dendrite&#8208;free cycling. 








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) emerge as prime candidates for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, capitalizing on their intrinsic electrochemical robustness and enhanced safety profiles. However, overcoming the inherent trade&#8208;off between efficient lithium&#8208;salt dissociation and rapid ion migration remains a fundamental challenge for SPEs. We propose a programmable liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) framework with spatially patterned carbonyl (&#9472;C&#9552;O) and ether (&#9472;C&#9472;O&#9472;C&#9472;) oxygen motifs. In this hierarchical architecture, carbonyl groups act as stationary anchors to dissociate LiTFSI via strong coordination, while ether chains serve as dynamic relays enabling barrier&#8208;reduced Li&#8314; hopping along oriented mesophases. This decoupled &#8220;anchor&#8208;relay&#8221; mechanism achieves outstanding room&#8208;temperature performance: ionic conductivity of 4.05&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and Li&#8314; transference number of 0.78. The synergistically induced LiF&#8208;rich interphase further suppresses dendrite growth, the symmetric Li//Li cell exhibits a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan over 1000&#160;h with a low overpotential of 300&#160;mV, delivering exceptional cycling stability in both LiFePO4//Li cell (90.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles) and high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2//Li cell systems. The proposed LCEs as a transformative platform for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries through rational molecular engineering.

         <dc:description>
A machine learning model for atropisomers&#8217; stability is developed. By integrating a physicochemically&#8208;informed axial chirality structure descriptor (ACSD) with a graph attention network (GAT), the model accurately predicts rotational barriers. Its robustness is validated on complex drugs and molecular switches, providing a powerful tool for rational catalyst and drug design.








Abstract
Atropisomers play a vital role in asymmetric synthesis, drug discovery, and the development of functional materials. However, the rational design of atropisomers is challenging due to the difficulty in predicting their configurational stability, which depends on the rotational barrier (&#916;G&#8225;). Here, we introduce ACSD&#8208;GAT, a deep learning framework that addresses this issue. Our approach comprises a newly curated benchmark dataset of 1015 experimentally measured rotational barrier, along with a physicochemically informed axial chirality structure descriptor (ACSD) that explicitly quantifies both static and dynamic steric repulsion during rotation. By integrating the ACSD with a graph attention network (GAT), our model accurately predicts the rotational barrier, achieving an R2 of 0.91 and a RMSE of 2.02&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1 on test datasets. The robustness and real&#8208;world applicability of the model are also demonstrated through rigorous validation with complex pharmaceuticals, molecular switches, and newly synthesized atropisomers.

         <title>Unlocking Selective Electrochemical Regulation via Interlayer Anion Competition for Nitrate Extraction from Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By engineering structural compatibility between 2D bismuth&#8208;based materials and planar nitrate ions, we developed [Bi2O2]2+ layered electrodes for selective NO3&#8722; capture. A controlled carbonate ion (CO32&#8722;) doping strategy was employed to modulate interlayer bonding energies through metal&#8208;affinity coordination, enhancing NO3&#8722;&#8208;specific adsorption while repelling competing anions. This enables a high NO3&#8722; removal capacity of 182.47&#160;mg g&#8722;1 and a remarkable 90.78% NO3&#8722; removal efficiency in complex ionic systems.








Abstract
Electrochemical separation technology offers an effective approach to recycle valuable nitrogen from industrial wastewater, but its separation efficiency is reduced by competitive electrostatic interactions from multiple ions. By engineering a competitive chemical reaction to facilitate site&#8208;specific electrochemical binding of NO3&#8722;, this approach offers a promising route for high&#8208;efficiency anion separation in complex solutions. Herein, a novel [Bi2O2]2+ layered Faraday electrode was designed with two&#8208;dimensional channels for NO3&#8722; migration and multiple sites that boost its interaction through combined electrostatic and coordination forces. In addition, by strategically introducing exogenous anions, the induced antisite cation defects at Bi3+ sites enhance the coordination of subsequent NO3&#8722; insertion, achieving a NO3&#8722; removal capacity of 182.47&#160;mg g&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the highly charged CO32&#8722; enhances its repulsion against other competitive anions, leading to an impressive removal ratio of 90.78% for NO3&#8722; in multi&#8208;ion solutions. More importantly, exogenous CO32&#8722; intercalation reverses the interlayer binding energy hierarchy between NO3&#8722; and SO42&#8722;, converting the substitution by NO3&#8722; (&#8722;13.12&#160;eV) more thermodynamically favorable than that by SO42&#8722; (&#8722;12.16&#160;eV), enabling spontaneous NO3&#8722; uptake. Our work provides new insights for designing NO3&#8722;&#8208;selective electrodes, enhancing understanding of anion&#8208;interface interactions.

         <title>Creep Resistant and Reprocessable Polyamide Networks Based on Reversible Lactone Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the reversible ring&#8208;opening reaction of &#947;&#8208;lactones with primary amines was used to obtain dynamic covalent polyamide networks combining excellent reprocessability and creep resistance. This behavior was facilitated by neighboring group participation of the mildly nucleophilic &#947;&#8208;hydroxyl moiety present after amide formation.








Abstract
Amides are robust chemical linkages of interest in the field of dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPNs), but their activation towards dynamic exchange remains an outstanding challenge. Herein, we introduce &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amides as a versatile motif for the design of creep resistant, yet fully reprocessable crosslinked polyamide&#8208;based materials. This was achieved by the reversible ring&#8208;opening of &#947;&#8208;lactones with primary amines. Small molecule kinetic studies showed that temperatures exceeding 120&#160;&#176;C are required for the ring&#8208;closure to occur at a significant rate. Thus, efficient exchange of the &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amide bonds was expected upon heating, while essentially non&#8208;dynamic covalent amide bonds should prevail at lower temperatures. &#947;&#8208;Hydroxy amides were then introduced into DCPNs, for which a newly prepared bifunctional &#947;&#8208;lactone monomer was cured with amine hardeners. A marked thermal response was observed in the rheological behavior, while creep resistance comparable to that of a non&#8208;dynamic epoxy&#8208;amine network was maintained up to 120&#160;&#176;C. Finally, we could also demonstrate the thermal resilience of &#947;&#8208;hydroxy amides after multiple compression molding cycles for a material with a glass transition temperature above 80&#160;&#176;C. Consequently, we expect that this simple chemistry platform has high potential for application in reprocessable thermoset materials.

         <title>Tracking Structural and Electron Spin Density Changes in a Cooperative Mn3+ Spin Crossover Complex at Atomic Scale via Low Temperature Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin transition of a Mn(III) complex is investigated by tracking the evolution of the 1H and 13C NMR signals of individual sites under fast low&#8208;temperature magic angle spinning conditions. The proposed experimental methodology combined with ab initio calculations of the paramagnetic NMR shifts provides a unique toolbox to study the electronic structure and dynamics of spin&#8208;crossover systems at cryogenic temperatures.








Abstract
Electron spin&#8208;state changes in transition&#8208;metal (TM) complexes underpin many biochemical processes and molecular spin&#8208;control technologies. Such transitions, triggered by external stimuli like temperature, light, or pressure, alter both the molecular structure and electron spin density (ESD) distribution. Paramagnetic NMR offers atomic&#8208;scale insights into these changes, yet traditional solution&#8208;state measurements bear limitations due to solvent effects, unaccounted lattice cooperativity, and inaccessibility at cryogenic temperatures. We overcome these limitations by extending the approach to spinning solids at cryogenic temperatures. Specifically, we report high&#8208;resolution 13C and 1H magic&#8208;angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra of a mononuclear spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) Mn(III) complex across the SCO transition at 130&#160;K. Such low&#8208;temperature experiments are particularly challenging because paramagnetic shift and shift anisotropy are inversely proportional to the temperature. The experimental findings are supported by advanced quantum chemical calculations of the NMR and EPR parameters to assign and rationalize the observed paramagnetic shifts. Additionally, monitoring selected 1H resonances upon heating and cooling through the transition provides access to the order parameter (q=NHS&#8722;NLSNHS+NLS$q = \frac{{{N_{{\mathrm{HS}}}} - {N_{{\mathrm{LS}}}}}}{{{N_{{\mathrm{HS}}}} + {N_{{\mathrm{LS}}}}}}$), revealing hysteresis behavior similar to the magnetic susceptibility measurements. This work demonstrates that paramagnetic NMR combined with quantum chemical calculations provides a unique route to probing SCO at the atomic level.

         <title>B&#8208;N Fused Anthracene as Functional Linker for &#960;&#8208;Extended Viologens: Near&#8208;IR Emission and Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce &#960;&#8211;extended viologens with B&#8208;N fused dipyridylanthracene (BDPA) as conduit for delocalization. Quaternization of pyridyl&#8208;substituted BDPA by methylation or Lewis pair formation with B(C6F5)3 produces strongly colored compounds that are emissive in the near&#8208;IR. Spectroelectrochemical studies reveal reversible formation of doubly reduced species that adopt a closed shell electronic configuration with prominent quinoidal delocalization.








Abstract
As prototypical organic electrochromic materials viologens have been extensively studied in display technologies, smart materials, and energy storage applications.

&lt;p&gt;We introduce &#960;&#8211;extended viologens with B-N fused dipyridylanthracene (BDPA) as conduit for delocalization. Quaternization of pyridyl-substituted BDPA by methylation or Lewis pair formation with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; produces strongly colored compounds that are emissive in the near-IR. Spectroelectrochemical studies reveal reversible formation of doubly reduced species that adopt a closed shell electronic configuration with prominent quinoidal delocalization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As prototypical organic electrochromic materials viologens have been extensively studied in display technologies, smart materials, and energy storage applications. Their properties can be fine-tuned by introducing different substituents on the pyridine rings, fusion with heteroatoms, or insertion of &#960;&#8211;conjugated linkers. In this article we study the effect of B-N fused dipyridylanthracene (BDPA) as a novel linker unit in viologens on the electronic structure, optical properties, and electrochromic characteristics. Quaternization of pyridyl-functionalized BDPA (&lt;b&gt;1Py&lt;/b&gt;) by N-methylation or complexation with B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a powerful Lewis acid gives rise to two fundamentally different &#960;-extended viologens, dicationic [&lt;b&gt;1Py-Me&lt;/b&gt;](PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the neutral complex &lt;b&gt;1Py-BCF&lt;/b&gt;. We investigate the effect of these different quaternization methods on the LUMO energy, band gaps, absorption and emission, and the self-sensitized reactivity toward oxygen. We also demonstrate facile electrochemical reduction to singly and multiply reduced species.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Photoacid Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the synthesis and (photo)chemical characterization of water&#8208;soluble 3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate&#8208;based copolymers containing protonated merocyanine units. We show that these copolymer polyelectrolytes can serve in light&#8208;to&#8208;protonic energy conversion, effectively dissociating protons reversibly following 500&#160;nm light absorption in water.








Abstract
Spiropyran&#8208;based polymers are widely studied on account of their multifaceted stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors. However, their photoacid characteristics in aqueous environments remain overlooked. Here, we synthesized a series of poly(3&#8208;sulfopropyl methacrylate) copolymers containing spiropyran units in their photoacidic, protonated merocyanine form. We studied the behavior of these copolymer polyelectrolytes in water and found that polymer constitution significantly enhances the hydrolytic stability of protonated merocyanines, whereas polymer composition can be used as a tool to program their photoacidity &#8211; i.e., the acidity difference between their ground state and metastable state. Exposure to 500&#160;nm light enables these polyelectrolytes to reversibly dissociate protons, causing metastable fluctuations in bulk pH as large as 3&#160;pH units. The results presented here hold promise in the development of robust light&#8208;to&#8208;protonic energy conversion devices.

         <title>Thiophene Derivatives as Versatile Precursors for (Hetero)Arene and Natural Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hidden but Powerful: Thiophenes and their saturated analogues have been demonstrated to be versatile C4&#8208;building blocks that can be rapidly applied to natural product synthesis and the construction of functionalized (hetero)arenes. This minireview aims to provide a concise overview of the strategies and implementations of these sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic precursors in challenging synthetic applications.








Abstract
Thiophenes and their saturated analogues are versatile C4&#8208;building blocks used to construct structurally intricate ring systems found in various biologically active structures. For instance, thiophenes can undergo dearomative cycloaddition reactions under photocatalytic conditions forming highly substituted benzenes. Thiophene S&#8208;oxides and S,S&#8208;dioxides have emerged as valuable precursors for the construction of complex frameworks in (4&#160;+&#160;2)/retro&#8208;(4&#160;+&#160;1) cascade reactions through cheletropic release of SO or SO2, respectively. In addition, 2,5&#8208;dihydrothiophenes can be rapidly converted into furans or pyrroles via pericyclic cascade reactions. The installation of a tetrahydrothiophene followed by reductive deletion of the sulfur atom has been demonstrated to be a powerful method for the cis&#8208;dialkylation of electron&#8208;poor olefins. The ability to generate highly complex, aromatic scaffolds and quaternary stereocenters makes thiophene compounds valuable intermediates for synthesizing natural products and bioactive molecules, which are important for crop science and medicinal chemistry. This minireview provides an overview of strategies for using these sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic precursors in challenging synthetic applications.

         <title>Biocatalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Styrenes via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identification and protein engineering on an imine reductase (IRED) for both (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;selective synthesis of nonbiaryl amine atropisomers via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) have been achieved. Enantiocomplementary ADHs were also identified to catalyze the reductive DKR processes. The axially chiral styrenes were produced in high atroposelectivity and yields with broad substrate scope.








Abstract
Enzymatic synthesis of atropisomers has recently attracted considerable research attention, with most studies focusing on axially chiral biaryls. We report a less explored atroposelective dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of nonbiaryl styrenes catalyzed by imine reductases (IREDs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). The IR189 wild type enzyme was identified to be highly active and selective; furthermore, the inversion of atroposelectivity was achieved with protein engineering. Additionally, two ADHs with enantio&#8208;complementary selectivity for the reductive DKR were identified and applied in the synthesis of axially chiral styrenes. Both IREDs and ADHs exhibited broad substrate scope, affording up to 99:1 e.r. and 99% yields for up to 29 examples. Scaled&#8208;up reactions and derivatization of optically pure products demonstrated the synthetic utility of these axially chiral styrenes. Molecular recognition mechanisms were elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The current strategy expands the scope of enzymatic DKR of atropisomeric compounds and significantly advances the field of biocatalytic synthesis of axially chiral compounds.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structural Distortion Drives Exciton Localization for Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence in Copper&#8211;Iodide Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplifying self&#8208;trapped emission to near&#8208;unity quantum yield by atomic&#8208;level distortion control in a soft copper&#8211;iodide lattice involving two vertically oriented and alternately arranged [Cu2I4]6&#8722; clusters.








Abstract
Engineering structural distortions presents a powerful strategy for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of luminescent materials, while a fundamental understanding of how atomic&#8208;scale distortions govern photoluminescence in copper&#8208;iodide clusters has remained elusive. Herein, we report a model van der Waals solid based on copper&#8211;iodide clusters, where two vertically oriented and alternately arranged [Cu2I4]2&#8722; clusters are assembled via protection and interaction afforded by peripheral long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chain cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ligands. This unique architecture affords a cooperative distortion response and exceptional buffering capacity, enabling precise control and direct probing of atomic&#8208;scale structural distortions under pressure. We demonstrate that hydrostatic pressure induces controlled atomic distortions and an isostructural phase transition, which collectively enhance exciton localization. This leads to a dramatic amplification of self&#8208;trapped emission, boosting the photoluminescence quantum yield from 32.25% to near&#8208;unity (99.82%). Our work establishes atomic&#8208;distortion engineering as a general principle for achieving ultimate control over light emission in hybrid semiconductors.

         <title>Irreversible Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Magneto&#8208;Thermal&#8208;Induced Structural Reorganization in a Chiral Lead Bromide Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;thermal control of structural reorganization in hybrid metal halides enables irreversible circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) inversion. A single crystal of P/M&#8208;(C4H14S2N2)PbBr5&#183;H3O (P/M&#8208;PbBr) undergoes a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;triggered structural reorganization at 486&#160;K, flipping absolute chirality and switching CPL handedness, offering a strategy for programmable chiroptical materials.








Abstract
The dynamic inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in solid&#8208;state materials is a pivotal goal for both fundamental science and advanced chiroptoelectronic technologies. While achievable in flexible molecular systems, CPL inversion remains profoundly challenging in crystalline lattices due to their inherent structural rigidity. Herein, we demonstrate irreversible CPL inversion in a single crystal of a lead&#8208;based hybrid metal halide, P/M&#8208;(C4H14S2N2)PbBr5&#183;H3O (P/M&#8208;PbBr), engineered with stereochemically dynamic cysteamine cations. The inversion is achieved by applying a magnetic field at a specific phase transition temperature (486&#160;K), which triggers a magneto&#8208;thermal&#8208;induced structural transformation that flips the crystal's absolute chirality between its P and M enantiomeric forms. This configurational reversal of the organic moieties drives a cooperative structural inversion of the entire inorganic lattice, thereby switching the CPL handedness. Our work provides a fundamental strategy for achieving chirality control in rigid crystalline systems, paving the way for developing programmable chiroptical materials and devices.

         <title>Molecular Design of Nitrile Electrolytes Enabling Lithiated Silicon&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sulfur Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating polar nitrile with hydrofluoroether segments, a novel fluorinated nitrile electrolyte is developed which enhances Li+&#8211;anion coordination and suppresses polysulfide dissolution. This system promotes a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur reaction and stabilizes interfaces via additive&#8208;derived layers. It enables high&#8208;capacity retention and Coulombic efficiency in LiSi&#8722;S batteries over 100 cycles.








Abstract
The development of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is hindered by the polysulfide dissolving, cross&#8208;over and the inherent lithium metal anode instability. We herein instead describe a lithiated silicon&#8722;sulfur (LiSi&#8722;S) battery enabled by molecular engineering of highly solvating nitrile electrolytes toward weakly solvating to fundamentally decouple the reactions of the two electrodes and eliminate their cross&#8208;talk. Specifically, by controlled fluorination of the ethoxy&#8208;nitrile base solvent, the charge distribution on the solvent is manipulated which suppresses the solvation for polysulfides promoting a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sulfur reaction (QSSSR) mechanism. The promoted anion participation in Li+ solvation, along with the fluoroethylene carbonate additive, further stabilizes the interphases at both sulfur cathode and LiSi anode mitigating the mechanical degradations. The QSSSR&#8208;based LiSi&#8722;S cell shows a high capacity of 1499.0&#160;mA h gsulfur&#8722;1 at 0.1C, and achieves a high capacity retention of 90.2% over 100 cycles at 0.2C with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%. This work highlights the essence of molecular engineering for manipulating the primary reactions and interphasial behaviors at both electrodes toward high performance sulfur batteries.

         <title>Transmembrane Transport of cAMP and AMP Using a Two Component Small Molecule Transport System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transmembrane transport of the nucleotides cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and AMP (adenosine monophosphate) is challenging, but can be achieved using a two&#8208;component system consisting of a synthetic anionophore (e.g., squaramides) and a lipophilic thymine derivative. Fluorescence and NMR&#8208;based liposomes studies confirm that direct translocation of the nucleotides across the membrane occurs without disruption of membrane integrity.








Abstract
Nucleotides such as cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and AMP (adenosine monophosphate) are central to many cellular processes, but their highly hydrophilic and charged nature prevents passive permeation across lipid bilayers. Here, we report the first example of facilitated transport of cAMP and AMP across liposome membranes using a neutral two&#8208;component system at physiological pH. This system pairs a synthetic anionophore targeting the phosphate group with a thymine derivative to boost transport efficiency. Liposome&#8208;based fluorescence and 31P NMR experiments confirmed transmembrane transport, supported by control experiments. A fluorinated squaramide proved to be the best transporter and was able to transport cAMP even without the help of a thymine derivative, as well as AMP in the presence of a lipophilic thymine derivative. These findings show that carefully designed small molecules can enable direct nucleotide translocation, with potential applications in drug delivery and synthetic biology.

         <title>Excited State Modulation of Copper Clusters Realized by Single&#8208;Site Alteration Achieving Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;active copper clusters (Cu4P, Cu4S, and Cu4Se) were successfully constructed using different anionic templates. Among them, Cu4P exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission, while Cu4S achieves a near&#8208;unity quantum yield. Theoretical calculations reveal that single&#8208;site modulation governs the excited states of these copper clusters, enabling precise manipulation of their photoluminescence properties.








Abstract
Modulating the excited states of coinage metal clusters can effectively improve their photophysical properties, and significant progress has been realized through ligand modification and heterometallic doping. However, precise substitution of individual atoms within the kernel remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present three copper cluster analogs, namely Cu4S, Cu4Se, and Cu4P, displaying distinct thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), wherein Cu4S and Cu4Se display yellow luminescence with QYs of 99.2% and 89.0% respectively, while Cu4P with the first HP2&#8722; unit in copper clusters exhibits near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission with a QY of 22.2%. Theoretical calculations have verified that the energy levels of excited states in copper clusters are modulated by substituting the central coordinating atoms. The spin&#8208;orbit coupling of Cu4P, Cu4S, and Cu4Se, as well as the structural deformation differences between the excited state and the ground state, leads to the different luminescence quantum yields. This study not only reports the first HP2&#8722;&#8208;involved copper cluster but also establishes a platform for investigation on single&#8208;site modulation directed luminescence of copper clusters.

Strained spirocyclic spiro[2.3]hexane and its heteroatom&#8208;containing derivatives, including previously underrepresented 5&#8208;oxa&#8208;1&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexanes and 1,5&#8208;diazaspiro[2.3]hexanes, were synthesized via a modular approach of insertion of cyclobutane&#8208;, oxetane&#8208;, and azetidine&#8208;containing sulfonium reagents into alkenes, carbonyls and imines. A combined in silico unsupervised learning and predictive analytics approach was used to investigate their potential as bioisosteres and our hypothesis was validated through in vitro studies.








Abstract
Molecular scaffolds with a high fraction of sp3&#8208;hybridized centers have attracted considerable attention in medicinal chemistry as bioisosteres for a wide range of aromatic and nonstrained heterocycles. In particular, strained spiro&#8208;heterocycles have garnered popularity for this purpose, although access to spiro[2.3]hexane analogues is underrepresented. We herein report modular access to nine different spiro[2.3]hexane analogues, including previously underdeveloped 5&#8208;oxa&#8208;1&#8208;azaspiro[2.3]hexane and 1,5&#8208;diazaspiro[2.3]hexane motifs. Our synthetic approach leverages novel cyclobutane&#8208;, oxetane&#8208;, and azetidine&#8208;substituted sulfonium salts, which can undergo Johnson&#8211;Corey&#8211;Chaykovsky type reactions with alkenes, carbonyls and imines to provide access to the desired spiro[2.3]hexanes. Here, we also report the first comprehensive computational and predictive in silico evaluation of their bioisosteric potential, with validation provided by in vitro experiments.

         <title>Regulating *H Dynamics via Photoinduced Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Lattice Oxygen Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Superior CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Construction of photoinduced oxygen vacancy&#8211;lattice oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (Vo&#8208;OL FLPs) on the metal oxide atomic layers, coupled with employing BA as alternative *H source, to concurrently facilitate *H generation and subsequent transfer from BA to CO2, while suppressing competitive *H reduction to H2, thereby enabling superior CO2 photoreduction.








Abstract
Herein, we construct photoinduced oxygen vacancy&#8208;lattice oxygen frustrated Lewis pairs (Vo&#8208;OL FLPs) on metal oxide atomic layers, coupled with employing benzyl alcohol (BA) as an alternative *H source, to concurrently promote *H production and transfer, enabling efficient CO2 photoreduction. Taking the Vo&#8208;Bi2WO6 atomic layers as examples, in situ solid&#8208;state electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy elucidate photoinduced FLPs, composed of Vo and OL, which respectively trap photogenerated electrons and holes to activate CO2 and facilitate BA dehydrogenation. In situ Kelvin probe force microscopy and density of states calculations indicate Vo suppresses the electron&#8208;hole recombination by creating defect levels. Importantly, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra, isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the Vo&#8208;OL FLPs mediate efficient *H transfer from BA to CO2, suppressing competitive *H reduction to H2. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra also disclose BA oxidation proceeds via a more kinetically favorable pathway for *H production than H2O oxidation. Benefiting from the synergistic enhancement in *H production and transfer, the photocatalyst achieves an impressive CO2 conversion rate of 3667.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with excellent 240 h stability, surpassing previously reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems. This work offers atomic&#8208;level insights for designing active sites to optimize *H dynamics.

         <title>Dynamic Li+ Respiration Effect Enables Cascade Conversion of Lithium Polysulfides for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li+&#8208;respiration&#8208;effect concept through tailoring the electrochemical&#8208;lithiation&#8208;tunable TiNb2O7 (TNO) catalyst is proposed to drive the cascade conversion of multiphase intermediates for Li&#8211;S batteries. By in situ potential modulation, LixTNO with dynamic active sites can automatically switch catalytic states to accelerate sulfur redox kinetics one&#8208;by&#8208;one. Li&#8211;S cells with LiTNO display enhanced cycling stability and wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries exhibit obvious kinetics differences involving multistep reactions, making it hard to realize constantly high&#8208;efficient polysulfide conversion during the full charging/discharging Herein, we propose a concept of Li+&#8208;respiration&#8208;effect&#8208;induced cascade catalysis through taking full advantage of dynamic active sites from in situ potential&#8208;modulated TiNb2O7. The Li+ respiration effect activates the lattice O atom and regulates the antibonding orbitals filling, triggering an electrochemical&#8208;dominated switchable catalytic for sequential conversion of intermediates. As a result, the Li&#8211;S cell displays a good cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature ability from &#8722;30 to +60&#160;&#176;C. A flexible pouch cell maintains a capacity retention of 94.6% after 120 cycles. Our discovery provides a fire&#8208;new perspective in electrochemically reconstructed catalysis for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerant Li&#160;&#8722;&#160;S batteries.

A bench&#8208;stable boryl thianthrenium dication is synthesized via thianthrenation of vinyl MIDA boronate. This novel dication enables metal&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;, and diastereoselective late&#8208;stage aziridination with diverse nitrogen nucleophiles.

Abstract
Organoboron compounds are indispensable in modern organic synthesis and biomedical research. This study describes the synthesis of bench&#8208;stable boryl thianthrenium dicationic compound via chemical or electrochemical thianthrenation of vinyl MIDA boronate. This unique boryl thianthrenium dication enables a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, chemo&#8208;, and diastereoselective synthesis of aziridinyl boronates, utilizing a broad range of nitrogen nucleophiles. The method demonstrates generality, practicality, and functional group tolerance, as evidenced by its application to diverse substrates, including the late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules. Notably, the MIDA boryl group plays crucial roles in this approach including i) suppressing undesired deborylation, ii) promoting exclusive mono&#8208;adduct formation via a formal [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition pathway, iii) directing regioselective vinyl boryl thianthrenium formation via selective deprotonation, and iv) enabling diastereoselective aziridination. The strategic significance of this approach is further highlighted through electrochemical one&#8208;pot protocol, asymmetric synthesis using vinyl PIDA boronate, and diverse downstream transformations of aziridinyl boronates, offering new opportunities for synthetically challenging boron&#8208;containing drug&#8208;like scaffolds.

         <title>Stabilization of the Benzene Radical Trianion in an Inverse&#8208;Sandwich Yttrium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of benzene anion state is born: The unprecedented benzene radical trianion embedded in an inverse&#8208;sandwich yttrium complex was synthesized by a one&#8208;electron chemical reduction of its benzene dianion precursor using potassium graphite in the presence of [2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand. Notably, the yttrium ions remain in the&#160;+3 oxidation state and the spin density of unpaired electron resides at the non&#8208;planar benzene radical trianion and induces weak aromaticity.








Abstract
Herein, the first report on the isolated and unambiguously proven benzene radical trianion is presented. This unprecedented radical oxidation state of benzene is stabilized through two trivalent rare earth (RE) metal cations each supported by a bis(guanidinate) scaffold. Specifically, the one&#8208;electron chemical reduction of the neutral inverse&#8208;sandwich yttrium complex [[{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2Y]2(&#956;&#8211;&#414;6:&#414;6&#8211;C6H6)] 1, containing a benzene dianion, with potassium graphite (KC8) in the presence of [2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand yielded the title complex [K([2.2.2]&#8208;cryptand)][[{(Me3Si)2NC(NiPr)2}2Y]2(&#956;&#8211;&#414;6:&#414;6&#8211;C6H6&#8226;)] 2, featuring a benzene radical trianion. Analyses through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, elucidated its molecular structure and revealed strong [YIII&#8211;(C6H6)3&#8211;&#8226;&#8211;YIII] metal&#8211;radical interactions. Although the Y centers remain in the&#160;+3 oxidation state, the spin density of the unpaired electron resides primarily on the benzene trianion moiety and extends toward the YIII ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on 2 corroborate this assignment and further suggest weak aromaticity for the benzene radical trianion.

&lt;p&gt;A new type of benzene anion state is born: The unprecedented benzene radical trianion embedded in an inverse-sandwich yttrium complex was synthesized by a one-electron chemical reduction of its benzene dianion precursor using potassium graphite in the presence of [2.2.2]-cryptand. Notably, the yttrium ions remain in the&#160;+3 oxidation state and the spin density of unpaired electron resides at the non-planar benzene radical trianion and induces weak aromaticity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, the first report on the isolated and unambiguously proven benzene radical trianion is presented. This unprecedented radical oxidation state of benzene is stabilized through two trivalent rare earth (RE) metal cations each supported by a bis(guanidinate) scaffold. Specifically, the one-electron chemical reduction of the neutral inverse-sandwich yttrium complex [[{(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#414;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#414;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)] &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, containing a benzene dianion, with potassium graphite (KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) in the presence of [2.2.2]-cryptand yielded the title complex [K([2.2.2]-cryptand)][[{(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NC(N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#414;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;i&gt;&#414;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt;)] &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, featuring a benzene radical trianion. Analyses through single-crystal X-ray diffraction, EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, elucidated its molecular structure and revealed strong [Y&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;3&#8211;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Y&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;] metal&#8211;radical interactions. Although the Y centers remain in the&#160;+3 oxidation state, the spin density of the unpaired electron resides primarily on the benzene trianion moiety and extends toward the Y&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; corroborate this assignment and further suggest weak aromaticity for the benzene radical trianion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cross&#8208;Shaped Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Push&#8211;Pull Architectures for Effective Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

         <dc:description>
A cross&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor topology is constructed via TCNQ&#8208;based framework design, and further refined through post&#8208;synthetic conversion of cyano groups into N&#8208;heterocycles. This multilevel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D1 architecture enables multidirectional charge transport and enhanced exciton dissociation, offering a tunable molecular platform for COF&#8208;based photocatalysts beyond conventional linear COFs.








Abstract
Efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production are pivotal for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. However, their performance remains limited by inefficient charge separation and rapid electron&#8211;hole recombination. Rational molecular design is therefore essential to enhance intrinsic charge&#8208;separation driving forces and establish efficient transport pathways. Herein, a TCNQ&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TCNQ&#8208;COF) featuring a rare cross&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor fragment was constructed by integrating electron&#8208;deficient TCNQ and electron&#8208;rich triphenylene into a conjugated backbone, achieving multidirectional charge&#8208;transfer pathways. Post&#8208;synthetic transformation of the cyano groups into electron&#8208;withdrawing heterocycles (pyrazole or pyrimidine, A&#697;), when combined with triphenylene (D) and amino groups (D1), yielded two novel COFs (Pz&#8208;COF, Pym&#8208;COF) with multilevel cross&#8208;shaped D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#697;&#8208;D1 architectures. This sophisticated push&#8211;pull system enables gradient&#8208;tuning of donor&#8211;acceptor interactions, thereby promoting efficient charge separation and carrier mobility. Among them, Pz&#8208;COF exhibits the highest H2O2 production rate (7613&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses further reveal a synergistic effect between acceptor strength and donor diversity in regulating intramolecular charge behavior. The proposed cross&#8208;shaped D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A and its multilevel D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242;&#8208;D1 architectures overcome the limitations of conventional linear motifs, offering a blueprint for the development of advanced photocatalytic COFs.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Chiral Sulfinamidines via Asymmetric Amination of Sulfenamides Using a Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of chiral sulfinamidine was achieved with excellent efficiency and enantiocontrol through a CPA catalyzed enantioselective amination of sulfenamides at room temperature. This method features a broad substrate scope, mild conditions, and excellent functional group compatibility. The obtained sulfinamidines allow for further stereospecific elaborations to afford sulfinimidoyl fluoride, sulfonimidamide, and other aza&#8208;sulfur derivatives.








Abstract
Despite the significant applications of stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;sulfur compounds in pharmaceutical sciences and organic chemistry, efficient methods for precise construction of valuable chiral sulfinamidines remain limited. Herein, we disclosed a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric strategy for the synthesis of chiral sulfinamidines through the direct amination of sulfenamides. This method demonstrated remarkable substrate scope and excellent yields and stereoselectivities across a diverse array of sulfinamidine compounds. The synthetic utility and practicability of this robust protocol were further highlighted through gram&#8208;scale reactions, product derivatization and late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and drugs.

         <title>Organoplatinum(II) J&#8208;Aggregates with Prolonged Triplet Lifetimes for Enhanced Photodynamic and Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the Pt(II) complexes capable of self&#8208;assembling into J&#8208;aggregates. The J&#8208;aggregates exhibit a prolonged triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime and enhanced triplet sensitization, which collectively boost their photodynamic and photocatalytic performance, leading to significantly improved tumor ablation efficacy.








Abstract
J&#8208;aggregates have demonstrated superior phototherapeutic performance compared to their monomeric counterparts. However, the underlying mechanisms for this enhancement are not fully understood. In this work, we report two near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive organoplatinum(II) complexes, Pt&#8208;2TPE and Pt&#8208;2TPA, which self&#8208;assemble into J&#8208;aggregates via Pt&#8208;Pt and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. Theoretical calculations reveal that J&#8208;aggregates possess lower LUMO energy levels and reduced singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps compared to their monomers, indicating enhanced electron&#8208;accepting ability and more efficient intersystem crossing (ISC). Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed a dramatically prolonged triplet excited&#8208;state lifetime in Pt&#8208;2TPA J&#8208;aggregates (5.8 &#181;s) versus the monomer (123&#160;ns). The efficient oxygen quenching of this long&#8208;lived triplet excited&#8208;state verified enhanced triplet&#8208;state population and sensitization in the J&#8208;aggregates. Consequently, the J&#8208;aggregates efficiently generate Type I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and catalyze NADH oxidation under red light, leading to effective eradication of B16&#8208;F10 cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, a biotin&#8208;modified nanoformulation (Biotin@Pt&#8208;2TPA) exhibits excellent tumor accumulation and tumor growth suppression in vivo. This work provides a strategy to enhance the efficacy of photodynamic and photocatalytic therapy of platinum(II) complexes.

         <title>Interwoven Porous ZIF Polyhedra Threaded with Silver Thiolate Nanowires for Ultrasensitive SERS Detection of Chlorotoluene Isomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed SERS substrate of (Ag02AgIMpy)n@h&#8208;ZIF is fabricated through the integration of structure&#8208;defined Ag&#8208;Mpy into a porous ZIF framework. The inherent porosity of ZIF, along with the incorporation of Mpy signal molecules, facilitate the effective enrichment of target molecules, positioning them in close vicinity to the electromagnetic enhancement zones of the Ag0 substrates. Remarkably, the (Ag02AgIMpy)n@h&#8208;ZIF substrate demonstrates SERS recognition capabilities for monochlorotoluene isomers that are difficult to distinguish non&#8208;destructively using alternative techniques.








Abstract
The identification of isomeric organic compounds poses a significant challenge due to their structurally and chemically analogous features. This research introduces an innovative methodology for the detection of chlorotoluene isomers through the utilization of Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). The approach utilizes an exceptionally efficient SERS substrate, namely (Ag02AgIMpy)n@h&#8208;ZIF (where Mpy denotes p&#8208;mercaptopyridine), characterized by its hollow Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (h&#8208;ZIFs) interwoven with silver thiolate nanowires. The porous channels within h&#8208;ZIFs stably adsorb various chlorotoluene isomers, subsequently exposing them to the electromagnetic field generated by Ag0 species. In addition to coordinating with silver ions, the Mpy component within the silver nanowires functions as a highly stable SERS probe, which improves detection accuracy by serving as an internal standard. This study introduces a novel Ag&#8208;ZIF model as a highly efficient SERS substrate and presents a distinctive methodology for differentiating organic isomers or analogous small molecules.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Mpy)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-ZIF substrate demonstrates SERS recognition capabilities for monochlorotoluene isomers that are difficult to distinguish non-destructively using alternative techniques.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of isomeric organic compounds poses a significant challenge due to their structurally and chemically analogous features. This research introduces an innovative methodology for the detection of chlorotoluene isomers through the utilization of Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). The approach utilizes an exceptionally efficient SERS substrate, namely (Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;Mpy)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;@&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-ZIF (where Mpy denotes &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-mercaptopyridine), characterized by its hollow Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-ZIFs) interwoven with silver thiolate nanowires. The porous channels within &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-ZIFs stably adsorb various chlorotoluene isomers, subsequently exposing them to the electromagnetic field generated by Ag&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; species. In addition to coordinating with silver ions, the Mpy component within the silver nanowires functions as a highly stable SERS probe, which improves detection accuracy by serving as an internal standard. This study introduces a novel Ag-ZIF model as a highly efficient SERS substrate and presents a distinctive methodology for differentiating organic isomers or analogous small molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Experimental Validation of a Photocatalyst Recommender Based on a Large Language Model</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choosing a photocatalyst for a given reaction can be challenging due to complex mechanisms and multiple parameters that govern the outcome of a photocatalyzed reaction. Herein, we disclose a machine learning (ML) model that can suggest catalysts for a given reaction using an online portal. The model was experimentally validated against five photocatalysis reactions, in all cases suggesting productive photocatalysts. This model serves as a valuable tool for researchers optimizing photocatalysis reactions.








Abstract
Utilizing an extensive library of literature on photocatalytic transformations, we disclose the development of a machine learning (ML) model for the recommendation of photocatalysts most suitable for reactions of interest. The model is trained on&#160;&gt;&#160;36&#160;000 such literature examples and uses an architecture inspired by the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) large language model. Under cross&#8208;validation, it can suggest the &#8220;correct&#8221; photocatalysts with &#8764;90% accuracy. When experimentally tested on five out&#8208;of&#8208;box reactions, this algorithm consistently suggested photocatalysts that gave yields competitive to those chosen by human researchers and frequently suggested alternative photocatalysts that are potentially more appealing than the originally selected photocatalyst. Altogether, this platform serves as a valuable tool for researchers undertaking reaction optimization programs. The model is free to use at https://photocatals.grzybowskigroup.pl/predict/.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Circular Oligonucleotides for Spatiotemporal Control of Gene Silencing in Mice</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR light&#8208;activatable circular DNAzyme and ASO have been developed using cyanine&#8208;scaffolded NIR linkers, enabling spatiotemporal control of gene silencing in cells and in vivo. Our data demonstrated that NIR&#8208;activated circular DNAzymes specifically suppressed EGR1 expression and inhibited tumor growth in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, highlighting their potential for safe and on&#8208;demand gene therapy.








Abstract
Oligonucleotide therapeutics hold great promise for gene regulation but face challenges in achieving spatiotemporal control of their functions in vivo. In this study we developed a novel design of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;activatable circular oligonucleotide platform that incorporates a cyanine&#8208;scaffolded NIR photocleavable linker. These engineered circular DNAs, including DNAzymes and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) remain functionally inactive until NIR light irradiation triggers the linker cleavage and activates their functions, thereby enabling spatiotemporal control of gene silencing in cells and in vivo. Live cell studies demonstrated that circular DNAzymes and ASOs maintained minimal basal activity but could be efficiently activated by NIR light to achieve robust gene silencing of both exogenous and endogenous mRNAs. In vivo studies showed that lipid nanoparticle&#8208;delivered circular DNAzymes targeting the early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) mRNA achieved localized tumor suppression upon NIR irradiation, while exhibiting minimal gene silencing activity in normal organs. Our work establishes a versatile and effective platform for the spatiotemporal control of oligonucleotide functions in vivo, providing a powerful tool for the basic study of gene function and highlighting their potential in the development of safe and on&#8208;demand gene therapeutics.

         <title>Translation&#8208;Promoting Effects of RNA Template Overhangs in the Absence of Ribosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribosome&#8208;free translation of an RNA sequence into a peptide sequence can be controlled by the folding of the template strand. Overhang sequences forming a triplex structure with the templating region and the peptidoyl RNA in pH&#8208;dependent manner increase yields up to 40&#8208;fold through entropic effects and mixed anhydride formation, allowing for controlled, locus&#8208;specific translation.








Abstract
Translation requires a complex set of biomacromolecules. How it evolved is an unsolved problem. Ribosome&#8208;free, single&#8208;nucleotide translation via coupling of 3&#8242;&#8208;aminoacylated RNA to 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphoramidate&#8208;linked RNAs was shown for very short peptides. It was unclear how this process could be induced at a specific locus, regulated, and expanded. Here we show that a triplex&#8208;forming template overhang accelerates ribosome&#8208;free translation and increases its yield. An NMR&#8208;monitored model study suggested that mixed anhydrides between carboxylates of amino acid residues and phosphates can contribute to efficient peptide coupling, strengthening proximity effects. Folding into triplexes at pH 6 enhances the template effect, and unfolding at pH 8 suppresses it, suggesting a simple way of achieving &#8220;inducible translation&#8221; in a system devoid of biomacromolecules. Under mild acidic conditions, doubly RNA&#8208;linked peptides up to octamers were formed in near&#8208;quantitative yield. Taken together, our data suggests that the growth of template strands not only allows for encoding more genetic information, but may also enhance translational fitness.

A crown&#8208;ether&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene&#8208;based cationic cage, featuring multiple cavities formed by four flexible, amphiphilic 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 units and a rigid, hydrophobic cage&#8208;like structure has been designed and synthesized.

Abstract
Natural biological systems achieve precise recognition and regulation of nucleic acids through multi&#8208;domain synergistic interactions. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a crown&#8208;ether&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene&#8208;based cage (1&#8226;8X, X&#160;=&#160;PF6&#713; or Cl&#713;) with two distinct recognition sites&#8212;four flexible, amphiphilic 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (18&#8208;C&#8208;6) units and a rigid, hydrophobic cavity. Its multi&#8208;cavity architecture offers an enzyme&#8208;like microenvironment, replicating the cooperative recognition behavior seen in natural receptors. As a result, 1&#8226;8Cl&#713; promotes distinctive hydrogen&#8208;bonded assemblies of dinucleotides with various sequences in aqueous environments. Notably, 1&#8226;8Cl&#713; facilitates a stable G&#8226;C&#8226;G&#8226;C quartet upon binding with two d(GpC), while assembling into an unprecedented C&#8226;C&#8226;C&#8226;C quartet in a 1:4 stoichiometric ratio with d(CpC). Additionally, 1&#8226;8Cl&#713; selectively recognizes the 5&#8242;&#8208;base of dinucleotides or specifically binds to T base, promoting the formation of non&#8208;classical base&#8208;pairing patterns such as G&#8226;G, T&#8226;(H2O)2&#8226;T, and T&#8226;(K+)&#8226;T dimers in crystalline states. This study systematically investigates the hydrogen&#8208;bonding patterns of dinucleotides in biomimetic environments, providing new insights into the design of biomimetic receptors and understanding the diversity of non&#8208;classical nucleic acid structures.

         <title>Unveiling Residual Charge Effects in the Direct Regeneration of Spent LiFePO4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations are carried out to expound the physicochemical differences between the incompletely and fully discharged spent LiFePO4 (IDS&#8208;LFP and FDS&#8208;LFP), distinguishing and establishing a screening standard for them. Various regeneration methods are also employed to investigate the differences in regeneration effects between FDS&#8208;LFP and IDS&#8208;LFP under the same conditions. 








Abstract
The emergence of safe crushing technologies for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries treatment will significantly increase the proportion of incompletely discharged spent LiFePO4 (IDS&#8208;LFP) in future recycling industry. The IDS&#8208;LFP and fully discharged S&#8208;LFP (FDS&#8208;LFP) with different residual charge show different microstructures and physicochemical properties. However, the current research in direct regeneration mainly focus on FDS&#8208;LFP, the regeneration of IDS&#8208;LFP and the relationship between residual charges and regeneration effect that has received less attention. Therefore, we classify the FDS&#8208;LFP and IDS&#8208;LFP based on their physicochemical properties and investigate the differences in their repair process using three kinds of regeneration methods. Compared to FDS&#8208;LFP, IDS&#8208;LFP exhibits a higher lithium intercalation energy barrier due to vacancies in the bulk. In addition, the proportion of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in regenerated IDS&#8208;LFP (IDR&#8208;LFP) (1.3%) is higher than regenerated FDS&#8208;LFP (FDR&#8208;LFP) (0.6%), confirming that IDS&#8208;LFP cannot be completely regenerated. As a result, FDR&#8208;LFP delivers a specific discharge capacity of 137.1 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C, retaining 81.5% capacity retention after 400 cycles. In sharp contrast, IDR&#8208;LFP only provides a specific discharge capacity of 105.1 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C. This study provides foundational insights for handing S&#8208;LFP with varying residual charge.

         <title>A Label&#8208;Free Phosphate&#8208;Transfer DNAzyme for the Cost&#8208;Effective Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Detection of Influenza Virus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphate&#8208;transfer DNAzyme (P&#8208;Dz)&#8208;based POCT platform was developed for the accurate and low&#8208;cost detection of influenza virus by restoring P&#8208;Dz activity upon target virus RNA binding, triggering high fluorescence being facilely imaged and analyzed via smartphone.








Abstract
DNAzymes have significantly enriched the toolbox for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT); however, their inferior biostability and reliance on costly chemical labeling limit their broader applicability in high&#8208;throughput viral sample analysis. Herein, we constructed a label&#8208;free DNAzyme POCT platform for the accurate detection of influenza virus, with low cost (approximately US$0.20 per test). The simple yet robust viral detection system consists merely of a phosphate&#8208;transferase&#8208;mimicking DNAzyme (P&#8208;Dz) with a newly discovered highly&#8208;efficient small&#8208;molecule substrate, 6,8&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP). Target viral RNA could specifically restore the catalytically active conformation of P&#8208;Dz for initiating the phosphate transfer reaction from DiFMUP and for producing a high fluorescence signal. Without the prerequisite of laborious and expensive chemical labeling of DNA substrate, a readily accessible test filter strip (TFS) was introduced into the system, enabling the interpretation of fluorescence readout via smartphone visualization and thereby achieving the amplified detection of various viral RNA targets. This label&#8208;free DNAzyme platform provides a cost&#8208;effective and portable platform for bioanalysis, with considerable potential in epidemiological diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring.

         <title>Hybridized Host Functions in Polyaromatic Tube&#8208;in&#8208;Capsule Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of tube&#8208;in&#8208;capsule hybrid hosts is achieved in water through a combination of a polyaromatic tube and capsule. Rod&#8208;like aromatic dyes are selectively bound within the hybrid host, yielding ternary composites with high emission ability through spatial isolation of the dyes. Replacing the capsule with a chiral derivative affords chiral ternary composites with pronounced dye&#8208;based circularly polarized emission.








Abstract
Noncovalent hybridization of two types of host compounds has emerged as a promising strategy to develop unique functions, unattainable by either of the hosts. Here we report unusual spectroscopic features observed within a new hybrid host, formed by the combination of a polyaromatic tube and capsule, with rigid and flexible frameworks, respectively, in water. The resultant tube&#8208;in&#8208;capsule host selectively encapsulates rod&#8208;like aromatic dyes (e.g., BODIPY and coumarin derivatives), yielding ternary host&#8211;guest composites bearing a dye&#8208;in&#8208;tube structure. The ternary composites exhibit strong emission (up to &#934;F = &#8764;60%) from the bound dyes in water, with up to 45&#8208;fold enhancement compared to the corresponding dye&#8208;in&#8208;capsule composites, due to the spatial isolation of the dyes in the tubular cavities. Detailed host&#8211;guest studies using dye derivatives and partial tube structures clearly indicate the importance of the rod&#8208;like dye shape and tubular cavity for the present photofunctions. Furthermore, unusual remote chiroptical induction of encapsulated achiral dyes is readily demonstrated within a related hybrid host, where the achiral capsule is replaced with a chiral polyaromatic capsule. The dye&#8208;based, pronounced circularly polarized emission (|glum| = &#8764;3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3) is observed only in this hybridized host&#8211;guest system.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Defined Cu(I) Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst with a Cu2N6 Motif in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for CO Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu(I) dual&#8208;atom sites within a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) stabilize key C2 intermediates through distinct binding configurations during carbon monoxide (CO) electroreduction, delivering 72% C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) at &#8722;430&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density and a maximum of 86% at &#8722;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 total current density, thereby meeting commercially viable benchmarks.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon monoxide (CO) provides a sustainable pathway to valuable multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products, contributing to carbon neutrality. Enhancing coupling efficiency and selectivity for C2+ formation hinges on precise control of the spatial arrangement of catalytic sites where CO molecules adsorb. Here, we introduce a structurally well&#8208;defined Cu(I) dual&#8208;atom catalyst (DAC) embedded in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) that is synthesized via a thermal transformation. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCD) reveals Cu2N6 motifs with a Cu&#8211;Cu distance of 3.6&#160;&#197;, stabilized by tetrazolate within a 2D layer, ensuring CO accessibility and efficient coupling. The catalyst achieves a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72% for C2+ products at a partial current density of &#8722;430&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a maximum C2+ FE of 86% at a total current density of &#8722;200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the paired Cu nodes stabilize key C2 intermediates via distinct binding configurations, underpinning the system's exceptional performance.

         <title>Rigidifying Qubit Candidates in a Cu&#8208;Porphyrin Nanohoop: Dipolar Coupling in Spin Pairs and Spin&#8208;Polarized Ground State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated nanohoop, Cu[3]CPTA, containing three Cu(II) porphyrin spin centers (S&#160;=&#160;&#189;) was synthesized. We show that the exceptionally high &#8220;nanohoop rigidity&#8221; results in well&#8208;defined dipolar coupling (DEER) and a rare light&#8208;induced spin polarization of the doublet ground state in frozen solution (transient cwEPR).








Abstract
Assembling molecular qubit candidates with precise control over the position and orientation of spin centers is an important contemporary challenge for synthesis. In this work, we show that the rigidity of highly strained macrocycles from the cycloparaphenylene family gives rise to distinct spin&#8208;spin and light&#8208;spin interactions that make such few&#8208;qubit systems a promising testing ground for future quantum technologies. We synthesized conjugated nanohoop Cu[3]CPTA that comprises three Cu(II)porphyrin centers (S&#160;=&#160;&#189;) with a Cu&#8211;Cu distance of ca. 18&#160;&#197; (by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction). Continuous&#8208;wave (cw) and pulse electron&#8208;paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies revealed that dipolar coupling in spin pairs is so well defined in this nanohoop that the Cu&#8211;Cu distance can be determined accurately via double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER). By transient cwEPR, we observed a rare case of a light&#8208;induced polarization of a doublet ground state in frozen solution. The fact that ground state polarization was significantly less pronounced in a comparable, but more flexible macrocycle will inspire future efforts to better understand and harness this effect.

     alt="Rigidifying Qubit Candidates in a Cu-Porphyrin Nanohoop: Dipolar Coupling in Spin Pairs and Spin-Polarized Ground State"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A conjugated nanohoop, &lt;b&gt;Cu[3]CPTA&lt;/b&gt;, containing three Cu(II) porphyrin spin centers (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#189;) was synthesized. We show that the exceptionally high &#8220;nanohoop rigidity&#8221; results in well-defined dipolar coupling (DEER) and a rare light-induced spin polarization of the doublet ground state in frozen solution (transient cwEPR).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembling molecular qubit candidates with precise control over the position and orientation of spin centers is an important contemporary challenge for synthesis. In this work, we show that the rigidity of highly strained macrocycles from the cycloparaphenylene family gives rise to distinct spin-spin and light-spin interactions that make such few-qubit systems a promising testing ground for future quantum technologies. We synthesized conjugated nanohoop &lt;b&gt;Cu[3]CPTA&lt;/b&gt; that comprises three Cu(II)porphyrin centers (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#189;) with a Cu&#8211;Cu distance of ca. 18&#160;&#197; (by single-crystal X-ray diffraction). Continuous-wave (cw) and pulse electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies revealed that dipolar coupling in spin pairs is so well defined in this nanohoop that the Cu&#8211;Cu distance can be determined accurately via double electron&#8211;electron resonance (DEER). By transient cwEPR, we observed a rare case of a light-induced polarization of a doublet ground state in frozen solution. The fact that ground state polarization was significantly less pronounced in a comparable, but more flexible macrocycle will inspire future efforts to better understand and harness this effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Cancer Chemoimmunotherapy with Mitochondria&#8208;Targeting Iridium(III)&#8208;Based Immunogenic Oncosis Inducers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium(III) complexes modified with benzothiazole and benzoselenazole moieties were designed to concurrently trigger oncosis and activate the cyclic GMP&#8211;AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8211;STING) pathway, thereby bridging chemotherapy with immunotherapy








Abstract
Most clinically used chemotherapeutic agents act by inducing apoptosis. However, their clinical effectiveness is often limited by poor therapeutic efficacy and the rapid development of drug resistance. In contrast, oncosis, as an inflammatory form of cell death independent of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and apoptotic pathways, exhibits unique advantages in overcoming tumor drug resistance and regulating anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Herein, we present the first iridium(III)&#8208;based immunogenic oncosis inducers designed to concurrently induce oncosis and activate the cGAS&#8211;STING pathway, thereby bridging chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Through a bioisosteric design strategy, we identified benzoselenazole and benzothiazole derivatives as key pharmacophores for triggering oncosis. These iridium(III)&#8208;based oncosis&#8208;inducers rapidly disrupt mitochondrial architecture, induce oxidative stress, and promote Ca(II) release, which subsequently activate calpain and porimin to initiate oncosis in multidrug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. Transcriptomic profiling further revealed their ability to regulate actin cytoskeleton organization, modulate ABC transporter activity, and affect glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Notably, the metal complexes induce mitochondrial swelling and mt&#8208;DNA damage, leading to robust activation of the cGAS&#8211;STING innate immune pathway and eliciting a strong anticancer immune response. Based on these multimodal mechanisms, the Ir(III)&#8208;based immunogenic oncosis inducers were able to effectively kill drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells and enhance the anticancer immune response in tumor mouse models.

         <title>Universal Catalyst Design Framework for Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis Facilitated by Local Atomic Environment Descriptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal catalyst design framework integrating weighted atom&#8208;centered symmetry function (wACSF) descriptors with machine learning accurately predicts adsorption energies for 2e&#8722; water oxidation reaction. Microkinetic modeling and experimental validation confirm the framework's universality, establishing a powerful paradigm for rational electrocatalyst discovery.








Abstract
A universal design framework for high&#8208;performance catalysts remains challenging due to diverse structures and active sites. We developed a framework integrating weighted atom&#8208;centered symmetry function (wACSF) descriptors with machine learning, microkinetic modeling, and high&#8208;throughput screening. The wACSF descriptors unify geometric and chemical characteristics of active sites across different catalyst families. ML models trained on wACSF accurately predicted adsorption free energies of hydroxyl (&#916;GOH*, R2 = 0.84) and oxygen (&#916;GO*, R2 = 0.91) for intermetallic alloys, metal oxides, perovskites, and single&#8208;atom catalysts in the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR). Density functional theory and microkinetic modeling yielded a universal 2e&#8722; WOR volcano model that agreed well with experiments. High&#8208;throughput screening with ML&#8208;predicted &#916;GOH* identified LiScO2, which achieved 90% H2O2 Faradaic efficiency at 2.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with 168&#8208;hour stability (82%&#8211;86% retention). Experimental activity (log(j) = 1.56) matched theoretical predictions (log(j) = 1.28) within 5% deviation at 2.4 V_RHE. This universal framework provides a general paradigm for rational catalyst design and is implemented in the Digital Catalysis Platform (DigCat), enabling efficient discovery across diverse material classes and electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Packing Order Control in Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Tuning Ligand Oxidation State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning ligand oxidation state effectively controls packing and charge transport in Gd&#8208;HHTP MOFs. A reduced ligand state yields an ordered, porous stp&#8208;type framework with high conductivity (&#8764;1.5 S cm&#8722;1), whereas an oxidized state drives the formation of a dense, low&#8208;conductivity cag&#8208;b&#8208;type framework (&#8764;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1). This redox&#8208;driven structural bifurcation offers a powerful strategy to program topology and electronic properties in conductive MOFs.








Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs), composed of metal nodes and redox&#8208;active ligands, have attracted growing interest due to the coexistence of porosity and charge transport. Notably, their electrical performance is closely related to the packing and ligand oxidation state within the framework, which has rarely been explored. Typical divalent metal nodes favor saturated intralayer square&#8208;planar coordination to ligands in a single oxidation state, thereby predetermining the framework topology. Here, we report a packing and topology control strategy, achieved by tuning the ligand oxidation state and grounded in lanthanides (e.g., Gd) versatile coordination chemistry. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal transport measurements reveal that, at low temperature, coordination of Gd3+ with 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) in a lower mixed oxidation state (&#8722;4 and &#8722;5) yields a more ordered porous packing (Gd1.5HHTP) with superior electronic transport performance. In contrast, at elevated temperature, the ligand adopts a higher oxidation state (&#8722;3), and coordination with Gd3+ yields a densely packed structure with local coordination disorder (GdHHTP), resulting in a markedly reduced electrical conductivity. This study demonstrates ligand&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state tuning provides an effective strategy for the precise control of structural order and charge transport in c&#8208;MOFs, laying a theoretical foundation for the rational design of materials with tunable electronic properties.

The above article, published online on 24 July 2012 in Wiley Online Library (wileyonlinelibrary.com), has been retracted by agreement between the journal Editors&#8208;in&#8208;Chief, Frank Maass and Nathalie Weickgenannt; the German Chemical Society; and Wiley&#8208;VCH GmbH. A third party reported that Figure 1C contained duplicated bands, that the Naked siRNA bands in Figure 2D had been manipulated to remove data containing bands from the 0&#8208;120 (min) lanes. These concerns were confirmed by the publisher.
The authors responded to an inquiry by the publisher and stated that the bands in Figure 1C were original but agreed that Figure 2D was incorrect. The authors confirmed that all original data were no longer available, supplied data of repeated experiments for Figure 2D, and stated their intention to supply data from repeated experiments for Figure 1C. Both the editors and publisher agree that a correction with data from repeated experiments would not be appropriate.
The retraction has been agreed to because the evidence of image manipulation in Figures 1C and 2D fundamentally compromises the editor's confidence in the conclusions presented in the article. The authors were informed of the retraction.

The authors confirmed that all original data were no longer available, supplied data of repeated experiments for Figure 2D, and stated their intention to supply data from repeated experiments for Figure 1C. Both the editors and publisher agree that a correction with data from repeated experiments would not be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retraction has been agreed to because the evidence of image manipulation in Figures 1C and 2D fundamentally compromises the editor's confidence in the conclusions presented in the article. The authors were informed of the retraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

EGFP linked to a click&#8208;cyclized cell penetrating peptide that attach itself to the cell membrane and internalize into the cell, while carrying the EGFP as a cargo. The best CPP was selected from a designed library of linear and click cyclized D&#8208;peptides having four arginines and a naphthyl group. As indicated by membrane curvature the cell penetration occurs by a dynamin dependent endocytosis mechanism. The cells were healthy at all concentrations investigated indicating low or no toxicity.

         <title>Frontispiece: Carbonothioate&#8208;Triggered Cascade Cyclization Enables High&#8208;Specificity Fluorescence Imaging of Hydrogen Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonothioate&#8208;based fluorescent probe is developed that can be selectively activated by H2Sn (n&#160;&gt;&#160;1) through cascade cyclization reaction to liberate the phenolic fluorophore. This work for the first time demonstrates the fluorescence imaging of H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Details are reported by Wei Chen and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202519021).

Achieving specific interactions of metal&#8208;oxo clusters with biological substrates becomes possible through organic functionalization. The illustration depicts a dartboard that symbolizes the enzyme's active site as the molecular target. The darts represent clusters bearing distinct organic functionalities, designed to enable selective interactions with the protein surface. This concept highlights the potential of molecular design strategies to achieve precise bioinorganic recognition. More in the Communication (e202518349) by Mhamad Aly Moussawi, Tatjana N.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Solvent Channels and Electric Fields Guide Proton Delivery to the Active Site of Heme Peroxidases (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50/2025)</title>

Local electric fields guide protons toward the heme through two distinct electrostatic funnels at the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges in heme peroxidases. Water&#8208;mediated pathways enable proton exchange with key residues such as Arg38 and His42. These findings reveal that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple, well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery, conserved across heme peroxidase enzymes.

Mechanical activation in ball&#8208;milling mechanochemistry remains experimentally elusive, prompting the theoretical exploration in the Research Article (e202505263) by Ivan Halasz, Ana&#8208;Sun&#269;ana Smith, and co&#8208;workers. Using molecular simulations, mechanochemical impacts under neat and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding are modelled, capturing how kinetic energy from the impact drives crystal fragmentation into atoms, ions, and ion pairs, triggering product formation and agglomeration. It is shown that minimal liquid promotes reactivity, while excess stabilizes reactants. This framework enables rational optimization of catalysts and reaction conditions.

         <title>Organic Polymer Semiconductor Photocatalysts: From Building Block Design to Controllable Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polymer semiconductors are highly tunable photocatalytic systems. This review explores the structural design of organic polymer semiconductors from two perspectives: building block design and control over self&#8208;assembly and surface modification. Furthermore, the future development of organic polymer semiconductor photocatalysts is discussed. By integrating structural design with photocatalytic reactions, this review provides a foundation for the rational design of photocatalytic organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic polymer semiconductors are emerging as a promising class of photocatalysts because their highly tunable molecular structures and flexible morphological control offer unique advantages for overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks of traditional inorganic materials. However, the development of organic polymer photocatalysts largely relies on empirical, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches. The understanding of their structure&#8211;activity relationship is insufficient, which significantly hinders the rational design and performance prediction of polymer photocatalysts. This review systematically outlines the structure&#8208;driven design strategies for polymer photocatalysts by focusing on two interconnected levels: molecular building block design and controllable assembly. Starting with the molecular building block design, strategies including monomer unit selection, functional group modification, and heteroatom doping are analyzed in detail for tuning the material's intrinsic electronic and photophysical properties. At the assembly level, we explore how strategies like morphological control, surface modification, and pore engineering can guide the controlled organization of polymers to optimize the final semiconductor architecture. By establishing the relationship between structure and properties at different scales, we aim to build a systematic structure&#8211;activity relationship for polymer photocatalysts, ultimately seeking to shift from empirical screening to rational design.

         <title>Recent Advances in Regulating Metal&#8722;Silica Interaction for Boosting Heterogeneous Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discussed the recent developments in the construction of the metal&#8211;silica interface, and important catalytic applications in heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts are extensively utilized in the modern chemical industry, with catalytic processes primarily occurring on the surfaces of nanocrystals. Construction of an optimum surface/interface is of significant importance in regulating the catalytic performance. Strong metal&#8208;support interactions (SMSI) have been proven to be an efficient strategy to modulate the electronic and geometric properties of the supported nanocrystals by forming a thin amorphous coating layer and a new metal bond. The classical SMSI typically occurred on reducible metal oxides (TiO2, CeO2, Nb2O5, and Fe2O3) under a reduction environment. Nevertheless, the SMSI effect could be successfully engineered for the inert oxides (Al2O3, MgO, and SiO2) under much more severe conditions owing to the inertness of hard&#8208;to&#8208;reduce oxides compared with reducible oxides. Over the past few decades, it has been observed that the amorphous encapsulation layer could be induced under much higher temperatures, as well as the formation of a metal&#8211;Si bond, which significantly promotes various catalysis. In this review, we focus on the construction of metal&#8211;silica interaction and the dynamics of structure evolution of the metal crystals under certain reaction conditions, while highlighting their unique features in heterogeneous catalytic processes.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Sulfur&#8208;Dots Induced Spatiotemporal PhotoRDRP for Multi&#8208;Arm Star Functional Polymer</title>

Metal&#8208;free photoRDRP for functional polymers: Metal&#8208;free sulfur&#8208;dots (S&#8208;dots) mediated photoinduced reversible deactivation radical polymerization (photoRDRP) strategy is developed for the production of well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;arm star copolymers with dual stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. The resulting smart polymers exhibited precise architecture control and self&#8208;assembly behavior.








Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;dots (S&#8208;dots) serve as a cost&#8208;effective and non&#8208;toxic alternative to traditional photocatalysts or transition metals typically required in photoinduced reversible deactivation radical polymerization (photoRDRP). Herein, we report a facile and efficient method for synthesizing well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;arm star polymers through S&#8208;dots mediated photoRDRP under ambient conditions. This approach enables precise control over polymer growth with excellent spatiotemporal control over polymerization, as evidenced by the ability to pause and resume polymerization with UVA light (&#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switching). This methodology was successfully applied to produce a variety of polymer architectures, including multi&#8208;arm star homopolymers and dual&#8208;responsive diblock and triblock copolymers. Among these, the synthesized 4&#8208;arm star [poly(N,N&#8208;dimethyl acrylamide)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(butyl acrylate)]4&#8208;Br [4&#8208;arm star (PDMA&#8208;b&#8208;PDMAEMA&#8208;b&#8208;PBA)4&#8208;Br] triblock copolymer was used to assess pH and temperature responsiveness. This work introduces a sustainable, metal&#8208;free route for the development of next&#8208;generation smart polymers suitable for biomedical and environmental applications and highlights the versatility of S&#8208;dots as a catalyst.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Acidity Interplay in Eu&#8208;Promoted PtSn2 Catalysts for Selective and Stable Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

Eu&#8208;promoted PtSn2 catalysts leverage the redox activity of Eu and tailored acidity to reduce coke formation, enhancing selectivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. This synergy significantly improves propylene yield and extends catalyst lifespan, providing an effective strategy for efficient PDH processes.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts based on Pt alloys are widely employed in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), yet challenges such as coking and poor nanoparticle stability hinder their broader industrial deployment. Strategies to enhance dispersion and tune the catalyst surface properties remain at the forefront of catalyst design. Here, we demonstrate a new class of PtSn2&#8208;based catalysts promoted by rare&#8208;earth elements for efficient and stable PDH. Among the rare&#8208;earth screened, europium (Eu) delivers the most pronounced promotional effect, enabling the formation of &#8764;1.3&#160;nm PtSn2 nanoparticles with improved thermal stability. Through its redox flexibility (Eu3+/Eu2+), Eu modulates the electronic environment of Pt, tunes surface acidity, and suppresses coke accumulation by directing carbon species away from active sites and onto the support. This work shows that rare&#8208;earth elements can serve as multifunctional promoters in alloy catalysts, influencing both structural dispersion and catalytic surface chemistry. The optimized catalyst (0.5% Pt&#8208;3% Sn&#8208;2% Eu on &#947;&#8208;Al2O3) achieves a 40.6% propylene yield at 575&#160;&#176;C and a low deactivation rate (0.047&#160;h&#8722;1), under conditions relevant to industrial practice. Our findings offer a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance diluted alloy catalysts through rare&#8208;earth promotion, applicable to other dehydrogenation and hydrocarbon upgrading reactions where coke suppression and acid&#8211;base balance are critical.

         <title>Solubility, Speciation and Thermodynamics of PuCO3OH(cr) in Carbonate Containing NaCl Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline Pu(III) hydroxo carbonate, PuCO3OH(cr), was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions, and structurally characterized by Rietveld analysis and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Solubility experiments revealed a great thermodynamic stability of PuCO3OH(cr), that substantially enhances the predominance field of solid Pu(III).








Abstract
The solubility, aqueous speciation, and solid phase formation of trivalent plutonium, Pu(III) was investigated for the first time in pH near&#8208;neutral 0.10&#160;M NaCl solutions under the presence of carbonate at T&#160;=&#160;(23&#160;&#177;&#160;2)&#160;&#176;C in the frame of a comprehensive experimental study. Crystalline PuCO3OH(cr) was synthesized by long&#8208;term equilibration of the binary hydroxide Pu(OH)3(am) in aqueous Na2CO3 solutions and comprehensively characterized by VIS/NIR absorption spectroscopy, SEM/EDX, powder XRD and Rietveld analysis, and Pu L3&#8208;edge EXAFS. Batch solubility experiments with PuCO3OH(cr) equilibrated in 0.10&#160;M NaCl&#8211;Na2CO3 solutions were performed from undersaturation as a function of pHm and followed over time for up to 90 days. A chemical model was derived and the corresponding thermodynamic constants evaluated. These novel data demonstrate that under specific conditions Pu(III) equilibrium concentrations are up to three orders of magnitude lower when controlled by the PuCO3OH(cr) compared to the concentration level defined by Pu(OH)3(am), and reveal a remarkable stabilization of the entire Pu(III) oxidation state in carbonate containing aqueous solutions. The relevance of the new data for geochemical modeling of environmental systems and nuclear waste repositories is discussed.

         <title>Solvent Channels and Electric Fields Guide Proton Delivery to the Active Site of Heme Peroxidases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic potential surfaces and electric field lines reveal that local fields guide proton delivery through multiple conserved solvent channels in heme peroxidases, enabling efficient access to the active site.








Abstract
The active sites of heme enzymes have evolved to control the formation of highly reactive intermediates in oxidative catalysis. Proton delivery to the heme is essential, yet the mechanisms of proton delivery remain poorly understood. Here, we identify routes and drivers of proton delivery in a heme peroxidase (ascorbate peroxidase) using computational approaches that combine classical, quantum, and hybrid methods with enhanced sampling and local electric field (LEF) analyses. Our results show that networks of active&#8208;site water molecules facilitate proton exchange with Arg38, which may act as a transient proton carrier at the &#947;&#8208;heme edge where the substrate binds. The distal His42 residue aids proton transfer into the active site via solvent at the &#948;&#8208;edge. Molecular dynamics simulations of three heme peroxidases identify hydrated channels leading to both &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, allowing solvent protons to reach the active site. Comparison with eight other heme peroxidases shows that these channels are conserved. LEF analyses reveal a continuous electrostatic funnel drawing protons toward the heme from the &#947;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;edges, a feature that is broadly conserved across other peroxidases. These results suggest that nature pre&#8208;organizes electrostatic funnels and solvent channels to provide multiple well&#8208;defined routes for proton delivery in peroxidase catalysis.

         <title>Development of High Performance Pyrolized Polyimide&#8208;based Carbon Molecular Sieves for Enhanced Selectivity of Propylene/Propane Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report extremely selective carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) pyrolized from a triptycence&#8208;based intrinsically microporous polyimide: 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride&#8208;2,6(7)&#8208;diamino triptycene (6FDA&#8208;DAT1). A fresh CMS membrane pyrolyzed at 800 &#176;C for 2&#160;h displayed a mixed&#8208;gas C3H6 permeability of 56 Barrer combined with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 66. A remarkable increase in mixed&#8208;gas C3H6/C3H8 selectivity up to 152 was observed after 147 days of continuous mixed&#8208;gas testing at 4&#160;bar.








Abstract
The replacement or de&#8208;bottlenecking of the highly energy&#8208;intensive distillation unit operation process for propylene/propane separation has long posed a formidable challenge. Although membrane technology can potentially offer a more energy&#8208;efficient alternative, existing materials lack the requisite mixed&#8208;gas selectivity for industrial use. Achieving effective separation for propylene and propane with only 0.13&#197; difference in molecular size requires membranes with superb molecular sieving properties. Here, we report extremely selective carbon molecular sieve (CMS) materials fabricated by utilizing a triptycene&#8208;based intrinsically microporous 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride&#8208;2,6(7)&#8208;diamino triptycene (6FDA&#8208;DAT1) polyimide precursor and adjusting its microstructure through finely tuned high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. A freshly prepared isotropic CMS membrane pyrolyzed at 800 &#176;C for 2&#160;h displayed a mixed&#8208;gas propylene permeability of 56 Barrer combined with a C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of 66. Notably, after an extended period of continuous mixed&#8208;gas testing and aging at 4&#160;bar over 147 days, the CMS membrane exhibited a remarkable increase in mixed&#8208;gas propylene/propane selectivity to 152&#8212;an unmatched value to date for a CMS material&#8212;because of selective tightening of the CMS microstructure by physical aging.

         <title>Rational Crystal Contact Engineering for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembled Protein Architectures</title>

Winning by losing: With rational elimination of crystal lattice contacts, the remaining interaction sites drive the formation of predetermined assemblies. Thus, rational lattice redesign can produce multiple structured frameworks from essentially the same building blocks, without resource&#8208;costly calculations required for new designs.








Abstract
Ordered protein&#8208;based assemblies are increasingly desirable for materials science, but the design of new materials remains challenging and requires considerable effort. Crystal lattice contact modulation enables rapid rational design of an assortment of structurally diverse constructs with crystalline order. Targeted disruption of crystal contacts and directional growth pre&#8208;biasing allows for restricting crystal lattice growth in selected directions, resulting in lower&#8208;dimension assemblies with parent crystal structural features. Two&#8208;dimensional crystals, one&#8208;dimensional fibres, flexible ribbons, and single&#8208;walled nanotubes based on tetratricopeptide repeat proteins were constructed from reengineered 3D crystal lattices. The large library of available crystal structures provides an abundance of engineering targets, promising to make crystal contact engineering a rapid and attractive approach for the design of ordered supramolecular protein assemblies.

         <title>Controlled Dual Activation of Rhenium(I) Photosensitizers and Profluorophores/Prodrugs via a Dissociative Bioorthogonal Tetrazine&#8211;Isonitrile Reaction</title>

Rhenium(I) tetrazylmethyl complexes serve as phosphorogenic bioorthogonal reagents, releasing luminescent and photocytotoxic rhenium(I) 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes and functional payloads upon reaction with 3&#8208;isocyanopropyl derivatives. Their selective lysosomal accumulation in cancer cells and enhanced singlet oxygen photosensitization in acidic environments highlight their potential for bioimaging and combination therapy in tumors.








Abstract
Strategies for prodrug activation have been developed to enhance treatment efficacy, with bioorthogonal dissociation reactions emerging as a promising approach due to their remarkable specificity. In this work, we designed three rhenium(I) polypyridine complexes featuring a tetrazylmethyl (TzMe) group capable of bioorthogonal activation by 3&#8208;isocyanopropyl (ICPr) or 3&#8208;isocyanopropyl&#8208;1&#8208;carbamoyl (ICPrc) derivatives. This design serves as a dual&#8208;release platform, which liberates rhenium(I) 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes and functional payloads from rhenium(I) TzMe complexes and ICPr/ICPrc&#8208;caged compounds, respectively. Upon incubation with an ICPrc derivative, the TzMe complexes exhibited strong emission in acidic buffers, attributed to the predominant existence of the resulting rhenium(I) 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes in their protonated form. Confocal imaging of live cells incubated with a TzMe complex and ICPr&#8208;caged fluorescein unveiled intense intracellular emission in distinct channels. Importantly, the therapeutic potential of this approach was underscored by the treatment of cells with a TzMe complex and ICPrc&#8208;caged doxorubicin. The anticancer effect was amplified through the synergy between singlet oxygen (1O2) photosensitization and prodrug activation, effectively combining photodynamic therapy with chemotherapy. The more pronounced 1O2 generation of the 3&#8208;hydroxypyridine complexes in acidic media and their specific accumulation within the acidic lysosomes of cancer cells highlight the potential of bioorthogonal prodrug activation for effective cancer&#8208;targeted therapy.

         <title>Enzyme Immobilization in Porous Crystals via Cage Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins have been immobilized in crystals by encapsulation in well&#8208;defined, spherical coordination cages prior to crystallization. This pre&#8208;encapsulation approach allows isomorphic crystallization of various types of proteins with high loading efficiency. Dual enzyme immobilization in the cage crystals resulted in enhanced cascade reaction activity due to close proximity.








Abstract
Enzyme immobilization within solid or polymer matrices continues to face challenges, such as inhomogeneous protein environments, low loading efficiency, and limited versatility. Here, we present a pre&#8208;encapsulation strategy for enzyme immobilization in porous crystals via coordination cage encapsulation. In this approach, enzymes are first confined within the well&#8208;defined cavities of spherical coordination cages prior to crystallization. The host cage framework facilitates crystal formation under almost uniform conditions, independently of the surface properties of the enzymes. This isomorphous crystallization enabled the successful immobilization of nine proteins with diverse sizes and properties, achieving high loading efficiencies. The immobilized enzymes retained their native structures and catalytic activities within the crystal, functioning as heterogeneous catalysts with enhanced stability. Furthermore, the co&#8208;immobilization of two enzymes in close proximity facilitated cascade reactions, underscoring the potential of coordination cages as effective hosts for enzyme immobilization.

         <title>Two&#8208;Stage Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide Into Aromatics Via Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a two&#8208;stage process for converting CO2 via CH4 to C6H6 using a Ni/TiO2 catalyst in stage 1 and a Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst stage 2. Thermodynamic calculations as well as experimentally varying parameters, aided in finding the optimal reaction conditions and reducing the coke deposition in stage 2. Furthermore, operando spectroscopy was employed to understand the increased catalyst stability in stage 2.








Abstract
In the refinery of the future, the input shifts from crude oil to biomass, plastic, and CO2. Therefore, we need to find alternative routes to produce chemical building blocks, such as aromatics, which are used in products like, for example, fuels. In this study, we investigated a two&#8208;stage route to produce benzene from CO2. In two sequential reactions, CO2 is first converted into methane over a Ni/TiO2 catalyst, and methane is further reacted to yield benzene using a Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst via the methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) reaction. Through a combination of thermodynamic calculations and experiments, we found the goldilocks conditions for performing this two&#8208;stage process. The unreacted CO2 and H2 from the first reaction extended the benzene production in the second reaction. Using a reaction mixture of CO2, H2, and CH4 resulted in benzene production of at least 72&#160;h, by suppressing carbon growth on the catalyst surface. However, the concentration range in which CO2 and H2 can be added to the feed without losing benzene production is narrow, as we show with H2 fluctuation experiments. We demonstrate that the combination of CO2 methanation and MDA allows us to catalytically convert CO2 into benzene with an overall yield of 5%.

         <title>Exploring a New Family of (Phosphinochalcogenoyl)Europocenes for Magneto&#8208;Optical Thermometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand featuring a coordinating phosphinothioyl, &#8208;selenoyl, or &#8208;telluroyl pendant arm in addition to the typical &#951;5&#8208;mode is presented. The homoleptic divalent europocenes obtained from these are the first examples of organometallic probes for magnetic circular dichroism thermometry at cryogenic temperatures, attaining relative sensitivities of up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&#8722;1 at 1.7&#160;K with resolution as high as 0.003&#160;K.








Abstract
The development of novel materials based on lanthanide metallocenes remains a valuable endeavour, due to the synthetic accessibility, compositional tunability, and impressive magnetic and luminescent properties of this class of well&#8208;studied compounds. Europium(II) complexes are particularly interesting in this regard, given the relative stability, strong paramagnetism, and characteristic Laporte&#8208;allowed 5d&#8594;4f emission of this ion. In this study, we tap into the powerful class of phosphinocyclopentadienyl ligands to develop a novel family of potassium (bis(dimethylamino)phosphinochalcogenoyl)cyclopentadienides K[C5Me4(PCh(NMe2)2] of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium, and explore their coordination chemistry with EuII. These ligands readily form homoleptic europocenes where the pendant phosphine chalcogenide arms also coordinate the europium center, and these are characterized via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorbance, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Characterization via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy reveals that these complexes act as extremely sensitive probes for MCD&#8208;based magneto&#8208;optical thermometry, reaching relative thermal sensitivities up to 170&#160;%&#160;K&#8722;1 at cryogenic temperatures, with temperature uncertainties as low as 0.003&#160;K. These complexes represent the first examples of organometallic MCD thermometers, and their remarkable properties and interesting structures highlight the promise of this new class of ligands and the utility of the EuII ion in lanthanide&#8208;based functional materials research.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Powered Signaling Between Artificial and Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

We introduce an ATP&#8208;powered artificial cell platform capable of selectively and transiently releasing DNA signals to facilitate communication between artificial and living cells. By engineering these DNA signals, we achieve precise activation of cellular functions and regulated delivery in response to ATP levels.








Abstract
ATP is the energy currency of life and is overabundant in the tumor microenvironment, where it has been suggested as a target for cancer therapy. We introduce ATP&#8208;dissipative delivery of DNA signals from artificial cells to living cells by exploiting an ATP&#8208;driven reaction network that transiently ejects DNA Signal strands from the shielded artificial cell interior to the extracellular medium of living cells. We customize the Signal for intracellular uptake or for extracellular instruction using a cytokine&#8208;ssDNA chimera that can trigger efficient intracellular downstream signaling programs. Our study discusses details of system design on a timer circuit and artificial cell level, system integration challenges, and how ATP concentrations regulate the transient delivery. The strategy can be extended to deliver therapeutic oligonucleotides for applications in gene therapy and gene silencing.

     alt="ATP-Powered Signaling Between Artificial and Living Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce an ATP-powered artificial cell platform capable of selectively and transiently releasing DNA signals to facilitate communication between artificial and living cells. By engineering these DNA signals, we achieve precise activation of cellular functions and regulated delivery in response to ATP levels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATP is the energy currency of life and is overabundant in the tumor microenvironment, where it has been suggested as a target for cancer therapy. We introduce ATP-dissipative delivery of DNA signals from artificial cells to living cells by exploiting an ATP-driven reaction network that transiently ejects DNA Signal strands from the shielded artificial cell interior to the extracellular medium of living cells. We customize the Signal for intracellular uptake or for extracellular instruction using a cytokine-ssDNA chimera that can trigger efficient intracellular downstream signaling programs. Our study discusses details of system design on a timer circuit and artificial cell level, system integration challenges, and how ATP concentrations regulate the transient delivery. The strategy can be extended to deliver therapeutic oligonucleotides for applications in gene therapy and gene silencing. For cancer therapy, it can use naturally enhanced ATP levels to induce selective delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Difluorinative Cyclopropene Rearrangement by I(I)/I(III) Catalysis: Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Synthesis of Allyl Difluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A difluorinative rearrangement of substituted cyclopropenes is disclosed using I(I)/I(III) catalysis. This platform enables di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl difluorides to be generated with high levels of stereoselectivity, with the I(III) center serving as a traceless directing group. X&#8208;ray crystal structural analysis is described together with facile post&#8208;reaction modifications that include expedient access to fluorinated indenes.








Abstract
Allyl difluorides are pervasive in the pharmaceutical arena, but synthetic challenges in the construction of highly substituted derivatives impede chemical space exploration. Consequently, efforts to develop general approaches that display high levels of regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity continue to be intensively pursued. To contribute to this vibrant area of contemporary organofluorine chemistry, a highly efficient difluorinative rearrangement of densely substituted cyclopropenes is disclosed under the auspices of I(I)/I(III) catalysis. This platform leverages a highly intuitive ring opening model that enables di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted allyl difluorides to be generated with high levels of stereoselectivity where the transient I(III) center serves as a traceless directing group. X&#8208;ray crystal structural analysis is described together with facile post&#8208;reaction modifications that include expedient access to fluorinated indenes. Given the ubiquity of the allyl difluoride chemotype in drug discovery, it is envisaged that this operationally simple, organocatalytic platform will expedite bioisostere design.

         <title>A Modular Approach to Asymmetric Mg(I) Complexes Using a Unique Cyclopentadienyl Mg(I) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like changing the tire of a car: The synthesis of a unique MgI complex with a Cp* ligand enabled facile ligand exchange by salt metathesis, giving access to a first aryloxide&#8208;stabilized MgI complex. This concept paves the way for the syntheses of a large variety of asymmetric MgI dimers in which one of the MgI centres is stabilized by a non&#8208;nitrogen ligand.








Abstract
The first MgI complexes with non&#8208;N ligands have been isolated and were fully characterized. Reaction of [(BDI*)MgNa]2 (III) with MgCp*2 gave quantitative conversion to (BDI*)MgMgCp* (1); BDI* = HC[tBuC&#160;=&#160;N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl) and Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl. A similar reaction with CaCp*2 did not give (BDI*)MgCaCp* but led to insertion of the formal Mg&#176; centre in the benzylic C&#9472;H bond, an oxidative addition that resulted in a mixed Mg/Ca hydride complex. The Cp* ligand in the unique (BDI*)MgMgCp* complex can be exchanged by addition of LM (M&#160;=&#160;Li, Na, K) complexes, resulting in formation of (BDI*)MgMgL and insoluble (Cp*M)n. This modular approach worked for Cp*/N(SiMe3)2 exchange but not for the substitution of Cp* by P(SiMe3)2 or other PR2 ligands. Reaction of (BDI*)MgMgCp* with a bulky NaOAr reagent led to quantitative formation of (BDI*)MgMgOAr&#183;THF, a first MgI complex stabilized with an aryloxide ligand. All products have been fully characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR methods. A computational study gives insight in the thermodynamics of formation and electronic structures.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Directed Assembly of Robust Coordination Cages: Overcoming Kinetic Inertness and Conformational Mismatch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

Polyoxometalate (POM) templates unlock the selective self&#8208;assembly of robust coordination cages from inert metal centers and conformationally mismatched ligands. This strategy modulates both thermodynamic and kinetic pathways, affording stable hosts capable of guest binding under acidic and basic aqueous conditions.








Abstract
The selective construction of kinetically robust coordination cages by self&#8208;assembly remains a significant challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report an efficient polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly strategy enabling the selective assembly of robust Pt6L4 cages under thermodynamic or kinetic control, which is inaccessible via untemplated methods. For a planar ligand (L1) with a dihedral angle (&#952; = 0&#176;), the POM template promotes the formation of a thermodynamically favored Pt6(L1)4 analog. Remarkably, for a twisted and flexible ligand (L2) with a nonideal dihedral angle (&#952; &#8776; 36&#176;), which typically favors the thermodynamically preferred M12L8 cages, the POM template induces the formation of the kinetically trapped M6L4 cages even when using inert Pt(II) precursors. In the absence of POMs, such structures cannot form due to conformational mismatch and the kinetic inertness of metal&#8208;ligand coordination. The resulting Pt(II)&#8208;based cages are highly stable and remain intact as discrete, template&#8208;free hosts after POM removal, capable of encapsulating diverse guests in both acidic and basic aqueous media. This work highlights the unique templating role of POMs in accessing both thermodynamic and kinetic architectures, offering new opportunities for designing robust cages for drug delivery, sensing, and catalysis under harsh conditions.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Substituted DOTAs as Superior and Universal Platforms for Multifunctional Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step multi&#8208;component synthetic approach is reported to construct &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs, which required tedious multi&#8208;step synthesis in all previous works. The synthesized &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs showed improved performance for developing multifunctional theranostics and represent a universal platform for bioconjugation. 








Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Substituted DOTAs are promising chelators for MRI contrast agents owing to the improved coordination stability and relaxivity of the corresponding Gd(III) complexes. However, their broader application is limited by significant synthetic challenges arising from their multi&#8208;component nature. In this work, we report&#8212;for the first time&#8212;the use of multi&#8208;component reactions (MCRs) to assemble all necessary building blocks of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTAs in a single step. This strategy yields derivatives with faster coordination kinetics. Furthermore, we extend their application to luminescent lanthanide probes, achieving improved photophysical properties. This MCR approach offers a versatile solution for establishing a library of functionalized diagnostic and therapeutic agents. We are convinced that this work will reshape the field, inspiring broader exploration of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted DOTA derivatives and unlocking their full potential in next&#8208;generation biomedical applications.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Tunable Double Bond Migration and Geometrical Isomerization in Olefins via a Spin&#8208;Accelerated Alkyl Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A readily accessible, well&#8208;defined iron(II) catalyst that demonstrates high efficiency and versatility in positional and geometrical alkene isomerization is presented. A comprehensive mechanistic study suggests an alkyl mechanism via an isolable iron hydride species and indicates the stereo&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination step exhibits a two&#8208;state reactivity resulting in spin acceleration and dictating the stereoselectivity outcome. 








Abstract
Despite the central relevance of metal&#8208;catalyzed alkene isomerization in academia and industry and the overarching role of iron in sustainable catalysis, highly efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed positional and geometrical isomerizations of alkenes remain long&#8208;sought&#8208;after goals. Herein, we disclose the development of an easily accessible, well&#8208;defined anilido&#8208;aldimine iron(II) alkyl catalyst that efficiently and selectively performs, for the first time, tunable olefin migration over one and multiple carbon&#8211;carbon bonds and configurational alkene isomerization. This singular catalyst behavior also unraveled the implementation of productive regiodivergent and regio&#8208; and stereoconvergent olefin isomerization processes. Notably, with only 1 equiv. of Cy2NH&#183;BH3 (relative to Fe) under mild conditions, these reactions exhibited a broad substrate scope, including (hetero)aryl&#8208;substituted and aliphatic alkenes of different substitution patterns and with diverse functionalities. They also displayed high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Using experimental and computational approaches, a detailed mechanistic study of the positional isomerization regime suggested a redox&#8208;neutral alkyl&#8208;type mechanism via an isolable iron(II)&#8208;hydride species. This study indicated the stereo&#8208; and rate&#8208;determining &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination step occurs through a two&#8208;state reactivity resulting in spin acceleration and a stereoselectivity correlated to these spin state changes. This work also elucidated the peculiar and critical role of the anilido&#8208;aldimine skeleton on the reactivity.

         <title>Deciphering Ball Milling Mechanochemistry via Molecular Simulations of Collision&#8208;Driven and Liquid&#8208;Assisted Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supported by experiments, molecular dynamics simulations were developed to reveal how mechanochemical reactions, such as between KCl and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 with water as a liquid additive, proceed. Product formation is triggered by collision&#8208;induced fragmentation, with liquid content showing a non&#8208;linear effect. These insights clarify how collision energy and additives affect reactivity, aiding the optimization of milling conditions.








Abstract
Mechanochemistry by ball milling proceeds through a series of discrete, high&#8208;energy collisions between milling balls and the sample, yet the molecular&#8208;level processes that govern the resulting chemical and physical transformations remain poorly understood. In this study, we develop a molecular dynamics simulation protocol to investigate a model mechanochemical reaction between potassium chloride (KCl) and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether, both under dry conditions and in the presence of water as a liquid additive. Our simulations reveal that the reaction is initiated by collision&#8208;induced fragmentation of the KCl crystal into individual ions. This process occurs when the absorbed energy per ion pair during a collision exceeds the crystal's cohesion energy. We further show that the addition of a small amount of water facilitates the formation of complexes between potassium ions and 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 molecules. However, excessive water content stabilizes the reactants instead, thereby suppressing complex formation. These findings highlight a non&#8208;linear relationship between liquid additive concentration and the reaction outcome. Our approach offers a molecular&#8208;level perspective on mechanochemical reactivity, providing valuable insights that could guide the rational optimization of milling conditions&#8212;particularly the targeted selection and dosing of liquid additives&#8212;to improve reaction efficiency.

         <title>Achiral Catalyst&#8208;Induced Stereoselectivity Switch at Quaternary Stereocenter: Diastereodivergent Ring&#8208;Opening Alkylation and Enantiodivergent Arylation of Oxindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;one stone, a butterfly's wings, two birds&#8221; for the stereodivergence strategy. By simply changing the achiral Lewis acid from d&#8208;block metal salt ZnCl2 to lanthanide f&#8208;block metal salt DyCl3 without changing the chiral catalyst, an achiral metal cation&#8208;arene noncovalent interaction directed stereodivergence synthesis in both diastereodivergent asymmetric ring&#8208;opening alkylation and enantiodivergent arylation of oxindoles was developed in this study.








Abstract
The development of a unified strategy to achieve both diastereodivergence and enantiodivergence is a prominent yet challenging objective. In this study, a new strategy involving achiral Lewis acid &#8208;directed stereodivergence has been developed. An achiral metal salt is used as a control element to achieve a diastereoselectivity switch, which is unusual. By simply changing the achiral Lewis acids from a non&#8208;lanthanide d&#8208;block metal salt (ZnCl2) to a lanthanide f&#8208;block metal salt (DyCl3), a diastereodivergent asymmetric ring&#8208;opening alkylation of racemic oxindoles with oxabicyclic alkenes has been achieved, leading to a new series of chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles with three contiguous stereocenters bearing a dihydronaphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;ol motif with excellent enantioselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and diastereoselectivities (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;95:5 dr). Next, by simply switching the achiral metal Lewis acid cocatalysts while maintaining the same chiral catalyst, an enantiodivergent formal arylation has been achieved, providing chiral 3,3&#8208;diaryl oxindoles featuring a triaryl&#8208;substituted quaternary stereocenter. Diverse transformations of the chiral 3,3&#8208;oxindoles delivered synthetically useful compounds. Those chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles have shown significant antiproliferative activity against HCT116 colorectal cancer cells. The relative and absolute configurations of these compounds exert prominent effects on the bioactivities, further highlighting the remarkable importance of catalytic asymmetric stereodivergent synthesis.

         <title>SiR&#8208;XActin: A Fluorescent Probe for Imaging Actin Dynamics in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiR&#8208;XActin is a far&#8208;red fluorescent probe for live&#8208;cell imaging of actin that avoids genetic modification and minimizes disruption of actin dynamics, due to its lower binding affinity. Based on jasplakinolide&#8208;like natural product hybrids and Si&#8211;Rhodamine, it offers photostable live&#8208;cell no&#8208;wash staining across cell types and microscopy techniques. Fluorophore exchange allows multicolor labeling and combination with other probes or chemigenetic tools.








Abstract
Imaging actin&#8208;dependent processes in live cells is important for understanding numerous biological processes. However, currently used natural&#8208;product&#8208;based fluorescent probes for actin filaments affect the dynamics of actin polymerization and can induce undesired cellular phenotypes. Here, we introduce SiR&#8208;XActin, a simplified jasplakinolide&#8208;based, far&#8208;red fluorescent probe that enables bright and photostable staining in various cell types without requiring genetic modifications. Due to its relatively weak binding affinity, the probe exhibits minimal cytotoxicity and labels actin filaments without significantly altering actin dynamics. Furthermore, SiR&#8208;XActin is suitable for time&#8208;resolved, live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution STED microscopy. Exchanging the SiR fluorophore in SiR&#8208;XActin for other fluorophores yields probes in different colors. All these properties make SiR&#8208;XActin and its analogs powerful tools for studying actin dynamics using live&#8208;cell fluorescence microscopy.

         <title>In Situ NMR and Kinetics Reveal Origins of Regioselectivity Differences for Epichlorohydrin Ring&#8208;Opening in Lewis and Br&#248;nsted Acid Zeolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselectivities for epichlorohydrin ring&#8208;opening over Br&#248;nsted and Lewis acid zeolites change by an order of magnitude upon replacing fractions of methanol with acetonitrile co&#8208;solvent. Combining transient operando 13C&#8208;NMR with traditional kinetic measurements reveals that these differences originate from competition between an SN1 pathway through ring&#8208;opened carbocation intermediates formed from epichlorohydrin and an SN2 pathway through a methanol&#8208;derived intermediate. This work provides spectroscopic evidence for epoxide ring&#8208;opening intermediates and mechanisms not previously established over solid catalysts.








Abstract
Altering the quantities and organization of reactive species at active sites enables control of turnover rates and regioselectivities (rate ratios) for ring&#8208;opening of epichlorohydrin (C3H5ClO) across two orders of magnitude. Kinetic analysis suggests that parallel monomolecular (SN1) and bimolecular (SN2) substitution mechanisms contribute to observed rates of C3H5ClO reactions with methanol (CH3OH) over both Lewis (Sn&#8208;BEA) and Br&#248;nsted acid (Al&#8208;BEA) zeolites in liquid solvents. In situ solid&#8208;state 13C&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (SS&#8208;NMR) measurements give direct evidence for the proposed ring&#8208;opened carbocations and activated CH3OH intermediates over these catalysts. Interpretation of time&#8208;resolved operando 13C&#8208;SS&#8208;NMR spectra shows that C3H5ClO&#8208;derived carbocations and CH3OH&#8208;derived surface species convert to ring&#8208;opening products through SN1 and SN2 reaction mechanisms and subsequently form distinct product regioisomers. These NMR spectra also reveal a concomitant shift from SN1 to SN2 reactions with increases in the coverage of CH3OH&#8208;derived reactive intermediates achieved by control of the local concentrations of CH3OH, C3H5ClO, and diluting CH3CN. This knowledge provides new insight into the role of coverage on regioselectivity and rates of catalytic reactions of organic species at solid&#8211;liquid interfaces.

         <title>Simultaneous Induction and Self&#8208;Reporting of Nucleolar Stress by a Nucleolus&#8208;Targeted Platinum(II) Complex via Lifetime Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first example of a metal complex that can achieve simultaneous induction and self&#8208;reporting of nucleolar stress via PLIM of nucleolar viscosity. The phosphorescence response of this platinum(II) complex to viscosity is achieved by suppressing the structural distortion to the non&#8208;emissive d&#8211;d excited state and restricting the rotation of Pt&#9472;N coordination bonds.








Abstract
The nucleolus exhibits characteristic viscous fluid dynamics, whereas nucleolar stress plays a key role in carcinogenesis. However, monitoring nucleolar viscosity in living cells remains a great challenge, which also leads to the lack of a clear report on the relationship between nucleolar viscosity and nucleolar stress. Herein, a nucleolus&#8208;targeted platinum(II) complex with monodentate ligands (Pt2) has been developed, which can rapidly accumulate in the nucleolus and inhibit ribosome biogenesis through energy&#8208;dependent signaling pathways, eventually inducing nucleolar stress and simultaneously monitoring nucleolar viscosity via phosphorescence lifetime imaging (PLIM). The phosphorescence response of Pt2 to viscosity is achieved by suppressing the structural distortion to the non&#8208;emissive d&#8211;d excited state and restricting the rotation of Pt&#9472;N coordination bonds, which is different from other commonly reported viscosity probes in the literature. After exposure to Pt2 or other antineoplastic agents, which can induce nucleolar stress, the gradual decrease of nucleolar viscosity is observed in living cells in a quantitative and real&#8208;time manner, indicating that nucleolar viscosity can be used as a real&#8208;time monitor of the extent of nucleolar stress. This work reports the first example of a metal complex that can achieve simultaneous induction and self&#8208;reporting of nucleolar stress via PLIM of nucleolar viscosity.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Diversified Kinetic Resolutions of Diaryl&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutenones via Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation</title>

         <dc:description>
The diversified kinetic resolutions of diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones through Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation has been achieved for the first time, affording a range of diaryl&#8208;substituted four&#8208;membered ring products, which facilitates the total synthesis of six representative natural products in a stereodivergent fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the catalysts play vital roles in determining the resolution modes.








Abstract
1,2&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dialkyl cyclobutanes (DA2CBs) are important scaffolds in numerous bioactive substances. However, the concise asymmetric synthesis of this type of compound remains a formidable challenge, especially in a stereodivergent manner. In this work, we report for the first time the diversified kinetic resolutions of diaryl&#8208;substituted cyclobutenones through Ru&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH). The protocol affords a range of diaryl&#8208;substituted four&#8208;membered rings with structural and stereochemical diversity, which facilitates the total synthesis of six representative natural products in a stereodivergent fashion. Detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted to reveal the origin of the three kinetic resolution modes, and the catalysts are found to play vital roles in determining the reaction pathways, a phenomenon that has been scarcely observed in the field of ATH.

A functional group assisted self&#8208;templating strategy is proposed for coal&#8208;based hard carbon. &#8208;OH group chelates with metal ions to form carbonates as templates, promoting closed&#8208;pore structures. C&#9552;O restricts carbon atom movement, preventing graphitization, and inducing a stable F&#8208;rich SEI. The resulting hard carbon for SIBs shows high capacity and superior rate capability.








Abstract
Coal is a promising precursor for the preparation of hard carbon, which shows great commercial potential as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between planar aromatic molecules and the trend toward graphitization lead to a highly ordered carbon structure with narrow interlayer spacing. In this study, a self&#8208;templating strategy is proposed to regulate the closed&#8208;pore structures of coal&#8208;based hard carbon at the molecular level, and finally improve the plateau capacity. The &#8208;OH is beneficial for the formation of closed&#8208;pore structure during carbonization by chelation with metal ions, and C&#9552;O can help to prevent graphitization, increase the interlayer spacing and form hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic SEI through surface functional remodeling with salt in ether&#8208;based electrolytes. The coal&#8208;based hard carbon displays good cycling stability, exhibiting a high reversible capacity (350 mAh g&#8722;1) at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of up to 88% after 8000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the full battery assembled with NVP demonstrates a stable cycling performance. This work provides new insights into the construction of closed pores and the role of carbonyl groups in hard carbons for enhancing sodium storage performance.

Develop a descriptor&#8208;guided framework through solvent oxidative stability and Na+ coordination analysis to design flame&#8208;resistant ester electrolytes surpassing diffusion limits. 








Abstract
Traditional electrolyte systems are struggle to meet practical needs for high performance of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their limited functionality. The design of electrolytes today relies largely on expensive trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies and intricate solvent&#8211;structure engineering, in which various additives and solvents are arbitrarily used without any reasonable selection rules. Motivated by this, we herein establish a descriptor&#8208;guided framework centered on solvent oxidative stability and Na+&#8208;solvent coordination chemistry to identify intrinsically flame&#8208;proof, ester&#8208;based electrolytes that overcome conventional diffusion limits. By screening a number of fluorinated phosphate and cyclic carbonate candidates, the electrolytes with the comprehensive properties, including the electrolyte desolvation processes, oxidation resistance, and flame retardancy, were successfully designed and synthesized, thereby realizing intrinsic flameproofing with fast&#8208;charging capability. Impressively, our optimized electrolytes sustain over 98% capacity retention for 350 cycles at 1.0 C with a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% when deployed in Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cells, whereas benchmark carbonate systems fail within a few tens of cycles. By linking the explicit performance descriptors of solvent electronic structure and ion&#8211;solvent coordination, this work delivers a rational pathway to flame&#8208;proof and high&#8208;rate SIB electrolytes, breaking the long&#8208;standing diffusion limit and brute&#8208;force screening.

         <title>Copolymer Sequence Regulation Enabled by Reactivity Ratio Fingerprints via Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep learning&#8208;based approach has been established with &#8220;reactivity ratio fingerprints&#8221; design, enabling instant determination of reactivity ratios from arbitrary reaction design. This approach presents exceptional versatility to analyze the condition influence (e.g., temperature, solvent) on reactivity ratios, promoting on&#8208;demand sequence regulation and azeotropic copolymerizations for a broad scope of binary and ternary copolymers.








Abstract
Sequence control is critical for tuning polymer properties in high&#8208;end applications, where reactivity ratios serve as key parameters for analyzing and regulating sequences. Nevertheless, traditional determination methods exhibit low experimental efficiency and are typically confined to two&#8208;component copolymerization. Here, we develop a machine learning platform, which leverages a novel design of &#8220;reactivity ratio fingerprints&#8221; (rFPs) to determine reactivity ratios in binary and ternary copolymerizations. Deep learning models trained on millions of rFPs enable highly efficient (millisecond&#8208;level) determination from sparse experimental data (random monomer structures, arbitrary reaction design). This approach demonstrates outstanding versatility to analyze reactivity ratios under diverse conditions (e.g., temperature, solvent). Notably, rFP&#8208;guided reaction design promotes on&#8208;demand sequence tailoring, compatible with a wide range of binary and ternary monomer combinations. Kinetic investigations and glass transition characterizations support the formation of varied sequence structures, facilitating the identification of binary and ternary azeotropic copolymerizations. This work not only unveils an attractive strategy for determining reactivity ratios but also offers a generalizable framework for sequencing complicated chain structures toward property engineering.

         <title>Side&#8208;Chain Macrocyclization in Ahp&#8208;Bicyclodepsipeptides Biosynthesis Involves Cytochrome P450&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Aromatic Hydroxylation and C&#9472;N Coupling</title>

The biosynthesis of Ahp&#8208;bicyclodepsipeptides featuring an N51&#8208;C15 bridge linking citrulline and tyrosine residues is reported. A single CYP450 enzyme, Dlm16, has been biochemically characterized to perform this intriguing macrocyclization through sequential aromatic hydroxylation and C&#9472;N coupling. The enzymatic C&#9472;H arene amidation mediated by Dlm16 involves a primary amide as the nitrogen donor and an aromatic ring as the acceptor.








Abstract
We report the biosynthesis of FR901277 (1) and delmomycin A2 (2), two 3&#8208;amino&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxypiperidone (Ahp)&#8208;containing bicyclodepsipeptides featuring an N&#8208;C bridge linking the citrulline and tyrosine residues. This intriguing side&#8208;chain macrocyclization is catalyzed by Dlm16, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP450), through a sequential process initiated by ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of the tyrosine ring, followed by intramolecular C&#9472;N coupling between the resulting catechol moiety and the terminal NH2 of the ureido group. Structure&#8208;function analyses and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis confirmed the catalytic importance of identified key residues, enabling the proposal of plausible macrocyclization mechanisms. Functional characterization of eight additional Dlm16 homologs further revealed a CYP450 subfamily capable of catalyzing C&#9472;N bond formation, underscoring the prevalence of this unusual macrocyclization in cyclodepsipeptide biosynthesis. Our work highlights nature's strategies for macrocycle construction and provides another example of CYP450&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;N coupling via direct C&#9472;H functionalization.

         <title>Discovery of a Heme&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Catalyzing Nitrogen&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Formation in Kinamycin Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unexpected heme&#8208;dependent enzyme, Alp1J, was identified as the catalyst that installs N&#9472;N bond in kinamycin biosynthesis. Alp1J forms a stable complex with ferredoxin Alp1I, which is essential for activity. Together they convert l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite into a hydrazine intermediate through a four&#8208;electron reductive pathway. The discovery establishes a platform for genome mining and synthetic biology aimed at novel N&#9472;N&#8208;containing therapeutics.








Abstract
A nitrogen&#8211;nitrogen (N&#9472;N) bond is a core feature of diverse natural products with interesting structural and biological properties. Kinamycin and lomaiviticin, featuring a diazobenzo[b]fluorene core, exhibit exceptional potency as chemotherapeutic agents. However, the N&#9472;N bond forming step in their biosynthesis has remained elusive. Through extensive mutagenesis and biochemical studies, we herein report that Alp1J, belonging to a new family of heme&#8208;dependent enzymes, catalyzes the N&#9472;N bond formation in kinamycin biosynthesis. Interestingly, Alp1J forms a stable complex with its partner ferredoxin Alp1I, which can protect the cofactors and is critical for the N&#9472;N bond formation activity. With its partner ferredoxin, Alp1J catalyzes formation of the hydrazine intermediate directly from l&#8208;aspartate and nitrite by a pathway involving four&#8208;electron reduction. Our findings expand the knowledge of enzymatic N&#9472;N bond formation and show the potential for the discovery and development of novel N&#9472;N bond containing natural products through genome mining and synthetic biology.

         <title>Elucidating the Critical Role of Water in Selective Hydrogenation of N&#8208;heterocycles on a Cobalt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model catalyst consisting of carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles with rich functional groups exhibits universal and efficient water&#8208;promoted N&#8208;heterocycle hydrogenation performance at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H2. Mechanistic studies have shown that water is crucial in providing protons directly and enhancing H2 diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water&#8208;mediated hydrogenation pathway on the Co catalyst.








Abstract
The ambiguous role of water as a solvent in regulating liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation activity and selectivity is of great significance to modern organic synthesis, yet remains challenging to identify. Here, we present a carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticle catalyst with a high number of functional groups, synthesized using a simple approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional water&#8208;promoted N&#8208;heterocycle hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Remarkably, 100% quinoline conversion and &gt;99% 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline selectivity can be achieved at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H2, surpassing the performance of most reported heterogeneous catalysts. Using a combination of advanced mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and theoretical analysis, we elucidate the water&#8208;promoted hydrogenation mechanism. Water is a crucial solvent because it provides protons directly and enhances H2 diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water&#8208;mediated 1&#8211;4&#8211;2&#8211;3 hydrogenation pathway on the surface of this catalyst. Based on this finding, the catalyst exhibits universal water&#8208;promoted hydrogenation performance for a wide range of N&#8208;heterocycles (14 examples with yields of over 96%). This work highlights the crucial role of water in liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation reactions and provides a new research paradigm for the future development of such reactions.

&lt;p&gt;A model catalyst consisting of carbon-coated cobalt nanoparticles with rich functional groups exhibits universal and efficient water-promoted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycle hydrogenation performance at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Mechanistic studies have shown that water is crucial in providing protons directly and enhancing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water-mediated hydrogenation pathway on the Co catalyst.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ambiguous role of water as a solvent in regulating liquid-phase hydrogenation activity and selectivity is of great significance to modern organic synthesis, yet remains challenging to identify. Here, we present a carbon-coated cobalt nanoparticle catalyst with a high number of functional groups, synthesized using a simple approach. This catalyst exhibits exceptional water-promoted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycle hydrogenation activity and selectivity. Remarkably, 100% quinoline conversion and &amp;gt;99% 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline selectivity can be achieved at 100 &#176;C and 0.5&#160;MPa H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, surpassing the performance of most reported heterogeneous catalysts. Using a combination of advanced mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and theoretical analysis, we elucidate the water-promoted hydrogenation mechanism. Water is a crucial solvent because it provides protons directly and enhances H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diffusion, thereby facilitating a favorable water-mediated 1&#8211;4&#8211;2&#8211;3 hydrogenation pathway on the surface of this catalyst. Based on this finding, the catalyst exhibits universal water-promoted hydrogenation performance for a wide range of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-heterocycles (14 examples with yields of over 96%). This work highlights the crucial role of water in liquid-phase hydrogenation reactions and provides a new research paradigm for the future development of such reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Effect of Cap Structure and Poly(A) Positioning on mRNA Translation Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We examined how protein synthesis is affected when the positions of two major structural elements of eukaryotic mRNA&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;are reversed. Reversing their orientation resulted in a marked reduction in protein production. This decrease is likely due to the essential role of cap positioning at the 5&#8242; end for efficient translation initiation, coupled with an inhibitory influence of the poly(A) positioned at the 5&#8242; end.








Abstract
We investigated the relationship between mRNA structure and translation activity using our recently developed chemical method to add a cap structure to an oligonucleotide and a technique for purifying capped mRNAs via reversed&#8208;phase high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) employing a photoreactive tag. Specifically, we designed and synthesized mRNA constructs in which the typical eukaryotic elements&#8212;the 5&#8242; cap and the 3&#8242; poly(A) tail&#8212;were interchanged in position. We examined how this inversion affected translation efficiency. The results revealed that this reversed configuration abolished the synergistic enhancement of translation typically observed with correctly positioned cap and poly(A) tail, resulting in a substantial decrease in activity compared to the native orientation. Interestingly, focusing solely on the cap structure, capping at the 3&#8242; end&#8212;though less effective than at the 5&#8242; end&#8212;still promoted a measurable increase in translation. Moreover, the poly(A) sequence placed at the 5&#8242; end was found to suppress translation. We also prepared mRNAs containing a poly(A) tail with reversed 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; orientation and demonstrated that this inverted poly(A) could still enhance protein synthesis.

         <title>Alternating Magnetic Field Induced Ultra&#8208;Active Cu Sites in Trimetal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Low&#8208;Overpotential CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of nonmagnetic Zn and Mg atoms into the Cu&#8208;based ultrathin MOF induces spin&#8208;isolated Cu(II) active sites and enables local electronic energy elevation at the Cu sites under alternating magnetic field (AMF) stimulation. This design significantly enhances proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer dynamics, achieving efficient electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at low electrode potentials. 








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction is a sustainable approach to address climate challenges, requiring energy&#8208;economic catalysts that are highly active at low electrode potentials. Herein, we developed a Cu&#8208;ZnMg ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), where Zn/Mg atoms enhance CO2 adsorption and CO desorption and the Cu sites show ultrahigh catalytic activity from CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electroreduction under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The Cu&#8208;ZnMg MOF@AMF exhibited a high current density (25.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) at a low potential of &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus RHE with remarkable CO selectivity (&#8764;95%), surpassing that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The incorporation of nonmagnetic metals isolates the unpaired electrons at Cu(II) active sites which are antiferromagnetically coupled in the 1D Cu(II) chains. These spin magnetic moments can effectively interact with the AMF through spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, leading to local electronic energy elevation at the Cu sites. This AMF&#8208;induced activation of isolated Cu sites promotes cooperative proton&#8208;electron transfer, thereby enabling efficient from CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion at low electrode potential.

         <title>Valence&#8208;Modulated Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) Cathode Tuned by Orbital&#8208;Delocalization for Extreme&#8208;Temperature Sodium Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
Conventional NFPP cathodes suffer from slow Na&#8314; diffusion, low capacity, and structural degradation. We propose an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulation strategy, optimizing Na&#8314; pathways for ultralow&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8239;&#176;C) operation and creating multiple redox centers to boost capacity and conductivity. NFPP&#8208;2Mo exhibits enhanced structural stability, resisting electrolyte attack even at 60&#8239;&#176;C, ensuring long&#8208;term integrity. This approach enables wide&#8208;temperature (&#8722;40&#8211;60&#8239;&#176;C) functionality, fast charging/discharging, and extended lifespan, addressing key Na&#8208;ion cathode challenges.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based polyanionic Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) is recognized as a promising cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) with its cost&#8208;effectiveness and stable framework. However, its commercialization is seriously hindered by sluggish Na+ kinetics, and insufficient capacity utilization. Herein, an orbital&#8208;delocalization assisted valence modulated strategy is proposed to address these challenges. The lattice is stabilized by high&#8208;valence Mo6+ through robust Mo&#9472;O bonds, simultaneously reducing Na+ diffusion barriers and activating the inert Na2 sites, while electron delocalization is effectively promoted by its partially filled 3d orbitals to enhance electronic conductivity. Concurrently, additional charge compensation is also provided by Mo4+ via a reversible Mo4+/Mo6+ redox couple, enabling complete Na+ extraction/insertion and suppression of structure distortion. A record&#8208;high discharge capacity of 130.74&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C is delivered by the optimized Na4Fe2.91Mo0.09(PO4)2(P2O7) cathode, with 87.23% capacity retained after 10&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;C, along with stable operation from&#160;&#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. A universal paradigm for high&#8208;performance polyanionic cathodes is established by this synergistic reinforcement approach, advancing durable and high&#8208;power SIBs.

         <title>Modular Design of Polymer Donors Regulates Solution Aggregation and Stretchability of Organic Solar Cells</title>

Modular design of PTzBI&#8208;dF&#8208;Si balances solubility and aggregation in o&#8208;xylene, enabling fibrillar morphologies and mechanically robust stretchable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The use of nonhalogenated solvents in organic solar cell (OSC) manufacturing is crucial for environmental sustainability but remains hindered by difficulties in achieving optimal thin&#8208;film morphologies. In particular, controlling solution&#8208;state aggregation to form well&#8208;defined fibrillar networks that enable high device performance is a central challenge. Here, we present a modular molecular design strategy based on the PTzBI polymer platform, enabling simultaneous tuning of energy levels, crystalline packing, and chain flexibility to address this limitation.

&lt;p&gt;Modular design of PTzBI-dF-Si balances solubility and aggregation in &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene, enabling fibrillar morphologies and mechanically robust stretchable organic solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of nonhalogenated solvents in organic solar cell (OSC) manufacturing is crucial for environmental sustainability but remains hindered by difficulties in achieving optimal thin-film morphologies. In particular, controlling solution-state aggregation to form well-defined fibrillar networks that enable high device performance is a central challenge. Here, we present a modular molecular design strategy based on the PTzBI polymer platform, enabling simultaneous tuning of energy levels, crystalline packing, and chain flexibility to address this limitation. The resulting polymer, PTzBI-dF-Si, integrates a fluorinated backbone and siloxane-terminated side chains, showing balanced solubility and controlled solution-state aggregation in &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene. These network-like solution aggregates translate into enhanced molecular crystallinity and a well-organized fibrillar morphology in the solid film. The corresponding PTzBI-dF-Si:L8-BO blends achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.9% in rigid OSCs. Moreover, PTzBI-dF-Si exhibits ductile deformation with a fracture strain of &#8764;20%, leading to intrinsically stretchable OSCs with a PCE over 16%, retaining&#160;&amp;gt;80% of the initial PCE under 40% strain. These results highlight the promise of rational, modular polymer design in advancing nonhalogenated-solvent processed, high-efficiency, and mechanically robust OSCs for scalable and wearable electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Laccase&#8208;Like Mechanism in Peroxymonosulfate&#8208;Based Oxidation System for Water Decontamination: Dual&#8208;Substrate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed that direct electron transfer (DET)&#8208;dominated peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PMS&#8208;AOPs) are a kind of laccase&#8208;like process, since they share similar oxidation mechanisms including dual&#8208;substrate activation, DET mechanism, pollutant polymerization, and relatively high redox potential. This new discovery means that laccase will be a good reference to develop high&#8208;performance catalysts for PMS&#8208;AOPs.








Abstract
This study demonstrates that direct electron transfer (DET)&#8208;dominated peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PMS&#8208;AOPs) share a similar oxidation mechanism with laccase, including dual&#8208;substrate activation, DET mechanism, polymerization of organic pollutants, and relatively high redox potential at active site. To verify this point, a detachable catalyst (MnPc/CNT) was used. Neither manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) nor carbon nanotubes (CNT) could efficiently catalyze PMS to remove phenol (PE), whereas MnPc/CNT achieved complete PE elimination primarily through a DET mechanism. In this process, PE was mainly removed via polymerization. Importantly, galvanic cell experiments and density functional theory calculations showed that MnPc/CNT can simultaneously activate both PE and PMS, whereas MnPc or CNT alone cannot. This dual&#8208;substrate activation phenomenon was seldom reported in PMS&#8208;AOPs. Comparative studies showed that MnPc/CNT, FePc/CNT, and CoPc/CNT exhibited significantly higher PE removal efficiency than NiPc/CNT, CuPc/CNT, and ZnPc/CNT, which correlated with their higher open circuit potentials. Since&#160;current catalyst design strategies for PMS&#8208;AOPs remain largely empirical and enzyme is highly efficient catalyst, this laccase&#8208;like mechanism means that the laccase&#8208;mimetic approach will be a promising direction for developing high&#8208;performance catalysts.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Coordinated Lipids: Facilitators for Enhanced mRNA Delivery Efficacy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of zinc&#8208;coordinated lipids (Zn&#8208;CL) into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) modifies the interaction forces between LNPs and mRNA, subsequently enhancing mRNA delivery through benefiting multiple processes, including cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and mRNA release. Zn&#8208;CL LNPs hold substantial promise to augment the therapeutic efficiency of mRNA and advance their clinical application.








Abstract
The advancement of mRNA therapeutics necessitates more efficient delivery systems. Current clinically advanced lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) primarily bind mRNA through electrostatic interactions, with limited exploration of other intermolecular forces that can benefit multiple delivery processes. Here, we design zinc&#8208;coordinated lipids (Zn&#8208;CL) to formulate LNPs, enabling high mRNA delivery efficacy in vivo. The zinc&#8208;coordinated moieties in ionizable lipids show strong affinity toward phosphate groups, yielding tight yet reversible mRNA encapsulation. In addition, due to the abundance of phosphate groups in biological membranes, Zn&#8208;CL lipids engage them to boost enhanced cellular uptake. Once inside endosomes, competitive binding of zinc&#8208;coordinated moieties to the membranes strengthens endosomal destabilization and weakens Zn&#8209;CL/mRNA interactions, enabling efficient endosomal escape as well as rapid cytosolic mRNA release and resolving the long&#8209;standing paradox between stable encapsulation and efficient release. As a result, zinc coordination introduction simultaneously solves multiple mRNA delivery obstacles, ultimately leading to 29&#8208;fold higher mRNA translation than FDA&#8208;approved SM&#8208;102 LNPs in vivo. Notably, this coordination strategy is extendable to other metal ions, with cobalt&#8208;coordinated lipids facilitating spleen&#8208;targeted mRNA delivery. These findings highlight the substantial potential of metal&#8208;coordinated lipids as a versatile platform for enhancing mRNA therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Quantitative Reactivity Profiling of Functional Arginine Residues in Human Cancer Cell Line Proteomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent probe targeting arginine was used along with the proteomic platform isotopic tandem orthogonal proteolysis&#8208;activity&#8208;based protein profiling (isoTOP&#8208;ABPP) to identify hyperreactive arginine residues in the human proteome of cancer cell lines. This approach underscores the essential role of arginine in protein function, highlighting its biological importance and therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Arginine, a critical amino acid for protein structure and function, is involved in enzyme catalysis and macromolecular interactions. However, selectively targeting its reactive guanidine group has been challenging. Here, we utilized a probe, AP&#8208;1, based on phenylglyoxal, which demonstrated remarkable chemical selectivity and reactivity toward arginine residues. Using activity&#8208;based protein profiling (ABPP), we explored the human proteome across four cancer cell lines, obtaining quantitative data for approximately 3500 arginine residues. This analysis led to the identification of several previously unreported hyperreactive arginine residues, including R43 of PKM, R171 of LDHA, R172 of LDHB, R341 of CKB, R168 of EIF4A1, and R118 of FUBP1, which are crucial for protein function. Notably, the mutation of CKB's R341 inhibited cell proliferation and migration by downregulating energy supply. We also introduced ArGO&#8208;LDHA&#8208;1, a covalent inhibitor targeting LDHA's hyperreactive arginine residues, showing potential to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. This work highlights the biological significance of arginine residues and provides a platform for large&#8208;scale profiling of arginine reactivity.

         <title>Rational Engineering of a Pseudaminic Acid Synthase Enzyme Enables Access to a 3&#8208;Fluoro Sugar with Motility Inhibition in Bacterial Pathogens</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational engineering of a pseudaminic acid synthase enzyme (PseI) enables the synthesis of a 3&#8208;fluorinated pseudaminic acid sugar (3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac), which can be processed to the fluorinated CMP&#8208;donor in vitro by a synthetase enzyme, and impairs the motility of the gut pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, demonstrating the potential utility of fluorinated bacterial &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars as anti&#8208;motilins.








Abstract
We report the rational engineering of a pseudaminic acid synthase (PseI), which enables the first synthesis of a 3&#8208;fluorinated pseudaminic acid sugar (3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac), potentially establishing a new class of metabolic inhibitors targeting bacterial glycosylation. Pseudaminic acids are &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars essential for O&#8208;glycosylation of flagellin in pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni, where they are critical for motility and virulence. By introducing rational mutations in the PseI active site, we achieve enhanced turnover with unnatural 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phosphoenolpyruvate, facilitating a scalable chemoenzymatic synthesis of the fluorinated sugar. Subsequent treatment of C. jejuni with 3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac resulted in a significant, time&#8208;dependent reduction in motility, and in vitro studies demonstrated bacterial CMP&#8208;pseudaminic acid synthetase enzymes (PseF) can process the fluoro sugar to afford CMP&#8208;3&#8208;(eq)&#8208;F&#8208;Pse5Ac7Ac, potentially implicating the fluorinated pseudaminic acid or its glycosyltransferase CMP&#8208;donor as an anti&#8208;motilin in vivo. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that fluorinated pseudaminic acids can impair bacterial motility, paving the way for anti&#8208;virulence strategies in pathogenic bacteria. This anti&#8208;motilin approach offers a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, addressing the urgent need for novel strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance, and could be extended to other bacterial &#9082;&#8208;keto acid sugars.

By introducing rational mutations in the PseI active site, we achieve enhanced turnover with unnatural 3-fluoro-phosphoenolpyruvate, facilitating a scalable chemoenzymatic synthesis of the fluorinated sugar. Subsequent treatment of &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; with 3-(&lt;i&gt;eq&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;-Pse5Ac7Ac resulted in a significant, time-dependent reduction in motility, and in vitro studies demonstrated bacterial CMP-pseudaminic acid synthetase enzymes (PseF) can process the fluoro sugar to afford CMP-3-(&lt;i&gt;eq&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;-Pse5Ac7Ac, potentially implicating the fluorinated pseudaminic acid or its glycosyltransferase CMP-donor as an anti-motilin in vivo. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that fluorinated pseudaminic acids can impair bacterial motility, paving the way for anti-virulence strategies in pathogenic bacteria. This anti-motilin approach offers a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, addressing the urgent need for novel strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance, and could be extended to other bacterial &#9082;-keto acid sugars.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Singlet Oxygen Generation via Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Intersystem Crossing in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Two ESIPT&#8208;capable molecules with distinct dimensionalities were designed, exhibiting opposing ESIPT behaviors upon excitation. The 2D THTA undergoes complete ESIPT, enabling efficient intersystem crossing and robust 1O2 generation. This study highlights the pivotal role of ESIPT in triplet&#8208;state formation and pioneers its application for sustainable ESIPT&#8208;based catalysis. 








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is a key reactive species in photodynamic therapy and organic synthesis. Conventional generation of 1O2 relies on metal&#8208;containing sensitizers to promote intersystem crossing (ISC) and thereby activate molecular oxygen (3O2), which limits biocompatibility and scalability. Here, we report a metal&#8208;free strategy leveraging excited&#8208;state intramolecular&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ESIPT) to enhance 1O2 production. Two classes of ESIPT&#8208;active materials, 1D polymers and 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), were systematically compared. Interestingly, while the ESIPT transition in the 1D polymer is incomplete and unstable, 2D COF enables a highly stabilized tautomeric transition, resulting in a persistent metastable state that acts as a gateway to enhanced ISC. This difference is due to a reversed ESIPT pathway dictated by ground&#8208;state geometry. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic studies reveal that the ESIPT transition process in the 2D COF triggers ISC, facilitating 1O2 generation. Thermodynamic analysis reduces the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and increases dipole moment changes, while spin&#8211;orbit coupling and frontier molecular orbital reorganization indicate kinetic facilitation of ISC. This work highlights the unique advantages of 2D&#8208;COF&#8208;based ESIPT transformations, offering a groundbreaking approach to boosting ISC efficiency and 1O2 generation, expanding the scope of ESIPT in photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Conformational Quenching in an Engineered Lipocalin Protein Achieves High Affinity Binding to the Toxin Colchicine</title>

Specific high affinity recognition of colchicine by an engineered anticalin involves loop dynamics and conformational selection








Abstract
The engineered lipocalin Colchicalin binds the clinically relevant plant toxin colchicine with picomolar affinity. X&#8208;ray structures revealed major loop rearrangements at the open end of the &#946;&#8208;barrel upon ligand binding, suggesting a critical role for protein dynamics. Here, we integrated solution NMR relaxation experiments with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov modelling to examine conformational dynamics in the free and ligand&#8208;bound Colchicalin on the picosecond&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale. Fast backbone dynamics were comparable in the presence and absence of colchicine, indicating preserved secondary structure. However, large&#8208;scale fluctuations in the structurally variable loops on the microsecond&#8208;to&#8208;millisecond timescale were observed in the apo form. We identified conformational exchange between three states, binding competent, partially closed and fully closed, characterised by loop L3 rearrangements. Colchicine binding quenches these motions, indicating a strong interplay between protein dynamics and ligand recognition. Our results support conformational selection over induced fit as the binding mechanism, highlighting the critical role of slow&#8208;timescale dynamics to enable specific, high&#8208;affinity ligand recognition and providing an important example for rational drug design.

         <title>Redox Reactions with Calcium&#8208;Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium metal nanoparticles (5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm) are realized by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with [LiNaph] in toluene. Their reactivity is exemplarily evaluated in the liquid phase and results in [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold.








Abstract
Calcium is generally a highly reactive alkaline&#8208;earth metal, but as bulk metal, it exhibits only low reactivity at ambient conditions due to small surface area, low solubility, and/or passivation. The reactivity can be significantly enhanced when using small&#8208;sized calcium nanoparticles. In this regard, we describe the first synthesis of Ca(0) nanoparticles, 5.4&#160;&#177;&#160;1.2&#160;nm in size, by TMEDA&#8208;supported reduction of CaI2 with lithium naphthalenide in toluene (TMEDA: N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine). We also show Ca(0) nanoparticles to be substantially different from so&#8208;called &#8220;Rieke calcium&#8221;. The high reactivity can be used for redox reactions, for instance, with [Cp2MoCl2] and the sterically demanding &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand HDippNacNac (Dipp: 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) or with [(Ph3P)AuCl] as a derivative of a ligand&#8208;stabilized noble metal. The Ca(0)&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;driven reactions result in the novel compounds [{(DippNacNac)(thf)Ca}2(naph)] (1) with a rare naphthalenide dianion, [{(DippNacNac)(thf)CaMo(Cp)H}2(fulvalene)] (2) with unusual MoH&#160;&#8594;&#160;Ca dative bonding, and [Au9(PPh3)8](naph)(tmeda)0.5 (3) with a non&#8208;charged body&#8208;centered cubic Au9 cluster core of zerovalent gold. Ca(0) nanoparticles and the compounds 1&#8211;3 are characterized by electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (single crystals, powders), spectroscopy (IR, UV&#8208;Vis, NMR, EPR), and computation. Exemplarily, the formation of 1&#8211;3 points to the potential of nanosized alkaline&#8208;earth metals for chemical syntheses and the different reactivity of nanosized and bulk metals.

         <title>Buried Interface Modification for High Performance and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylamine derivatives (TAPC) act as an effective passivating agent. The resulting modified molecular layer establishes a gradient arrangement of thermal expansion coefficients between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite, effectively mitigating stress accumulation within the perovskite film. This method effectively alleviated the accumulated stress within the membrane, reduced the barrier for hole transport at the interface, inhibited non&#8208;radiative recombination, and ultimately increased the PCE from 24.22% to 26.05%.








Abstract
Residual stress can cause distortion of the perovskite lattice, resulting in the formation of local defects such as dislocation and vacancy. These defects serve as non&#8208;radiative recombination centers and significantly affect the stability of perovskite films.&#8204; In this study, triphenylamine derivative (TAPC) was designed as an effective passivating agent.

&lt;p&gt;Triphenylamine derivatives (TAPC) act as an effective passivating agent. The resulting modified molecular layer establishes a gradient arrangement of thermal expansion coefficients between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite, effectively mitigating stress accumulation within the perovskite film. This method effectively alleviated the accumulated stress within the membrane, reduced the barrier for hole transport at the interface, inhibited non-radiative recombination, and ultimately increased the PCE from 24.22% to 26.05%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residual stress can cause distortion of the perovskite lattice, resulting in the formation of local defects such as dislocation and vacancy. These defects serve as non-radiative recombination centers and significantly affect the stability of perovskite films.&#8204; In this study, triphenylamine derivative (TAPC) was designed as an effective passivating agent. The resulting modified molecular layer established a gradient arrangement of thermal expansion coefficients between the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite, effectively mitigating stress accumulation within the perovskite film. This modification concurrently enhanced hole transport capability and optimized the energy level alignment. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the optimized perovskite solar cell (PSCs) increased from 24.22% to 26.05%, with the fill factor (FF) rising from 83.2% to 85.2%. Furthermore, the device achieved the lowest open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) loss reported for comparable 1.55&#160;eV bandgap PSCs, while maintaining excellent long-term stability. Importantly, this strategy also enabled a corresponding flexible PSC (F-PSCs) to achieve a remarkable PCE of 24.39%. Collectively, these results demonstrate a promising pathway for buried interface modification of perovskite films and the fabrication of high-performance F-PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Isomeric &#928; Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Nitrogen Topologies for Integrated Gold Adsorption and Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric nitrogen&#8208;topology&#8208;guided &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz and v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Pz) are developed that integrate selective adsorption and efficient photoreduction of AuCl4&#8211;. The v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz shows higher Au3&#8314; uptake (2465 mg g&#8722;1), and both COFs achieve &gt;99% gold extraction under visible light, establishing a topology&#8208;directed paradigm for COF&#8208;based precious metal recovery.








Abstract
Gold recovery from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) presents a significant materials challenge, as conventional systems lack structural tunability, exhibit poor metal selectivity, and fail to integrate adsorption and photoreduction functionalities effectively. Herein, we present a topology&#8208;guided strategy based on two isomeric &#960;&#8208;conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) (v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz and v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Pz), incorporating diazine (ortho&#8208;N) and pyrazine (para&#8208;N) units, respectively, for integrated gold adsorption and photoreduction. The nitrogen topology not only stabilizes the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone but also significantly modulates the frameworks&#8217; optoelectronic and redox properties. Notably, v&#8208;2D&#8208;COF&#8208;Dz exhibits a markedly higher Au3&#8314; adsorption capacity (2465&#160;versus 1854&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1), attributed to enhanced interfacial electron localization and directional charge transfer to Au3&#8314; centers. Both frameworks achieve over 99% gold extraction from real e&#8208;waste leachates under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Spectroscopic characterization and DFT analysis reveal that nitrogen topology governs metal coordination strength and electronic coupling, enabling precise Au&#8211;Cl bond activation. This work establishes a nitrogen&#8208;topology&#8208;directed design paradigm for light&#8208;driven, COF&#8208;based precious metal recovery systems.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Hard Carbons: A Fully Organic SEI Enables Low&#8208;Coordination Interfacial Environments and Fast Na+ Desolvation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully organic Poly(MMA) SEI reconstructs the interfacial coordination near the inner Helmholtz plane, weakens solvation, and accelerates desolvation kinetics.








Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging capability becomes a critical bottleneck for the practical deployment of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), particularly due to sluggish Na+ desolvation and interfacial transport at hard carbon (HC) anodes. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on Na+ desolvation and transport kinetics across solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) with diverse chemical natures. Although inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs are generally regarded as favorable for Na+ transport, our results reveal that certain organic&#8208;rich SEIs can deliver comparable or even superior kinetic performance. Guided by these insights, we construct a Poly(MMA)&#8208;based artificial SEI on commercial HC (Type&#8208;1), which reorganizes the Na+&#8211;DME solvation shell at the inner Helmholtz plane into a Na+&#8211;DME/Poly(MMA) coordination environment. This interfacial reconstruction markedly enhances Na+ desolvation and interphase transport, enabling exceptional rate performance (236&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (99% capacity retention over 1000 cycles) for the commercial Type&#8208;1 HC. The effectiveness of the Poly(MMA)&#8208;derived interphase is further validated in both coin&#8208;type and pouch&#8208;type full sodium&#8208;ion chemistries, as well as in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This work unveils the pivotal role of interfacial solvation structure, beyond the organic/inorganic ratios of SEI, in governing Na+ kinetics, offering a new design paradigm for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

         <title>Double&#8208;Donor and Anion&#8208;&#960; Polymer Electrolytes for Fast Li+ Conduction in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

We report a molecularly engineered cellulose trimellitate ester (PCLA) quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte with dual&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; motifs. C&#9552;O/COOH groups coordinate Li+ and anchor TFSI&#8722;, while an electron&#8208;deficient benzene enables anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, improving ion transport and interfacial stability. PCLA delivers 1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 ionic conductivity, 57.04&#160;MPa strength, and stable cycling in LFP and NCM811 full cells.








Abstract
Cellulose&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) offer advantages such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, renewability, and environmental friendliness, making them ideal candidates for lithium metal batteries. However, the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds within the cellulose framework hinder lithium ion (Li+) transport and reduce ion mobility, limiting their practical applications. In this study, we developed a cellulose trimellitate ester (PCLA) with a double&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; structure: 1) the carbonyl group (C&#9552;O) as a Li+ donor, 2) the carboxyl group (COOH) serves as a hydrogen bond donor to anchor the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) anion, and 3) the electron&#8208;deficient benzene ring (Ph) interacts with the TFSI&#8722; anion through the anion&#8208;&#960; mechanism. The resulting PCLA QPE achieved high ionic conductivity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and excellent tensile strength (57.04&#160;MPa). Full&#8208;cell batteries with LFP and NCM811 cathodes exhibited exceptional cycling stability with remaining 85% and 90% of their initial capacity after 1000 and 200 cycles, respectively. This double&#8208;donor and anion&#8208;&#960; molecular design paves the way for cellulose&#8208;based solid electrolytes with commercial potential, advancing next&#8208;generation safe energy storage technologies.

Dynamic &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy centers drive electrocatalytic nucleophile oxidation (NOR) via dual&#8208;site synergy with adsorbed OH*. Enables near&#8208;quantitative 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) conversion (97.1% yield/Faradaic efficiency) with &gt;100&#160;h stability. Mechanism governs broad substrate reactivity, establishing dynamic active&#8208;center engineering for transition&#8208;metal (oxy)hydroxide catalysts. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nucleophile oxidation (NOR) is pivotal for renewable energy and sustainable synthesis, yet the ambiguous nature of active sites hinders catalyst design. Herein, we thoroughly investigate the dynamic activation of CuO under NOR using surface voltammetry, in situ Raman, and impedance spectroscopies. Direct voltametric and spectroscopic evidences reveal that the adsorbed hydroxyl&#8208;bridged Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy species (&#956;2&#8208;OH&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy, 2&#160;&#8804;&#160;&#948;&#160;&#8804;&#160;3) are the catalytically active centers for the reaction. Experimental&#8211;theoretical synergy reveals that the dynamic &#956;2&#8208;OH&#8208;Cu&#948;+&#8208;oxy interacts with stabilized OH* to form a dual&#8208;site, dictating the structure&#8211;activity relationship. This mechanism enables near&#8208;quantitative conversion of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (97.1% yield/Faradaic efficiency) with&#160;&gt;&#160;100&#160;h stability. The mechanistic insights we obtained show broad applicability across various nucleophilic substrates, where substituent effects, carbon chain flexibility, and &#945;&#8208;hydrogen mobility govern reactivity variations. This study establishes dynamic active center engineering as a universal strategy for designing transition&#8208;metal (oxy)hydroxide catalysts, bridging electrocatalysis and precision organic synthesis.

         <title>Cyclometalated Gold(III)&#8208;Mediated Cysteine Arylation: A Bioorthogonal Platform for Covalent Targeting of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclometalated Au(III) complexes have been designed to rapidly and selectively arylate cysteine residues within intrinsically disordered protein regions, enabling covalent labeling of previously &#8220;undruggable&#8221; cysteines. This gold&#8208;based platform expands the accessible cysteinome for proteome&#8208;wide profiling and offers new opportunities for targeting disordered proteins.








Abstract
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) remain largely inaccessible to covalent chemical tools due to their structural plasticity and lack of defined pockets. We introduce a bioorthogonal cyclometalated gold(III) platform of monodentate phosphine&#8208;supported AuP1&#8208;8 complexes that selectively and irreversibly arylate cysteine residues via enhanced Lewis acidity. This platform enables targeting of low&#8208;reactivity, buried, or dynamically disordered cysteines across the human proteome. Chemoproteomic, structural, and computational analyses establish an expanded ligandable cysteinome, including transiently helical LLCLL motifs in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Our findings establish a new class of metal&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal reagents for proteome&#8208;wide cysteine labeling, functional interrogation of disordered proteins, and future therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Twisted Intramolecular Charge Transfer (TICT) Dyes into Bright Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile supramolecular strategy to transform environment&#8208;sensitive twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes into bright fluorophores with retained large Stokes shifts in aqueous media is reported. By embedding TICT dyes within a rigid microdomain provided by a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold, nonradiative decay pathways, particularly the TICT process, are effectively suppressed, leading to enhanced radiative emission.








Abstract
Twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) dyes are promising candidates for bioimaging and sensing due to their environment&#8208;sensitive fluorescence and large Stokes shifts. However, their inherently low fluorescence quantum yields in aqueous media have limited their practical applications. Here, we present a general supramolecular strategy to transform a broad range of TICT dyes into bright fluorophores with large Stokes shifts. By noncovalently dispersing the dyes into the rigid microdomain of a cyclic peptide&#8208;based supramolecular scaffold in water, the formation of the non&#8208;radiative TICT state is effectively suppressed. The resulting supramolecular TICT dyes exhibit dramatically enhanced fluorescence quantum yields (up to 42.3%), while preserving large Stokes shifts of up to 107&#160;nm. Particularly, supramolecular TICT dyes emitting in the NIR region display excellent photostability, enabling applications in long&#8208;term bioimaging and single&#8208;excitation multi&#8208;color imaging in live cells. This work offers a versatile and modular supramolecular approach to generate high&#8208;performance fluorophores from otherwise low&#8208; or non&#8208;emissive TICT dyes, greatly broadening their potential in biological and optical applications.

A silica&#8208;anchored cobaloxime catalyst enables efficient seawater electrolysis and energy storage. Coupled with photovoltaics and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries, this multifunctional system delivers continuous green H2 production, offering a scalable and sustainable pathway for renewable fuel generation. 








Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven seawater electrolysis presents a sustainable method for producing high&#8208;purity green hydrogen to address the energy crisis. Developing a robust electrocatalyst for seawater splitting is crucial for green fuel production with solar integration. This study introduces a silica&#8208;anchored cobaloxime system as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for overall seawater splitting in conjunction with photovoltaic cells. The system achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen generation efficiency of 14%, a power conversion efficiency of 17.4%, and a round&#8208;trip energy efficiency of 80%. A single&#8208;stack electrolyser using this catalyst produces an average of 0.82&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 of green hydrogen and 0.44&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 of oxygen, with a hydrogen conversion efficiency of approximately 80&#160;kWh kg&#8722;1 under natural sunlight. The same catalyst also shows bidirectional O2 reduction and evolution activity, enabling solar energy storage through a rechargeable zinc&#8211;air battery (RZAB). A photovoltaic&#8208;RZAB&#8208;electrolyser triad was established for indirect green hydrogen production using stored renewable energy. The catalyst&#8208;containing RZAB system is effectively charged by a photovoltaic (PV)&#160;cell, achieving 25% energy efficiency, and facilitates seawater splitting without sunlight at an energy conversion efficiency of 84%. The strategic application of the catalyst as a multifunctional electrocatalyst enables sustainable green hydrogen production both during the day and night under practical conditions.

A study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and stability of Fe incorporation into porous Si catalysts for the acidic ORR.



Abstract
Developing non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based catalysts as alternatives to precious metals for the 4 electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions is crucial in advancing practical proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) technology. A significant challenge in designing these electrocatalysts is to suppress metal leaching and optimize the adsorption and dissociation free energy of oxygen intermediates during the reaction. Herein, a carbon&#8208;encapsulated porous silicon (Si) featuring single iron (Fe) sites was developed as an effective ORR catalyst through a one&#8208;step thermal reduction process using silica nanoparticles as precursors. This catalyst exhibited both impressive activity with half&#8208;wave potentials (E1/2) of 0.88&#160;V and 0.95&#160;V, alongside robust stability showing minimal decay of 7 and 4&#160;mV after 40,000 potential cycles under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Additionally, as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs, it reached a peak power density of 0.63&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in a 1.0&#160;bar H2&#8211;O2 condition, while maintaining notable durability at a constant potential of 0.5&#160;V over a duration of 100 h. Spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that iron atoms were effectively integrated into the crystal lattice of porous Si, resulting in the formation of stable Si&#9472;Fe bonds that inhibited the leaching of Fe and the formation of *OOH intermediates, thereby enhancing the ORR performance. This approach facilitates the design of efficient and stable ORR catalysts, which hold significant implications for the advancement of next&#8208;generation PEMFCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing non-noble metal-based catalysts as alternatives to precious metals for the 4 electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic conditions is crucial in advancing practical proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) technology. A significant challenge in designing these electrocatalysts is to suppress metal leaching and optimize the adsorption and dissociation free energy of oxygen intermediates during the reaction. Herein, a carbon-encapsulated porous silicon (Si) featuring single iron (Fe) sites was developed as an effective ORR catalyst through a one-step thermal reduction process using silica nanoparticles as precursors. This catalyst exhibited both impressive activity with half-wave potentials (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.88&#160;V and 0.95&#160;V, alongside robust stability showing minimal decay of 7 and 4&#160;mV after 40,000 potential cycles under acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Additionally, as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs, it reached a peak power density of 0.63&#160;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a 1.0&#160;bar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; condition, while maintaining notable durability at a constant potential of 0.5&#160;V over a duration of 100 h. Spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrated that iron atoms were effectively integrated into the crystal lattice of porous Si, resulting in the formation of stable Si&#9472;Fe bonds that inhibited the leaching of Fe and the formation of *OOH intermediates, thereby enhancing the ORR performance. This approach facilitates the design of efficient and stable ORR catalysts, which hold significant implications for the advancement of next-generation PEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemically Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops mechanochemically induced circularly polarized luminescence (MICPL) in polymers by integrating achiral mechanophores into chiral polymer networks, where mechanical compression triggers fluorophore release and aggregation with chirality transfer, enabling tunable CPL colors, including white light and potential as stress&#8208;reporting probes.








Abstract
Achieving diversified optical signals in polymer mechanochemistry remains a significant challenge, particularly within the area of light polarization. This work pioneers the development of mechanochemically induced circularly polarized luminescence (MICPL) in polymers. We have designed crosslinked polymer networks by photopolymerizing achiral mechanophores (Diels&#8211;Alder adducts of maleimide and anthracene derivatives) with the chiral monomer L(&#8208;)&#8208;bornyl acrylate (LBA). Mechanical compression triggers the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of the mechanophores, releasing fluorophores. Crucially, the applied force simultaneously promotes the aggregation of these released fluorophores and transfers the nonreciprocal chirality inherent in the compressed chiral polymer matrix (PLBA) to these aggregates, resulting in bright, force&#8208;dependent CPL emission with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor of up to 10&#8722;2. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated with a series of mechanophores with varying electronic structures and copolymer matrix, enabling tunable CPL colors spanning from blue&#8208;violet to green to yellow&#8211;orange, and a ternary system achieving white CPL. The MICPL property was retained in copolymer systems (e.g., copolymers with achiral monomer methyl acrylate), demonstrating its potential as a macromolecular chiral optical probe for multimodal stress reporting. These findings resolve questions about mechanical force&#8208;regulated chirality and offer a platform for on&#8208;demand CPL materials.

Two small molecules, L8&#8208;CT and L8&#8208;2CT, were designed by gradually replacing the end group of L8&#8208;BO from an electron acceptor to electron donor. The introduction of L8&#8208;2CT significantly enhances the donor&#8211;acceptor molecular percolation at the interface, so that enabling auxiliary charge generation and transport pathways. The PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;2CT ternary device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 20.33%, with simultaneously enhanced photostability.








Abstract
The commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs) is limited by bottlenecks including relatively high voltage loss, insufficient donor&#8211;acceptor interfacial charge generation, and morphological instability. Traditional approaches of interfacial regulation usually struggle with unmatching energetic landscape and/or molecular compatibility. In this study, two small molecules, L8&#8208;CT and L8&#8208;2CT are designed and synthesized by end&#8208;group substitution of the star nonfullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO, gradually switching it from electron acceptor to electron donor. Moreover, L8&#8208;2CT with full end&#8208;group substitution exhibits exceptional compatibility/miscibility with both donor (PM6) and acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) in the ternary blend. The tight molecular packing between L8&#8208;2CT and L8&#8208;BO also reduces exciton diffusion time by an order of magnitude compared to PM6:L8&#8208;BO. The introduction of L8&#8208;2CT significantly enhances the donor&#8211;acceptor molecular percolation at the interface so that enabling auxiliary charge generation and transport pathways, thereby boosting the interfacial charge generation efficiency and morphology stability. Therefore, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;2CT ternary device achieves a remarkable efficiency of 20.33%, with simultaneously enhanced photostability. This achievement fundamentally challenges the traditional design paradigms for third components in ternary OSCs.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Prediction of Ground&#8208; and Excited&#8208;State Redox Potentials in Iridium(III) Photocatalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven framework integrating density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) predicts ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials of Ir(III) photocatalysts. Unified models enable interpretable structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis and efficient virtual screening, supporting rational molecular design for advanced photoredox catalysis.








Abstract
This study introduces a data&#8208;driven framework that combines DFT calculations with machine learning to facilitate accurate and scalable predictions of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state redox potentials for iridium(III) photocatalysts. We first constructed independent models to identify key geometric and electronic descriptors governing redox behavior. Shapley additive explanations&#8208;based analyses revealed clear structure&#8211;activity relationships, offering mechanistic insights and rational guidance for tuning redox potentials. Based on these insights, we developed unified multi&#8208;output models&#8212;Model G for ground&#8208;state and Model E for excited&#8208;state redox potentials&#8212;to enable rapid, cost&#8208;effective, and high&#8208;throughput predictions. By modeling oxidation and reduction processes within a shared descriptor space, we can reduce computational overhead while maintaining high predictive accuracy. To assess cross&#8208;metal generalizability, residual transfer learning was applied to osmium (Os) photocatalysts. Using feature&#8208;similar complexes, the resulting transfer models (G&#8208;T, E&#8208;T) achieved performance comparable to Os&#8208;only baselines, demonstrating efficient few&#8208;shot cross&#8208;metal transfer. Collectively, this study establishes an interpretable and transferable machine&#8208;learning framework for photocatalyst discovery. This framework provides a foundation for large&#8208;scale screening and rational design across diverse transition&#8208;metal platforms, accelerating advancements in photoredox catalysis, solar fuel production, and broader sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Catalytic Non&#8208;Oxidative C&#8211;C Coupling of Benzene to Biphenyl Over Sub&#8208;Nanostructured Europium Hydride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a sub&#8208;nanostructured europium hydride catalyst supported on MgO which enables direct benzene coupling to produce biphenyl under mild conditions (&#8804;&#160;150&#160;&#176;C). Mechanistic studies reveal that the crucial role of hydride species for C&#9472;H bond activation and C&#9472;C construction in the catalytic cycle, which is fundamentally different from the conventional aryl&#8211;aryl coupling routes. 








Abstract
Catalytic coupling of benzene to biphenyl through direct C&#9472;H bond activation and C&#9472;C bond construction represents an ideal, atom&#8208;economical strategy, offering a streamlined alternative to classical multi&#8208;step functionalization approaches, and thus has been a long&#8208;sought after goal. Herein, we report that such a pathway can be realized over a sub&#8208;nanostructured europium hydride (Eu&#8211;H) catalyst under mild condition. The Eu&#8211;H catalyst achieved a biphenyl production of 53.7&#160;mmol&#160;gEu&#8722;1 with a turnover number (TON) of 16.3 over 144&#160;h at 150&#160;&#176;C. Mechanistic studies suggest that hydride species (H&#8722;) in Eu&#8211;H preferentially deprotonate benzene to form a [C6H5&#8211;Eu] intermediate, which subsequently undergoes nucleophilic attack on another benzene molecule, resulting in biphenyl formation and regeneration of the Eu&#8211;H species to complete the catalytic cycle. This work not only provides a strategy for benzene coupling to biphenyl but also demonstrates the promising role of hydrides in transforming arenes into value&#8208;added molecules.

         <title>Closing Electron Transfer Loop to Boost Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The closed&#8208;loop electron transfer strategy employing fullerene (C60) achieves synergistic coupling of electrochemical and chemical processes through its reversible redox mediation, effectively suppressing over&#8208;reduction of Cu active sites. The generated fullerene anions (C60&#8319;&#8722;) spontaneously reduce nitrate to nitrite while regenerating C60, bypassing the thermodynamic rate&#8208;limiting step and optimizing the electrocatalytic reaction pathway of urea synthesis.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling of carbon dioxide and nitrate presents a promising approach for environmentally friendly urea synthesis. In this work, we propose a strategy to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis by coupling the electrochemical and chemical steps. Utilizing fullerene (C60) as a redox&#8208;active electron mediator during the electrochemical reduction process, we effectively inhibit the irreversible reduction deactivation of positively charged copper (Cu&#948;+) active sites. The electron&#8208;accepting fullerene form ions (C60n&#8211;) that engage in a spontaneous chemical redox reaction with nitrate ions, producing nitrite ions and regenerating neutral C60 (C60n&#8211; + NO3&#8211; &#8594; C60&#160;+&#160;NO2&#8211;). This recycling mechanism closes the electron transfer loop while optimizing the overall reaction pathway. The urea yield rate is dramatically increased to 385.9&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, accompanied by long&#8208;term durability. Our findings provide a valuable framework for designing highly efficient electrocatalyst for coupling reactions, advancing the field of sustainable urea synthesis.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastics into Carboxylic Acids for Biodegradable Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biodegradable surfactants have now been created from post&#8208;consumer waste HDPE. High conversion (&gt;80%) is maintained throughout all major process steps including pyrolysis, hydroformylation, and oxidation. The utility of the plastic&#8208;derived carboxylate surfactant is confirmed via critical micelle concentration, surface tension, and foaming measurements.








Abstract
This work outlines a process for producing high&#8208;purity (&gt;95%) carboxylate surfactants from post&#8208;consumer recycled high&#8208;density polyethylene (PCR&#8208;HDPE). The approach involves the thermal depolymerization of PCR&#8208;HDPE via pyrolysis, followed by fractional distillation to isolate C9&#8211;C14 olefins. These olefins undergo hydroformylation using cobalt carbonyl catalysts to generate aldehydes, which are subsequently oxidized to carboxylic acids using Pinnick oxidation under mild aqueous&#8208;phase conditions. Neutralization of the resulting carboxylic acids with sodium hydroxide produces plastic&#8208;derived carboxylate surfactants (PDCs) in the form of sodium carboxylates. Subsequent purification steps ensure surfactant&#8208;grade purity and enable accurate assessment of physicochemical properties. The resulting PDCs are evaluated for critical micelle concentration (CMC), foamability, surface tension reduction, and calcium ion tolerance, demonstrating competitive behavior with conventional anionic carboxylate surfactants. This route provides a sustainable alternative for surfactant production, reducing reliance on fossil&#8208;derived feedstocks and valorizing plastic waste streams through chemical upcycling.

         <title>Enhancing NMR Signals in Liquids by Fluorine&#8208;19 Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) and Hyperpolarization Transfer to Carbon&#8208;13</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine nuclear spins can be hyperpolarized in solution by Overhauser dynamic nuclear polarization from a paramagnetic agent like galvinoxyl. This hyperpolarization can be transferred by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to nearby 13C, leading to 13C signal enhancements up to &#8764;100. The method opens new opportunities for NMR structural determination of fluorine&#8208;containing drugs and synthetic molecules.








Abstract
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) plays an essential role in life and material science but suffers from low sensitivity due to the small energy differences it aims to detect. Therefore, techniques that can increase spin polarization, and thus sensitivity, in NMR are gaining tremendous attention. Overhauser effect dynamic nuclear polarization (OE&#8208;DNP) can increase multidimensional NMR signals of small molecules in liquid solutions; however, at high magnetic fields, the direct mechanism to 13C is site selective, while it is poorly efficient for 1H. Here, we report OE&#8208;DNP hyperpolarization of fluorine&#8208;19 (19F) nuclei at 9.4&#160;T, thus expanding the methodological toolbox of 19F NMR. Signal enhancements up to &#8764;20 under steady&#8208;state conditions can be used to either rapidly detect 19F resonances or to enhance through&#8208;bond J&#8208;coupled 13C nuclei by two orders of magnitude. The latter corresponds to a 104 gain in signal acquisition. We demonstrate this with 19F&#8594;13C INEPT (insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer) spectra of the drug flutrimazole at 13C natural abundance, where quaternary carbons become readily detectable, opening perspectives for accelerated NMR on fluorinated drugs or small molecules. The results are corroborated by a theoretical analysis of 19F OE&#8208;DNP coupling factors.

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Ultrarigid Chiral Styrenes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Unconventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig Cyclization/Carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;Enynes</title>

Atroposelective synthesis of ultrastable chiral styrenes: An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;enynes to configurationally ultrastable axially chiral styrenes was reported for the first time. This protocol demonstrates broad substrate scope, accommodating various nucleophiles, including alcohols, water, and amines, to access diverse axially chiral styrene&#8208;based esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. Mechanistic studies revealed an unexpected Pd&#8211;hydride&#8208;triggered 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway.








Abstract
Axially chiral styrenes represent a promising class of atropisomers with broad potential in asymmetric catalysis, drug discovery, and materials science. However, their catalytic asymmetric synthesis remains underdeveloped due to the conformational flexibility and inherently low rotational barriers. Herein, we report a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/carbonylation of 1,5&#8208;enynes that enables efficient access to a series of configurationally ultrastable axially chiral styrenes in good to high yields (up to 88%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99.5/0.5&#160;er). Key to success is the strategic design of an ortho&#8208;alkyne&#8208;substituted styrene substrate that favors olefin&#8208;first Pd&#8211;hydride insertion, followed by unconventional 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization and carbonylation. This protocol exhibits broad nucleophile compatibility, including alcohols, water, and amines, enabling the modular synthesis of diverse chiral styrene&#8208;based esters, carboxylic acids, and amides. The resulting conformationally rigid product was further transformed into an axially chiral monophosphine ligand, which demonstrated high efficiency in asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic investigations support a Pd&#8211;hydride insertion&#8211;cyclization&#8211;carbonylation sequence. This transformation provides a powerful platform for the asymmetric synthesis and application of axially chiral styrenes.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Allenylic Fluorides Enabled by Multiple Radical Sorting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric multiple&#8208;radical sorting strategy enables the synthesis of axially chiral allenylic fluorides from 1,3&#8208;enynes, fluoroiodomethane, and alkyl bromides. The protocol shows broad functional group tolerance and excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity, providing an efficient platform for constructing fluorine&#8208;containing axial chirality.








Abstract
Here, we disclose a nickel&#8208;catalyzed, three&#8208;component asymmetric radical sorting strategy that enables the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral allenylic fluorides from readily available 1,3&#8208;enynes, fluoroiodomethane, and alkyl bromides. This radical protocol proceeds under mild, reductive conditions, accommodates a broad range of functional groups, including those found in complex bioactive molecules, and demonstrates high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. A previously unrecognized fluorine effect proved essential in dictating both reactivity and stereocontrol in this multicomponent radical coupling. This discovery establishes an efficient protocol for enantioselective multiple radical sorting and provides a modular platform for the catalytic synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing axial chirality.

         <title>Donor&#8722;&#960;&#8722;Acceptor Conjugated Polymeric Photocatalyst for Efficient Deep Oxidation of NO Facilitated by Strong Asymmetric Local Electric Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>

Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymeric catalyst by covalently incorporating ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets with &#960;&#8211;pyrene&#8211;&#960; molecules displayed strong asymmetric local electric field, which enables facilitated exciton dissociation, accelerated charge transfer kinetics, and offers dual adsorption sites for capture O2 and NO for highly selective and deep photocatalytic oxidization of NO at ppb levels to NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of low&#8208;concentration NOx into NO3&#8722; is limited by strong exciton effects, rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, and lack of localized bonding sites of oxygen species in catalysts. Directed enrichment of charge carriers and reactants (O2 and NO) at active sites is essential for achieving high&#8208;performance photocatalytic NO removal. Herein, a donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) conjugated polymeric catalyst was engineered by covalently incorporating ultrathin carbon nitride nanosheets with electron&#8208;donating &#960;&#8211;pyrene&#8211;&#960; molecules, which achieves an exceptional 82.2% NO elimination and 94.9% selectivity toward ionic products (NO3&#8722; sel. of 75.9%) with stable operation over 1000 mins, outperforming the previously reported carbon nitride photocatalysts. Rapidly reduces NO levels below safe concentration in a simulated environment chamber was also achieved. The generated asymmetric local electric field in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A conjugated polymeric catalyst through intramolecular charge transfer between electron&#8208;accepting heptazine rings and electron&#8208;donating pyrene units facilitates exciton dissociation, accelerating charge transfer kinetics, and offer dual adsorption sites for capture O2 and NO, thus favoring the O2 activation for highly selective oxidization of NO to NO3&#8722;. This work highlights the pivotal role of asymmetric local electric fields in D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A architectures for advancing efficient photocatalytic NO oxidation.

         <title>Reversible Zn2+&#8208;Activated Channel Transport Through Monomer&#8208;Dimer Interconversion of Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biological Zn2+&#8208;gated channels, we developed a [2]rotaxane&#8208;based artificial ion channel. It features a K+&#8208;transporting sliding ring and a terpyridine unit that enables reversible Zn2+&#8208;dependent switching between carrier and channel states, offering a novel design for gated biomimetic transporters.








Abstract
Inspired by natural ligand&#8208;gated ion channels, artificial counterparts are of great interest for understanding biological transport mechanisms and developing bioinspired functional systems. Here, we report a Zn2+&#8208;activated artificial ion channel from a [2]rotaxane. Its key components are: i) a sliding bis(benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) unit for K&#8314; transport and ii) a Zn2+&#8208;responsive terpyridine thread that provides gating control. The monomeric rotaxane functions as an inactive carrier, whereas Zn2+&#8208;induced dimerization triggers a switch to a highly efficient channel transport mode. This transition is fully reversible with Zn2+ and competitive ligands. As the first biomimetic Zn2+&#8208;gated artificial ion channel, this work provides a novel design strategy for ligand&#8208;regulated transmembrane transporters.

         <title>Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alcohol Derivatives with Chlorosilanes via Pyridines&#8208;Promoted Si&#9472;Cl Activation</title>

This work presents a new approach to access silyl radicals via pyridines&#8208;promoted reductive activation of chlorosilanes using magnesium, and demonstrates its application in the reductive cross&#8208;coupling with benzyl, allyl, and propargyl ethers, providing an efficient and step&#8208;economical route for synthesizing diverse benzyl&#8208;, allyl&#8208;, and allenylsilanes. 








Abstract
The development of efficient approaches mediated by silyl radicals for constructing C&#9472;Si bonds is of great interest and importance, yet methods to generate these intermediates from readily available chlorosilanes remain scarce. Herein, we report a new strategy for silyl radical generation via pyridines&#8208;promoted reductive Si&#9472;Cl activation of chlorosilanes and demonstrate its application in the reductive cross&#8208;coupling with a wide array of benzyl, allyl, and propargyl alcohol derivatives. This protocol offers an efficient and step&#8208;economical route for the synthesis of diverse benzyl&#8208;, allyl&#8208;, and allenylsilanes, featuring broad substrate scope and easy scalability. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the coupling reaction was initiated by the reductive Si&#9472;Cl activation of chlorosilanes with magnesium promoted by pyridine derivatives, which generates silyl radicals. These silyl radicals subsequently mediate the deoxygenation of alcohol derivatives to form carbon radicals, culminating in C&#9472;Si radical&#8211;radical cross&#8208;coupling.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component Dearomative Coupling of Bromoarenes: Modular Construction of Terpenoid Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, enantioselective three&#8208;component dearomative coupling of bromoarenes, silyldiazomethane, and malonates has been developed. This method employs a newly designed chiral ligand to efficiently construct 1,4&#8208;disubstituted hydrogenated naphthalenes, providing a concise and versatile strategy for the synthesis of terpenoid natural products. 








Abstract
We report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric three&#8208;component coupling of bromoarenes, diazoalkanes, and malonates. It represents a significant advancement in catalytic enantioselective dearomative 1,4&#8208;difunctionalization of unactivated arenes. A palladium catalyst of a novel phosphoramidite enables a domino reaction consisting of enantiofacial aryl insertion of a bound diazoalkane and regioselective and stereospecific allylic substitution. The new reaction was readily applied in short total syntheses of three terpenoids, including (+)&#8208;erogorgiaene, (&#8722;)&#8208;7&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydrocadalin, and (&#8722;)&#8208;odongrossin C. Mechanistic studies establish that stereocontrol arises from a concerted aryl migration/N2 extrusion, which forms the key cyclic &#960;&#8208;allyl palladium intermediate. The C4&#8208;regioselectivity of the malonate attack is governed by a combination of ligand effects, silyl group sterics, and stabilizing noncovalent interactions between the naphthyl ring and sodium malonate.

This method employs a newly designed chiral ligand to efficiently construct 1,4-disubstituted hydrogenated naphthalenes, providing a concise and versatile strategy for the synthesis of terpenoid natural products. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a palladium-catalyzed asymmetric three-component coupling of bromoarenes, diazoalkanes, and malonates. It represents a significant advancement in catalytic enantioselective dearomative 1,4-difunctionalization of unactivated arenes. A palladium catalyst of a novel phosphoramidite enables a domino reaction consisting of enantiofacial aryl insertion of a bound diazoalkane and regioselective and stereospecific allylic substitution. The new reaction was readily applied in short total syntheses of three terpenoids, including (+)-erogorgiaene, (&#8722;)-7-hydroxy-3,4-dihydrocadalin, and (&#8722;)-odongrossin C. Mechanistic studies establish that stereocontrol arises from a concerted aryl migration/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extrusion, which forms the key cyclic &#960;-allyl palladium intermediate. The C4-regioselectivity of the malonate attack is governed by a combination of ligand effects, silyl group sterics, and stabilizing noncovalent interactions between the naphthyl ring and sodium malonate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatial Confinement of Solution&#8208;Inaccessible Single&#8208;Site Cu(I) in a Molecular Titanium&#8211;Oxo Cage for Efficient Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular titanium&#8211;oxide cage, Ti16O24Bz24 (Bz = benzoate), featuring a &#8764;1 nm internal cavity and a hydrophobic Bz ligand shell, is developed to encapsulate a spatially confined Cu+ single&#8208;atom site, enabling the Ti16Cu2 catalyst to achieve high activity and selectivity for photoelectrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722;. 








Abstract
We introduce a precisely engineered molecular titanium&#8208;oxo cage, Ti16O24Bz24 (denoted as Ti16; Bz = C6H5CO2), designed to host a spatially confined Cu+ single&#8208;atom site, that enables efficient and selective C&#9472;N coupling from CO2 and NO3&#8722; under photo&#8208;electrocatalytic (PEC) conditions, providing a molecular&#8208;level blueprint for multi&#8208;reactant coupling catalysis. Ti16 features a large internal cavity assembled from TiO6 octahedra shielded by a hydrophobic benzoate shell. Metalation of Ti16 with CuCl2/NaBH4 incorporates Cu+ ions, displacing encapsulated H3O+ and enabling the synthesis of Ti16Cux (x = 0.25&#8211;8). Among the Ti16Cux series, Ti16Cu2 demonstrates optimal performance under PEC conditions, achieving a high urea yield of 20 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 85% and a selectivity of 62% at &#8722;0.6 V versus RHE, outperforming most reported Cu&#8208;based systems. Spectroscopic and structural analyses reveal that C&#9472;N bond formation occurs via coupling of *CO and *NO species at the confined Cu sites, highlighting the essential role of the molecular cage in stabilizing reactive species and facilitating their interaction. This work establishes cage&#8208;like metal&#8211;oxo clusters as an atomically precise and versatile molecular platform for developing highly selective single&#8208;atom catalysts for challenging multi&#8208;reactant coupling reactions.

         <title>A Band&#8208;Orientation Co&#8208;Anchoring Strategy for the Design of a High&#8208;Performance Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A band&#8208;orientation co&#8208;anchoring strategy is proposed for the rational design of high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. A new mid&#8208;infrared NLO Rb3ZnV4O12Br crystal was successfully obtained by integrating d0&#8208;TM tetrahedral [VO4] into the KBBF design platform, which exhibits a strong second&#8208;harmonic generation effect, high laser damage threshold, wide bandgap, broad transmission window, moderate birefringence and favorable growth habit.








Abstract
Mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals have long been pursued, yet the realization of a balance among key performance metrics remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we propose a band&#8208;orientation co&#8208;anchoring strategy to precisely regulate the band structures and module spatial arrangement for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MIR NLO crystals. Leveraging the deep&#8208;ultraviolet NLO KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) as a template, a novel MIR NLO Rb3ZnV4O12Br (RZVB) crystal was successfully obtained through multimodule substitution. Importantly, the tailored tetrahedral hybridization mode effectively anchors the conduction band minimum&#8212;dominated by d0 cations&#8212;at a higher energy level and suppresses d&#8211;d transitions. Concurrently, structural confinement within the KBBF&#8208;derived lattice enforces the optimal alignment of distorted tetrahedra. Furthermore, RZVB displays an unprecedented second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement mechanism, arising from a unique cross&#8208;module electron transfer. Consequently, RZVB exhibits superior linear and NLO performances, including a wide bandgap (3.25&#160;eV), high laser threshold damage (1.07 GW/cm2@1064&#160;nm), broad transmission window (0.382&#8211;7.6 &#181;m), moderate birefringence (0.06@589.3&#160;nm) and the strongest SHG response (7.7&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP@1064&#160;nm and 1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;AGS@2.09 &#181;m) among vanadates with bandgap exceeding 3&#160;eV. This work presents a high&#8208;performance MIR NLO crystal and establishes a bottom&#8208;up, broadly applicable design paradigm for the tailored development of next&#8208;generation crystalline materials.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Calix[4]arenes via Catalytic Asymmetric Lower&#8208;Rim Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inherently chiral calix[4]arenes (ICCs) were synthesized via asymmetric lower&#8208;rim functionalization. In this approach, chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) organocatalysis, with vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) serving as pivotal intermediates, enables stepwise asymmetric halo&#8208;cyclization. A diverse library of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes featuring multiple C&#9472;C axial stereogenic axes with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities is obtained.








Abstract
We report herein an efficient approach for the enantioselective synthesis of inherently chiral calix[4]arenes (ICCs) via chiral phosphoric acid (CPA)&#8208;catalyzed lower&#8208;rim asymmetric functionalization. With vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) as the key intermediates, a stepwise asymmetric halo&#8208;cyclization strategy was applied to construct diverse inherently chiral calix[4]arenes bearing multiple C&#9472;C axially stereogenic elements with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (up to 96% ee, all d.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;20:1). The obtained lower&#8208;rim functionalized products underwent further photocatalytic transformations to access novel inherently chiral naphthofuran&#8208;based calix[4]arene architectures. Further synthetic modifications and analysis of their photophysical/chiroptical properties demonstrated their potential in optoelectronic materials and related fields. Mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds via a stepwise process, with the stereoselectivity&#8208;determining step occurring in the first VQMs&#8208;mediated cyclization, and the second step constituting a chiral transfer process.

Cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;anchored copper (CB[6]&#8208;Cu) is reported as a stable single&#8208;site catalyst, achieving a 95.39% Faradaic efficiency for C2H4 at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in electrocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation (EAH). The single&#8208;Cu&#8208;site and adjacent cavity structure facilitates optimal reactant coverage and disrupted hydrogen bonding, suppressing side reactions. The general applicability of this strategy is shown with CB[6]&#8208;Co for hydroxylamine synthesis.








Abstract
Controlling mass transfer and adsorption in single&#8208;site catalysts is critical for the activity and selectivity of heterogeneous electrocatalytic hydrogenation, but structural fragility at large current densities (&#8805;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) makes their practical application challenging. Here, taking acetylene (C2H2) hydrogenation to ethylene (C2H4) as an example, cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;coordinated copper (CB[6]&#8208;Cu) is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to be the desired carbonyl&#8208;anchoring isolated Cu site with engineered mass transport. CB[6]&#8208;Cu demonstrates an outstanding Faradaic efficiency of 95.4% for C2H4, which significantly suppresses the competitive coupling and hydrogen evolution reactions at 300&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, with a turnover frequency of 2.91 s&#8722;1 and 65&#160;h of continuous stable operation. The distinctive C2H2 adsorption configuration and broken hydrogen bond network are revealed to result in optimal coverage and a sufficient supply of C2H2 feedstocks, accounting for the remarkable C2H4 performance. The extended CB[6]&#8208;Co also exhibits enhanced NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH2OH electrosynthesis performance, highlighting its potential.

Pd&#8208;catalyzed reaction of homoallylic amides with phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) under Pd(II) catalysis delivers 6&#8208;acetoxylated 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazines through the formation of one C&#9472;C and two C&#9472;O bonds.








Abstract
We report a Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed migratory triple functionalization of terminal alkenes. The reaction of homoallylic amides with phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA) under Pd(II) catalysis delivers 6&#8208;acetoxylated 5,6&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3&#8208;oxazines through the formation of one C&#9472;C and two C&#9472;O bonds. Mechanistic studies suggest a sequence involving oxypalladation, oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), a 1,2&#8208;alkyl(aryl)/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement (DR), and subsequent acetoxylation. While Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis with PIDA as the oxidant has enabled numerous powerful transformations, the DR reported here is unprecedented.

         <title>Directional Electron Transfer in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Heteroleptic Metallacages for Enhanced Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the design of porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages that mediate directional photoinduced electron transfer for efficient confined photocatalysis. One of the metallacages, constructed via multicomponent self&#8208;assembly, incorporate electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine ligands that enhance charge separation and superoxide generation, leading to improved photocatalytic activity in the visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates.








Abstract
The rational design of supramolecular architectures capable of mediating directional photoinduced electron transfer (PET) remains a central challenge in confined photocatalysis. Herein, we report two porphyrin&#8208;based heteroleptic metallacages, constructed via multicomponent coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, for the visible light&#8208;driven oxidative coupling of tetraorganoborates. Both metallacages feature well&#8208;defined, positively charged cavities that enable selective substrate encapsulation and efficient catalytic turnover. In particular, one metallacage incorporates electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine units that engage in directional interligand PET with the porphyrin moieties, as supported by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This intramolecular PET promotes long&#8208;lived charge separation and enhances superoxide anion generation, resulting in markedly improved photocatalytic activity compared to control systems lacking donor&#8211;acceptor motifs. This study demonstrates a modular strategy for integrating electron donor and acceptor functionalities within a single supramolecular scaffold and highlights the potential of PET&#8208;enhanced cage&#8208;based photocatalysis, providing a versatile platform for sustainable light&#8208;driven chemical transformations.

         <title>Carbonothioate&#8208;Triggered Cascade Cyclization Enables High&#8208;Specificity Fluorescence Imaging of Hydrogen Polysulfides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonothioate&#8208;triggered cascade cyclization strategy enabled near&#8208;infrared probe CTP&#8208;8 for highly selective hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn) sensing. It achieves first&#8208;ever imaging of H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant live cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. The trigger is adaptable to diverse phenolic hydroxyl&#8208;containing fluorophores, providing a modular platform for future probes.








Abstract
Hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn; n&#160;&gt;&#160;1) are critical redox signaling molecules. While the biological functions of H2Sn have received much attention, their exact action mechanisms are still poorly understood due to the lack of reliable detection methods. In this context, fluorescent probes for H2Sn are emerging as powerful chemical tools to aid in unraveling its contributions to biology. Currently, most available H2Sn probes are prone to interference from biothiols or hydrogen sulfide (H2S). To address this challenge, herein, we report a unique carbonothioate&#8208;based trigger utilizing a cascade cyclization reaction for specific detection of H2Sn. Using this strategy, eight new fluorescent probes (CTP 1&#8211;8) were prepared and evaluated. Among them, CTP&#8208;8 not only enables highly sensitive and selective detection of H2Sn but also allows visualization of H2Sn fluctuations in living cells and mice. Significantly, we demonstrate for the first time the fluorescence imaging of endogenous H2Sn dynamics in insulin&#8208;resistant cells and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Besides, this carbonothioate&#8208;based trigger could also be potentially utilized in other fluorescent dye scaffolds that possess an optically tunable phenolic hydroxyl group. This work provides a useful approach for further investigations of H2Sn biology as well as future probe development.

         <title>Superatomic or Not? A Case Study on Isostructural Au3Ag2 and Au3Cu2 Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural nanoclusters, [Au3Ag2(Ppy3)6](NO3)3 (Au3Ag2) and [Au3Cu2(Ppy3)6](BF4)3 (Au3Cu2), are synthesized, and they demonstrate different stability. Calculations show that Au3Ag2 is the smallest well&#8208;defined superatom, while Au3Cu2 with identical electron count is nonsuperatomic. This contrast underscores how doping governs electronic structures and stability, offering new insights into the superatom model.








Abstract
Two bimetal nanoclusters, [Au3Ag2(Ppy3)6](NO3)3 (Au3Ag2) and [Au3Cu2(Ppy3)6](BF4)3 (Au3Cu2) have been synthesized with tri(2&#8208;pyridyl)phosphine (Ppy3). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis reveals that both have trigonal bipyramidal structures with three Au atoms at the waist and Ag/Cu atoms at the top and bottom vertices. Au3Ag2 demonstrates much better stability than Au3Cu2 in solution. Theoretical calculations indicate that Au3Ag2 is the smallest well&#8208;defined superatom while Au3Cu2 is nonsuperatomic, even though they are isostructural and have the same number of valence electrons.

&lt;p&gt;Two isostructural nanoclusters, [Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ppy&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;](NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/b&gt;), are synthesized, and they demonstrate different stability. Calculations show that &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is the smallest well-defined superatom, while &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with identical electron count is nonsuperatomic. This contrast underscores how doping governs electronic structures and stability, offering new insights into the superatom model.

&lt;/b&gt; in solution. Theoretical calculations indicate that &lt;b&gt;Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/b&gt; is nonsuperatomic, even though they are isostructural and have the same number of valence electrons. This work highlights the influence of atom doping on the electronic structures and superatomic properties of metal nanoclusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;engineered MOFs with various interpenetrated degrees/modes enable precise modulation of porosity/stability. Among them, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb and Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn exhibit improved C2H2 uptake, while Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan shows rotor&#8208;driven stimuli&#8208;responsive gating effect at 195&#160;K. Breakthrough experiments confirm Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb achieves one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90, v/v/v) mixture with new benchmark productivity.








Abstract
Efficient separation of challenging acetylene/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) and acetylene/carbon dioxide (C2H2/CO2) mixtures is crucial for the chemical industry. Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold significant promise for separating complex gas mixtures but often face a trade&#8208;off between porosity and stability. Herein, three different entangled degrees and modes of MOFs, namely Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn, and Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan, were yielded by the crystal engineering strategy using molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;based co&#8208;ligands (benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene groups) to systematically modulate their porosity and stability. As expected, the stable Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb/Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpn achieve enhanced porosity (27.2%/32.1%) and improved C2H2 uptake (73.9/75.8 cm3 g&#8722;1, 298&#160;K, 100&#160;kPa). Interestingly, Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpan exhibits the unique rotor&#8208;driven gating effect with free bpan ligands, facilitating the pressure&#8208;dependent switching between nonporous (10.8%) and open states at 195&#160;K. Breakthrough experiments confirm excellent C2H2 separation performance from binary/ternary mixtures and achieve one&#8208;step purification of C2H4 (&gt;99.9%) from C2H2/CO2/C2H4 (1/9/90, v/v/v) mixture with a new benchmark productivity of 396.9&#160;L kg&#8722;1 (Ni&#8208;dcpp&#8208;bpb). Theoretical calculations and in situ IR spectra reveal that C2H2/C2H4 and C2H2/CO2 separation are primarily governed by the abundant C&#9472;H&#8943;O/N and C&#9472;H&#8943;&#960; interactions. This study establishes a molecular&#8208;rotor&#8208;engineered approach to precisely modulate interpenetration in MOFs and offers a robust platform for high&#8208;performance gas purification.

         <title>Synthesis of Type II Porous Liquids from Nonporous Metal&#8211;Organic Polyhedra Enhanced by Host&#8211;Guest Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II porous liquids with record&#8208;high cage&#8208;content. This strategy synergistically increases the solubility of MOP&#8208;18 and prevents the interpenetration of n&#8208;dodecyl chains into cage cavities, enabling the transition MOP&#8208;18 from nonporous in the solid state to porous in the liquid state for gas separation.








Abstract
The synthesis of Type II porous liquids (PLs) from metal&#8211;organic polyhedra, a kind of excellent porous molecular sources, suffers from their strong crystallization tendency induced poor solubility. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest complexation enhanced dissolution strategy for constructing Type II PLs from MOPs with record&#8208;high concentration. Benefitting from host&#8211;guest interactions between pillar[5]arene and n&#8208;alkyl chains, a Type II PL (P5&#8208;PL) is developed by dissolving apolar n&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic polyhedra (MOP&#8208;18) in polar liquid pillar[5]arene (P5&#8208;L), exhibiting solubility much higher than all MOP&#8208;based Type II PLs reported to date. MOP&#8208;18, being nonporous in the solid state because of molecular packing&#8208;induced pore blockage, displays permanent molecular porosity when molecularly and randomly dispersed in P5&#8208;L to form P5&#8208;PL, as confirmed by experimental and simulation results. P5&#8208;PL demonstrates excellent CO2/N2 separation capabilities, enabling the fabrication of mixed matrix membrane with superior CO2/N2 selectivity. This strategy can be extended to the fabrication of additional Type II PLs, showing its universality. This synergistic design concept integrating supramolecular chemistry with PLs not only overcomes traditional tedious covalent modification but also enables high compatibility between apolar cage solutes and polar solvents, affording PLs with high porosity, low volatility and viscosity, and programmable tunability.

         <title>Inverting Palladium&#8211;Phosphorus Lewis Pair Formation: Phosphonium Acting as Z&#8208;Type Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic phosphonium&#8208;palladium(0) complexes were synthesized using an ambiphilic phosphorus&#8208;based ligand. A strong Z&#8208;type interaction was identified by DFT calculations (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM analyses), surpassing the strength of classical L&#8208;type P&#9472;Pd bonds. The pronounced Pd(0) stabilization facilitates mild P&#9472;C coupling reaction, showcasing the effect of Z&#8208;type ligands on reductive elimination in transition metal mediated transformations. 








Abstract
Phosphorus&#8208;based ligands are prototypical L&#8208;type donors. Here, we introduce a Lewis acidic phosphonium cation that engages in unprecedented Z&#8208;type coordination to palladium(0). The resulting Pd&#8594;P(V) interactions are structurally unique and stronger than conventional L&#8208;type Pd&#9472;phosphine bonds, as revealed by NMR spectroscopy, x&#8208;ray crystallography, and quantum chemical analyses (NBO, ETS&#8208;NOCV, and QTAIM). It enables the formation of rare L2Z&#8208;type Pd(0) complexes with distinctive optical and electronic properties. A notably mild P&#9472;C bond forming reaction suggests an overlooked role of Z&#8208;type interactions for facilitating reductive elimination pathways.

It enables the formation of rare L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Z-type Pd(0) complexes with distinctive optical and electronic properties. A notably mild P&#9472;C bond forming reaction suggests an overlooked role of Z-type interactions for facilitating reductive elimination pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Structural Transformations of Zinc(II) Knotted Cage Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic control over coordination environments and subcomponent sequences enabled the formation and stabilization of trefoil perplexanes and trefoil tetrahedral knotted cages. Peripheral crosslinkers diminished framework stability to tune host&#8211;guest behavior and dynamic exchange, while mechanical entanglement modulated self&#8208;sorting and guest binding, offering routes to future functional designs. 








Abstract
Interwoven architectures feature in biomolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, the high&#8208;yielding syntheses and controlled structural transformations of artificial interwoven structures, particularly those exhibiting intricate topologies and bifurcated strands, remain a challenge. In this study, we present a rational design strategy that harnesses the rigidity of tailored ligands in combination with zinc coordination to direct the self&#8208;assembly process, thus enabling the controlled synthesis of covalently linked trefoil perplexane and trefoil tetrahedral knotted cage frameworks. We further elucidate the role of structural rigidity in governing framework transformations, demonstrating two&#8208;way interconversion between interwoven and non&#8208;interwoven architectures, accompanied by tunable guest encapsulation and release. Notably, the incorporation of peripheral crosslinkers was found to lock the cage conformation, thereby regulating its guest binding properties. In addition, the sequence of subcomponent addition was found to be critical to the product outcome: Initial construction of a covalently&#8208;linked knotted cage framework stabilizes kinetic intermediates during self&#8208;assembly, providing access to distinct products.

         <title>A Synergistic Cu/Ca Dual&#8208;Doping Strategy for High&#8208;Stability and Fast&#8208;Charging O3&#8208;Type Cathode in Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A Cu2+/Ca2+ doped&#160;O3&#8208;type oxide Na0.98Ca0.01Ni0.35Cu0.05Fe0.2Mn0.4O2 (CuCa&#8211;NFM) was designed as a cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Cu2+ facilitates Na+ diffusion and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, whereas Ca2+ pillars restrain phase transition. The CuCa&#8208;NFM cathode displays a high&#8208;rate capacity of 86.02 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles.








Abstract
The O3&#8208;type layered oxide cathodes are highly promising for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interlayer stability caused by narrow layer spacing and volumetric stress accumulation limit their fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;cycle performance. Herein, targeted interlayer regulation is conducted on O3&#8208;type layered oxide by introducing Cu2+ and Ca2+ into the transition metal (TM) and alkali metal (AM) layers, respectively. The introduction of Cu2+ effectively enlarges sodium&#8208;ion transport channels, mitigates oxygen arrangement around TM octahedra, and suppresses Na+/vacancy ordering, which is evidenced by scanning transmission electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations. Additionally, Ca2+ in the AM layer effectively mitigates volume variation during electrochemical reactions and preserves structural integrity, as confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, resulting in lower lattice stress and mitigated phase evolution. The result is an exceptionally high&#8208;rate capability of 86.02&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C (2.4&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), accompanied by a prolonged lifetime with 80.64% retention after 300 cycles. This work demonstrates synergistic regulation of ion transport and lattice stability, providing new insights for cathode design.

         <title>Construction of Tetrasubstituted &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Phosphine Oxides via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Hydrophosphinylation of Dienes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and general method for the Pd&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;amido and 2&#8208;alkoxyl dienes is developed. This approach facilitates the expedited and straightforward construction of chiral allylic &#945;&#8208;amino and &#945;&#8208;alkoxyphosphine oxides with tetrasubstituted carbon centers. Both 2&#8208;amido diene and 2&#8208;alkoxyl diene served as excellent coupling partners with a wide range of phosphine oxides.








Abstract
Significant progress has been made in the asymmetric hydrofunctionalization of dienes to construct vinylic stereogenic carbon centers. However, achieving enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of substituted dienes with heteroatom nucleophiles to form vinylic tetrasubstituted carbon centers remains a formidable challenge. This difficulty arises primarily from issues of regio&#8208;control, steric hindrance, and stereo&#8208;discrimination. In this study, we present a palladium&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 2&#8208;amido and 2&#8208;alkoxyl dienes using phosphine oxides. This approach successfully constructs chiral allylic &#945;&#8208;aminophosphine oxides and &#945;&#8208;alkoxyphosphine oxides with tetrasubstituted carbon centers. Our method demonstrates a broad substrate scope with excellent enantioselectivity (up to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% ee) and high yields (up to 99%), achieving exclusive regio&#8208;control under mild conditions. Additionally, the versatile post&#8208;functionalization of the allyl group facilitates the synthesis of a wide variety of tetrasubstituted carbon centers featuring distinct heteroatom.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Polymerization and Pre&#8208;Etching Dominated by Carbon Dots to Fabricate the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Microporous Carbon for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) are used as the sole self&#8208;template to produce sub&#8208;nanometer microporous carbon with high packing density, large specific surface area (SSA), high yield, and high micropore area ratio, which challenges the conventional understanding of porous carbon synthesis and establishes CDs as a key member in the self&#8208;template family.








Abstract
The self&#8208;templating method is a facile and low&#8208;cost strategy to synthesize porous carbon materials, but the obtained products usually have low yields, limited specific surface areas (SSAs), and broad pore size distributions. It is a great challenge for the self&#8208;templating method to prepare the sub&#8208;nanometer (0.5&#8211;1.0&#160;nm) microporous carbon that is preferred for high&#8208;performance supercapacitors. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) are employed as the sole precursor to prepare porous carbon without using any activating agents. The obtained carbon materials have large SSA (2733.6 m2 g&#8722;1), high micropore area ratio (92.5%), high packing density (0.82&#160;g cm&#8722;3), high yield (12%), and concentrated sub&#8208;nanometer pore structure. The formation mechanism of such porous carbon and the unique functions of CDs as self&#8208;templates are interpreted by various characterizations. When used as electrodes for supercapacitors, this carbon material exhibits specific capacitance up to 639 F g&#8722;1 and is compatible with electrolytes of wide pH values and enlarged voltage windows (1.3&#8211;1.7&#160;V). The symmetric devices assembled by such material exhibit low self&#8208;discharge behaviors, excellent energy densities (15.9&#8211;44.1&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and good cycling performance even under the commercial&#8208;level mass loading (10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) on electrodes.

         <title>Discriminative Peroxymonosulfate Activation on Iron Carbides for Redox&#8208;Neutral Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report the covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds featured with moderate electron delocalization regulates peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation pathway and preserves the Fe valence state, affecting the contribution of radical pathway and electron&#8208;connection between PMS and phenol, thereby achieving high catalytic activity with exceptional stability. This study introduces a new paradigm for Fenton&#8208;like processes in wastewater treatment.








Abstract
In conventional redox cycle&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like processes, the imbalanced rates between the reductive activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the subsequent catalyst recovery by PMS oxidation often leads to the catalyst deactivation, posing a major challenge to achieving long&#8208;term stability. Herein, we report a discriminative, redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation pathway enabled by a core&#8211;shell Fe3C@C catalyst, which eliminates performance loss caused by such redox imbalance. Covalent Fe&#9472;C bonds within Fe3C@C suppress complete electron transfer for PMS oxidation or reduction, preventing the radical&#8208;forming pathways. Instead, PMS is activated through electronic induction, discriminatively cleaving the peroxyl O&#9472;O bond to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) as the sole reactive oxygen species (ROS) without significant changes in the Fe valence state, thereby greatly enhancing catalyst durability. Beyond PMS activation, the highly conductive Fe3C@C network serves as an efficient electron relay, promoting pollutant degradation with 1O2 by facilitating electron&#8208;exchange between PMS and pollutant. By integrating redox&#8208;neutral PMS activation with electron&#8208;connection driven pollutant oxidation, Fe3C@C achieves both high reactivity and exceptional long&#8208;term stability, overcoming the traditional trade&#8208;off between activity and durability. This work introduces a new paradigm in Fenton&#8208;like catalysis, demonstrating how covalent coordination engineering can unlock selective, nonradical pathways for sustainable and robust water treatment.

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Glasses Enabled by Frustrated Non&#8208;Covalent Complexation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated noncovalent complexation has been developed as an effective route to tough supramolecular glasses, by installing steric isopropyl groups adjacent to directional squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. Compared with a nonfrustrated control, the frustrated design increases mechanical toughness by 4.3&#8208;fold and enhances interfacial adhesion, enabling the resulting supramolecular glasses to function as impact&#8208;resistant coatings. 








Abstract
Supramolecular glasses, as noncovalently cross&#8208;linked amorphous materials, are hampered by a fundamental trade&#8208;off between vitrification and mechanical performance. Here we propose a strategy&#8212;&#8220;frustrated non&#8208;covalent complexation&#8221;&#8212;inspired by frustrated Lewis pairs to overcome this limitation. This is achieved by installing sterically hindering isopropyl groups adjacent to directional squaramide hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. Relative to a nonfrustrated control, this design not only generates more loosely packed hydrogen&#8208;bonded domains but also shifts the dominant interactions from squaramide&#8211;squaramide to squaramide&#8211;ester hydrogen bonding. The frustrated system yields a 4.3&#8208;fold increase in mechanical toughness in the resulting supramolecular glass, facilitated by efficient energy dissipation through reversible hydrogen&#8208;bond rupture. It also enhances interfacial adhesion, functioning as an effective impact&#8208;resistant coating that mitigates substrate fracture. Overall, this work establishes frustrated noncovalent complexation as a powerful paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance supramolecular glass materials.

         <title>Breaking Interference&#8208;Driven Reversal Currents to Boost Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In cross&#8208;conjugated single&#8208;molecule systems, the presence of destructive quantum interference leads to low conductivity, which is accompanied by the presence of reversal currents. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically enhance conductance in cross&#8208;conjugated systems by preventing reversal current formation, achieving two orders of magnitude increase in conductance. 








Abstract
Controlling charge transport in single&#8208;molecule junctions is essential for advancing molecular electronics. This study demonstrates a novel strategy to dramatically enhance conductance in cross&#8208;conjugated systems by preventing reversal current formation in destructive quantum interference (DQI) regimes. We design four molecules with meta&#8208;substituted phenyl rings replaced by hydrogen&#8208;bonded diketone (OHO) or boron&#8208;coordinated rings (NBN, NBO, OBO), all maintaining hexagonal cross&#8208;conjugated topology. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal a counterintuitive conductance enhancement arising from suppressed reversal currents. Replacing the prototype m&#8208;phenyl ring (mPh) with diketone (OHO) elevates conductance by one order of magnitude. Further boron coordination synergistically modulates quantum interference and energy levels, achieving an unprecedented two orders of magnitude increase in conductance in OBO (from 10&#8722;5.39 G0 to 10&#8722;3.41 G0). This work establishes a paradigm for efficient conductance modulation via targeted reversal current suppression, enabling rationally designed quantum&#8208;interference molecular devices.

This work presents a strategy for extracting an efficient catalyst from discarded chemical reagents to construct a photo&#8208;assisted oxidant activation system with customizable activation pathways. While enabling green and sustainable remediation of organic wastewater, this approach also holds promise for applications in selective CO2 reduction, selective H2O2 regeneration, and other high&#8208;value chemical transformations, fostering prosperity across multiple fields.








Abstract
Resource recovery from chemical wastes offers significant economic and environmental opportunities. In particular, repurposing recycled materials to construct light&#8208;driven oxidant activation systems presents a promising strategy for organic wastewater remediation. However, in such a photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like system, precise regulation of active species remains a major challenge, limiting performance optimization. Here, we propose a sustainable approach using catalysts derived from deteriorated potassium iodide (KI) reagents. Theoretical analyses reveal that I&#8722; and I3&#8722; species from degraded KI function as effective redox mediators, generating internal electric fields that substantially lower energy barriers for carrier separation. The resulting catalytic system exhibits outstanding decontamination performance, achieving complete removal of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole with a pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order rate constant of 0.79&#160;min&#8722;1, representing 3.76&#8208; and 79.00&#8208;fold enhancements over systems using standard KI and single&#8208;based catalysts, respectively. Mechanistic studies confirm the efficient utilization of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of singlet oxygen through non&#8208;radical pathways. Notably, this novel mechanism shows broad applicability across various oxidant activation systems, with the I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox mediator effectively modifying substrate electronic structures to enhance reactive oxidant interactions. This work introduces an innovative strategy for converting chemical wastes into high&#8208;value materials, advancing sustainable wastewater treatment, and opening new avenues for resource&#8208;efficient chemical applications.

Stable nor[7]circulenyl radical (nor[7]CR) is synthesized and isolated in the crystalline form. nor[7]CR exhibits a distinct four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, and the charged species are isolated and characterized. The stable cation (nor[7]CR+) exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption with a PCE of 93% and a high Tmax under low optical power density. The applications of nor[7]CR+ in photothermal imaging and laser ignition are demonstrated.








Abstract
[n]Circulenes have attracted considerable research interest; however, open&#8208;shell [n]circulene&#8208;type structures remain elusive. In this study, we report the synthesis of a highly stable nor[7]circulenyl radical (nor[7]CR) and its isolation in the crystalline phase. nor[7]CR exhibits a distinct four&#8208;stage amphoteric redox behavior, as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. The stable cation (nor[7]CR+) was obtained via chemical oxidation and isolated in crystalline form, and the corresponding anionic species were characterized spectroscopically. Remarkably, nor[7]CR+ exhibits strong NIR&#8208;II absorption at 1105&#160;nm with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 93%, as well as a high maximum photothermal temperature (Tmax) under low optical power density. The applications of nor[7]CR+ in photothermal imaging and laser ignition were demonstrated, highlighting its great potential as a photothermal material.

         <title>Precise Kinetic Separation of Hexane Isomers via Morphology Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Diffusion&#8208;Selective Pore Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed metal&#8211;organic framework ZU&#8208;621 features a tailored diffusion&#8208;selective pore structure that enables intrinsic kinetic recognition of hexane isomers. Combined with synergistic crystal size engineering, it achieves precise and multi&#8208;objective separation of all C6 alkane isomers. 








Abstract
Hexane isomer separation is critical to advancing sustainable and high&#8208;value refining in the petrochemical industry. However, precise separation of multi&#8208;component hexane mixtures with similar molecular structures remains a bottleneck. Herein, we report a novel metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;3,3&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;SIFSIX, termed as ZU&#8208;621) featuring a tailored diffusion&#8208;selective pore structure, synergistically integrated with crystal size engineering, that enables precise and efficient separation of hexane isomers. Owing to the uniquely engineered dumbbell&#8208;shaped, misaligned electronegative pore environment, ZU&#8208;621 exhibits intrinsic kinetic discrimination among hexane isomers based on the alkyl spatial distribution. Complementary crystal morphology engineering further fine&#8208;tunes the adsorption&#8211;diffusion behavior, affording precise kinetic separation across linear, mono&#8208;branched, and di&#8208;branched isomer pairs. As a result, this kinetic&#8208;morphology synergistic approach achieved benchmark separation performance as evidenced by record gasoline productivity (research octane numbers, RON&#160;&gt;&#160;95, 49.8&#160;L&#160;kg&#8722;1) along with precise, multi&#8208;objective separation across five hexane isomers.

         <title>A Photoswitchable HaloTag for Spatiotemporal Control of Fluorescence in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable fluorophores are critical for advanced bioimaging. Here, we develop a photoswitchable self&#8208;labeling HaloTag that can reversibly modulate the emission of a bound fluorogenic dye via a light&#8208;induced conformational change. In living cells, this tunable chemigenetic system enables precise spatiotemporal activation and control of emitter density in SMLM.








Abstract
Photosensitive fluorophores, whose emission can be controlled using light, are essential for advanced biological imaging, enabling precise spatiotemporal tracking of molecular features and facilitating super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. Although irreversibly photoactivatable fluorophores are well established, reversible reporters that can be reactivated multiple times remain scarce, and only a few have been applied in living cells using generalizable protein labeling methods. To address these limitations, we introduce chemigenetic photoswitchable fluorophores, leveraging the self&#8208;labeling HaloTag protein with fluorogenic rhodamine dye ligands. By incorporating a light&#8208;responsive protein domain into HaloTag, we engineer a tunable, photoswitchable HaloTag (psHaloTag), which can reversibly modulate the fluorescence of a bound dye&#8208;ligand via a light&#8208;induced conformational change. Our best performing psHaloTag variants show excellent performance in living cells, with large, reversible, deep&#8208;red fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon 450&#160;nm illumination across various biomolecular targets and SMLM compatibility. Together, this work establishes the chemigenetic approach as a versatile platform for the design of photoswitchable reporters, tunable through both genetic and synthetic modifications, with promising applications for dynamic imaging.

         <title>Click&#8208;Cyclized Cell Penetrating Peptides Containing Hydrophobic Proline Derivatives for Efficient Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic cell&#8208;penetrating peptide featuring a modified aminoproline moiety that significantly enhances permeability is reported. The results demonstrate that a secondary amine linkage coupled with a hydrophobic substituent leads to better peptide permeability. This peptide successfully delivered EGFP into cells, offering a promising strategy for targeted protein transport and peptide drug development.








Abstract
Targeting intracellular organelles with macromolecules is challenging due to cell membrane impermeability. Innovative approaches to direct intracellular delivery have been developed, including nanoparticles, as a promising method for protein delivery; however, with limited efficiency. Cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) provide a versatile alternative for intracellular cargo delivery. We suggest substituting hydroxy&#8208; or amino prolines in &#946;&#8208;turns in cyclic CPPs with hydrophobic residues to facilitate cell penetration. We investigated the influence of substituted amine and ether derivatives of trans&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; or amino&#8208;l&#8208;proline on MCF&#8208;7 and other cell lines for the import of the fluorophore ATOTA. Flow cytometry and spinning disk confocal microscopy on 17 linear and click&#8208;cyclic peptides revealed that particularly cyclic cell penetrating peptide 15 (cCPP 15) exhibited remarkable permeability. When conjugated with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), cCPP 15 efficiently delivered the protein into MCF&#8208;7 and HeLa cells. cCPP 15, comprising two endocyclic and two exocyclic d&#8208;arginines and a trans amino&#8208;L&#8208;proline with a 2&#8208;naphthylmethylene modification in a typeII&#946;&#8208;turn, significantly enhanced intracellular penetration. The efficiency of cCPP 15 in intracellular delivery provides a valuable addition to the growing field of CPPs that can deliver macromolecules to the interior of the cell and possibly even cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier with proteins or drugs.

         <title>Finding the Key: Binding of Metal&#8208;Oxo Clusters to the Enzyme Active Site Enabled by &#8220;Click&#8221; (Bio)Conjugation</title>

This work demonstrates targeted, site&#8208;specific binding of metal&#8208;oxo clusters to Hen Egg White Lysozyme through organic functionalization. Crystallographic analysis reveals Azide&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside&#8208;functionalized vanadate clusters accessing the enzyme's binding pocket, whereas hexyne&#8208;functionalized clusters do not promote interactions with the same site. This work demonstrates the utility of derivatizing inorganic clusters with organic moieties to facilitate targeted protein interactions.








Abstract
Molecular metal&#8208;oxo nanoclusters with tunable redox and structural properties have emerged as powerful bio&#8208;inorganic tools in catalysis, protein crystallization, and therapeutic applications. Despite their potential, interactions between discrete clusters and proteins are predominantly driven by nonspecific intermolecular interactions, which limit precise control over binding sites and functional outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new strategy to achieve site&#8208;directed binding of vanadium&#8208;based polyoxometalate clusters (POVs) to distinct regions of Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL), an archetypal antimicrobial enzyme. Three novel hybrid POVs were designed and fully characterized, starting from an azide&#8208;functionalized cluster (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;N3), which was subsequently post&#8208;functionalized with a hydrophobic hexyne group (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Hex) to probe nonpolar interactions, and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;mannopyranoside (Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Man) to mimic the protein's natural substrate. Structural and spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that, in contrast to conventional nonhybrid POV clusters which bind nonspecifically to peripheral positively charged protein patches, the hybrid POVs achieve distinct binding behaviors. Specifically, Na&#8208;V6&#8208;N3 and Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Man selectively target the glycosidic pocket, resembling the binding of the protein's natural substrate, while Na&#8208;V6&#8208;Hex exhibits an unprecedented crystallization of two POV clusters in close proximity, which wrap around the protein surface.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates targeted, site-specific binding of metal-oxo clusters to Hen Egg White Lysozyme through organic functionalization. Crystallographic analysis reveals Azide- and &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-mannopyranoside-functionalized vanadate clusters accessing the enzyme's binding pocket, whereas hexyne-functionalized clusters do not promote interactions with the same site. This work demonstrates the utility of derivatizing inorganic clusters with organic moieties to facilitate targeted protein interactions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular metal-oxo nanoclusters with tunable redox and structural properties have emerged as powerful bio-inorganic tools in catalysis, protein crystallization, and therapeutic applications. Despite their potential, interactions between discrete clusters and proteins are predominantly driven by nonspecific intermolecular interactions, which limit precise control over binding sites and functional outcomes. In this work, we introduce a new strategy to achieve site-directed binding of vanadium-based polyoxometalate clusters (POVs) to distinct regions of Hen Egg White Lysozyme (HEWL), an archetypal antimicrobial enzyme. Three novel hybrid POVs were designed and fully characterized, starting from an azide-functionalized cluster (&lt;b&gt;Na-V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;), which was subsequently post-functionalized with a hydrophobic hexyne group (&lt;b&gt;Na-V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-Hex&lt;/b&gt;) to probe nonpolar interactions, and &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-mannopyranoside (&lt;b&gt;Na-V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-Man&lt;/b&gt;) to mimic the protein's natural substrate. Structural and spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that, in contrast to conventional nonhybrid POV clusters which bind nonspecifically to peripheral positively charged protein patches, the hybrid POVs achieve distinct binding behaviors. Specifically, &lt;b&gt;Na-V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Na-V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-Man&lt;/b&gt; selectively target the glycosidic pocket, resembling the binding of the protein's natural substrate, while &lt;b&gt;Na-V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-Hex&lt;/b&gt; exhibits an unprecedented crystallization of two POV clusters in close proximity, which wrap around the protein surface. These findings highlight that strategic organic functionalization can circumvent electrostatic barriers to achieve site-selective cluster&#8211;protein interactions, thus opening new avenues for the application of metal-oxo clusters in biotechnology, drug delivery, and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Parkinson's Disease Drug Tolcapone and Analogues are Potent Glycomimetic Lectin Inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LecA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present Tolcapone and derivatives as a new class of potent glycomimetics for lectin inhibition. Over 3200 Roche in&#8208;house compounds were screened experimentally and a subset was biophysically evaluated. Our findings show the potential to develop potent non&#8208;carbohydrate glycomimetic lectin inhibitors, opening a path toward innovative anti&#8208;infective drug research.








Abstract
The notorious pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa relies on the lectin LecA for host cell adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation. Motivated by the pressing need for new anti&#8208;infective therapies caused by antimicrobial resistance, inhibitors of LecA are under investigation. Complementary to the use of carbohydrate&#8208;based inhibitors, we have previously identified catechols as weak but specific ligands of LecA, constituting a novel class of non&#8208;carbohydrate glycomimetics. By growing the initial millimolar fragment hits, we identified Tolcapone as a promising compound. To gain insight into the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of catechols as LecA binders, more than 3,200 compounds of the Roche in&#8208;house library were experimentally screened in a competitive binding assay at three concentrations. Of these, 48 compounds were chosen for further investigation, resulting in compounds equipotent to aryl galactosides, the current epitome of LecA inhibition. X&#8208;ray crystallography and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy revealed conserved interactions of the catechol moiety in the glycan binding site of LecA and rationalized the observed SAR. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to develop potent non&#8208;carbohydrate glycomimetic lectin inhibitors. This work paves the way for a new avenue of research towards innovative anti&#8208;infective drugs. In a more general perspective, such small molecules also hold potential to challenge the hegemony of antibodies for lectin inhibition in clinical use.

         <title>Counteranion&#8208;Controlled Chemodivergent Transfer&#8208;Hydrothiolation/Carbothiolation Using Thioethers as Bifunctional Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 50, December 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a counteranion&#8208;controlled Rh&#8208;catalytic system for the chemodivergent functionalization of alkenes via C(sp3)&#9472;S bond cleavage. The use of Rh(COD)2OTf promotes Markovnikov transfer&#8208;hydrothiolation. Alternatively, Rh(COD)2BF4 enables unprecedented intermolecular carbothiolation, where thioethers act as dual carbon and sulfur donors, forming both C(sp3)&#9472;S and C(sp3)&#9472;C(sp3) bonds.








Abstract
The pursuit of catalysis capable of forging C(sp3)&#9472;S bonds is extremely desired because these bonds have substantial importance in pharmaceuticals, functional materials, and organic synthesis. Hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of feedstock alkenes are among the most straightforward and prominent approaches to C(sp3)&#9472;S bond formations. However, hydrothiolation of alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes typically proceeds in an anti&#8208;Markovnikov fashion, and carbothiolation predominantly relies on three&#8208;component coupling strategies using highly reactive pre&#8208;functionalized electrophilic sulfur sources and nucleophilic carbon sources. Herein, by strategically using heterolytic cleavage of C(sp3)&#9472;S bond, we report a chemodivergent transfer&#8208;hydrothiolation and carbothiolation of alkenes with thioethers serving as bifunctional reagents. The chemo&#8208;control is achieved through careful selection of the counteranion associated with the Rh&#8208;center. Counteranions with relatively strong coordinating ability, such as TfO&#8722;, promote an unusual Markovnikov transfer&#8208;thiol&#8208;ene reaction. Conversely, noncoordinating counteranions, such as BF4&#8722;, enable an unprecedented intermolecular thioether&#8208;ene reaction that adds thioethers directly across alkenes. Mechanistic and computational studies elucidated that the coordination or noncoordination of counteranions on Rh can alter the basicity of the thiolate, resulting in chemodivergence.

         <dc:description>
We report an aqueous, surfactant&#8208;free, and versatile synthesis method for imine&#8208;linked nanoCOFs incorporating porphyrin units, with tunable size and morphology. The resulting nanoCOFs exhibit excellent aqueous dispersibility, strong light absorption, and significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
The synthesis of nanosized covalent organic frameworks (nanoCOFs) with good dispersibility is vital for optical and optoelectronic applications. However, conventional methods rely on surfactants and organic solvents, limiting scalability and water compatibility. Here, we report a facile, scalable, and surfactant&#8208;free strategy to synthesize imine&#8208;linked nanoCOFs incorporating porphyrin units in aqueous acetic acid. By tuning monomer and catalyst concentrations, we modulated polymerization kinetics to obtain highly crystalline nanoCOFs with controlled sizes (&#8764;50&#160;nm&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m), tunable morphologies (nanocubes, nanorods, nanofibers), and good dispersibility. Protonation of porphyrin units during synthesis introduced surface charges, preventing aggregation and enabling excellent water dispersibility. The nanoCOFs exhibited strong and broad light absorption along with high colloidal stability. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrated their remarkable photocatalytic activity for oxidative coupling of benzylamines in water, even at an ultra&#8208;low loading (0.0074&#160;mol%). This sustainable approach offers a versatile route to high&#8208;performance nanoCOFs, advancing COF&#8208;based photocatalysis and fundamental studies of their photophysical properties.

         <title>Synergistic Interplay of Ni Single Atoms and Neighboring Mn2 Dual Atoms Enabling Selective Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Ni1/Mn2&#8208;MIL catalyst, the Ni1 site activates CO2 to form CO, and the Mn2 site facilitates *COCHO intermediate formation. Strong electronic interaction between adjacent Ni1 and Mn2 sites induces a charge&#8208;polarized center, weakening electrostatic repulsion between C1 and C2 intermediates. This promotes C1&#8211;C2 coupling to form the key C3 intermediate *CH2OCOCO, and enhances C3H8 selectivity.








Abstract
The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into long carbon chain products (Cn, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;3) presents a sustainable strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;value fuels and chemicals. However, the synthesis of long carbon chain products under mild conditions still faces great challenges, largely due to sluggish multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer kinetics and the thermodynamically unfavorable C1&#8211;C1 and C1&#8211;C2 coupling processes. In this study, we developed tri&#8208;metal active sites composed of Ni single atoms and Mn2 dual atoms anchored on NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125(Ti) (Ni1/Mn2&#8208;MIL) for synergistic photocatalytic C3H8 production. The synthesized Ni1/Mn2&#8208;MIL catalyst achieved efficient CO2 photoreduction (CO2PR) in pure water, yielding 32.2&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of C3H8 with 81.3% electron&#8208;based selectivity, significantly outperforming Ni1&#8208;MIL and Mn2&#8208;MIL. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibited exceptional stability over 50 cycles without degradation. Integrated experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the Ni1 site activates CO2 to form CO, while the adjacent Mn2 site promotes the formation of *COCHO intermediates. Strong electronic interactions between Ni1 and Mn2 create charge&#8208;polarized active sites, which mitigate electrostatic repulsion between C1 and C2 intermediates, thereby promoting C&#8211;C coupling and subsequent formation of the *CH2OCOCO intermediates. Consequently, both the selectivity and catalytic efficiency toward C3H8 production are significantly enhanced.

&lt;p&gt;In the Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL catalyst, the Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site activates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form CO, and the Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; site facilitates *COCHO intermediate formation. Strong electronic interaction between adjacent Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites induces a charge-polarized center, weakening electrostatic repulsion between C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates. This promotes C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coupling to form the key C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCOCO, and enhances C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into long carbon chain products (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, n&#160;&#8805;&#160;3) presents a sustainable strategy for synthesizing high-value fuels and chemicals. However, the synthesis of long carbon chain products under mild conditions still faces great challenges, largely due to sluggish multi-electron/proton transfer kinetics and the thermodynamically unfavorable C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coupling processes. In this study, we developed tri-metal active sites composed of Ni single atoms and Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual atoms anchored on NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125(Ti) (Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL) for synergistic photocatalytic C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; production. The synthesized Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL catalyst achieved efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PR) in pure water, yielding 32.2&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; with 81.3% electron-based selectivity, significantly outperforming Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL and Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibited exceptional stability over 50 cycles without degradation. Integrated experimental and theoretical investigations revealed that the Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; site activates CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form CO, while the adjacent Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; site promotes the formation of *COCHO intermediates. Strong electronic interactions between Ni&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; create charge-polarized active sites, which mitigate electrostatic repulsion between C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediates, thereby promoting C&#8211;C coupling and subsequent formation of the *CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OCOCO intermediates. Consequently, both the selectivity and catalytic efficiency toward C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; production are significantly enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential Phase&#8208;Engineered Afterglow Modulation in Mn&#8208;Doped Cs&#8208;Cd&#8208;Cl Perovskites for X&#8208;ray Time&#8208;Lapse Flexible Imaging</title>

A phase transition&#8211;guided route enables selective synthesis of Mn&#8208;doped Cs&#8211;Cd&#8211;Cl scintillators with tunable afterglow. The CsCdCl3:Mn, showing the strongest scintillation afterglow, supports high&#8208;resolution flexible time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray imaging and thermally stimulated retrieval of stored images.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray time&#8208;lapse flexible imaging and information retrieval significantly broaden the application scope of X&#8208;ray technologies, while posing new challenges for the design of advanced scintillators. Herein, we report a phase transition&#8211;guided strategy for the rational design of Mn&#8208;doped ternary cadmium chlorides long afterglow emitters, wherein crystal growth dynamics are precisely modulated via solubility&#8208;controlled synthesis. By sequentially preparing powders and single crystals of Cs2CdCl4:Mn, Cs3Cd2Cl7:Mn, and CsCdCl3:Mn, we achieve phase&#8208;selective synthesis through fine&#8208;tuning of mixed solvent ratios, establishing a robust framework for phase engineering in the Mn&#8208;doped Cs&#8211;Cd&#8211;Cl system. Among them, CsCdCl3:Mn exhibits the highest trap density, resulting in a pronounced scintillation afterglow. Benefiting from this unique property, a flexible scintillating film fabricated by embedding phosphor powders into a polymer matrix enables high&#8208;resolution time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray imaging (13.6 lp mm&#8722;1), along with thermally stimulated image retrieval after X&#8208;ray exposure. This work not only presents a generalizable approach for phase&#8208;controlled afterglow modulation in Mn&#8208;doped chlorides, but also offers new avenues toward flexible, high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with delayed visualization capabilities.

         <title>Atomic Fe&#8210;P Pairs Eliminate H2O2 Migration Barriers for Sustainable Electro&#8208;Fenton Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic&#8208;level pairing effectively overcomes the overlooked diffusion limitation of intermediate H2O2, leading to markedly improved electro&#8208;Fenton performance.








Abstract
The electro&#8208;Fenton process, involving O2 reduction to H2O2 and its subsequent activation into &#8226;OH, is an eco&#8208;friendly strategy for degrading organic pollutants in wastewater. Enhancing electro&#8208;Fenton efficiency necessitates two distinct functional sites: one for H2O2 generation to preserve the O&#8210;O bond and the other for activation to cleave the O&#8210;O bond. Despite extensive efforts to optimize these functions, the role of H2O2 migration between sites has been largely overlooked. Excessive inter&#8208;site distances can lead to sluggish H2O2 migration, making it a potential rate&#8208;limiting step in electro&#8208;Fenton catalysis. To address this challenge, we have developed Fe&#8210;P pairs at the atomic level, achieving the theoretical shortest site distance, with single&#8208;atom Fe acting as the H2O2 activation center and P in its first coordination shell facilitating H2O2 generation. Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that Fe&#8210;P pairs significantly shortened the H2O2 diffusion time to &#8764;1.5&#160;ps, over 10 times faster than unpaired configurations, by reducing the migration distance, thereby improving the H2O2 utilization efficiency by over 4 times and enhancing electro&#8208;Fenton performance. Life cycle assessment further highlighted the low environmental impact of this approach, indicating its potential for large&#8208;scale wastewater treatment. By exploiting the previously neglected role of H2O2 migration, this study not only enhances our understanding of the electro&#8208;Fenton process but also offers new insights into the rational design of advanced electro&#8208;Fenton catalysts.

         <title>Phenothiazine&#8208;Phenoxazine Hybrid Cross Hole&#8208;Transporting Material for High Performance Perovskite Solar Cell</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents novel hole&#8208;transport materials featuring diphenothiazine (D&#8208;PTZ) and diphenoxazine (D&#8208;POZ). The hybrid cross phenothiazine&#8208;phenoxazine (PTZ&#8208;POZ) uniquely combines the advantages of D&#8208;PTZ and D&#8208;POZ, delivering superior solubility, optimal film formation, highest hole mobility, and effective defect passivation. Consequently, PTZ&#8208;POZ achieves a champion PCE of 25.85% in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Hole transport materials (HTMs) critically influence perovskite solar cell (PSC) performance through three key mechanisms: facilitating hole transport, blocking electron recombination, and protecting the perovskite layer. Herein, we present novel HTMs featuring diphenothiazine (D&#8208;PTZ) and diphenoxazine (D&#8208;POZ) core architectures. Comprehensive characterization reveals that the hybrid cross phenothiazine&#8208;phenoxazine (PTZ&#8208;POZ) synergistically integrates the complementary advantages of D&#8208;PTZ and D&#8208;POZ demonstrating good solubility, improved film uniformity, and superior hole mobility. When implemented in small&#8208;area PSC (0.0625 cm2), PTZ&#8208;POZ achieves record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.85% with negligible hysteresis, outperforming D&#8208;PTZ (23.09%) and D&#8208;POZ (14.33%) based reference devices and representing the highest PCE reported to date for phenothiazine/phenoxazine&#8208;based HTM devices. Additionally, the large&#8208;area PSC (1.0 cm2) based on PTZ&#8208;POZ also achieved a high PCE of 23.23%. Moreover, the engineered HTM also exhibits exceptional stability, maintaining 90.4% of initial PCE after 1080&#160;h at 40%s&#8211;50% humidity and ambient temperature. This study establishes a novel molecular design paradigm for developing low&#8208;cost high&#8208;efficiency PSCs.

         <title>Thermodynamic Control of Oxygen Vacancies for Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pyrometallurgical approach, guided by phase diagrams, provides a method to precisely engineer oxygen vacancies in Li&#8208;rich layered oxides. This strategy establishes a thermodynamic equilibrium to systematically modulate the electronic structure and enhance superstructures. The resulting material exhibits a sixfold increase in initial capacity, offering a generalizable method for advanced cathode material design.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies (OVs) play a critical role in tuning the properties of oxides, yet their rational control remains challenging. We present a meticulous engineering approach to modulate OVs in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LRLOs), a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Guided by a Mn&#8208;O2 binary phase diagram, our method achieves accurate and broad tuning of the oxygen partial pressure (PO2) during calcination using a pyrometallurgical CO/CO2 gas pair.

&lt;p&gt;A pyrometallurgical approach, guided by phase diagrams, provides a method to precisely engineer oxygen vacancies in Li-rich layered oxides. This strategy establishes a thermodynamic equilibrium to systematically modulate the electronic structure and enhance superstructures. The resulting material exhibits a sixfold increase in initial capacity, offering a generalizable method for advanced cathode material design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen vacancies (OVs) play a critical role in tuning the properties of oxides, yet their rational control remains challenging. We present a meticulous engineering approach to modulate OVs in lithium-rich layered oxides (LRLOs), a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Guided by a Mn-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binary phase diagram, our method achieves accurate and broad tuning of the oxygen partial pressure (PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during calcination using a pyrometallurgical CO/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas pair. Using an ultra-high-Mn LRLO model, we quantify a thermodynamic equilibrium between OV concentration and a wide PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; range (10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;0.7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10.0&lt;/sup&gt; atm). Structural characterizations reveal progressive lattice expansion and an unprecedented enhancement of Li@Mn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; superstructures. An optimized LRLO with 3.8&#160;mol % OVs shows a sixfold improvement in initial discharge capacity (175.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) over a reference sample (28.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0.1C, achieving a maximum capacity of 287.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Photocatalyzed Ring Expansion of &#945;&#8208;Ketosulfonylaziridines: Ready Access to &#948;&#8208;Sultams</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) photoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction for the synthesis of &#948;&#8208;sultams from N&#8208;sulfonyl &#945;&#8208;ketoaziridines through a controlled ring opening&#8211;expansion process is presented. This method allows the easy access to sultams with an unprecedented substitution pattern in up to 85% yield and 2:1 d.r., and highlights the potential of photocatalytic RPC strategies for the construction of value&#8208;added heterocyclic molecules. 








Abstract
Herein, a novel photocatalytic ring expansion reaction of aziridines to &#948;&#8208;sultams through intramolecular radical cyclization is reported. In particular, versatile N&#8208;sulfonyl&#8208;protected &#945;&#8208;ketoaziridines were envisioned to undergo a ring opening&#8211;expansion through a photoredox&#8208;mediated radical&#8211;polar crossover (RPC) process to provide six&#8208;membered sultams bearing an unprecedented 2,3&#8208;disubstitution pattern. The generality of the reaction was explored with a wide variety of substrates, showing a good functional group tolerance. Moreover, the robustness of the method allows a 10&#8208;fold upscaling, providing similar yield or diastereomeric preference for the trans&#8208;disubstituted products. Mechanistic investigations supported the postulated radical&#8211;polar crossover pathway, involving aziridine ring opening by photocatalytic single&#8208;electron reduction via a carbonyl radical anion, followed by intramolecular cyclization with the aryl unit of the N&#8208;sulfonyl group and re&#8208;aromatization. Thus, this strategy opens new possibilities for the construction of highly decorated heterocycles by photoredox&#8208;mediated RPC ring expansion reactions.

         <title>Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Decay via Cyanation: A Promising Design Strategy for Bright Organic NIR&#8208;II Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peripheral cyanation strategy was developed to resolve the intrinsic trade&#8208;off among absorption wavelength, light&#8208;harvesting efficiency, and emission intensity in conventional donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, enabling in vivo perfusion assessment, vascular and lymphatic imaging, and precise fluorescence guidance for tumor resection.








Abstract
Achieving high fluorescence efficiency in organic fluorophores within the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8764;1700&#160;nm) remains challenging, as extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and active intramolecular motions typically funnel excitation energy into non&#8208;radiative decay. Here, we present peripheral cyanation as a molecular design strategy that directly modulates excited&#8208;state dynamics and suppresses non&#8208;radiative relaxation. Incorporation of cyano groups (A') into the D&#8208;A&#8208;D scaffold of BBTCz afforded BBTCzCN with an A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217; architecture, which significantly reduced vibronic coupling compared to the parent dye. Upon encapsulation with DSPE&#8208;mPEG5000, BBTCzCN nanoparticles (NPs) retained a high FLQY of 2.8% with a record&#8208;high brightness of 565&#160;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, representing a 10.4&#8208;fold enhancement over BBTCz NPs and placing it among the brightest organic NIR&#8208;II emitters reported to date. Mechanistic studies combining density functional theory and ultrafast spectroscopy revealed that cyanation synergistically suppressed vibrational relaxation and internal conversion, thereby prolonging radiative decay pathways. As a result, BBTCzCN NPs enabled high&#8208;resolution vascular imaging, real&#8208;time lymphatic tracking, and precise intraoperative delineation of tumors and peritoneal metastases. This work establishes peripheral cyanation as a broadly applicable molecular design strategy for tailoring excited&#8208;state decay pathways, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation NIR&#8208;II fluorophores for deep&#8208;tissue imaging and image&#8208;guided surgery.

         <title>Where's the Salt? Sensing the Ionic Environment of the Air&#8211;Organic&#8211;Water Interface Using an Azide Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sensing that the air&#8211;organic&#8211;water interface is salt&#8208;depleted using azide monolayers, extending the stratified salt hypothesis beyond neat interfaces. 








Abstract
Understanding ionic behavior at aqueous interfaces is vital to fields spanning environmental chemistry, microdroplet reactivity, and electrochemical systems. Yet, whether ions accumulate or are depleted at aqueous boundaries remains debated. Using an uncharged, surface&#8208;anchored azide probe, we find that even at 5&#160;M salt concentrations, the air&#8211;organic&#8211;water interface is depleted of small, inorganic ions, contrasting pronounced effects in bulk. Only under water&#8208;in&#8208;salt conditions (&gt;10&#160;M ZnCl2) does evidence of direct cation coordination emerge at the interface. These findings extend the stratified salt model to the air&#8211;organic&#8211;water interface and provides molecular&#8208;level insights into interfacial reactivity, ion partitioning, and &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221; transformations.

         <title>Unlocking Durable and Efficient Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis via Interface&#8208;Stabilized Trivalent Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have demonstrated that the interface electric field at the CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 junction could stabilize the critical low&#8208;spin Co3+ (t2g6eg0) active centers, thereby enabling highly durable nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia even under high&#8208;current&#8208;density operation.








Abstract
Although cobalt&#8208;based materials are promising catalysts for electrochemical nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction, achieving stable operation at high current densities remains challenging due to significant overpotential issues. To address this, we engineered a CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 assembly to stabilize low&#8208;spin Co3+ (t2g6eg0) active centers, enabling highly durable performance under high current density operation. Sn doping in the underlying (CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 strengthens the stability of Co3+ within the CoOOH catalytic layer by inducing an interfacial electric field at the CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 junction. This field promotes electron transfer from Co3+ species in CoOOH to (CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4, thereby stabilizing the critical Co3+ active centers during high&#8208;current operation. The enhanced interfacial electric field arises from the higher electronegativity of Sn4+ (1.706) compared to Co3+ (1.693). Consequently, the CoOOH/(CoxSn1&#8208;x)3O4 catalyst achieves a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 96.7% for NH4+ generation at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE (110&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability for 1000 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that creating an interface electric field is an efficient strategy to stabilize electroreduction active centers at high currents.

&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; junction. This field promotes electron transfer from Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species in CoOOH to (Co&lt;i&gt;

The enhanced interfacial electric field arises from the higher electronegativity of Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; (1.706) compared to Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (1.693).

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Additive Reshapes Lifetime Limit of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated computation&#8208;experiment framework identifies KCOOH as a promising potassium&#8208;supplying additive whose decomposition releases K+ to offset losses from solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation, while the concomitant CO2 promotes the formation of a robust, inorganic&#8208;rich SEI at graphite anode.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are being considered as the sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems, yet their specific energy and cycling lifespan is hindered by irreversible potassium loss due to solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and SEI instability&#8208;induced ion depletion. Here, by employing an integrated computational&#8208;experimental selection framework, we identify a dual&#8208;functional additive that contributes to both active potassium compensation and SEI stability. Consequently, the additive&#8208;integrated coin&#8208;type full&#8208;cell with a K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode and a graphite anode delivers a specific energy of 334.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and achieves a cycling lifespan of 1700 cycles at 0.5C with 88.32% capacity retention. Similarly, the effectiveness of the additive is also demonstrated in the pouch&#8208;type cell, which maintains 80.64% capacity after 3000 cycles at 0.5C. Mechanistic investigations by multimodal advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the decomposition of the additive not only provides additional active potassium&#8208;ions to replenish SEI&#8208;related losses but also promotes the formation of an inorganic&#8208;rich and mechanically robust SEI, both of which contribute to the enhanced specific energy and substantially extended cycling lifespan of PIBs. This work greatly advances the electrochemical performance of PIBs and provides fresh insights for developing multifunctional additives to synergistically realize active ion compensation and controlled interfacial engineering.

Based on the &#8220;asymmetric spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking architecture&#8221; strategy, (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLTPA exhibit saturated green emission with the EQEmax of 39.8% and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 27 nm in non&#8208;sensitized 5 wt% doped device, accompanied by intense chiral EL signals with gEL values of&#160;+0.84/&#8722;1.22&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. Even at the high doping concentration of 30 wt%, the EQEmax remains at 36.6% with an FWHM of 28 nm, showing an anti&#8208;quenching effect over a wide range of doping concentration.








Abstract
Highly efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emitters with narrowband emission are promising for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) displays. Herein, we put forward an &#8220;asymmetric spiro&#8208;carbon&#8208;locking architecture&#8221; strategy to construct chiral multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. Two pairs of enantiomers, (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLCz and (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLTPA, are successfully achieved, which show high photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 95%, narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximums (FWHMs) of 24&#8211;26&#160;nm (0.11&#8211;0.12&#160;eV) and 26&#8211;27&#160;nm (0.12&#160;eV) in films over a wide range of dopant concentrations (1&#8211;30 wt%), and obvious mirror&#8208;image CPL properties in both solution and film states. As a result, the sensitizer&#8208;free organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on BN&#8208;FLCz and BN&#8208;FLTPA exhibit pure green emission with the FWHMs of 26&#160;nm (0.12&#160;eV) and 27&#160;nm (0.13&#160;eV), Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.16, 0.72) and (0.18, 0.73), and the record&#8208;breaking maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxs) of 37.9% and 39.8%, respectively. Even at the high doping concentration of 30 wt%, the EQEmaxs for BN&#8208;FLCz and BN&#8208;FLTPA remain at 35.5% and 36.6% without sacrificing the color fidelity. Furthermore, the circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLCz and (R/S)&#8208;BN&#8208;FLTPA displayed clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of&#160;+0.85/&#8722;1.19&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and&#160;+0.84/&#8722;1.22&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, respectively.

         <title>A Diffusion&#8208;Retarded Strategy for Practical Zn&#8211;I2 Batteries Under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the diffusion&#8208;retarded strategy, a scalable Cu&#8211;ZnO&#8208;CC/FPC cathode customized by FPC substrate, carbon cages as physical barriers, and Cu&#8208;doped ZnO active sites for adsorption/catalysis of iodine species. It enables Zn&#8211;I2 batteries to exhibit impressive electrochemical performance under both mild and harsh conditions.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries attract increasing attention for inherent safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, challenges like sluggish iodine kinetics and polyiodide shuttle effect seriously impede their practical viability. Herein, we develop a diffusion&#8208;retarded strategy, where carbon cage&#8208;encapsulated Cu&#8208;doped ZnO nanoparticles are tailored on scalable carbon paper substrates as iodine cathodes to simultaneously retard polyiodide shuttle effect and accelerate iodine species reaction kinetics. Specifically, the physical barrier formed by carbon cage and porous fiber effectively retards the diffusion of polyiodides, while the intermodulated single&#8208;atom Cu sites and adjacent Zn sites in Cu&#8211;ZnO nanoparticles show remarkable catalytic activity and chemisorption for iodine species, respectively. Hence, the obtained Zn&#8211;I2 batteries exhibit an ultra&#8208;low polarization voltage of 26.7 mV (1 A g&#8722;1) and endure an ultra&#8208;long cycle life over 40&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Notably, the batteries maintain over 5000 cycles with a capacity degradation rate of barely 0.007% per cycle at 60 &#176;C, while the capacity decline is 20.8 mAh g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20 &#176;C (vs. 25 &#176;C), as well as over 1150 cycles at a negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 2.5. Overall, high&#8208;performance Zn&#8211;I2 batteries under harsh conditions through the diffusion&#8208;retarded strategy provide valuable guidance for rational cathode designs toward practical Zn&#8211;I2 battery systems.

         <title>Lattice Strain in Multi&#8208;Component Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Condensation reactions between electron&#8208;deficient building block and the mixture of two electron&#8208;rich building blocks generate a series of three&#8208;component covalent organic frameworks, exhibiting optimized performance toward H2O2 photosynthesis via the modulation of lattice strain in the framework.(For the convenience of readers, we have reuploaded a clearer graphic for Table of Contents, which has been named TOC in the attachment.)








Abstract
The structural designability of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) makes these systems the promising candidates for photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis, however, most D&#8211;A COFs are constructed by one electron&#8208;rich building block with one electron&#8208;deficient building unit, which are short of accuracy in modulating the electron structure, herein, condensation reactions between electron&#8208;deficient 4,4,4&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;benzenetriyltri&#8208;2,1&#8208;ethynediyl)tris&#8208;benzenamine (TAEB) and the mixture of electron&#8208;rich benzo[1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8243;]trithiophene&#8208;2,5,8&#8208;tricarboxaldehyde (BTT) and 2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;formylphenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TPT) were carried out with the ratio of BTT and TPT changing from 8:2, 6:4, 4:6, to 2:8, generating a series of three&#8208;component COFs, named as BTTP&#8208;x:(10&#8208;x) (x&#160;=&#160;8, 6, 4, and 2). The lattice strain of the frameworks is revealed to be adjusted with the change in the ratio of BTT and TPT, achieving accurate modulation for the local electron structure of active sites, proving the advantage of three&#8208;component COFs system. Particularly, this in turn leads to the optimized catalytic performance of BTTP&#8208;2:8 toward H2O2 photosynthesis from H2O and O2 with a production rate of 15498&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, an apparent quantum yield of 28.45% at 420&#160;nm, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 2.74%, superior to most photocatalysts reported thus far. The present result should be helpful for developing highly efficient photocatalysts toward H2O2 synthesis.

         <title>The Expanding Horizons of Chemodynamic Therapy: From Fenton Chemistry to Radical&#8208;Driven Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by recent advances in fundamental research and biomedical applications of chemodynamic therapy (CDT), this review integrates progress in reaction&#8208;center engineering, electron&#8208;state modulation, radical&#8208;driven biological mechanisms, and newly identified subcellular targets. It highlights therapeutic opportunities and proposes a new conceptual framework, presenting a forward&#8208;looking roadmap for CDT research and clinical translation.








Abstract
Since the integration of Fenton chemistry into biomedicine, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has rapidly emerged as a vibrant interdisciplinary research frontier. In recent years, exciting advances in both the fundamental understanding and the attractive applications of CDT have greatly enriched the field, expanding its conceptual boundaries and therapeutic potential. In this review, we first summarize the advances in CDT from a chemical perspective, including strategies to optimize reaction centers at the electronic level and approaches to refine reaction environments through cellular metabolic regulation. We then discuss emerging insights into hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH)&#8211;mediated biological mechanisms and effects, including CDT&#8208;related cell death pathways, newly identified subcellular therapeutic targets, and the growing applications of CDT in antibacterial therapy, wound healing, and immune activation. Furthermore, we summarize ongoing efforts toward clinical translation and outline key challenges and perspectives from a translational standpoint. More importantly, we propose an expanded conceptual framework for CDT in response to the evolving research landscape and present an outlook on the key scientific questions and promising application directions. We hope this review will benefit the disciplinary research paradigm across chemistry, nanotechnology, and biology, providing valuable inspiration for future research in nanomedicine.

         <title>Thermodynamic Compensation of Surface Hydroxyl Moieties in Reduced Polyoxometalates Translates to Deviations in the Mechanism of Proton&#8211;coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change in the central atom in the series of vanadium&#8208;doped Keggin&#8208;type polyoxotungstate clusters results in the near&#8208;perfect thermal compensation between redox potential and proton affinity. Despite identical driving forces, this series of polyoxotungstate clusters exhibits distinguished different proton&#8211;coupled electron transfer mechanisms toward the dehydrogenating of organic substrates.








Abstract
The design of H&#8208;atom transfer catalysts requires the control of redox potential and proton affinity to direct the mechanism, rate, and selectivity of proton&#8211;coupled electron transfer (PCET). In the present study, we demonstrate that a series of reduced and protonated vanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxotungstates ([XVW11O39(OH)]n&#8211;, X&#160;=&#160;Si, n&#160;=&#160;5; X&#160;=&#160;P, n&#160;=&#160;4; X&#160;=&#160;S, n&#160;=&#160;3), exhibit invariant bond dissociation free energies of surface O&#9472;H bonds (BDFE(O&#9472;H)s). Despite uniform driving forces for H&#8208;atom uptake, kinetic analysis with a variety of H&#8208;atom donors (5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine, hydrazobenzene, and hydroquinones) reveals differences in rates of substrate oxidation, which are ascribed to disparate PCET mechanisms. Together, these findings show that substitution at the central heteroatom tunes the electron&#8208; and proton&#8208;transfer driving forces (&#916;GPT and &#916;GET) thereby dictating the operative PCET mechanism.

         <title>Water&#8208;Splitting &#8220;Without Water&#8221;: Splitting of the Crystallised Water of Hydrated Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike liquid water, the structural and molecular properties of water molecules embedded in hydrated salts are subject to strong influences and vary little. This makes them potential candidates for the water splitting reaction. Here, we present the first example of the electrochemical decomposition of crystallised water.








Abstract
In contrast to the liquid phase of water, the structural molecular realities of H2O molecules embedded in crystallised salts vary little and can be precisely determined. However, this water, which is neither in the liquid nor in the gas phase, has not yet been used in water electrolysis. Here, we demonstrate that water electrolysis can be achieved without the addition of (liquid) water through experiments with a wide range of hydrated salts and organic solvent suspensions. We obtain an excellent correlation between the position of the FTIR O&#9472;H stretch vibration of the hydrated salts and the onset of the OER potential from CV measurements. Together with first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that intramolecular bonds in crystallised water can be effectively controlled through choice of the inorganic salt. Targeted manipulation of the bonds in the H2O molecule is a promising new approach to more efficient hydrogen production.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Aliphatic C&#9472;Br Activation for Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Stereogenic Nitriles from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work showcases a photoenzymatic platform using bromoacetonitrile as a practical cyanide source for asymmetric &#947;&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkenes. The system enables direct activation of inert aliphatic C&#9472;Br bonds via engineered ene&#8208;reductases (PETNR H182M) under visible light. Remarkably, the enzyme achieves excellent enantiocontrol through stereoselective hydrogen atom transfer within its active site








Abstract
Enzymatic strategies for direct cyano group incorporation remain underdeveloped, creating synthetic bottlenecks for accessing chiral nitrile derivatives in pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we have developed a photoenzymatic &#947;&#8208;hydrocyanation strategy that addresses this gap. The system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in activating the challenging aliphatic C&#9472;Br bond of bromoacetonitrile through engineered ene&#8208;reductase catalysis. Upon visible light excitation, the reduced flavin cofactor generates cyanomethyl radicals that are spatially confined and precisely oriented within the enzyme's active site for efficient coupling with &#945;&#8208;methylstyrenes. This synergistic photoenzymatic system also demonstrates distinct stereochemical control, with the engineered active site simultaneously governing radical generation and subsequent enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer to afford a large range of &#947;&#8208;stereogenic nitriles in up to 93% yield, 94% ee &#8211; a transformation that poses considerable challenges for traditional transition metal catalysis. Beyond providing a robust platform for asymmetric cyanoalkylation, this work significantly advances photoenzymatic catalysis by establishing unactivated alkyl bromides as viable radical precursors for selective bond formations.

&lt;p&gt;The present work showcases a photoenzymatic platform using bromoacetonitrile as a practical cyanide source for asymmetric &#947;-hydrocyanation of alkenes. The system enables direct activation of inert aliphatic C&#9472;Br bonds via engineered ene-reductases (PETNR H182M) under visible light. Remarkably, the enzyme achieves excellent enantiocontrol through stereoselective hydrogen atom transfer within its active site

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic strategies for direct cyano group incorporation remain underdeveloped, creating synthetic bottlenecks for accessing chiral nitrile derivatives in pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we have developed a photoenzymatic &#947;-hydrocyanation strategy that addresses this gap. The system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in activating the challenging aliphatic C&#9472;Br bond of bromoacetonitrile through engineered ene-reductase catalysis. Upon visible light excitation, the reduced flavin cofactor generates cyanomethyl radicals that are spatially confined and precisely oriented within the enzyme's active site for efficient coupling with &#945;-methylstyrenes. This synergistic photoenzymatic system also demonstrates distinct stereochemical control, with the engineered active site simultaneously governing radical generation and subsequent enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer to afford a large range of &#947;-stereogenic nitriles in up to 93% yield, 94% ee &#8211; a transformation that poses considerable challenges for traditional transition metal catalysis. Beyond providing a robust platform for asymmetric cyanoalkylation, this work significantly advances photoenzymatic catalysis by establishing unactivated alkyl bromides as viable radical precursors for selective bond formations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the Origin of Substrate Specificity of Enzymes from the Amidohydrolase Superfamily</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive analyses of two enzyme classes from the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS) revealed that catalysis proceeds either via 1,4 or 1,6 nucleophilic conjugate addition and that this property defines substrate specificity. Moreover, although all substrates and products are entirely achiral, this mechanistic difference results in an inverted enantioselectivity for fleeting chiral intermediates in the two analyzed AHS classes.








Abstract
The sequencing of numerous genomes has led to the identification of open reading frames for millions of enzymes, many of which use unknown substrates. Hence, the identification of both primary and promiscuous activities remains a major challenge for enzyme research. Here, we identified the mechanistic basis of substrate specificity for members of the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS). Comprehensive analyses of two AHS classes revealed that catalysis proceeds either via 1,4 or 1,6 nucleophilic conjugate addition mediated by a glutamine that is located at two different positions within the active site thereby shaping substrate scope in these enzymes. These different enzymatic properties result in an inverted enantioselectivity for fleeting chiral intermediates, which are transient chiral species on the reaction pathway from an achiral substrate to an achiral product. Moreover, we demonstrated that catalysis focuses on conserved core structures rather than on all moieties of a given substrate, which increases the degree of promiscuity and evolvability in these enzymes. Using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we showed that an enzyme specialized in a specific nucleophilic conjugate addition can both readily adapt to secondary substrates and accommodate novel substrates by few amino acid exchanges. Hence, our study reveals mechanistic principles that underly substrate specificity, promiscuity, and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Monitoring Enzyme Clustering in a Highly Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering was used to probe porosity changes in the high&#8208;q range (0.06&#8211;0.4 &#197;&#8722;1) of a highly crystalline Tb&#8208;mesoMOF. The appearance of a broad scattering feature at low&#8208;q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&#8722;1) in Cyt. c@Tb&#8208;mesoMOF indicates enzyme clustering within the framework across long&#8208;range length scales.








Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level investigation of enzyme behavior in confined, cell&#8208;free environments is essential to understanding intrinsic properties and optimizing systems for desired functions. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide unique structural features that enable the immobilization of bulky biomolecules and allow direct probing of enzymatic behavior under confinement. Here, small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) was employed to probe porosity changes in a highly crystalline Tb&#8208;mesoMOF and to reveal the spatial arrangement of encapsulated enzymes across long&#8208;range length scales. Structural characteristics such as framework void space were resolved by SANS, while contrast&#8208;matching experiments using D2O/H2O mixtures suppressed background scattering from the MOF and isolated the enzyme contribution. Compared to unloaded Tb&#8208;mesoMOF, cytochrome c (Cyt. c)&#8208;loaded Tb&#8208;mesoMOF exhibited the emergence of a broad scattering feature at low q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&#8722;1), indicative of enzyme clustering within the framework, accompanied by enhanced loading rate and capacity. Additional structural analyses using complementary techniques further corroborated these findings.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Ketone Hydrogenation to Secondary Alcohols with High Activity and Selectivity Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic screening identifies Ru nanoparticles on carbon black (RuNP/C) as an efficient electrocatalyst for acetone hydrogenation via a hydrogen atom transfer pathway, enabled by optimized acetone and hydrogen adsorption. RuNP/C achieves 95% isopropanol Faradaic efficiency at 250 mA cm&#8722;2 and 99% single&#8208;pass conversion in the membrane electrode assembly, and selectively hydrogenates diverse ketones to secondary alcohols.








Abstract
Secondary alcohols are indispensable building blocks in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers, yet their conventional synthesis routes are energy and resource intensive. Electrochemical ketone hydrogenation under ambient conditions offers an attractive approach to synthesize secondary alcohols, but this process is often hindered by base&#8208;catalyzed self&#8208;condensation, hydrogenolysis, and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate that Ru nanoparticles supported on commercial carbon black (RuNP/C) can enable efficient, selective, and stable electrochemical hydrogenation of a wide range of structurally diverse ketones to produce corresponding secondary alcohols under ambient conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal that RuNP/C can simultaneously promote generation of reactive hydrogen species and adsorption of ketone molecules, facilitating rapid transfer of reactive hydrogen species to adsorbed ketone molecules, thereby enabling efficient secondary alcohols formation and suppressing HER. This work opens a green and sustainable pathway for ketone upgrading.
