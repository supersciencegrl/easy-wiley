         <title>Chiral Polar Bifunctional Polyimide Enantiomers for Asymmetric Photo&#8208; and Piezo&#8208;catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral catalysts for asymmetric catalysis represent a crucial research focus in chemistry and materials science. However, a few cases about chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalysts primarily focus on plasmonic noble metals. Particularly, developing chiral nano&#8208;catalysts that can be driven by mechanical energy remains in the blank stage. Herein, organic polymer&#8208;based enantiomers, chiral polar polyimide (PI) microspheric nano&#8208;assembly are synthesized as novel bifunctional catalysts for asymmetric photocatalysis and piezocatalysis. The PI catalyst enantiomers present enantioselectivity towards left&#8208; and right&#8208;circularly polarized light, demonstrating chiral&#8208;dependent H2O2 photoproduction. Interestingly, enantioselectivity of the catalyst reverses under irradiation of different bands, presenting tunability in the interaction between chiral catalysts and circularly polarized light. For the first time, enantioselective piezocatalytic behavior is demonstrated by the chiral polar PI catalysts. They show remarkable chiral preference for asymmetric Diels&#8208;Alder reaction and enantioselective conversion of tyrosine substrates under ultrasonic vibration. The findings provide a new perspective into exploring metal&#8208;free chiral catalysts and their asymmetric catalysis applications across multiple energy forms.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconfiguring the Hydrogen Networks of Aqueous Electrolyte to Stabilize Iron Hexacyanoferrate for High&#8208;Voltage pH&#8208;Decoupled Cell</title>

Proton insertion&#8208;induced local pH increase leads to PBA dissolution. Our strategy locks water molecules to disrupt the proton diffusion's hydrogen bond network, inhibit the proton insertion, and stabilize electrode pH, consequently ensuring stable PBA cathode cycling.







Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are promising insertion&#8208;type cathode materials for different types of aqueous batteries, capable of accommodating metal or non&#8208;metal ions. However, their practical application is hindered by their susceptibility to dissolution, which leads to a shortened lifespan. Herein, we have revealed that the dissolution of PBAs primarily originates from the locally elevated pH of electrolytes, which is caused by the proton co&#8208;insertion during discharge. To address this issue, the water&#8208;locking strategy has been implemented, which interrupts the generation and Grotthuss diffusion of protons by breaking the well&#8208;connected hydrogen bonding network in aqueous electrolytes. As a result, the hybrid electrolyte enables the iron hexacyanoferrate to endure over 1000&#8197;cycles at a 1&#8197;C rate and supports a high&#8208;voltage pH&#8208;decoupled cell with an average voltage of 1.95&#8197;V. These findings provide insights for mitigating the dissolution of electrode materials, thereby enhancing the viability and performance of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Bltter&#8208;pyr radical/cobalt interface is investigated. We found that changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allows screening, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces in view of their potential applications in spintronics.







Abstract
In this work, we study the interface obtained by depositing a monolayer of a Blatter radical derivative on polycrystalline cobalt. By examining the occupied and unoccupied states at the interface, using soft X&#8208;ray techniques, combined with electronic structure calculations, we could simultaneously determine the electronic structure of both the molecular and ferromagnetic sides of the interface, thus obtaining a full understanding of the interfacial magnetic properties. We found that the molecule is strongly hybridized with the surface. Changes in the core level spectra reflect the modification of the molecule and the cobalt electronic structures inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. Our method allowed us to screen, beforehand, organic/ferromagnetic interfaces given their potential applications in spintronics.

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetic acid, a key intermediate compound, is synthesized by oxidization of ethane with H2O2 at 0&#8201;&#176;C at ambient pressure through an integrated thermal catalysis and photocatalysis. The selectivity for producing acetic acid reaches 98.7&#8201;%. The positively charged Pd1 atom with an adsorbed OH group is the site for activating the first C&#8722;H of C2H6 with an energy barrier of only 0.14&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high&#8208;temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g&#8208;C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single&#8208;atom sites. In situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single&#8208;atom of OH&#8722;Pd1

/g&#8208;C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C&#8722;H instead of C&#8722;C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14&#8197;eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7&#8201;%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#8201;&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis. This integration of photocatalysis in low&#8208;temperature oxidation demonstrates a new route of selective oxidation of light alkanes.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production by MOF&#8208;Derived Metal Oxide Heterojunctions with a 10.0&#8201;% Apparent Quantum Yield</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pyrolysis of Ti(IV)&#8208; and Ru(II/III)&#8208;based MOFs results in the formation of metal oxide heterojunctions, which exhibit photocatalytic activity for water reduction and hydrogen generation, achieving an apparent quantum yield of 10.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production offers an alternative pathway to establish a sustainable energy economy, utilizing the Earth's natural sunlight and water resources to address environmental concerns associated with fossil fuel combustion. While numerous photoactive materials exhibit high potential for generating hydrogen from water, the synergy achieved by combining two different materials with complementary properties in the form of heterojunctions can significantly enhance the rate of hydrogen production and quantum efficiency. Our study describes the design and generation of the metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;derived (MOF) metal oxide heterojunction herein referred to as RTTA, composed of RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2. The RuO2/N,S&#8208;TiO2 is generated through the pyrolysis of MOFs, Ru&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1, and the amino&#8208;functionalized MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2 in the presence of thiourea. Among the various RTTA materials tested, RTTA&#8208;1, characterized by the lowest RuO2 content, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate, producing 10,761&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;hr&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 of hydrogen with an apparent quantum yield of 10.0&#8201;% in pure water containing glycerol. In addition to RTTA&#8208;1, we generated two other MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide heterojunctions, namely ZTTA&#8208;1 (ZnO/N,S&#8208;TiO2) and ITTA&#8208;1 (In2O3/N,S&#8208;TiO2). These heterojunctions were tested for their photocatalytic activity, leading to apparent quantum yields of 0.7&#8201;% and 0.3&#8201;%, respectively. The remarkable photocatalytic activity observed in RTTA&#8208;1 is thought to be attributed to the synergistic effects arising from the combination of metallic properties inherent in the metal oxides, complemented by the presence of suitable band alignment, porosity, and surface properties inherited from the parent MOFs. These properties enhance electron transfer and restrict hole movement. The photocatalytic efficiency of RTTA&#8208;1 was further demonstrated in actual water samples, producing hydrogen with a rate of 8,190&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;hr&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 in tap water, and 6,390&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;hr&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 in river water.

     alt="Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production by MOF-Derived Metal Oxide Heterojunctions with a 10.0&#8201;% Apparent Quantum Yield"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pyrolysis of Ti(IV)- and Ru(II/III)-based MOFs results in the formation of metal oxide heterojunctions, which exhibit photocatalytic activity for water reduction and hydrogen generation, achieving an apparent quantum yield of 10.0&#8201;%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic hydrogen production offers an alternative pathway to establish a sustainable energy economy, utilizing the Earth's natural sunlight and water resources to address environmental concerns associated with fossil fuel combustion. While numerous photoactive materials exhibit high potential for generating hydrogen from water, the synergy achieved by combining two different materials with complementary properties in the form of heterojunctions can significantly enhance the rate of hydrogen production and quantum efficiency. Our study describes the design and generation of the metal&#8211;organic framework-derived (MOF) metal oxide heterojunction herein referred to as RTTA, composed of RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N,S-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N,S-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is generated through the pyrolysis of MOFs, Ru-HKUST-1, and the amino-functionalized MIL-125-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of thiourea. Among the various RTTA materials tested, RTTA-1, characterized by the lowest RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content, exhibited the highest hydrogen evolution rate, producing 10,761&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;hr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of hydrogen with an apparent quantum yield of 10.0&#8201;% in pure water containing glycerol. In addition to RTTA-1, we generated two other MOF-derived metal oxide heterojunctions, namely ZTTA-1 (ZnO/N,S-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ITTA-1 (In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/N,S-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). These heterojunctions were tested for their photocatalytic activity, leading to apparent quantum yields of 0.7&#8201;% and 0.3&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Strengthening an Intramolecular Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bond to Get in Shape for Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) are not considered strong interactions, they can profoundly affect molecular interactions. One prominent example is the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx. When the CH3 group of l&#8208;fucose is replaced by CF3, the intramolecular non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond approaches the strength of a classical H&#8208;bond. Thus, although currently underestimated, non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds should find a place in the toolbox for structural design.







Abstract
In this research article, we report on the strengthening of a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) by introducing electron withdrawing groups at the carbon atom. The approach is demonstrated on the example of derivatives of the physiological E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx (1, sLex). Its affinity is mainly due to a beneficial entropy term, which is predominantly caused by the pre&#8208;organization of sLex in its binding conformation. We have shown, that among the elements responsible for the pre&#8208;organization, the stabilization by a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond between the H&#8722;C5 of l&#8208;fucose and the ring oxygen O5 of the neighboring d&#8208;galactose moiety is essential and yields 7.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This effect could be further strengthened by replacing l&#8208;fucose by 6,6,6&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;l&#8208;fucose leading to an improved non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond of 14.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, i.e., an improved pre&#8208;organization in the bioactive conformation. For a series of glycomimetics of sLex (1), this outcome could be confirmed by high field NMR&#8208;shifts of the H&#8722;C5Fuc, by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of glycomimetics co&#8208;crystallized with E&#8208;selectin as well as by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the CF3&#8208;group beneficially influences the pharmacokinetic properties of sLex mimetics. Thus, acid&#8208;stability, a prerequisite for gastrointestinal stability, could be substantially improved.

         <title>Nonalternant B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Containing Azepines: Programmable Synthesis, Responsive Chiroptical Properties and Spontaneous Resolution into a Single&#8208;Handed Helix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a programmable and modular approach to fledged B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes was achieved by stepwise Scholl reactions with privileged formation of [9]helicene moiety. The controllable integration of negatively curved azepines into 6 afforded the dynamic chiral skeleton, which induced spontaneous resolution into single&#8208;handed helix at the single&#8208;crystal scale.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes (NGs) constitute an important and appealing class of intrinsically chiral materials. In this work, a series of B,N&#8208;embedded helical NGs (BN&#8208;HNGs) bearing azepines was synthesized via stepwise regioselective cyclodehydrogenation. First, the phenyl&#8208; or nitrogen&#8208;bridged dimers were efficiently clipped into highly congested model compounds 1 and 2. Later, the controllable Scholl reactions of the tetraphenyl&#8208;tethered precursor generated 1, 7 or 8 new C&#8722;C bonds, thereby establishing a robust method for the preparation of nonalternant BN&#8208;HNGs with up to 31 fused rings. The helical bilayer nature was unambiguously verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The helical chirality was transferred to the stereogenic boron centers upon fluoride coordination, with a concave&#8208;concave structure to comply with the bilayer skeleton. Notably, the largest nonalternant BN&#8208;HNG (6) spontaneously resolved into a homochiral 41 helix structure as a molecular spiral staircase during crystallization via conglomerate formation at the single&#8208;crystal scale. The large twisted C2&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;surface and the dynamic chiral skeleton induced by curved azepines might have synergistic effects on self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers of 6 to achieve the intriguing spontaneous resolution behavior. The chiroptical properties of the enantiomer of 6 were further investigated, revealing that 6 had a strong chiroptical response in the visible range (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).

         <title>An Organophosphorescence Probe with Ultralong Lifetime and Intrinsic Tissue Selectivity for Specific Tumor Imaging and Guided Tumor Surgery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study systematically compared the influence of phosphorescence emission intensity, lifetime, and wavelength on bioimaging performance, demonstrating that the phosphorescence lifetime is the primary factor. Importantly, the inherent ability of Fe ions to quench the phosphorescence of organic phosphorescent materials was verified. Finally, phosphorescent materials were designed for the specific imaging of liver tumors.







Abstract
Organic phosphorescent materials are excellent candidates for use in tumor imaging. However, a systematic comparison of the effects of the intensity, lifetime, and wavelength of phosphorescent emissions on bioimaging performance has not yet been undertaken. In addition, there have been few reports on organic phosphorescent materials that specifically distinguish tumors from normal tissues. This study addresses these gaps and reveals that longer lifetimes effectively increase the signal intensity, whereas longer wavelengths enhance the penetration depth. Conversely, a strong emission intensity with a short lifetime does not necessarily yield robust imaging signals. Building upon these findings, an organo&#8208;phosphorescent material with a lifetime of 0.94&#8197;s was designed for tumor imaging. Remarkably, the phosphorescent signals of various organic nanoparticles are nearly extinguished in blood&#8208;rich organs because of the quenching effect of iron ions. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrated that iron ions universally quench the phosphorescence of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials, which is an inherent property of such substances. Leveraging this property, both the normal liver and hepatitis tissues exhibit negligible phosphorescent signals, whereas liver tumors display intense phosphorescence. Therefore, phosphorescent materials, unlike chemiluminescent or fluorescent materials, can exploit this unique inherent property to selectively distinguish liver tumor tissues from normal tissues without additional modifications or treatments.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ripening Enabled by Hygroscopic Salts for Hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;Free Printable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 20&#8201;%</title>

Room&#8208;temperature ripening induced by the synergy of hygroscopic salt and moisture is reported for preparing efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with efficiency surpassing 20&#8201;%. The post&#8208;treatment enables significant secondary crystallization of perovskite through moisture absorption which liquefies the grain boundary and activates sufficient mass transfer by offering channels and promoting desired dissolution.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskite films generally possess small grain sizes and high density of grain boundaries, which intensify non&#8208;radiative recombination of carriers and limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. In this study, we report the room&#8208;temperature ripening enabled by the synergy of hygroscopic salts and moisture in air for efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs). Treating perovskite films with proper hygroscopic salts in damp air induces obvious secondary recrystallization, which coarsens the grains size from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. It's proposed that the hygroscopic salt at grain boundaries could absorb moisture and form a complex which could not only serve as mass transfer channel but also assist in the dissolution of perovskite grains. This activates mass transfer between small grains and large grains since they possess different solubilities, and thus ripens the perovskite film. Consequently, p&#8208;MPSCs treated with the hygroscopic salt of NH4SCN show an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.13&#8201;% from 17.94&#8201;%, and maintain &gt;98&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point tracking at 55&#177;5&#8201;&#176;C for 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Intense Circularly Polarized Luminescence Induced by Chiral Supramolecular Assembly: The Importance of Intermolecular Electronic Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>

We report highly emissive CPL emitter with |glum| values of 0.11 based on organic microcrystals, resulting from the intermolecular electronic coupling in chiral stacking.







Abstract
Herein we report on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) emission originating from supramolecular chirality of organic microcrystals with a |glum| value up to 0.11. The microcrystals were prepared from highly emissive difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonate (BF2dbk) dyes R&#8208;1 or S&#8208;1 with chiral binaphthol (BINOL) skeletons. R&#8208;1 and S&#8208;1 exhibit undetectable CPL signals in solution but manifest intense CPL emission in their chiral microcrystals. The chiral superstructures induced by BINOL skeletons were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal XRD analysis. Spectral analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that intermolecular electronic coupling, mediated by the asymmetric stacking in the chiral superstructures, effectively alters excited&#8208;state electronic structures and facilitates electron transitions perpendicular to BF2bdk planes. The coupling increases cos&#952;&#956;,m from 0.05 (monomer) to 0.86 (tetramer) and triggers intense optical activity of BF2bdk. The results demonstrate that optical activity of chromophores within assemblies can be regulated by both orientation and extent of intermolecular electronic couplings.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven Dynamic Combinatorial Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) using a catalytic reaction cycle to form transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. Fueled by a chemical reaction, the library explores liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and advances DCC by engineering peptide structures, paving the way for tunable materials exhibiting emergent, life&#8208;like behaviors.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) creates libraries of molecules that are constantly interchanging in a dynamic combinatorial library. When a library member self&#8208;assembles, it can displace the equilibria, leading to emergent phenomena like its selection or even its replication. However, such dynamic combinatorial libraries typically operate in or close to equilibrium. This work introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry fueled by a catalytic reaction cycle that forms transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. The products in this library exist out of equilibrium at the expense of fuel and are thus regulated by kinetics and thermodynamics. By creating a chemically fueled dynamic combinatorial library with the vast structural space of amino acids, we explored the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behavior of the library members. The study advances DCCs by showing that peptide structures can be engineered to control the dynamic library&#8242;s behavior. The work paves the way for creating novel, tunable material systems that exhibit emergent behavior reminiscent of biological systems. These findings have implications for the development of new materials and for understanding life&#8242;s chemistry.

A &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy has been used for fabricating high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes for gas separation. The methanol scaffolds contribute in two ways: methanol&#8208;activated monomer dissolution facilitates equilibrium shifts, and methanol&#8208;guided hydrogen bonding stabilizes the monomer in a thermodynamically favored state. As a result, these HOF membranes display improved hydrogen separation performance.







Abstract
We introduce a &#8220;solution&#8208;processing&#8208;transformation&#8221; strategy, deploying solvent vapor as scaffolds, to fabricate high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes. This strategy can overcome the mismatch in processing conditions and crystal growth thermodynamics faced during the facile solution processing of the membrane. The procedure includes the vapor&#8208;trigged in situ transformation of dense amorphous supramolecules to crystalline HOF&#8208;16, with HOF&#8208;11 as the transient state. The mechanism involves a vapor&#8208;activated dissolution&#8208;precipitation equilibrium shifting and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided molecule rearrangement, elucidated through combined experimental and theoretical analysis. Upon removal of the molecular scaffolds, the resulting HOF&#8208;16 membranes showcase significant improvement in hydrogen separation performance over their amorphous counterparts and previously reported HOF membranes. The method's broad applicability is evidenced by successfully extending it to other substrates and HOF structures. This study provides a fundamental understanding of guest&#8208;induced ordered supramolecular assembly and paves the way for the advanced manufacture of high&#8208;performance HOF membranes for gas separation processes.

A flexible crystalline Werner&#8208;type Cd(II) complex containing photoreactive ligands displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition type reactivity in the solid state, and associated unique properties including a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced development of porosity.







Abstract
Flexible crystalline solids exhibit unique properties in response to external stimuli like heat and light. However, challenges exist in developing crystalline solids that have similar degrees of flexibility as in solution. Herein, we report the preparation of the new flexible crystalline metal complex [Cd(CF3SO3)2(4&#8208;spy)4] (4&#8208;spy=4&#8208;styrylpyridine), which contains photoreactive 4&#8208;spy ligand. Unlike traditional solids, this metal complex displays solution state&#8208;like [2+2] photocycloaddition reactivity. Specifically, UV irradiation of the crystalline material leads to formation of the same diverse array of dimers and cis isomer that are generated by photoreaction in the solution state. In addition, the photoresponsive flexibility of the solid leads to a photosalient effect and photo&#8208;induced formation of pores. The origin of the solution state&#8208;like photoreactivity of the solid is related to properties of the Cd(II) cation and fluorinated CF3SO3 anion, and the multi&#8208;orientational arrangement of the 4&#8208;spy ligands.

         <title>Regulating Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphasial Reactions by Zwitterionic Binder Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes and Silicon&#8208;Graphite Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic binder is designed to achieve an anion&#8208;enriched solvation environment on Si&#8208;based anodes with weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating the formation of a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Such binder&#8208;regulated SEI is effective in minimizing the catalytic decomposition of the electrolyte and Si devitalization, thus enabling long&#8208;life full cells with Si&#8208;graphite anodes and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes.







Abstract
The practical application of silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes faces challenges due to severe structural and interphasial degradations. These challenges are exacerbated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) employing Si&#8208;based anodes with high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes, as significant transition&#8208;metal crossover catalyzes serious parasitic side reactions, leading to faster cell failure. While enhancing the mechanical properties of polymer binders has been acknowledged as an effective means of improving solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability on Si&#8208;based anodes, an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the binder chemistry influences the SEI is lacking. Herein, a zwitterionic binder with an ability to manipulate the chemical composition and spatial distribution of the SEI layer is designed for Si&#8208;based anodes. It is evidenced that the electrically charged microenvironment created by the zwitterionic species alters the solvation environment on the Si&#8208;based anode, featuring rich anions and weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. Such a binder&#8208;regulated solvation environment induces a thin, uniform, robust SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes, which is found to be the key to withstanding transition&#8208;metal deposition and minimizing their detrimental impact on catalyzing electrolyte decomposition and devitalizing bulk Si. As a result, albeit possessing comparable mechanical properties to those of commercial binders, the zwitterionic binder enables superior cycling performances in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs under demanding operating conditions.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Template&#8208;Guided Synthesis of High&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies for Humidity Gradient&#8208;Based Power Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organized assembly of fundamental building blocks into intricate molecular architectures remains challenging due to the dynamic building blocks. A general strategy has been developed to synthesize high&#8208;dimensional complex architectures by choosing appropriate anion templates and flexible, non&#8208;planar organic linkers. Further, the complex architecture possesses multifunctions suitable for humidity&#8208;electric power generation.







Abstract
Systematically orchestrating fundamental building blocks into intricate high&#8208;dimensional molecular assemblies at molecular level is imperative for multifunctionality integration. However, this remains a formidable task in crystal engineering due to the dynamic nature of inorganic building blocks. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;template&#8208;guided strategy to control building blocks. The coordination modes of ligands and the spatial hindrance of anionic templates are pivotal in dictating the overall structures. Flexible multi&#8208;dentate linkers selectively promote the formation of oligomeric assembly ([TeO3(Mo2O2S2)3O2(OH)(C5O2H7)3]4&#8722; {TeMo6}) into tetrahedral cages ([(TeO3)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O4P)6]8&#8722; {Te4Mo24} and [(AsO4)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O6)4]12&#8722; {As4Mo24}), while steric hindrance from anionic templates further assists in assembling cages into an open quadruply twisted M&#246;bius nanobelt ([(C6H5O3P)8(Mo2O2S2)24(OH)24(C8H10O4)12]16&#8722; {P8Mo48}). Among these structures, the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic hybrid cage {Te4Mo24} emerges as an exemplary molecular model for proton conduction and serves as a prototype for humidity gradient&#8208;based power generators (HGPGs). The Te4Mo24&#8208;PVDF&#8208;based HGPG (PVDF=Poly(vinylidene fluoride)) exhibits notable stability and power generation, yielding an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.51&#8197;V and a current density of 77.8&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Further insights into the interactions between water molecules and microscale molecules within the generator are achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. This endeavor unveils a universal strategy for synthesizing multifunctional integration molecules.

         <title>Dyotropic Rearrangement of an Iron&#8211;Aluminium Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report the reactivity of an iron&#8208;aluminium complex with CO and isocyanides. DFT calculations suggest that these reactions occur through a dyotropic rearrangement, which is exceedingly rare for bimetallic systems. The rearrangement fundamentally changes the nature of the hydride ligands, exposing new reactivity as evidenced by insertion reactions with CO2, isocyanates, and isocyanides.







Abstract
Ligand exchange processes at metal complexes underpin their reactivity and catalytic applications. While mechanisms of ligand exchange at single site complexes are well established, occurring through textbook associative, dissociative and interchange mechanisms, those involving heterometallic complexes are less well developed. Here we report the reactions of a well&#8208;defined Fe&#8722;Al dihydride complex with exogenous ligands (CO and CNR, R=Me, tBu, Xyl=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3). Based on DFT calculations we suggest that these reactions occur through a dyotropic rearrangement, this involves initial coordination of the exogenous ligand at Al followed by migration to Fe, with simultaneous migration of a hydride ligand from Fe to Al. Such processes are rare for heterometallic complexes. We study the bonding and mechanism of the dyotropic rearrangement through in&#8208;depth computational analysis (NBO, IBOs, CLMO analysis, QTAIM, NCIplot, IGMH), shedding new light on how the electronic structure of the heterometallic core responds to the migration of ligands between metal sites. The dyotropic rearrangement fundamentally changes the nature of the hydride ligands, exposing new nucleophilic reactivity as evidenced by insertion reactions with CO2, isocyanates, as well as isocyanides.

         <title>New Insights for High&#8208;Throughput CO2 Hydrogenation to High&#8208;Quality Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>

The multifunctional catalytic system of the composite NaFeGaZr&amp;HZSM&#8208;5 catalyst exhibits rapid responsiveness to high&#8208;throughput CO2 hydrogenation, leading to the production of liquid fuels that meet commercial gasoline standards. With an impressive space&#8208;time yield of 0.9&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, this achievement bears significant strategic importance for advancing the future development of sustainable energy.







Abstract
In the case of CO2 thermal&#8208;catalytic hydrogenation, highly selective olefin generation and subsequent olefin secondary reactions to fuel hydrocarbons in an ultra&#8208;short residence time is a huge challenge, especially under industrially feasible conditions. Here, we report a pioneering synthetic process that achieves selective production of high&#8208;volume commercial gasoline with the assistance of fast response mechanism. In situ experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the designed NaFeGaZr presents exceptional carbiding prowess, and swiftly forms carbides even at extremely brief gas residence times, facilitating olefin production. The created successive hollow zeolite HZSM&#8208;5 further reinforces aromatization of olefin diffused from NaFeGaZr via optimized mass transfer in the hollow channel of zeolite. Benefiting from its rapid response mechanism within the multifunctional catalytic system, this catalyst effectively prevents the excessive hydrogenation of intermediates and controls the swift conversion of intermediates into aromatics, even in high&#8208;throughput settings. This enables a rapid one&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons without any post&#8208;treatment, with high commercial product compatibility and space&#8208;time yield up to 0.9&#8197;kggasoline&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1. These findings from the current work can provide a shed for the preparation of efficient catalysts and in&#8208;depth understanding of C1 catalysis in industrial level.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Heterobenzylic Amines via Carbonyl Azinylative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium metal&#8208;mediated carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) reaction provides an operationally straightforward protocol for the multicomponent coupling carbonyls, amines and 2&#8208;iodo azines to form &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines. This modular reaction displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. These amines possess a high degree of functionality, are challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs attractive to the design of bioactive molecules.







Abstract
Transformations enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines by addition of 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;based nucleophiles to in situ&#8208;generated and non&#8208;activated alkyl&#8208;substituted iminium ions are extremely rare. Approaches involving classical 2&#8208;azinyl organometallics, such as the corresponding Grignard reagents, often fail to produce the desired products. Here, we report an operationally straightforward solution to this problem through the development of a multicomponent coupling process wherein a soft 2&#8208;azinyl indium nucleophile, generated in situ from the corresponding 2&#8208;iodo heteroarene and indium powder, adds to an iminium ion that is also formed directly in the reaction. This modular carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. Beyond the addition to iminium ions, the 2&#8208;azinyl addition to polyfluoromethyl ketones forms the corresponding tertiary alcohols. Together, the products of these reactions possess a high degree of functionality, are typically challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs recognized as privileged in the context of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

         <title>Unravelling White Phosphorus: Experimental and Computational Studies Reveal the Mechanisms of P4 Hydrostannylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed computational and experimental investigations are reported into the mechanism(s) of P4 hydrostannylation, revealing key factors behind the success of this reaction and important guidelines for the development of future P4 functionalisation chemistry.







Abstract
The hydrostannylation of white phosphorus (P4) allows this crucial industrial precursor to be easily transformed into useful P1 products via direct, &#8216;one pot&#8217; (or even catalytic) procedures. However, a thorough mechanistic understanding of this transformation has remained elusive, hindering attempts to use this rare example of successful, direct P4 functionalization as a model for further reaction development. Here, we provide a deep and generalizable mechanistic picture for P4 hydrostannylation by combining DFT calculations with in situ 31P NMR reaction monitoring and kinetic trapping of previously unobservable reaction intermediates using bulky tin hydrides. The results offer important insights into both how this reaction proceeds and why it is successful and provide implicit guidelines for future research in the field of P4 activation.

         <title>Multiphoton&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Defluorination of Persistent Perfluoroalkyl Substances and Polymers by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkyl substances and fluorinated polymers were efficiently decomposed to fluoride ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals. The decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and fluorinated polymers (FPs) have been extensively utilized in various industries, whereas their extremely high stability poses environmental persistence and difficulty in waste treatment. Current decomposition approaches of PFASs and FPs typically require harsh conditions such as heating over 400&#8201;&#176;C. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop a new technique capable of decomposing them under mild conditions. Here, we demonstrated that perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), known as a &#8220;persistent chemical,&#8221; and Nafion, a widely utilized sulfonated FP for ion&#8208;exchange membranes, can be efficiently decomposed into fluorine ions under ambient conditions via the irradiation of visible LED light onto semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). PFOS was completely defluorinated within 8&#8208;h irradiation of 405&#8208;nm LED light, and the turnover number of the C&#8722;F bond dissociation per NC was 17200. Furthermore, 81&#8201;% defluorination of Nafion was achieved for 24&#8208;h light irradiation, demonstrating the efficient photocatalytic properties under visible light. We revealed that this decomposition is driven by cooperative mechanisms involving light&#8208;induced ligand displacements and Auger&#8208;induced electron injections via hydrated electrons and higher excited states. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of efficiently breaking down various PFASs and FPs under mild conditions but also paves the way for advancing toward a sustainable fluorine&#8208;recycling society.

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Steric Demand to Control Ligand Exchange and Domain Composition in Stratified Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs having diverse components partitioned into unique domains may exhibit cooperative properties and functions reliant on domain composition and ordering. Inter&#8208;domain ligand exchange scrambles components across domains. This study provides strategies for mitigating ligand exchange and thus controlling domain compositional integrity, factors that are critical for building robust structure&#8211;property relationships in these classes of MOFs.

Incorporating diverse components into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can expand their scope of properties and applications. Stratified MOFs (sMOFs) consist of compositionally unique concentric domains (strata), offering unprecedented complexity through partitioning of structural and functional components. However, the labile nature of metal&#8208;ligand coordination handicaps achieving compositionally distinct domains due to ligand exchange reactions occurring concurrently with secondary strata growth. To achieve complex sMOF compositions, characterizing and controlling the competing processes of new strata growth and ligand exchange are vital. This work systematically examines controlling ligand exchange in UiO&#8208;67 sMOFs by tuning ligand sterics. We present quantitative methods for assessing and visualizing the outcomes of strata growth and ligand exchange that rely on high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field images and elemental mapping via scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In addition, we leverage ligand sterics to create &#8216;blocking layers&#8217; that minimize ligand exchange between strata which are particularly susceptible to ligand exchange and inter&#8208;strata ligand mixing. Finally, we evaluate strata compositional integrity in various solvents and find that sMOFs can maintain their compositions for &gt;12&#8197;months in some cases. Collectively, these studies and methods enhance understanding and control over ligand placement in multi&#8208;domain MOFs, factors that underscore careful tunning of properties and function.

&lt;p&gt;MOFs having diverse components partitioned into unique domains may exhibit cooperative properties and functions reliant on domain composition and ordering. Inter-domain ligand exchange scrambles components across domains. This study provides strategies for mitigating ligand exchange and thus controlling domain compositional integrity, factors that are critical for building robust structure&#8211;property relationships in these classes of MOFs.

         <title>Scalable Production of 2D Non&#8208;Layered Metal Oxides through Metal&#8211;Organic Gel Rapid Redox Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) rapid redox transformation (MRRT) strategy is proposed for mass production of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous metal oxides with non&#8208;layered structure. 39 kinds of 2D oxides, including transition metal oxides, II&#8208;main group oxide, III&#8208;main group oxides, perovskite oxides, high entropy oxides are prepared by the MRRT method, demonstrating its great versatility. These 2D oxides show excellent capacitive deionization properties.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nonlayered metal compounds with porous structure show broad application prospects in electrochemistry&#8208;related fields due to their abundant active sites, open ions/electrons diffusion channels, and faradaic reactions. However, scalable and universal synthesis of 2D porous compounds still remains challenging. Here, inspired by blowing gum, a metal&#8208;organic gel (MOG) rapid redox transformation (MRRT) strategy is proposed for the mass production of a wide variety of 2D porous metal oxides. Adequate crosslinking degree of MOG precursor and its rapid redox with NO3&#8722; are critical for generating gas pressure from interior to exterior, thus blowing the MOG into 2D carbon nanosheets, which further act as self&#8208;sacrifice template for formation of oxides with porous and ultrathin structure. The versatility of this strategy is demonstrated by the fabrication of 39 metal oxides, including 10 transition metal oxides, one II&#8208;main group oxide, two III&#8208;main group oxides, 22 perovskite oxides, four high&#8208;entropy oxides. As an illustrative verification, the 2D transition metal oxides exhibit excellent capacitive deionization (CDI) performance. Moreover, the assembled CDI cell could act as desalting battery to supply electrical energy during electrode regeneration. This MRRT strategy offers opportunities for achieving universal synthesis of 2D porous oxides with nonlayered structures and studying their electrochemistry&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Overall 99&#8201;% (002) Plane Achieves Extreme and Direct Utilization of 95&#8201;% Zn Anode and By&#8208;Product as Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;sized (002) Zn anodes with an ultra&#8208;high RTC of 99&#8201;% are fabricated on non&#8208;textured substrates by the synergistic action of Mn3+ and H+ via a constant voltage electrodeposition strategy. The anode is capable of stable operation at ultra&#8208;high current densities &amp; areal capacities. Additionally, MnO2, a by&#8208;product of the 99&#8201;% RTC Zn (002) electrodeposition, can be used directly as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life cathode.







Abstract
Zn anode protection in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) face great challenges of high Zn utilization rate (i.e., depth of discharge, DOD) and high current density due to the large difficulty in obtaining an extreme overall RTC (relative texture coefficient) of Zn (002) plane. Through the potent interaction of Mn(III)aq and H+ with distinct Zn crystal planes under an electric field, large&#8208;size Zn foils with a breakthrough (002) plane RTC of 99&#8201;% (i.e., close to Zn single crystal) are electrodeposited on texture&#8208;less substrates, which is also applicable from recycled Zn. The ultra&#8208;high (002) plane RTC remarkably enhances cyclic performance of the Zn anode (70&#8201;% DOD @ 45.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and the DOD is even up to 95&#8201;% (@ 28.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with an electrolyte additive of polyaniline. Furthermore, MnO2, the by&#8208;product of electrodeposition, is directly used as cathode of both coin cell and pouch battery, surpassing the cyclic performance exhibited by the majority of Zn||MnO2 batteries in previous instances. These results demonstrate the great potential of our strategy for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale ZIBs.

         <title>Successively Controlling Nanoscale Wrinkles of Ultrathin 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose manipulating MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions to control the synthesis of wrinkled Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;CX nanosheets. Using C1 to C8 acids as modulators, varying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity alters wrinkle sizes. Increased hydrophobicity strengthens MOF&#8208;MOF interactions and weakens MOF&#8208;solvent interactions, producing larger wrinkles. Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C2, Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C3, and Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 show increased nanoscale wrinkles, with Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 having the largest pores, enhancing GC separation performance.







Abstract
The wrinkles are pervasive in ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, but the regulation of wrinkles is rarely explored systematically. Here, we employed a series of carboxylic acids (from formic acid to octanoic acid) to control the wrinkles of Zr&#8208;BTB (BTB=1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet. The wrinkles at the micrometer scale were observed with transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field (HAADF) images showed lattice distortion in many nanoscale regions, which was precisely matched to the nano&#8208;wrinkles. With the changes of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions were possibly synergistically regulated and wrinkles with different sizes were obtained, which was supported by HAADF, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculation. Different wrinkle sizes resulted in different pore sizes between the Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheet interlayers, providing highly&#8208;oriented thin films and the successive optimization of kinetic diffusion pathways, proved by grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and nitrogen adsorption. The most suitable wrinkle pore from Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 exhibited highly efficient chromatographic separation of the substituted benzene isomers. Our work provides a rational route for the modulation of nanoscale wrinkles and their stacked pores of MOF nanosheets and improves the separation abilities of MOFs.

CB[6] favors ordered aggregation into one&#8208;dimensional fibrous nanoarchitectures that greatly facilitates the supramolecular chirality. It suggests the great potential of CB[6] in the preparation and manipulation of supramolecular chiral assemblies, shedding light on the macrocycle&#8208;based functional chiroptical materials.







Abstract
Macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8211;guest complexation offers an intriguing protocol in producing chiroptical materials, while the bulky size and dynamic exchange between hosts and guests hinders the ordered aggregation to afford the long&#8208;range chiral arrangement. It remains great challenges in assembling cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) included complexes to induce supramolecular chirality ascribed to the excellent water solubility and flexible packing. Herein, we unveiled the structural basis on the formation of chiroptical coassemblies from CB[n] (n=6, 7) complexes. Perylene diimides (PDIs) with cationic chiral pendants formed complexes in the aqueous media, which selectively showed chiroptical properties. Chlorination at the bay position, increasing alkyl length of cationic chiral pendants or reducing the number of polyaromatic rings would hinder the chiral aggregation. In a comprehensive manner, CB[6] favors ordered aggregation into one&#8208;dimensional fibrous nanoarchitectures that greatly facilitates the supramolecular chirality. In contrast, CB[7] with larger cavity and water solubility shrinks the ordered arrangement of complexes, reducing the formation possibility of supramolecular chiral nanoarchitectures. This work suggests the great potential of CB[6] in the preparation and manipulation of supramolecular chiral assemblies, shedding light on the macrocycle&#8208;based functional chiroptical materials.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Acridines by Integrating Photo&#8208;Excitation of o&#8208;Alkyl Nitroarenes with Copper&#8208;Promoted Cascade Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We hereby introduce a potent and modular synthetic strategy for the assembly of valuable acridine architectures, leveraging the synergistic combination of photo&#8208;excitation of o&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with copper&#8208;mediated cascade annulation. This approach facilitates the rapid construction of a diverse collection of symmetric, unsymmetric, and poly&#8208;substituted acridines, which can be seamlessly converted into precious acridinium photocatalysts. Notably, certain members of this class exhibit extraordinary oxidative strength, thereby unlocking immense potential for advancing the realm of photochemical reactions.







Abstract
Acridine frameworks stand as pivotal architectural elements in pharmaceuticals and photocatalytic applications, owing to their chemical adaptability, biological activity, and unique excited&#8208;state dynamics. Conventional synthetic routes often entail specialized starting materials, anaerobic or moisture&#8208;free conditions, and elaborate multi&#8208;stage manipulations for incorporating diverse functionalities. Herein, we present a convergent approach integrating photo&#8208;excitation of readily available ortho&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with copper&#8208;promoted cascade annulation. This innovative system enables an aerobic, one&#8208;pot reaction of o&#8208;alkyl nitroarenes with arylboronic acids, thereby streamlining the modular construction of a wide array of acridine derivatives with various functional groups. This encompasses symmetrical, unsymmetrical and polysubstituted varieties, some of which are otherwise exceptionally difficult to synthesize. Furthermore, it significantly improves the production of structurally varied acridinium salts, featuring enhanced photophysical properties, high excited state potentials (E*red=2.08&#8211;3.15&#8197;V), and exhibiting superior performance in intricate photoredox transformations.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked [an]Daisy Chain Adhesives with Simultaneously Enhanced Interfacial Adhesion and Cohesion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In our study, we prepare an adhesive displaying a rare combination of strong interfacial bonding and enhanced cohesion via an elegant integration of orthogonal mechanical bonds and quadruple H&#8208;bonds in a single system. This work creates an exciting opportunity to prompt the development of adhesive materials with enhanced properties.







Abstract
Adhesives have been widely used to splice and repair materials to meet practical needs of humanity for thousands of years. However, developing robust adhesives with balanced adhesive and cohesive properties still remains a challenging task. Herein, we report the design and preparation of a robust mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain network (DCMIN) adhesive by orthogonal integration of mechanical bonds and 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidone (UPy) H&#8208;bonding in a single system. Specifically, the UPy moiety plays a dual role: it allows the formation of a cross&#8208;linked network and engages in multivalent interactions with the substrate for strong interfacial bonding. The mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain, serving as the polymeric backbone of the adhesive, is able to effectively alleviate applied stress and uphold network integrity through synergistic intramolecular motions, and thus significantly improves the cohesive performance. Comparative analysis with the control made of the same quadruple H&#8208;bonding network but with non&#8208;interlocked [an]daisy chain backbones demonstrates that our DCMIN possesses superior adhesion properties over a wide temperature range. These findings not only contribute to a deep understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship between microscopic mechanical bond motions and macroscopic adhesive properties but also provide a valuable guide for optimizing design principles of robust adhesives.

         <title>Preformation of Insoluble Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Highly Reversible Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) show promise for future energy storage. However, the dissolution of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) severely deteriorates their performance. Herein, the quantified correlation between SEI solubility and SEI components is established, inspiring a feasible strategy to preform the insoluble SEI with 80.0&#8201;% capacity retention over 900&#8197;cycles in a practical full cell within a commercial electrolyte.







Abstract
A stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for cycling reversibility of Na&#8208;ion batteries by mitigating continuous side reactions. So far, the severe SEI dissolution leads to low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and short cycle life. Meanwhile, the quantified relationship between SEI components and their solubility remains unclear. In this work, we establish the direct correlation between SEI components and SEI solubility, and quantify that the solubility of organic&#8208;rich SEI is 3.26&#8197;times of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. We further propose a feasible strategy to preform inorganic&#8208;rich insoluble SEI and demonstrate a practical hard carbon (HC)||NaMn0.33Fe0.33Ni0.33O2 full cell in a commercial electrolyte of 1&#8197;M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) with 80.0&#8201;% capacity retention for 900&#8197;cycles, and achieve a record&#8208;high average CE of 99.95&#8201;% for a practical Na&#8208;ion full cell. This study provides an effective strategy of preforming insoluble SEI to suppress its dissolution towards highly reversible Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Low&#8208;Dispersity Polymers via Free Radical Alternating Copolymerization: Effects of Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced free radical polymerization was established to enable scalable preparation of alternating copolymers across low to high dispersities, compatible with fluorinated/non&#8208;fluorinated monomers and binary/ternary/quaternary copolymerizations. The correlation between dispersity control and charge transfer complexes was elucidated through DFT calculations, model experiments and Monte Carlo simulation&#8208;based machine learning methods.







Abstract
Alternating copolymers are crucial for diverse applications. While dispersity (&#208;, also known as molecular weight distribution, MWD) influences the properties of polymers, achieving low dispersities in alternating copolymers poses a notable challenge via free radical polymerizations (FRPs). In this work, we demonstrated an unexpected discovery that dispersities are affected by the participation of charge transfer complexes (CTCs) formed between monomer pairs during free radical alternating copolymerization, which have inspired the successful synthesis of various alternating copolymers with low dispersities (&gt;30&#8197;examples, &#208;=1.13&#8211;1.39) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The synthetic method is compatible with binary, ternary and quaternary alternating copolymerizations and is expandable for both fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated monomer pairs. DFT calculations combined with model experiments indicated that CTC&#8208;absent reaction exhibits higher propagation rates and affords fewer radical terminations, which could contribute to low dispersities. Based on the integration of Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian optimization, we established the relationship map between FRP parameter space and dispersity, further suggested the correlation between low dispersities and higher propagation rates. Our research sheds light on dispersity control via FRPs and creates a novel platform to investigate polymer dispersity through machine learning.

Based on the integration of Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian optimization, we established the relationship map between FRP parameter space and dispersity, further suggested the correlation between low dispersities and higher propagation rates. Our research sheds light on dispersity control via FRPs and creates a novel platform to investigate polymer dispersity through machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Self&#8208;Assembled Bio&#8208;Interfacial Layers for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is employed as an electrolyte additive in the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte, which can form a bio&#8208;interfacial layer on the Zinc (Zn) anode via a self&#8208;assembly process. The BSA&#8208;based interfacial layer with hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments forms unique ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions and contributing to improved cycling performance.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion (Zn&#8208;ion) batteries are widely regarded as important candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems for low&#8208;cost renewable energy storage. However, the development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries is currently facing significant challenges due to uncontrollable Zn dendrite growth and severe parasitic reactions on Zn metal anodes. Herein, we report an effective strategy to improve the performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries by leveraging the self&#8208;assembly of bovine serum albumin (BSA) into a bilayer configuration on Zn metal anodes. BSA&#8242;s hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments form unique and intelligent ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions on Zn anodes and leading to a uniform Zn deposition along the Zn (002) plane. Notably, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell with BSA as the electrolyte additive demonstrated a stable cycling performance for up to 2400&#8197;hours at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the pivotal role of self&#8208;assembled protein bilayer structures in improving the durability of Zn anodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Quantum Dot&#8208;Based FRET Nanosensors for Talin&#8208;Membrane Assembly and Mechanosensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a straightforward method for resolving inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular interactions in cell adhesive machinery, using quantum dot (QD) based F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. Using talin, we are investigating mechanosensing ability of proteins to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. We quantified distance separating talin and a giant unilamellar vesicle membrane and talin mechanosensing capabilities with sub&#8208;nanometer accuracy.







Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms of assembly and disassembly of macromolecular structures in cells relies on solving biomolecular interactions. However, those interactions often remain unclear because tools to track molecular dynamics are not sufficiently resolved in time or space. In this study, we present a straightforward method for resolving inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;molecular interactions in cell adhesive machinery, using quantum dot (QD) based F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensors. Using a mechanosensitive protein, talin, one of the major components of focal adhesions, we are investigating the mechanosensing ability of proteins to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. First, we quantified the distances separating talin and a giant unilamellar vesicle membrane for three talin variants. These variants differ in molecular length. Second, we investigated the mechanosensing capabilities of talin, i.e., its conformational changes due to mechanical stretching initiated by cytoskeleton contraction. Our results suggest that in early focal adhesion, talin undergoes stretching, corresponding to a decrease in the talin&#8208;membrane distance of 2.5&#8197;nm. We demonstrate that QD&#8208;FRET nanosensors can be applied for the sensitive quantification of mechanosensing with a sub&#8208;nanometer accuracy.

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Spinel Oxides via Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Phase Boundary Construction for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we prepare CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 as model catalysts to investigate its reconstruction process. The results demonstrate that such a surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel oxides is a spontaneous chemical process, and phase boundary construction from tetrahedral to octahedral units is employed to decrease oxygen vacancy formation energy in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of surface reconstruction is crucial for developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides. Traditionally, the reconstruction has been achieved through electrochemical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this work, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 catalyst was an irreversible oxygen redox chemical reaction. And a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (EO&#8208;V) could benefit the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Motivated by this finding, a strategy of phase boundary construction from Co tetrahedral to octahedral was employed to decrease EO&#8208;V in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results showed that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rose to 64&#8201;%, a 3.5&#8197;nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer formed on the catalyst surface with a 158&#8197;mV decrease in overpotential. Further experiments indicated that the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8722;T) phase would result in lattice mismatch, promoting non&#8208;bonding oxygen states and lowering EO&#8208;V. Then more active lattice oxygen combined with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;), followed by soluble cation leaching, which enhanced the reconstruction process. This work provided new insights into the relationship between the intrinsic structure of pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.

         <title>Biomimetic Activation of N&#8208;Nitrosamides with Red Light&#8208;Triggered Nitric Oxide Release via Mediated Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mediated electron transfer was successfully developed to selectively activate N&#8208;nitrosamide&#8208;based photoNORMs (NOA) for quantitative NO release, demonstrating its generality across various N&#8208;nitrosamides. This activation mechanism works in both organic solvents and biological media, using micellar nanoparticles to encapsulate NOA and photocatalysts, enabling selective phototoxicity to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo through localized NO release.







Abstract
Mediated electron transfer (MET) is fundamental to many biological functions, including cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and enzymatic catalysis. However, leveraging the MET process to enable the release of therapeutic gases has been largely unexplored. Herein, we report the bio&#8208;inspired activation of a series of UV&#8208;absorbing N&#8208;nitrosamide derivatives (NOA) under red light exposure, enabling the quantitative release of nitric oxide (NO) gasotransmitter via an MET process. The cornerstone of our design is the covalent linkage of a 2,4&#8208;dinitroaniline moiety, which acts as an electron mediator to the N&#8208;nitrosamide groups. This facilitates efficient electron transfer from the excited palladium(II) meso&#8208;tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP) photocatalyst and the selective activation of NOA. Our approach has been validated with distinct photocatalysts and various N&#8208;nitrosamides, including those derived from carbamates, amides, and ureas. Notably, the modulation of the linker length between the electron mediator and N&#8208;nitrosamide groups serves as a regulatory mechanism for controlling NO release kinetics. Moreover, this biomimetic NO release platform demonstrates effective operation under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and it enables localized delivery of NO under physiological conditions, exhibiting significant anticancer efficacy within the phototherapeutic window and enhanced selectivity towards tumor cells.

         <title>Modular, Scalable Total Synthesis of Lapparbin with a Noncanonical Biaryl Linkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization enabled total synthesis of the cyclic peptide natural product lapparbin. The key steps to construct the highly strained C&#8722;N biaryl linkage between the Tyr C6 and Trp N1&#8242; centers were found to be applicable to the synthesis of analogues of lapparbin.







Abstract
We report the development of a novel synthetic approach for the highly strained atrop&#8208;Tyr C&#8208;6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp N&#8208;1&#8242; linkage, which can be executed on a decagram scale using a modular strategy involving palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization. The first total synthesis of lapparbin (1) was achieved by applying this synthetic strategy. Furthermore, the modular synthesis utilizing C&#8722;H arylation and Larock macrocyclization, discovered in the total synthesis of lapparbin (1), was demonstrated to be applicable to various arbitrary biaryl linkages, including non&#8208;natural types.

         <title>Phosphetene&#8208;Based Polyaromatics: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships and Chiroptical Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of phosphetene rings (4&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring) flanked with PAH systems is described. Although neither the P centre nor the four&#8208;membered ring participate in the frontier orbitals, both structural features play an important role in modulating the symmetry of the orbitals, resulting in chiroptical properties. The stereogenic P&#8208;atom was used as a chiral perturbator to induce circularly polarized luminescence of the polyaromatic system.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended phosphetene rings (4&#8208;member P&#8208;rings) flanked with PAH systems of various topologies. These compounds are fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction. The impact of both the polyaromatic platform and the P&#8208;ring on the structure, and the optical and redox properties are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Although neither the P centre nor the 4&#8208;membered ring significantly takes part in the HOMO or LUMO orbitals, both structural features have an important modulating role in distorting the symmetry of the orbitals, leading to chiroptical properties. The stereogenic P&#8208;atom is used as a remote chiral perturbator to induce circularly polarized luminescence of the polyaromatic system. The dissymmetry factor is highly dependent on the polyaromatic topology, as supported by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Durability of Perovskite Solar Cells With Chlorine&#8208;Functionalized Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine&#8208;functionalized fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed through a decarbonylation reaction. The chlorinated PAFs have high specific surface area, stability and long&#8208;range conjugated networks bearing multiple chlorine atoms. The formation of Cl&#8722;Pb bonds between PAF&#8722;Cl and uncoordinated Pb significantly passivate defects and inhibit non&#8208;radiative recombination, largely enabling the conversion efficiency and stability improvement.







Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative recombination, caused by trap states, significantly hampers the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The emerging porous organic polymers (POPs) show promise as a platform for designing novel defect passivation agents due to their rigid and porous structure. However, the POPs reported so far lack either sufficient stability or clear sites of interactions with the defects. Herein, two chlorine&#8208;functionalized, fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were constructed via a decarbonylation reaction. The chlorinated PAFs feature unique long&#8208;range conjugated networks bearing multiple chlorine atoms, significantly improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of doped solar cells. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses confirmed the strong passivation effects of conjugated structure to the defect through Cl sites. Specifically, PAF&#8208;159, bearing a triphenylamine moiety, demonstrated stronger Cl&#8722;Pb bonding and higher passivation efficiency due to the presence of &#960;* anti&#8208;bonding orbitals, which elevate the HOMO energy level and facilitate Cl&#8722;Pb charge transfer. Consequently, we obtained high&#8208;performance PAF&#8208;159&#8208;doped devices with advanced PCE (24.3&#8201;%), good storage stability (retaining 86&#8201;% after 3000&#8197;hours), and good long&#8208;term operational stability (retaining 92&#8201;% after 350&#8197;hours).

         <title>Surface Gradient Desodiation Chemistry in Layered Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface gradient desodiation strategy is proposed to solve capacity decay and voltage drop without compromising the initial specific capacity of layered cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. This tactic not only inhibits transition&#8208;metal&#8208;ion migration at high voltage, but also endows a stable interface by reducing the generation of Ni4+ and Co4+ ions on the surface of the cathode materials.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage have received unprecedented attention. However, the cathodes in SIBs generally suffer from detrimental cathode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial side reactions and structural degradation during cycling, which leads to severe capacity fade and voltage decay. Here, we have developed an ultra&#8208;stable Na0.72Ni0.20Co0.21Mn0.55Mg0.036O2 (NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg) cathode material in which a Mg&#8208;free core is encapsulated by a shell with gradient distribution of Mg using coprecipitation method with Mg&#8208;hysteretic cascade feedstock followed by calcination. From the interior to outer surface of the shell, as the content of electrochemically inactive Mg gradually increases, the Na+ deintercalation amount gradually decreases after charged. Benefiting from this surface gradient desodiation, the surface transition metal (TM) ion migration from TM layers to Na layers is effectively inhibited, thus suppressing the layered&#8208;to&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition and the resultant microcracks. Besides, the less formation of high&#8208;valence TM ions on the surface contributes to a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The as&#8208;prepared NCM&#8208;CS&#8208;GMg exhibits remarkable cycling life over 3000&#8197;cycles with a negligible voltage drop (0.127&#8197;mV per cycle). Our findings highlight an effective way to developing sustainable cathode materials without compromising on the initial specific capacity for SIBs.

         <title>Efficient and Stable NIR&#8208;II Phosphorescence of Metallophilic Molecular Oligomers for In Vivo Single&#8208;Cell Tracking and Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a substituent modulation design, we have developed a series of bright and stable NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence materials in aqueous solution. Motivated by the excellent brightnesses and microsecond&#8208;level lifetimes, we then performed the in vivo single macrophage tracking and time&#8208;resolved imaging to illustrate the application prospect of NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence in optical imaging.







Abstract
Molecular phosphorescence in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) holds promise for deep&#8208;tissue optical imaging with high contrast by overcoming background fluorescence interference. However, achieving bright and stable NIR&#8208;II molecular phosphorescence suitable for biological applications remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a new series of symmetric isocyanorhodium(I) complexes that could form oligomers and exhibit bright, long&#8208;lived (7&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;s) phosphorescence in aqueous solution via metallophilic interaction.

     alt="Efficient and Stable NIR-II Phosphorescence of Metallophilic Molecular Oligomers for In Vivo Single-Cell Tracking and Time-Resolved Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a substituent modulation design, we have developed a series of bright and stable NIR-II molecular phosphorescence materials in aqueous solution. Motivated by the excellent brightnesses and microsecond-level lifetimes, we then performed the in vivo single macrophage tracking and time-resolved imaging to illustrate the application prospect of NIR-II molecular phosphorescence in optical imaging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular phosphorescence in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) holds promise for deep-tissue optical imaging with high contrast by overcoming background fluorescence interference. However, achieving bright and stable NIR-II molecular phosphorescence suitable for biological applications remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report a new series of symmetric isocyanorhodium(I) complexes that could form oligomers and exhibit bright, long-lived (7&#8211;8&#8197;&#956;s) phosphorescence in aqueous solution via metallophilic interaction. Ligand substituents with enhanced dispersion attraction and electron-donating properties were explored to extend excitation/emission wavelengths and enhanced stability. Further binding the oligomers with fetal bovine serum (FBS) resulted in NIR-II molecular phosphorescence with high quantum yields (up to 3.93&#8201;%) and long-term stability in biological environments, enabling in vivo tracking of single-macrophage dynamics and high-contrast time-resolved imaging.

         <title>Dynamically Cross&#8208;linked Oligo[2]rotaxane Networks Mediated by Metal&#8208;Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of DCRN was created by cross&#8208;linking regiospecific oligo[2]rotaxane using metal&#8208;coordination interactions. The dissociation of host&#8211;guest recognition and subsequent sliding motion, along with breakage of metal&#8208;coordination bonds, represented an integrated energy dissipation pathway to enhance mechanical properties of DCRN. Thanks to the orthogonal design of multiple dynamic bonds, the resultant DCRN further exhibited emergent reprocessability and recyclability.







Abstract
Polyrotaxanes (PRs) have attracted significant research attention due to their unique topological structures and high degrees of conformational freedom. Herein, we take advantage of an oligo[2]rotaxane to construct a novel class of dynamically cross&#8208;linked rotaxane network (DCRN) mediated by metal&#8208;coordination. The oligo[2]rotaxane skeleton offers several distinct advantages: In addition to retaining the merits of traditional polymer backbones, the ordered intramolecular motion of the [2]rotaxane motifs introduced dangling chains into the network, thereby enhancing the stretchability of the DCRN. Additionally, the dissociation of host&#8211;guest recognition and subsequent sliding motion, along with the breakage of metal&#8208;coordination interactions, represented an integrated energy dissipation pathway to enhance mechanical properties. Moreover, the resulting DCRN demonstrated responsiveness to multiple stimuli and displayed exceptional self&#8208;healing capabilities in a gel state. Upon exposure to PPh3, which induced network deconstruction by breaking the coordinated cross&#8208;linking points, the oligo[2]rotaxane could be recovered, showcasing good recyclability. These findings demonstrate the untapped potential of the oligo[2]rotaxane as a polymer skeleton to develop DCRN and open the door to extend their advanced applications in intelligent mechanically interlocked materials.

         <title>A Multielectron and High&#8208;Potential Spirobifluorene&#8208;Based Posolyte for Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research addresses a critical challenge in developing multielectron positive electrolyte (posolyte) with high redox potential for aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) as an advanced energy storage technology. The chlorinated spirobifluorene ammonium salts (CSFAs) is synthesized via a green chlorination&#8208;protection mechanism during the initial battery cycling, leveraging side reactions to develop new redox species. A full battery using CFSA&#8208;Cl achieved over 99.4&#8201;% coulombic efficiency and 95&#8201;% capacity utilization for 250 stable cycles.







Abstract
The rising energy demand driven by human activity has posed pressing challenges in embracing renewable energy, necessitating advances in energy storage technologies to maximize their utilization efficiency. Recent studies in aqueous organic redox flow batteries have focused primarily on the development of organic negative electrolytes, while the progress in organic positive electrolytes remains constrained by limitations in their redox potentials and effective electron concentrations. Herein, we report a spatially twisted chlorinated spirobifluorene ammonium salts (CSFAs), created through an unexpected green chlorination&#8208;protection pathway during the initial cycling in the flow battery cell, utilizing chloride ions from counterions in aqueous solution. The chlorinated, nonplanar spiral structure of CSFAs possesses a one&#8208;step four&#8208;electron transfer electrochemical property and offers exceptional resistance to nucleophilic attacks, exhibiting an unprecedented redox potential as high as 1.05&#8197;V (vs. SHE). A full redox flow battery based on CSFA&#8208;Cl (chloride ions as the counter ions) with 1.4&#8197;M electron concentration achieved an average coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.4&#8201;% and a capacity utilization reaching 95&#8201;% of the four&#8208;electron capacity for a stable cycling over 250 cycles (~22&#8197;days). The present work exemplifies the use of side reactions to develop new redox species, which can be extended to create more structurally versatile energy storage materials.

         <title>Chelator&#8208;Assisted Precipitation&#8208;Based Separation of the Rare Earth Elements Neodymium and Dysprosium from Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a novel chelator, G&#8208;macropa, a highly efficient and environmentally friendly precipitation&#8208;based rare earth element separation approach is achieved.







Abstract
The rare earth elements (REEs) are critical resources for many clean energy technologies, but are difficult to obtain in their elementally pure forms because of their nearly identical chemical properties. Here, an analogue of macropa, G&#8208;macropa, was synthesized and employed for an aqueous precipitation&#8208;based separation of Nd3+ and Dy3+. G&#8208;macropa maintains the same thermodynamic preference for the large REEs as macropa, but shows smaller thermodynamic stability constants. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrate that the binding affinity differences of these chelators for Nd3+ and Dy3+ is a consequence of the presence or absence of an inner&#8208;sphere water molecule, which alters the donor strength of the macrocyclic ethers. Leveraging the small REE affinity of G&#8208;macropa, we demonstrate that within aqueous solutions of Nd3+, Dy3+, and G&#8208;macropa, the addition of HCO3&#8722; selectively precipitates Dy2(CO3)3, leaving the Nd3+&#8722;G&#8208;macropa complex in solution. With this method, remarkably high separation factors of 841 and 741 are achieved for 50&#8201;:&#8201;50 and 75&#8201;:&#8201;25 mixtures. Further studies involving Nd3+:Dy3+ ratios of 95&#8201;:&#8201;5 in authentic magnet waste also afford an efficient separation as well. Lastly, G&#8208;macropa is recovered via crystallization with HCl and used for subsequent extractions, demonstrating its good recyclability.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Antisite Defect and Coupling Anionic Redox in High&#8208;Voltage Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect and its coupling relationship with anionic redox in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes are revealed using operando neutron diffraction techniques. Further, a strategy that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes is proposed.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2, x&#8805;0.9) can significantly enhance the energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of Li&#8208;ion batteries beyond current levels. However, severe Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and their undetermined dynamic evolutions during high&#8208;voltage cycling limit the further development of these ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. In this study, we quantify the dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect using operando neutron diffraction and reveal its coupling relationship with anionic redox, another critical challenge restricting ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. We detect a clear Ni migration coupled with an unstable oxygen lattice, which accompanies the oxidation of oxygen anions at high voltages. Based on these findings, we propose that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations are essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage cycling structures in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. This is further demonstrated by the optimized ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, where reduced dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect effectively inhibit the anionic redox, enhancing the 4.5&#8197;V cycling stability.

However, severe Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and their undetermined dynamic evolutions during high-voltage cycling limit the further development of these ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. In this study, we quantify the dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect using operando neutron diffraction and reveal its coupling relationship with anionic redox, another critical challenge restricting ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. We detect a clear Ni migration coupled with an unstable oxygen lattice, which accompanies the oxidation of oxygen anions at high voltages. Based on these findings, we propose that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations are essential for achieving stable high-voltage cycling structures in ultrahigh-Ni cathodes. This is further demonstrated by the optimized ultrahigh-Ni cathode, where reduced dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect effectively inhibit the anionic redox, enhancing the 4.5&#8197;V cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Excitation Strategy for Deacylative Couplings of Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct excitation strategy, despite its versatility and long history in radical generation, is rarely used in metallaphotoredox catalysis due to the lack of suitable radical donors. During our revisit to this chemical tool, we designed the dihydropyrimidoquinolinone (DHPQ) reagents that enable the homolytic C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond cleavage under visible light, releasing alkyl radicals without photocatalysts (PC). Our method valorizes ketones for diverse deacylative functionalizations (FG) involving C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8722;X bond formation.







Abstract
The homolysis of chemical bonds represents one of the most fundamental reactivities of excited molecules. Historically, it has been exploited to generate radicals under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. However, unlike most contemporary radical&#8208;generating mechanisms, the direct excitation to homolyze chemical bonds and produce aliphatic carbon&#8208;centered radicals under visible light remains rare, especially in metallaphotoredox cross couplings. Herein, we present our design of the dihydropyrimidoquinolinone (DHPQ) reagents derived from ketones, which can undergo formal deacylation and homolytic C&#8722;C bond cleavage to release alkyl radicals without external photocatalysts. Spectroscopic and computational analysis reveal unique optical and structural features of DHPQs, rationalizing their faster kinetics in alkyl radical generation than a structurally similar but visible&#8208;light transparent radical precursor. Such a capability allows DHPQ to facilitate a wide range of Ni&#8208;metallaphotoredox cross couplings with aryl, alkynyl and acyl halides. Other catalytic and non&#8208;catalyzed alkylative transformations of DHPQs are also feasible with various radical acceptors. We believe this work would be of broad interest, aiding the synthetic planning with simplified operation and expanding the synthetic reach of photocatalyst&#8208;free approaches in cutting&#8208;edge research.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Ion Covalent Organic Framework Electrolytes Enabled by Nitrile Migration Ladders for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered the key importance of nitrile (&#8722;CN) functionality and for the first time developed a novel single&#8208;ion conducting COF electrolyte (CN&#8722;iCOF) that is high&#8208;voltage stable in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Utilizing Strecker reaction to convert the reversible imine&#8208;based linkage to a stable &#945;&#8208;aminonitrile linkage, azanide&#8208;based anionic centers that are adjacent to the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups were generated followed by deprotonation. When the CN&#8722;iCOF was assembled in solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries, excellent performance including stable Li electrodeposition and reversible high&#8208;voltage battery cycling up to 4.5&#8197;V was achieved at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The poor electrochemical stability window and low ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state electrolytes hinder the development of safe, high&#8208;voltage, and energy&#8208;dense lithium metal batteries. Herein, taking advantage of the unique electronic effect of nitrile groups, we designed a novel azanide&#8208;based single&#8208;ion covalent organic framework (CN&#8722;iCOF) structure that possesses effective Li+ transport and high&#8208;voltage stability in lithium metal batteries. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) revealed that electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups not only resulted in an ultralow HOMO energy orbital but also enhanced Li+ dissociation through charge delocalization, leading to a high tLi+ of 0.93 and remarkable oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) simultaneously. Moreover, cyanation leveraging Strecker reaction transformed reversible imine&#8208;linkage to a stable sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing azanide anion, which facilitated contorted alignment of transport &#8220;ladders&#8221; along the one&#8208;dimensional anionic channels and the ionic conductivity could reach 1.33&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at ambient temperature without any additives. As a result, CN&#8722;iCOF allowed operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811), demonstrating stable lithium deposition up to 1,100&#8197;h and reversible battery cycling at ambient temperature up to 4.5&#8197;V, shedding light on the importance of discovering new functionality for forthcoming high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Incorporation of Pd Single&#8208;Atom Sites in Perovskite with an Excellent Selectivity toward Photocatalytic Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd active phases have been successfully incorporated in the lattices of SrTiO3 as single&#8208;atom sites (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Pd atoms with an optimized electronic structure and coordination environment facilitate the desorption of alkenes, thereby exhibiting an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability.







Abstract
Semihydrogenation is a crucial industrial process. Noble metals such as Pd have been extensively studied in semihydrogenation reactions, owing to their unique catalytic activity toward hydrogen activation. However, the overhydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes often happens due to the rather strong adsorption of alkenes on Pd active phases. Herein, we demonstrate that the incorporation of Pd active phases as single&#8208;atom sites in perovskite lattices such as SrTiO3 can greatly alternate the electronic structure and coordination environment of Pd active phases to facilitate the desorption of alkenes rather than further hydrogenation. Furthermore, the incorporated Pd sites can be well stabilized without sintering by a strong host&#8211;guest interaction with SrTiO3 during the activation of H species in hydrogenation reactions. As a result, the Pd incorporated SrTiO3 (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) exhibits an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability for the photocatalytic semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene. This strategy based on incorporation of active phases in perovskite lattices will have broad implications in the development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Formulating Self&#8208;Repairing Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dynamic Electric Double Layer for Practical Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the EDL structure to construct stable SEI in situ provides a promising approach to solve the electrolyte/electrode interface problem. We have developed a dual&#8208;site adsorption additive to construct the dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing in situ SEI for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc ion batteries, filling the gap in understanding the EDL structure and SEI properties.







Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) encounter interface issues stemming from the water&#8208;rich electrical double layer (EDL) and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose the dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing hybrid SEI for practical ZIBs via incorporating the horizontally&#8208;oriented dual&#8208;site additive. The rearrangement of distribution and molecular configuration of additive constructs the robust dynamic EDL under different interface charges. And, a self&#8208;repairing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid SEI is constructed via the electrochemical decomposition of additive. The dynamic EDL and self&#8208;repairing SEI accelerate interfacial kinetics, regulate deposition and suppress side reactions in the both stripping and plating during long&#8208;term cycles, which affords high reversibility for 500&#8197;h at 42.7&#8201;% depth of discharge or 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1. Remarkably, Zn//NVO full cells deliver the impressive cycling stability for 10000&#8197;cycles with 100&#8201;% capacity retention at 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and for over 3000&#8197;cycles even at lean electrolyte (7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mAh&#8722;1) and high loading (15.26&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

     alt="Formulating Self-Repairing Solid Electrolyte Interface via Dynamic Electric Double Layer for Practical Zinc Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting the EDL structure to construct stable SEI in situ provides a promising approach to solve the electrolyte/electrode interface problem. We have developed a dual-site adsorption additive to construct the dynamic EDL and self-repairing in situ SEI for high-performance aqueous zinc ion batteries, filling the gap in understanding the EDL structure and SEI properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) encounter interface issues stemming from the water-rich electrical double layer (EDL) and unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, we propose the dynamic EDL and self-repairing hybrid SEI for practical ZIBs via incorporating the horizontally-oriented dual-site additive. The rearrangement of distribution and molecular configuration of additive constructs the robust dynamic EDL under different interface charges. And, a self-repairing organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid SEI is constructed via the electrochemical decomposition of additive. The dynamic EDL and self-repairing SEI accelerate interfacial kinetics, regulate deposition and suppress side reactions in the both stripping and plating during long-term cycles, which affords high reversibility for 500&#8197;h at 42.7&#8201;% depth of discharge or 50&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Remarkably, Zn//NVO full cells deliver the impressive cycling stability for 10000&#8197;cycles with 100&#8201;% capacity retention at 3&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and for over 3000&#8197;cycles even at lean electrolyte (7.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high loading (15.26&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Moreover, effectiveness of this strategy is further demonstrated in the low-temperature full cell (&#8722;30&#8201;&#176;C).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Subsurface Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst Enabled by Mechanochemical Synthesis for Oxidation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanochemical approach has been shown to be an effective method of regulating the position of single atoms. Controlling single atoms at the surface or subsurface results in catalysts with very different adsorption properties, leading to different reaction mechanisms. As a result, the subsurface Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst shifts the conversion profile 80&#8197;K towards the low&#8208;temperature region and NH3 is completely converted at 513&#8197;K.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional atom utilization and unique properties. However, the practical application of these catalysts is often impeded by challenges such as sintering&#8208;induced instability and poisoning of isolated atoms due to strong gas adsorption. In this study, we employed the mechanochemical method to insert single Cu atoms into the subsurface of Fe2O3 support. By manipulating the location of single atoms at the surface or subsurface, catalysts with distinct adsorption properties and reaction mechanisms can be achieved. It was observed that the subsurface Cu single atoms in Fe2O3 remained isolated under both oxidation and reduction environments, whereas surface Cu single atoms on Fe2O3 experienced sintering under reduction conditions. The unique properties of these subsurface single&#8208;atom catalysts call for innovations and new understandings in catalyst design.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Assisted Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid ester&#8208;ether electrolyte is proposed by introducing weakly solvated tetrahydrofuran into commonly used propylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, which simultaneously achieves the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity. These merit the gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with accelerated desolvation process, guaranteeing the fast&#8208;charging performance of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure favors the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which endows fast ion transport and high strength modulus to enable improved electrochemical performance. However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast&#8208;charging performance. Herein, a trade&#8208;off in tuning anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy&#8208;assisted hybrid ester&#8208;ether electrolyte. Anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na+ shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester&#8208;based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect. These enable the enhanced rate performance and cycling stability of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading. More importantly, the practical application of the designed electrolyte was further demonstrated by industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical cells.

         <dc:description>
The first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles with multiple elements of stereogenicity has been established via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols. This new type of alkene atropisomers possess promising utilities such as in discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction pathway.







Abstract
Catalytic enantioselective preparation of alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements and discovery of their applications have become significant but challenging issues in the scientific community due to the unique structures of this class of atropisomers. We herein report the first catalytic atroposelective preparation of cyclopentenyl[b]indoles, a new kind of alkene atropisomers, with stereogenic point and axial chirality via an unusual rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols under asymmetric organocatalysis. Notably, this novel type of alkene atropisomers have promising applications in developing chiral ligands or organocatalysts, discovering antitumor drug candidates and fluorescence imaging materials. Moreover, the theoretical calculations have elucidated the possible reaction mechanism and the non&#8208;covalent interactions to control the enantioselectivity. This approach offers a new synthetic strategy for alkene atropisomers with multiple stereogenic elements, and represents the first catalytic enantioselective rearrangement reaction of 3&#8208;indolylmethanols, which will advance the chemistry of atropisomers and chiral indole chemistry.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Driven Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction to C2H4 on Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Copper Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Suface plasmon&#8208;driven highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 has been realized on ionic liquid&#8208;mediated Cu nanowires. The addition of ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, which brings about electron&#8208;rich surface sites that stabilize the *CO intermediate and significantly reduce the energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2H4 product with high selectivity.







Abstract
Selective CO2 photoreduction to value&#8208;added multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) feedstocks, such as C2H4, holds great promise in direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. Nevertheless, the performance is largely inhibited by the high energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process, thereby leading to C2+ products with low selectivity. Here we report that through facile surface immobilization of a 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM&#8208;BF4) ionic liquid, plasmonic Cu nanowires could enable highly selective CO2 photoreduction to C2H4 product. At an optimal condition, the resultant plasmonic photocatalyst exhibits C2H4 production with selectivity up to 96.7&#8201;% under 450&#8197;nm monochromatic light irradiation, greatly surpassing its pristine Cu counterpart. Combined in situ spectroscopies and computational calculations unravel that the addition of EMIM&#8208;BF4 ionic liquid modulates the local electronic structure of Cu, resulting in its enhanced adsorption strength of *CO intermediate and significantly reduced energy barrier of C&#8722;C coupling process. This work paves new path for Cu surface plasmons in selective artificial photosynthesis to targeted products.

         <title>Customizing Aniline&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures to Attain beyond 22&#8201;% Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose the utilization of an aniline&#8208;derived molecule, namely 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline (MFA), as an additive for the fabrication of CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx solar cells. The incorporation of MFA into the perovskite film can effectively enhance the energy barrier for defect formation and ion migration. This customized strategy allows us to achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 22.14&#8201;% and significantly improved environmental stability and photostability.







Abstract
The characteristics of the soft component and the ionic&#8208;electronic nature in all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite typically lead to a significant number of halide vacancy defects and ions migration, resulting in a reduction in both photovoltaic efficiency and stability. Herein, we present a tailored approach in which both anion&#8208;fixation and undercoordinated&#8208;Pb passivation are achieved in situ during crystallization by employing a molecule derived from aniline, specifically 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylaniline (MFA), to address the above challenges. The incorporation of MFA into the perovskite film results in a pronounced inhibition of ion migration, a significant reduction in trap density, an enhancement in grain size, an extension of charge carrier lifetime, and a more favorable alignment of energy levels. These advantageous characteristics contribute to achieving a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.14&#8201;% for the MFA&#8208;based CsPbI3&#8208;xBrx perovskite solar cells (PSCs), representing the highest efficiency reported thus far for this type of inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells, to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, the resultant PSCs exhibits higher environmental stability and photostability. This strategy is anticipated to offer significant advantages for large&#8208;area fabrication, particularly in terms of simplicity.

         <title>Photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;Mediated Decarboxylative Thianthrenation of Aryl and Heteroaryl Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective decarboxylative thianthrenation of a broad range of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids forming high value&#8208;added (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salt reagents has been achieved under mild conditions, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these abundant starting materials, as exemplified here by modifications a series of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Given that (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids are inexpensive materials available in a great variety from commercial and natural resources or synthesis, the strategies enabling their use as starting materials for preparing fine chemicals are highly sought after. Here we report a photoinduced Cu(II)&#8208;mediated protocol converting (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, high value&#8208;added building blocks that can undergo various subsequent transformations, creating an attractive two&#8208;step pathway for the divergent functionalization of these ubiquitous starting materials. The excellent compatibility of the method is shown by preparing a broad range of sterically and electronically varied (hetero)aryl thianthrenium salts, including derivatives of pharmaceuticals, such as ataluren, celecoxib, flavoxate, probenecid, repaglinide, and tamibarotene. The syntheses of 13&#8197;C&#8208;labeled probenecid and bioisosteres of ataluren as well as the unconventional modifications of celecoxib and flavoxate, illustrate the synthetic potential of the strategy. Mechanistic studies are in line with a reaction occurring through a photoinduced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) of Cu(II)&#8208;arylcarboxylates, enabling radical decarboxylative carbometallation to form arylcopper(II) intermediates that in turn react with thianthrene to form the product. Noteworthy, the susceptibility of aryl thianthrenium salts to photodegradation is overcome by a Cu(I)&#8208;driven salvage loop, which continuously intercepts the transiently formed radicals and regenerates the products.

         <title>Dihydropyridopyrazine Functionalized Xanthene: Generating Stable NIR Dyes with Small&#8208;Molecular Weight by Enhanced Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We prepared a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a modular structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. Owing to its great charge separation feature, the dihydropyridopyrazine significantly enhanced the internal charge transfer states of traditional fluorophores, resulting in greatly redshifted wavelengths of the reconstructed dyes together with a small molecular weight increase, retained stability and biocompatibility.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared region (NIR; 650&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) dyes offer many advantages over traditional dyes with absorption and emission in the visible region. However, developing new NIR dyes, especially organic dyes with long wavelengths, small molecular weight, and excellent stability and biocompatibility, is still quite challenging. Herein, we present a general method to enhance the absorption and emission wavelengths of traditional fluorophores by simply appending a charge separation structure, dihydropyridopyrazine. These novel NIR dyes not only exhibited greatly redshifted wavelengths compared to their parent dyes, but also displayed a small molecular weight increase together with retained stability and biocompatibility. Specifically, dye NIR&#8208;OX, a dihydropyridopyra&#8208;zine derivative of oxazine with a molecular mass of 386.2&#8197;Da, exhibited an absorption at 822&#8197;nm and an emission extending to 1200&#8197;nm, making it one of the smallest molecular&#8208;weight NIR&#8208;II emitting dyes. Thanks to its rapid metabolism and long wave&#8208;length, NIR&#8208;OX enabled high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and assessment of cholestatic liver injury in vivo and also facilitated the evalua&#8208;tion of the efficacy of liver protection medicines against cholestatic liver injury.

Profiting from excellent interfacial passivation, electron injection, carrier mobility, hole blocking, and thermal stability of 3P, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.2&#8201;% and operational lifetime T50 of 3220&#8197;h at 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2 were realized, representing one of the highest performances in P&#8208;QLEDs.







Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs), abbreviated as P&#8208;QLEDs have been regarded as significantly crucial emitters for lighting and displays. Efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs still lack ideal electron transport materials (ETM), which could efficiently block hole, transport electron, reduce interface non&#8208;radiative recombination and possess high thermal stability. Here, we report 2,4,6&#8208;Tris(3&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl) biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TmPPPyTz, 3P) with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing moieties of pyridine and triazine to modulate the performance of P&#8208;QLEDs. Compared with commonly used 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi), the pyridine in 3P have a strong interaction with perovskites, which can effectively suppress the interface non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by the Pb2+ defects on the surface of QDs. In addition, 3P have deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (enhancing hole&#8208;blocking properties), matched lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and excellent electron mobility (enhancing electron transport properties), realizing the carrier balance and maximizing the exciton recombination. Furthermore, high thermal resistance of 3P obviously improves the stability of QDs under variable temperature, continuous UV illumination, and electric field excitation. Resultantly, the P&#8208;QLEDs using the 3P as ETM achieved an outstanding performance with a champion EQE of 30.2&#8201;% and an operational lifetime T50 of 3220&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 151&#8201;% and about 11&#8208;fold improvement compared to control devices (EQE=20&#8201;%, T50=297&#8197;hours), respectively. These results provide a new concept for constructing the efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs from the perspective of selective ETM.

Furthermore, high thermal resistance of 3P obviously improves the stability of QDs under variable temperature, continuous UV illumination, and electric field excitation. Resultantly, the P-QLEDs using the 3P as ETM achieved an outstanding performance with a champion EQE of 30.2&#8201;% and an operational lifetime &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 3220&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 151&#8201;% and about 11-fold improvement compared to control devices (EQE=20&#8201;%, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=297&#8197;hours), respectively. These results provide a new concept for constructing the efficient and stable P-QLEDs from the perspective of selective ETM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough, yet Rigid and Healable Supramolecular Polymers with Variable Stiffness for Multimodal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers were developed by incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs into densely interconnected hydrogen networks, achieving both exceptional mechanical strength and dynamic chain flexibility. These materials can be utilized to create variable stiffness layers for soft actuators, enhancing their motion versatility and structural robustness.







Abstract
Variable stiffness materials have shown considerable application in soft robotics. However, previously reported materials often struggle to reconcile high stiffness, stretchability, toughness, and self&#8208;healing ability, because of the inherently conflicting requisite of these properties in molecular design. Herein, we propose a novel strategy that involves incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs capable of from strong crosslinking sites into a dense and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to construct rigid self&#8208;healing polymers with tunable stiffness and excellent toughness. To demonstrate these distinct features, the polymer was employed to serve as the strain&#8208;regulation layers within a fiber&#8208;reinforced pneumatic actuator (FPA). The exceptional synergy between the configuration versatility of FPA and the dynamic molecular behavior of the supramolecular polymers equips the actuator with simultaneous improvement in motion dexterity, multimodality, loading capacity, robustness, and durability. Additionally, the concept of integrating high dexterity at both macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale is prospective to inspire the design of intelligent yet robust devices across various domains.

         <title>A Microscopically Heterogeneous Colloid Electrolyte for Extremely Fast&#8208;Charging and Long&#8208;Calendar&#8208;Life Silicon&#8208;Based Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolyte is engineered to tackle the critical issues of inadequate fast&#8208;charging capability and limited calendar life in silicon&#8208;based batteries. Leveraging multiscale noncovalent interactions, this electrolyte demonstrates exceptional fast&#8208;charging capability. Moreover, the mesoscopic medium in the colloid electrolyte strongly adsorbs H2O and HF, significantly extending the calendar life of the full cell.







Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life are critical metrics in rechargeable batteries, especially in silicon&#8208;based batteries that are susceptible to sluggish Li+ desolvation kinetics and HF&#8208;induced corrosion. No existing electrolyte simultaneously tackles both these pivotal challenges. Here we report a microscopically heterogeneous covalent organic nanosheet (CON) colloid electrolyte for extremely fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;calendar&#8208;life Si&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Theoretical calculations and operando Raman spectroscopy reveal the fundamental mechanism of the multiscale noncovalent interaction, which involves the mesoscopic CON attenuating the microscopic Li+&#8208;solvent coordination, thereby expediting the Li+ desolvation kinetics. This electrolyte design enables extremely fast&#8208;charging capabilities of the full cell, both at 8&#8197;C (83.1&#8201;% state of charge) and 10&#8197;C (81.3&#8201;% state of charge). Remarkably, the colloid electrolyte demonstrates record&#8208;breaking cycling performance at 10&#8197;C (capacity retention of 92.39&#8201;% after 400 cycles). Moreover, benefiting from the robust adsorption capability of mesoporous CON towards HF and water, a notable improvement is observed in the calendar life of the full cell. This study highlights the role of microscopically heterogeneous colloid electrolytes in enhancing the fast&#8208;charging capability and calendar life of Si&#8208;based Li&#8208;ion batteries. Our work offers fresh perspectives on electrolyte design with multiscale interactions, providing insightful guidance for the development of alkali&#8208;ion/metal batteries operating under harsh environments.

         <title>&#8220;Anions&#8208;in&#8208;Colloid&#8221; Hydrated Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte was designed, where the anions are trapped in the colloid and the H2O molecules are restricted by the eutectic network, thus enabling high reversible zinc anodes over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Zn metal as a promising anode for aqueous batteries suffers from severe zinc dendrites, anion&#8208;related side reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and narrow electrochemical stable window (ESW). Herein, an &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; hydrated deep eutectic electrolyte consisting of Zn(ClO4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), and H2O with mass ratio of 7&#8201;:&#8201;4.5&#8201;:&#8201;3 (ACDE&#8208;3) is designed to improve the stability of zinc anode. The ACDE&#8208;3 reconfigures the hydrogen&#8208;bond (HB) network and regulates the solvation shell. More importantly, the hydroxyl&#8208;rich &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#946;&#8208;CDs) in ACDE&#8208;3 self&#8208;assemble into micelles, in which the steric effect between adjacent &#946;&#8208;CDs in micelles restricts the movement of anions. This unique &#8220;anions&#8208;in&#8208;colloid&#8221; structure enables the eutectic system with a high Zn2+ transference number (tZn2+) of 0.84. Thus, ACDE&#8208;3 inhibits the formation of dendrite, prevents the anion&#8208;involved side reactions, suppresses the HER, and enlarges the ESW to 2.32&#8197;V. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell delivers a long lifespan of 900&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the Zn//Cu half cells have a high average columbic efficiency (ACE) of 97.9&#8201;% at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 from cycle 15 to 200 with a uniform and compact zinc deposition. When matched with a poly(1,5&#8208;naphthalenediamine) (poly(1, 5&#8208;NAPD)) cathode, the full battery with a low negative/positive capacity (N/P) ratio of 2 can still cycle steadily for 200 cycles at a current density of 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, this electrolyte has been proven to be operative over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C to 40&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Radical&#8208;Induced Changes in Transition Metal Interfacial Magnetic Properties: A Blatter Derivative on Polycrystalline Cobalt (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42/2024)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecules deposited on polycrystalline cobalt are strongly hybridised with the inorganic surface and experience charge transfer from the cobalt. This is reflected in the modification of the interface electronic structure inducing a decrease in the magnetic moment of the cobalt atoms bonded to the molecules which, in turn, lose their radical character. In their Research Article (e202403495) M. Benedetta Casu et&#8197;al. report a method, based on X&#8208;ray spectroscopies, that helps to screen in a simple way organic/ferromagnetic interfaces for applications in spintronics.

A &#8220;solution&#8211;processing&#8211;transformation&#8221; strategy with methanol scaffolds for fabricating high&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) membranes for gas separation is explored by Zixi Kang, Daofeng Sun et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407779). The methanol scaffolds contribute in two ways: vapor&#8208;activated monomer dissolution&#8211;precipitation equilibrium shifts, and hydrogen bonding&#8208;guided monomer rearrangement. As a result, these HOF membranes display improved hydrogen separation performance.

         <title>Using In situ Transmission Electron Microscopy to Study Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is currently a prominent subject of study in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Comprehending the atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of SMSI is crucial for directing the design and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts. This article reviews the latest advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) research on SMSI. It also offers a concise overview of the obstacles and potential solutions for future progress in this emerging domain.







Abstract
Precisely controlling the microstructure of supported metal catalysts and regulating metal&#8208;support interactions at the atomic level are essential for achieving highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) not only stabilizes metal nanoparticles and improves their resistance to sintering but also modulates the electrical interaction between metal species and the support, optimizing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, understating the formation mechanism of SMSI and its dynamic evolution during the chemical reaction at the atomic scale is crucial for guiding the structural design and performance optimization of supported metal catalysts. Recent advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have shed new light on these complex phenomena, providing deeper insights into the SMSI dynamics. Here, the research progress of in situ TEM investigation on SMSI in heterogeneous catalysis is systematically reviewed, focusing on the formation dynamics, structural evolution during the catalytic reactions, and regulation methods of SMSI. The significant advantages of in situ TEM technologies for SMSI research are also highlighted. Moreover, the challenges and probable development paths of in situ TEM studies on the SMSI are also provided.

         <title>Non&#8208;Alternant Nanographenes Bearing N&#8208;Doped Non&#8208;Hexagonal Pairs: Synthesis, Structural Analysis and Photophysical Properties</title>

         <dc:description>
Progress in the development of non&#8208;alternant nanographenes containing N&#8208;doped non&#8208;hexagonal pairs, including N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;heptagon (5&#8211;7)&#8197;pairs, N&#8208;doped pentagon&#8208;octagon (5&#8211;8)&#8197;pairs and N&#8208;doped heptagon&#8208;heptagon (7&#8211;7)&#8197;pairs, is comprehensively covered&#160;in this review. The synthesis, structure analysis, and photophysical properties have been highlighted to shed light on the structure&#8211;property relationships and to realize emerging applications for organic optoelectronics.







Abstract
Introduction of non&#8208;hexagons and/or heteroatoms allows for finely tuning the physicochemical properties of nanographenes. Heteroatoms doping have dominated the modulation of nanographenes with tunable band gap, rich electrochemical activities and so on. The pair of non&#8208;hexagons, for instance, pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs, have furnished nanographenes with aromatic and/or antiaromatic characteristics, open&#8208;shell properties and so on. In order to meet the growing demand for versatile nanographenes in materials science, research on novel nanographenes with heteroatom doped non&#8208;hexagonal pairs has been aroused in recent years. In this review, we focus on nanographenes with nitrogen&#8208;doped non&#8208;hexagonal paris including the synthesis, structure analysis, photophysical properties, and potential applications in organic devices.

         <title>Recent Advances on Catalytic Atroposelective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles</title>

We present here a Minireview which describes recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles. This Minireview mainly highlights the developments in the asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles. It will to provide a stepping stone for further investigations by summarizing and discussing the recent developments in the area of synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles.







Abstract
Planar&#8208;chiral skeletons widely exist in natural products, bioactive compounds, and other functional molecules. Although significant progress has been made in the field of asymmetric synthesis of centrally or axially chiral molecules over the past years, enantioselective constructing of planar chirality is still a big obstacle and numerous efforts have been made in this field. Previous works have mainly focused on the assembly of planar&#8208;chiral [2,2]&#8208;paracyclophanes and metallocenes. This Minireview describes recent advancements in asymmetric catalytic synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles, including ansa chain construction, plane formation and asymmetric transformation strategies. It is anticipated that this Minireview will sever as a source of inspiration for developing new unconventional procedures for access to planar&#8208;chiral skeletons.

         <title>Identification of Kibdelomycin and Related Biosynthetic Gene Clusters and Characterization of the C&#8208;Branching of Amycolose</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes are characterized in detail for many different reactions. However, only a few examples are known to catalyze the C&#8208;branching of deoxy&#8208;keto sugars. The first ThDP&#8208;dependent &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase to catalyze such a reaction was characterized in the biosynthesis of kibdelomycin. The sterically demanding tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone is subsequently converted by an amino transferase.







Abstract
Many bacterial natural products contain C&#8208;branched sugars, including components from the outer cell wall or antibiotically active metabolites. The enzymatic C&#8208;branching of keto sugars leading to longer side chains (&#8805;C2) is catalyzed by thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)&#8208;dependent enzymes. Chiral tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones are formed in this process. The ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes that catalyze C&#8208;branching reactions belong to one of three enzymatic superfamilies: decarboxylases, transketolases, and &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenases 2, but branching of keto sugars has only been demonstrated for decarboxylases. In this study, we showed that an &#945;&#8208;ketoacid dehydrogenase is responsible for C&#8208;branching of the deoxyketo sugar amycolose in the biosynthesis of kibdelomycin in Kibdelosporangium sp. MA7385. In addition, we characterized an amino transferase in the same biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) that accepts a sterically demanding tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketone in a downstream reaction. Subsequently, we identified approximately 400 similar BGCs in silico, suggesting that there is a large diversity of possible ThDP&#8208;dependent enzymes catalyzing the C&#8208;branching of keto sugars and subsequent modifications.

         <title>Controlled Protein&#8208;Membrane Interactions Modulate Self&#8208;Organization of Min Protein Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organization of proteins is a fundamental process in living systems. The Zieske research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen now reconstituted snowflake&#8208;like patterns using purified proteins and synthetic lipid membranes. Their work reveals membrane linkage as a key biophysical parameter, determining whether proteins self&#8208;organize into expanding snowflake&#8208;like patterns or into travelling surface waves.







Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing protein patterns are crucial for living systems, governing important cellular processes such as polarization and division. While the field of protein self&#8208;organization has reached a point where basic pattern&#8208;forming mechanisms can be reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins, understanding how cells can dynamically switch and modulate these patterns, especially when transiently needed, remains an interesting frontier. Here, we demonstrate the efficient regulation of self&#8208;organizing protein patterns through the modulation of simple biophysical membrane parameters. Our investigation focuses on the impact of membrane affinity changes on Min protein patterns at lipid membranes composed of Escherichia coli lipids or minimal lipid compositions, and we present three major results. First, we observed the emergence of a diverse array of pattern phenotypes, ranging from waves over flower&#8208;shaped patterns to snowflake&#8208;like structures. Second, we demonstrated the dependency of these patterns on the density of protein&#8208;membrane linkers. Finally, we demonstrate that&#160;the shape of snowflake&#8208;like patterns is&#160;fine&#8208;tuned by membrane charge. Our results demonstrate the significant influence of membrane linkage as a straightforward biophysical parameter governing protein pattern formation. Our research points towards a simple yet intriguing mechanism by which cells can adeptly tune and switch protein patterns on the mesoscale.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu&#8208;catalyzed sequential asymmetric hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs has been developed, providing a robust approach to chiral silacyclopentane featuring consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent stereocontrol. Mechanistic studies disclosed that this reaction undergoes a sequential intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant homoallylic silanes.







Abstract
Despite impressive advances in the construction of enantioenriched silacarbocycles featuring silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers via a selection of well&#8208;defined sila&#8208;synthons, the development of a more convenient and economic method with readily available starting materials is significantly less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first example of copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation of readily accessible methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) and primary silanes, affording an efficient and convenient route to a wide range of chiral silacyclopentanes bearing consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &#8805;98&#8201;% ee, &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions combine copper&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant Z/E mixture of homoallylic silanes.

         <title>Regioselective Oxidative Phenol Coupling by a Mushroom Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phlegmacin biosynthesis in the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer reveals that CoUPO1, an unspecific peroxygenase, catalyzes the dimerization step by regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative phenol coupling. This study demonstrates that mushrooms evolved aryl coupling independently of any other group of organisms.







Abstract
Bioactive dimeric (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are ubiquitous in nature and are found in bacteria, fungi, insects, and plants. Their biosynthesis via oxidative phenol coupling (OPC) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, peroxidases, or laccases. While the biocatalysis of OPC in molds (Ascomycota) is well&#8208;known, the respective enzymes in mushroom&#8208;forming fungi (Basidiomycota) are unknown. Here, we report on the biosynthesis of the atropisomers phlegmacin A1 and B1 of the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer. The biosynthesis of these unsymmetrically 7,10&#8217;&#8208;homo&#8208;coupled dihydroanthracenones was heterologously reconstituted in the mold Aspergillus niger. Methylation of the parental monomer atrochrysone to its 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl ether torosachrysone by the O&#8208;methyltransferase CoOMT1 precedes the regioselective homocoupling to phlegmacin, catalyzed by the enzyme CoUPO1 annotated as an &#8220;unspecific peroxygenase&#8221; (UPO). Our results reveal an unprecedented UPO reaction, thereby expanding the biocatalytic portfolio of oxidative phenol coupling beyond the commonly reported enzymes. The results show that Basidiomycota use peroxygenases to selectively couple aryls independently of and convergently to any other group of organisms, emphasizing the central role of OPC in natural processes.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Mimetic Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic molecular mimic metal&#8208;free catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized graphite exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and 99&#8201;% selectivity for the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
The direct construction of metal&#8208;free catalysts on conductive substrates for electrocatalytic organic hydrogenation reactions is significant but still unexplored. Here, learning from the homogeneous molecular catalysts, an organic molecular mimetic metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, 99&#8201;% selectivity and 96&#8201;% yield of the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts. The removal of these oxygen&#8208;containing groups leads to negligible activity. The experimental and calculation results reveal that the origin of the high activity can be assigned to the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups on graphite. A flow electrolytic cell delivers ten grams of hydrogenated products with 81&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. This metal&#8208;free catalyst is also suitable for gas&#8208;phase acetylene semihydrogenation and other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Zr(OH)4&#8208;Catalyzed Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Phenylacetylene with Terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H as Active Site: Inactive for Free Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr(OH)4 was firstly applied to catalyze semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. It can achieve a 95&#8201;% removal rate of 1&#8201;%&#8201;mol of phenylacetylene in styrene, and the terminal hydroxyl group is confirmed as the active site.







Abstract
In the field of industrial semi&#8208;hydrogenation of trace alkynes amidst alkene feedstocks, the pivotal challenge lies in circumventing the hydrogenation of alkenes. Herein, we present Zr(OH)4 as an innovative catalyst for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, demonstrating remarkable selectivity towards styrene (&gt;96&#8201;%), while exhibiting inactivity towards free styrene. Notably, Zr(OH)4 achieves a 95&#8201;% conversion of quasi&#8208;industry 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% phenylacetylene within styrene, with a mere 0.44&#8201;% styrene loss. Experimental and theoretical results confirm both terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H and bridge Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H can dissociate H2, while the terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H plays a crucial role on activating phenylacetylene through the sequential hydrogenation process of C6H5C&#8801;CH&#8594;C6H5C=CH2&#8594;C6H5CH=CH2. The high rate of phenylacetylene removal is attributed to its strong adsorption capacity, while Zr(OH)4 has a significantly weaker adsorption capacity for styrene.

         <title>Dual Channel Emissions of Kasha and Anti&#8208;Kasha from a Single Radical Molecule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable mono&#8208;radical counterpart of the chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabins's hydrocarbon displays dual&#8208;channel emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. This coexistence of two types of luminescence is observed for the first time in the field of luminescent radicals.







Abstract
Stable open&#8208;shell luminescent radicals have recently attracted much attention due to their unique luminescence properties. However, a radical molecule with both Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha doublet emission properties has not been reported. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a stable chlorine&#8208;substituted Chichibabin's hydrocarbon, TTM&#8208;TTM, along with its mono&#8208;radical counterpart, TTM&#8208;HTTM. The emission of TTM&#8208;TTM follows Kasha's rule in the near infrared region. However, TTM&#8208;HTTM shows dual channel doublet emissions of Kasha and anti&#8208;Kasha. Remarkably, these two types of emission compete dynamically in both solution and condensed states. Our findings provide valuable insights into the rational design and discovery of stable radicals that possess distinctive luminescent properties, thus broadening the horizons of luminescent materials research.

&lt;p&gt;A stable mono-radical counterpart of the chlorine-substituted Chichibabins's hydrocarbon displays dual-channel emissions of Kasha and anti-Kasha. This coexistence of two types of luminescence is observed for the first time in the field of luminescent radicals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable open-shell luminescent radicals have recently attracted much attention due to their unique luminescence properties. However, a radical molecule with both Kasha and anti-Kasha doublet emission properties has not been reported. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a stable chlorine-substituted Chichibabin's hydrocarbon, TTM-TTM, along with its mono-radical counterpart, TTM-HTTM. The emission of TTM-TTM follows Kasha's rule in the near infrared region. However, TTM-HTTM shows dual channel doublet emissions of Kasha and anti-Kasha. Remarkably, these two types of emission compete dynamically in both solution and condensed states. Our findings provide valuable insights into the rational design and discovery of stable radicals that possess distinctive luminescent properties, thus broadening the horizons of luminescent materials research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Urea from CO2 and Nitrate by a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Dual Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The main challenge for urea electrosynthesis is to operate at both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. Here, we report a sustainable method for urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and NO3&#8722; using a novel MOF catalyst, PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, achieving high efficiency and stability, and demonstrating potential for industrial scale&#8208;up.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of urea from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is a sustainable alternative to energy&#8208;intensive industrial processes. The main challenge hindering the progress of this technology lies in the development of advanced electrocatalysts that efficiently utilize abundant, low&#8208;cost CO2 and nitrogen sources to yield urea with both high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density. In this work, we designed and prepared a new two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), namely PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O, constructed by nickel&#8208;phthalocyanine (NiPc) ligands and square&#8208;planar FeO4 nodes, as the electrocatalyst for urea electrosynthesis. PcNi&#8722;Fe&#8722;O exhibits remarkable performance to yield urea at a high current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a high FE(urea) of 54.1&#8201;% in a neutral aqueous solution, surpassing those of most reported electrocatalysts. No obvious performance degradation was observed over 20&#8197;hours of continuous operation at the current density of 10.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. By expanding the electrode area to 25&#8197;cm2 and operating for 8&#8197;hours, we obtained 0.164&#8197;g of high&#8208;purity urea, underscoring its potential for industrial applications. Mechanism study unveiled the enhanced performance might be ascribed to the synergistic interaction between NiPc and FeO4 sites. Specifically, NH3 produced at the FeO4 site can efficiently migrate and couple with the *NHCOOH intermediate adsorbed on the urea&#8208;producing site (NiPc). This synergistic effect results in a lower energy barrier for C&#8722;N bond formation than those of the reported catalysts with single active sites.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Dependent Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Transport in a Perylenediimide Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contrasting behaviour of 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 in the presence of sodium and potassium ions is leveraged to create an n&#8208;type perylene diimide based organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor that responds selectively to potassium ions with a two order of magnitude higher current response than in the presence of sodium ions.







Abstract
A rapidly growing interest in organic bioelectronic applications has spurred the development of a wide variety of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. While these new mixed conductors have enabled the community to interface organic electronics with biological systems and efficiently transduce biological signals (ions) into electronic signals, the current materials selection does not offer sufficient selectivity towards specific ions of biological relevance without the use of auxiliary components such as ion&#8208;selective membranes. Here, we present the molecular design of an n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) perylene diimide semiconductor material decorated with pendant oligoether groups to facilitate interactions with cations such as Na+ and K+. Using the cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 oligoether motif, we find that the resulting mixed conductor PDI&#8208;crown displays a strong dependence on the size of the electrolyte cation when tested in an organic electrochemical transistor configuration. In stark contrast to the low current response on the order of 1&#8197;&#956;A observed with aqueous sodium chloride, a nearly 200&#8208;fold increase in current is observed with aqueous potassium chloride. We ascribe the high selectivity to extended molecular aggregation and therefore efficient charge transport in the presence of K+ due to a favourable sandwich&#8208;like structure between two adjacent 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 motifs and the potassium ion.

A phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy granted access to previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, allowing for molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of carbohydrates.







Abstract
A comprehensive molecular understanding of carbohydrate aggregation is key to optimize carbohydrate utilization and to engineer bioinspired analogues with tailored shapes and properties. However, the lack of well&#8208;defined synthetic standards has substantially hampered advances in this field. Herein, we employ a phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, including elongated platelets, helical bundles, and hexagonal particles. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis provided molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of these oligosaccharides, establishing a direct connection between the resulting morphologies and the oligosaccharide primary sequence. Our findings demonstrate that ETA is a powerful approach to elucidate the intrinsic aggregation behavior of carbohydrates in nature. Moreover, the ability to access a diverse array of morphologies, expanded with a non&#8208;natural sequence, underscores the potential of ETA, coupled with sequence design, as a robust tool for accessing programmable glycan architectures.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks Consisting of Tetraborate Nodes and Flexible Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetraborate node has been shown to facilitate the formation of 3D ionic covalent organic frameworks with flexible linkers. Irreversible deprotonation acts as a kinetic control to achieve high polymerization, while the dynamic B&#8722;O bond aids error correction. This approach has been investigated with three organic monomers and two metal counterions.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as versatile materials with many applications, such as carbon capture, molecular separation, catalysis, and energy storage. Traditionally, flexible building blocks have been avoided due to their potential to disrupt ordered structures. Recent studies have demonstrated the intriguing properties and enhanced structural diversity achievable with flexible components by judicious selection of building blocks. This study presents a novel series of ionic COFs (ICOFs) consisting of tetraborate nodes and flexible linkers. These ICOFs use borohydrides to irreversibly deprotonate the alcohol monomers to achieve a high degree of polymerization. Structural analysis confirms the dia topologies. Reticulation is explored using various monomers and metal counterions. Also, these frameworks exhibit excellent stability in alcohols and coordinating solvents. The materials have been tested as single&#8208;ion conductive solid&#8208;state electrolytes. ICOF&#8208;203&#8208;Li displays one of the lowest activation energies reported for ion conduction. This tetraborate chemistry is anticipated to facilitate further structural diversity and functionality in crystalline polymers.

         <title>Fence&#8208;Type Molecular Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To attain high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries, we've proposed a novel strategy for fence&#8208;type molecular electrocatalyst. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer (as catalyst), via nucleophilic substitution formation, creates a reaction space for multiphase transformation of sulfur species. And the uniformly distributed CE sites on the polymer regulate the molecular structures of sulfur species through coordination, boosting the overall redox kinetics.







Abstract
Improving the slow redox kinetics of sulfur species and shuttling issues of soluble intermediates induced from the multiphase sulfur redox reactions are crucial factors for developing the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. In this study, we successfully constructed a novel molecular electrocatalyst through in situ polymerization of bis(3,4&#8208;dibromobenzene)&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (BD18C6) with polysulfide anions on the cathode interface. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer acts as a spatial &#8220;fence&#8221; to precisely control the unique redox characteristics of sulfur species, which could confine sulfur substance within its interior and interact with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to optimize the reaction barrier of sulfur species. The &#8220;fence&#8221; structure and the double&#8208;sided Li+ penetrability of the CE molecule may also prevent the CE catalytic sites from being covered by sulfur during cycling. This new fence&#8208;type electrocatalyst mitigates the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, enhances the redox activity of sulfur species, and promotes the formation of three&#8208;dimensional stacked lithium sulfide (Li2S) simultaneously. It thus enables lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to exhibit superior rate performance and cycle stability, which may also inspire development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy&#8208;efficient conversion process.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Chiral Polymers Exhibiting Amplified Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers were synthesized by integrating chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone. The chiral polymers showed narrowband emission, high PLQY and large |glum| value. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs exhibited EQEmax of 9.8&#8201;%, |gEL| of 0.07, and FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This is the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers combining high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.







Abstract
Circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is highly promising in realm of 3D display and optical data storage. However, designing a groundbreaking chiral material with high comprehensive CPEL performance remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a pair of chiral polymers with self&#8208;assembled behavior is designed by integrating a chiral BN&#8208;moiety into polyfluorene backbone, named R&#8208;PBN and S&#8208;PBN, respectively. The chiral polymers show narrowband emission centered at 490&#8197;nm with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#8197;nm and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 79&#8201;%. After thermal annealing treatment, the chiral polymers undergo self&#8208;assembly, exhibiting amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetry factor (|glum|) of up to 0.11. Moreover, the solution&#8208;processed nondoped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on the chiral polymers as emitting layers exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 9.8&#8201;%, intense CPEL activities with |gEL| of up to 0.07, and small FWHM of 36&#8197;nm, simultaneously. This represents the first case of self&#8208;assembled chiral polymers that combines high EQE, large gEL value and narrowband emission.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Kalmanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol was achieved by using a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, aldol/elimination reaction to assemble the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations.







Abstract
Kalmanol, the flagship member of the kalmane diterpene family, possesses a complex and highly oxidized 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton with nine contiguous stereocenters and exhibits significant analgesic effects and cardiotoxic properties. We have achieved the efficient total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol in 22&#8197;steps with 2.3&#8201;% yield. The synthesis featured a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations of the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton.

         <title>Enantioselective S&#8208;Alkylation of Sulfenamides by Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 and an average yield of 94&#8201;% across a broad scope of inputs is achieved. Development of a catalyst to synthesize the opposite enantiomer with high selectivity and a demonstration of the utility of the method via application to the synthesis of a drug candidate is shown.







Abstract
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Essential to achieving high selectivity was the use of the triethylacetyl sulfenamide protecting group along with aqueous KOH as the base under biphasic aqueous conditions to enable the reaction to be performed at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. With these key parameters, enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 at the newly generated chiral sulfur center were achieved with an inexpensive cinchona alkaloid derived PTC. Broad scope and excellent functional group compatibility was observed for a variety of S&#8208;(hetero)aryl and branched and unbranched S&#8208;alkyl sulfenamides. Moreover, to achieve high selectivity for the opposite enantiomer, a pseudoenantiomeric catalyst was designed and synthesized from inexpensive cinchonidine. Given that sulfoximines are a bioactive pharmacophore of ever&#8208;increasing interest, selected product sulfilimines were oxidized to the corresponding sulfoximines with subsequent reductive cleavage affording the free&#8208;NH sulfoximines in high yields. The utility of the disclosed method was further demonstrated by the efficient asymmetric synthesis of atuveciclib, a phase I clinical candidate for which only chiral HPLC separation had previously been reported for isolation of the desired (R)&#8208;sulfoximine stereoisomer.

The first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective annulation of aldehydes and ketones with donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes generating chiral tetrahydrofurans is presented. For both aldehydes and ketones high yields and excellent stereoselectivities are obtained. Some intriguing mechanistic aspects are discussed, and stereoselective transformations are demonstrated.







Abstract
The substituted tetrahydrofuran core is a structural motif in many biologically active and natural compounds. However, the scarcity of enantioselective methods developed towards its synthesis makes this field challenging and attractive to explore. Herein, the first Br&#248;nsted&#8208;base catalyzed enantioselective (3+2) annulation of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes with aldehydes and ketones affording enantioenriched 2,3,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans is reported. The reaction concept is based on activation of racemic &#946;&#8208;cyclopropyl ketones by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base which catalyzes the (3+2) annulation for a range of aldehydes and ketones. For aldehydes, the annulation furnished tetrahydrofurans in excellent yield, good diastereoselectivity and with excellent enantioselectivity up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee. Surprisingly, aromatic aldehydes afforded the cis&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofurans as the major diastereoisomer, while for aliphatic aldehydes the trans&#8208;cycloadduct was favored. The reaction also proceeds well for ketones affording spiro tetrahydrofurans in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee). Hammett studies have been conducted to elucidate the influence of the electronic nature of benzaldehydes on the stereoselectivity. Based on the diastereochemical outcome for the aldehydes, two reaction paths for aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes are proposed. Finally, two diastereoselective synthetic transformations have been conducted to demonstrate the synthetic potential of the obtained products.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Modular Synthesis of Oxetane&#8208;Based Amide Bioisosteres: Concise, Robust and Scalable Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 42, October 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;step, modular and scalable construction of amino&#8208;oxetanes for the purpose of bioisosteric incorporation has been developed using Katritzky's benzotriazole chemistry. This simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol provides easy access to a range of amino&#8208;oxetanes, even those previously considered challenging. This method is expected to further lower the barrier to adoption of amino&#8208;oxetanes in drug development.







Abstract
Amide bioisoterism is a widely used strategy in drug development to fine&#8208;tune physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic properties, eliminate toxicity and gain intellectual property rights in uncharted chemical space. Of these, oxetane&#8208;amines offer particularly exciting possibilities as bioisosteres, although they are less frequently investigated than warranted due to the lack of simple and widely applicable synthetic methods. Herein, we report a two&#8208;step, practical, modular, robust, and scalable method for the construction of oxetane&#8208;containing amide bioisosteres that relies on the readily available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one. This operationally simple procedure exploits the enhanced reactivity of the keto group of the commercially available oxetan&#8208;3&#8208;one to form amine&#8208;benzotriazole intermediates, which springloaded adducts are then reacted with various aliphatic and aromatic organometallic reagents under mild conditions to afford various amino&#8208;oxetanes in good to high yields. The simplicity and broad applicability of the method greatly facilitates the synthesis of derivatives that were previously difficult or impossible to produce. The usefulness of this method in the field medicinal chemistry was also demonstrated by eliminating the well&#8208;known metabolic problem of ketoconazole.

         <dc:description>The development of advanced bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a unique dual active center alloying strategy is proposed to achieve the efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis, and the high entropy effect is further exploited to modulate the structure and performance of the catalysts. The MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;alloying method was employed to construct the CoCuFeAgRu high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA), which are uniformly anchored in porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets. Notably, the obtained HEA catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both ORR and OER, and a peak power density of 136. 53 mW cm&#8208;2 and an energy density of 987.9 mAh gZn&#8208;1, surpassing the most of the previously reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Moreover, the assembled flexible rechargeable ZAB enables excellent performance even at the ultralow temperature of &#8208;40&#176;C, with an energy density of 601.6 mAh gZn&#8208;1 and remarkable cycling stability up to 1,650 hours. Combined experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of the HEA catalyst originated from the synergistic effect of the Ag and Ru dual active centers, and the optimization of the electronic structure by alloying effect.</dc:description>

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One Polymer Gel Electrolyte towards High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Fiber Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries are explored as promising power systems for wearable and portable electronic devices due to their intrinsic safety and the use of ambient oxygen as cathode material. However, challenges such as limited zinc anode reversibility and sluggish cathode reaction kinetics result in poor cycling stability and low energy efficiency. To address these challenges, we design a polydopamine&#8208;based all&#8208;in&#8208;one gel electrolyte (PAGE) that simultaneously regulates the reversibility of zinc anodes and the kinetics of air cathodes through polydopamine interfacial and redox chemistry, respectively. The intrinsic catechol and carboxylate groups in PAGE regulate the transport and solvation structure of Zn2+, facilitating dendrite&#8208;free zinc deposition with a lamellar stacking morphology. Additionally, the oxidation of redox&#8208;active catechol groups in PAGE replaces the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction on the air cathode and reduces the energy barrier for charging, enabling fiber zinc&#8208;air batteries to achieve a significantly improved energy efficiency of 95% and a longer lifespan of 40 hours. Further integration into self&#8208;powered electronic textiles underscores its potential for next&#8208;generation wearable systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Spacer Conjugation for Efficient and Stable 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating 2D perovskite in 3D perovskite absorber holds great potential to improve the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the bulky&#8208;cation&#8208;based 2D structures often exhibit poor charge transport and are prone to formation of charge&#8208;extraction barrier that impedes efficient device operation. We address these issues by introducing aromatic spacers with enhanced molecular conjugation. Among our tested aromatic spacers, the pyrenylbutanamine (PyBA) spacer was shown to endow 2D perovskites with superior charge transport properties and efficient charge extraction from the bulk perovskite in 2D/3D PSCs, due to the highest degree of conjugation. As a result, we achieved a power conversion efficiency of up to 25.3% in a 0.16&#8208;cm2 single cell and 21.0% in a 24.8&#8208;cm2 module. Moreover, the incorporated PyBA substantially raised the resistance of 2D/3D PSCs against moisture and ion migration, resulting in enhanced environmental, thermal, and operational stability. Notably, the PyBA&#8208;based devices retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000 hours at 25 &#8451; and 80% relative humidity, or 1000 hours at 85 &#8451; and 85% humidity, or 3000 hours of operation under continuous 1&#8208;Sun illumination at 40 &#8451;, showcasing their enhanced stability compared to previously reported 2D/3D PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) fluoride molecular glue to improve the SnO2/perovskite interface for efficient perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming at numerous defects at SnO2/perovskite interface and lattice mismatch in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we design a kind of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular glue (KBF4&#8208;TFMSA), which is derived from strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction between potassium tetrafluoroborate (KBF4) and trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFMSA). A remarkable efficiency of 25.8% with negligible hysteresis and a stabilized power output of 25.0% have been achieved, in addition, 24.57% certified efficiency of 1 cm2 device is also obtained. Further investigation reveals that this KBF4&#8208;TFMSA can interact with oxygen vacancies and under&#8208;coordinated Sn(IV) from the SnO2, in the meantime, FA+ (NH2&#8208;C=NH) and K+ cations can be well fixed by hydrogen bonding interaction between FA+ &#160;and BF4&#8208;, and electrostatic attraction between sulfonyl oxygen and K+ ions, respectively. Thereby, FAPbI3 crystal grain sizes are increased, interfacial defects are significantly reduced and carrier extraction/transport is facilitated, leading to better cell performance and excellent stabilities. Non&#8208;encapsulated devices can maintain 91% of their initial efficiency under maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point (MPP) tracking while continuous illumination (~100 mW cm&#8208;2) for 1000 h, and retain 91% of the initial efficiency after 1000 h &#8220;double 60&#8221; damp&#8208;heat stability testing (60&#176;C and 60%RH (RH, relatively humidity)).</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Discovery of Low&#8208;Pt High Entropy Intermetallic Compounds for Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advancing the design of cathode catalysts to significantly maximize platinum utilization and augment the longevity has emerged as a formidable challenge in the field of fuel cells. Herein, we rationally design a high entropy intermetallic compound (HEIC, Pt(FeCoNiCu)3) for catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by an efficient machine learning stategy, where crystal graph convolutional neural networks are employed to expedite the multicomponent design. Based on a dataset generated from first&#8208;principles calculations, the model can achieve a high prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors of 0.003 for surface strain and 0.011 eV atom&#8208;1 for formation energy. In addition, we identify two chemical features (atomic size difference and mixing enthalpy) as new descriptors to explore advanced ORR catalysts. The carbon supported Pt(FeCoNiCu)3 catalyst with small particle size is successfully synthesized by a freeze&#8208;drying&#8208;annealing technology, and exhibits ultrahigh mass activity (4.09 A mgPt&#8208;1) and specific activity (7.92 mA cm&#8208;2). Meanwhile, The catalyst also shows significantly enhanced electrochemical stability which can be ascribed to the sluggish difussion effect in the HEIC structure. Beyond offering a promising low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell cathode, this work offers a new paradigm to rationally design advanced catalysts for energy storage and conversion devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Hydrophosphorylation of Unactivated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;stereogenic phosphorus compounds are essential across various fields, yet their synthesis via enantioselective P&#8208;C bond formation remains both challenging and underdeveloped. We report the first copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrophosphorylation of alkynes, facilitated by a newly designed chiral 1,2&#8208;diamine ligand. Unlike previous methods that rely on kinetic resolution with less than 50% conversion, our approach employs a distinct dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation&#160;mechanism, achieving complete conversion of racemic starting materials. This reaction is compatible with a broad range of aromatic and aliphatic terminal alkynes, producing products with high yields (up to 95%), exclusive cis selectivity, and exceptional regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity (&gt; 20:1 r.r. and up to 96% ee). The resulting products were further transformed into a diverse array of enantioenriched P&#8208;stereogenic scaffolds. Preliminary mechanistic studies were conducted to elucidate the reaction details.</dc:description>

         <title>Dyotropic Rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;Lactams: Reaction Development, Mechanistic Study, and Application to the Total Syntheses of Tricyclic Marine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented dyotropic rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;lactams has been developed, which provides an enabling tool for the synthesis of structurally diverse &#947;&#8208;butyrolactams. Unlike the well&#8208;established dyotropic rearrangements of &#946;&#8208;lactones, the present reaction probably proceeds through a dual&#8208;activation mode, and thus displays unusual reactivity and chemoselectivity. The combined computational and experimental results suggest that the dyotropic rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;lactams may proceed through different mechanisms depending on the nature of migrating groups (H, alkyl, or aryl). Hinging on a chemoselective H&#8208;migration dyotropic rearrangement of &#946;&#8208;lactams, we have completed the divergent synthesis of tricyclic marine alkaloids (&#8211;)&#8208;lepadiformine A, (+)&#8208;cylindricine C, and (&#8211;)&#8208;fasicularin within 11&#8208;12 longest linear steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Modification of Carbazole Based Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Hybrid Strategy for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) are widely applied in inverted perovskite solar cells (iPSCs) due to their unique molecular properties. However, the symmetrical structure of the carbazole&#8208;based SAMs makes it difficult to finely regulate their performance, which impedes the further enhancement of the efficiency and stability of iPSCs. This work shows that by building an asymmetric carbazole core, the crucial properties of SAM molecules can be effectively regulated. It has been confirmed that the hybrid thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene unit of this asymmetric core governs the energy level, the surface wettability, and the defect passivation capability of the SAMs, while the substituent of core has a greater impact on the molecular dipole and device stability. The synergistic effects from thieno[2,3&#8208;b]thiophene and fluorine lead to the KF&#8208;derived iPSC demonstrating a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.17% and excellent operational stability. This hybrid design concept offers a promising approach for the further structural modification of SAMs in iPSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable Silica&#8208;Based Zeolites with Three&#8208;Dimensional Systems of Extra&#8208;Large Pores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This minireview discusses the discovery and properties of the first stable, silica&#8208;based zeolites with 3D systems of extra&#8208;large pores. A hydrothermal synthesis using a large phosphonium cation affords the direct synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolite ZEO&#8208;1 and chain silicate ZEO&#8208;2. A 1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation of ZEO&#8208;2 yields zeolite ZEO&#8208;3, while its silylation followed by topotactic condensation affords the zeolite of lowest density, ZEO&#8208;5.







Abstract
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials that find a very wide range of applications, which, however, are limited by the size and dimensionality of their pores. Stable silica zeolites with a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) system of extra&#8208;large pores (ELP, i.e., pores with minimum windows along the diffusion path consisting of more than 12&#8197;SiO4/2 tetrahedra, 12R) are in demand for processing larger molecules than zeolites can currently handle. However, they have challenged worldwide synthetic capabilities for more than eight decades. In this review we first present a brief history of the discovery of ELP zeolites. Next, we show that earlier successes of zeolites with 3D ELP were not actually zeolites, but rather interrupted structures with, in addition, a composition that severely detracted from their stability. Finally, we present three new fully connected stable silica&#8208;based 3D ELP zeolites ZEO&#8208;1, ZEO&#8208;3 and ZEO&#8208;5, discuss their preparation methods and stability as well as the clear advantage of their increased porosity in catalysis and adsorption processes involving large molecules. We will discuss peculiar characteristics of their preparation and present two new reaction types giving rise to zeolites (1D&#8208;to&#8208;3D topotactic condensation and interchain expansion), highlighting how new synthesis methods can provide materials that would otherwise be unfeasible.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Chemistry in Aqueous Ammonium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen bond plays a crucial role in ammonium ion batteries, influencing NH4+ storage sites, energy storage mechanism, and diffusion process. Investigating hydrogen bonding effects is essential for developing strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, comprehending the energy storage mechanism, and guiding the future development of ammonium ion batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) pose the advantages of high safety, low cost, and high efficiency, capturing substantial research interest. The intrinsic chemical properties of NH4+ promote the formation of hydrogen bonds with other constituents in AIBs, critically influencing the processes of NH4+ transfer, storage, and diffusion. This review delves into the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding chemistry in AIBs. Firstly, the principles of hydrogen bond are elucidated as the dominant chemical interaction governing NH4+ dynamics in AIBs. Subsequently, a detailed analysis is conducted on the impacts of hydrogen bonds in both electrolytes and electrode materials. Furthermore, the practical applications of hydrogen bonding chemistry within the context of AIBs are assessed. Finally, strategic insights and future research directions are proposed to harness hydrogen bonding effects for optimizing AIB performance. This review aims to define the mechanisms and impacts of hydrogen bonds in AIBs, providing robust strategies to enhance electrochemical performance, deepen the understanding of energy storage mechanisms, and guide the future advancement of AIBs technology.

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Adenine Derived Secondary Nucleic Acid Frameworks: From Structural Characteristics to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular oligo&#8208;adenine structures, including A&#8208;motif, T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex, adenine&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, and adenine&#8208;coralyne&#8208;adenine complex, find growing interest in the area of DNA&#8208;nanotechnology, and significant recent advances and applications of these frameworks are demonstrated.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208;adenine (polyA) is primarily known for its critical role in mRNA stability, translational status, and gene regulation. Beyond its biological functions, extensive research has unveiled the diverse applications of polyA. In response to environmental stimuli, single polyA strands undergo distinctive structural transitions into diverse secondary configurations, which are reversible upon the introduction of appropriate counter&#8208;triggers. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances of noncanonical structures derived from polyA, including A&#8208;motif duplex, A&#8208;cyanuric acid triplex, A&#8208;coralyne&#8208;A duplex, and T&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;A&#8208;T triplex. The structural characteristics and mechanisms underlying these conformations under specific external stimuli are addressed, followed by examples of their applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA hydrogels, supramolecular fibre assembly, molecular electronics and switches, biosensing and bioengineering, payloads encapsulation and release, and others. A detailed comparison of these polyA&#8208;derived noncanonical structures is provided, highlighting their distinctive features. Furthermore, by integrating their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and conformational characteristics, advanced material development, such as pH&#8208;cascaded DNA hydrogels and supramolecular fibres exhibiting dynamic structural transitions adapting environmental cues, are introduced. An outlook for future developments is also discussed. These polyA derived, stimuli&#8208;responsive, noncanonical structures enrich the arsenal of DNA &#8220;toolbox&#8221;, offering dynamic DNA frameworks for diverse future applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomaterials Mediate Cholesterol Depletion for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this minireview, we briefly discuss multiple roles of cholesterol in cancer progression, tumor microenvironment, and immune responses. We then summarize recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism using multifunctional nanomaterials, via oxidative stress regulation, immune checkpoint modulation, mechanical stress response manipulation, and cholesterol metabolic pathway alteration.







Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential membrane component, and the metabolites from cholesterol play important biological functions to intricately support cancer progression and dampen immune responses. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the role of cholesterol metabolism regulation on inhibiting tumor growth, remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In this minireview, we discuss complex cholesterol metabolism in tumors, its important role in cancer progression, and its influences on immune cells in the TME. We provide an overview of recent advances in cancer treatment through regulating cholesterol metabolism. We discuss the design of cholesterol&#8208;altering multifunctional nanomaterials to regulate oxidative stress, modulate immune checkpoints, manipulate mechanical stress responses, and alter cholesterol metabolic pathways. Additionally, we examine the interactions between cholesterol metabolism regulation and established cancer treatments with the aim of identifying efficient strategies to disrupt cholesterol metabolism and synergistic combination therapies for effective cancer treatment.

         <title>The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine&#8208;tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi&#8208;component gas separations.







Abstract
Adsorbents&#8208;based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy&#8208;efficient alternatives towards current thermal&#8208;driven methods, and the study on multi&#8208;component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two&#8208;component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor&#8208;made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi&#8208;component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi&#8208;component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self&#8208;adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate&#8208;opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided.

     alt="The Chemistry of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Multicomponent Gas Separation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks that are featured with flexibility, fine-tunable pore size and diverse functional sites could be rationally designed as the trap for single molecule or multiple molecules, deepening the insight into the separation mechanisms for complex separation systems and paving the new paths towards multi-component gas separations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adsorbents-based gas separation technologies are regarded as the potential energy-efficient alternatives towards current thermal-driven methods, and the study on multi-component gas separation is essential to deepen our understanding of the adsorbents for practical use. Relative to the ideal two-component mixtures, both the adsorption behavior and separation mechanisms are obviously more complex in multiple gas mixtures due to their close or even overlapped sizes and properties. The emergence of metal&#8211;organic frameworks with controllable pore size and pore chemistry provides the platform for the tailor-made pore structure to satisfy the harsh requirements of multi-component gas separation. This minireview highlights the recent advance of multi-component gas separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks, including multiple impurities removal and selective molecular capture. Combining with the typical cases of hydrocarbon separations (C2, C4, and C8), the detailed discussion about the developed strategies (e.g. self-adaptive binding sites, multiple binding spaces, synergistic binding sites, synergistic sorbent separation technology, gate-opening effect, size and thermodynamic combine effect) that are adaptive to different scenarios would be provided. The review will conclude with our perspective on the existing barriers and the future direction of this topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complexes of HPN&#8226; and HNP&#8226; Radicals with Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorus mononitride (PN) is a carrier of phosphorus in the interstellar medium. As the simplest derivatives of PN, the radical species HPN&#8226; and HNP&#8226; have remained elusive. Herein, we report the generation, characterization, and photochemistry of HPN&#8226; and HNP&#8226; in N2&#8208;matrix at 3 K. Specifically, HPN&#8226; was formed as a weakly bonded complex with CO in the matrix by 254 nm photolysis of the novel phosphinyl radical HPNCO&#8226;. The &#8226;NPH&#8722;CO complex is extremely unstable, as it undergoes spontaneous isomerization to the lower&#8208;energy isomer &#8226;PNH&#8722;CO through fast quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) with a half&#8208;life of 6.1 min at 3 K. Upon further irradiation at 254 nm, the reverse conversion of &#8226;PNH&#8722;CO to &#8226;NPH&#8722;CO along with dehydrogenation to yield PN was observed. The characterization &#8226;NPH&#8722;CO and &#8226;PNH&#8722;CO with matrix&#8208;isolation IR spectroscopy is supported by D, 15N, and 13C isotope labeling and quantum chemical calculations at the XYGJ&#8208;OS/AVTZ level of theory, and the mechanism by hydrogen atom tunneling is consistent with multidimensional instanton theory calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytically Active Site Mapping Realized through Energy Transfer Modeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The demands of a sustainable chemical industry are a driving force for the development of heterogeneous catalytic platforms exhibiting facile catalyst recovery, recycling, and resilience to diverse reaction conditions. Homogeneous&#8208;to&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst transitions can be realized through the integration of efficient homogeneous catalysts within porous matrices. Herein, we offer a versatile approach to understanding how guest distribution and evolution impact the catalytic performance of heterogeneous host&#8208;guest catalytic platforms by implementing the resonance energy transfer (RET) concept using fluorescent model systems mimicking the steric constraints of targeted catalysts. Using the RET&#8208;based methodology, we mapped condition&#8208;dependent guest (re)distribution within a porous support on the example of modular matrices such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Furthermore, we correlate RET results performed on the model systems with the catalytic performance of two MOF&#8208;encapsulated catalysts used to promote CO2 hydrogenation and ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Guests are incorporated using aperture&#8208;opening encapsulation, and catalyst redistribution is not observed under practical reaction conditions, showcasing a pathway to advance catalyst recyclability in the case of host&#8208;guest platforms. These studies represent the first generalizable approach for mapping the guest distribution in heterogeneous host&#8208;guest catalytic systems, providing a foundation for predicting and tailoring the performance of catalysts integrated into various porous supports.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Confined Spaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of mechanophores, polymer mechanochemistry has emerged as a powerful tool for creating force&#8208;responsive materials with a variety of desired functions, ranging from color change to molecular release. However, it remains challenging to improve the efficiency of mechanochemical activation, especially for mechanophores embedded within polymer networks, which has profound implications for translating mechanochemical responses into materials&#8208;centered applications. The physical and chemical conditions under spatial confinement differ significantly from those in the surrounding bulk environment, offering opportunities to facilitate mechanochemical activation. In this Minireview, we discuss and summarize recent progress in polymer mechanochemistry within confined spaces including surfaces/interfaces, polymer assemblies, and other nanostructures, specifically focusing on the effects of spatial confinement on the enhancement of mechanophore activation. We envision that combining confinement effects with advances in molecular and materials engineering will further improve the activation efficiency, capitalizing more fully on the potential of mechanophores toward practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Germylene Mediated Reductive C&#8211;C and C&#8210;N Coupling of an Isocyanide and its Device Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have demonstrated a unique reductive coupling of 4&#8208;iodophenyl isocyanide, facilitated by a perimidine&#8208;based N&#8208;heterocyclic germylene (NHGe), which yields a bis&#8208;spirogerma compound featuring simultaneous C&#8210;C and C&#8210;N bond formation. This reaction, which leads to the oxidation of germanium from +2 to +4, represents a significant departure from previously documented isocyanide&#8208;germylene interactions. The product exhibits extensive conjugation across its bicyclic C&#8324;Ge&#8322;N&#8322; framework, conferring distinct photophysical properties, including prominent orange luminescence in both solution and solid states. The photophysical properties are supported by the TD&#8208;DFT calculations confirming an n&#8594;&#960;* transition. The potential application of this compound in optoelectronic devices, particularly as a hole transport layer in PbS quantum dot solar cells, is also explored, with promising preliminary results.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Dynamics Switches the Selectivity of CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Reverse Water Gas&#8208;Shift reaction (CO2 + H2=CO + H2O) allows to balance syn&#8208;gas under industrial conditions. Nickel has been suggested as a potential catalyst but the temperature required is too high, more than 800&#186;C, limiting practical implementation but when lowering the temperature methanation occurs. Simulations via Density Functional Theory on well&#8208;defined surfaces have systematically failed to reproduce these experimental results. But under reaction conditions Ni surfaces are not static and DFT models coupled to microkinetics show that at high CO coverages drive the generation of Ni adatoms that are the active sites for methanation. At higher temperatures, the adatom population decreases, and the selectivity towards CO increases. Thus, the mechanism behind the selectivity switch is driven by the dynamics induced by reaction intermediates. Our work contributes to the inclusion of dynamic aspects of materials under reaction conditions in the understanding of complex catalytic behaviour.</dc:description>

         <title>Endo&#8208;Encapsulated Multi&#8208;Resonance Dendrimers with Through&#8208;Space Interactions for Efficient Narrowband Blue&#8208;Emitting Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from conventional luminescent dendrimers with fluorophore tethered outside to dendron, here we first developed endo&#8208;encapsulated luminescent dendrimers with multi&#8208;resonance (MR) fluorophore embedded inside of carbazole dendrons by growing dendrons through 1,8&#8208;positions of central carbazole moiety to create a cavity for accommodating the fluorophore. This endo&#8208;encapsulated structure not only shields the fluorophore to fully resist aggregation&#8208;caused spectral broadening, but also induce through&#8208;space interactions between dendron and fluorophore via intramolecular &#960;&#8208;stacking, giving lowered singlet state energy and reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting to accelerate reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from triplet to singlet states. The resultant dendrimer containing 1,8&#8208;linked second&#8208;generation carbazole dendrons and boron, sulfur&#8208;doped polycyclic MR fluorophore exhibits narrowband blue emission at 471 nm with FWHM kept at 34 nm even in neat film, together with ~4 times enhancement of RISC rate constant compared to its exo&#8208;tethered counterpart. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs based on the endo&#8208;encapsulated dendrimer reveal efficient narrowband blue emissions with maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.6%, representing the best device efficiency for blue&#8208;emitting multi&#8208;resonance dendrimers so far.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer in Photoelectrochemical Alcohol Oxidation Enhanced by Nickel&#8208;based Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using biomass oxidation reactions instead of water oxidation reactions is optimal for accomplishing biomass conversion and effective hydrogen generation. Here, we report that Fe2O3 photoanodes with a NiOOH cocatalyst exhibit excellent performance for photoelectrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The conversion efficiency for HMF reaches 98.5%, while the selectivity for FDCA is 94.2%. We revealed that HMF is oxidized through a spontaneous proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process with the high&#8208;valent phase of the Ni&#8208;based catalyst. The dangling oxygen and bridging oxygen of the high&#8208;valent phase species serve as proton&#8208;accepting sites. Furthermore, we pointed out that the deprotonated bond dissociation free energy difference between the catalysts and alcohols is the thermodynamic trigger for the PCET process. This study provides a reasonable explanation for the alcohol oxidation reaction, which is beneficial for designing biomass conversion systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Promotion of RNF168&#8208;Mediated Nucleosomal H2A Ubiquitylation by Structurally defined K63&#8208;Polyubiquitylated Linker Histone H1</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of histones with homogeneous modifications is a potent approach for quantitatively deciphering the functional crosstalk between different post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs). Here, we developed an expedient site&#8208;specific (poly)ubiquitylation strategy (CAEPL, Cysteine&#8208;Aminoethylation coupled with Enzymatic Protein Ligation), which integrates the Cys&#8208;aminoethylation reaction with the process of ubiquitin&#8208;activating enzyme UBA1&#8208;assisted native chemical ligation. Using this strategy, we successfully prepared monoubiquitylated and K63&#8208;linked di&#8208; and tri&#8208;ubiquitylated linker histone H1.0 proteins, which were incorporated into individual chromatosomes. Quantitative biochemical analysis of different RNF168 constructs on ubiquitylated chromatosomes with different ubiquitin chain lengths demonstrated that K63&#8208;linked polyubiquitylated H1.0 could directly stimulate RNF168 ubiquitylation activity by enhancing the affinity between RNF168 and chromatosome. Subsequent cryo&#8208;EM structural analysis of the RNF168/UbcH5c&#8211;Ub/H1.0&#8211;K63&#8208;Ub3 chromatosome complex revealed the potential recruitment orientation between RNF168 UDM1 domain and K63&#8208;linked ubiquitin chain on H1.0. Finally, we explored the impact of H1.0 ubiquitylation on RNF168 activity in the context of asymmetric H1.0&#8211;K63&#8208;Ub3 di&#8208;nucleosome substrate, revealing a comparable stimulation effect of both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;nucleosomal crosstalk. Overall, our study highlights the significance of access to structurally&#8208;defined polyubiquitylated H1.0 by CAEPL strategy, enabling in&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations of in&#8208;trans PTM crosstalk between linker histone H1.0 and core histone H2A ubiquitylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous Nanobelts for Efficient Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) amorphous nanomaterials combine the advantages of high active site concentration of amorphous structure, high specific surface area and efficient charge transfer and mass transport of 1D materials, so they present promising opportunities for catalysis. However, a significant challenge involves achieving a balance between the high orientation of 1D morphology and the isotropy of amorphous structure, which severely obstructs the controllable preparation of 1D amorphous materials. Guided by the hard&#8208;soft acids&#8208;bases theory, here we develop a general strategy for preparing 1D amorphous nanomaterials through the precise modulation of bond strength between metal ions and organic ligands for a moderated fastness. The soft base dodecanethiol (DT) is multifunctionally served as both structure&#8208;regulating agent and morphology&#8208;directing agent. Compared with the borderline acids (e.g. Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+) to construct amorphous structure, soft acid of Cu+ which produced crystalline nanobelts can still be amorphized by reducing the hardness of Cu ions through redox reaction to weak Cu&#8208;SR bond. Due to the combined advantages of amorphous structure and one&#8208;dimensional morphology, amorphous CuDT nanobelts exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity in electrochemical nitrate reduction, outperformed the most of the reported Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This work will effectively bridge the gap between traditional 1D crystalline nanomaterials and amorphization preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenanthridine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall Solar H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels is green and sustainable, but severely restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Constructing intriguing photocatalysts with effective active centers is a shortcut to breaking the kinetic bottleneck with great significance. Herein, we synthesize two novel neutral phenanthridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2) for photosynthesizing H2O2. Compared to the no phenanthridine counterpart (AN&#8208;COF), the H2O2 photosynthetic activities of PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2 are markedly boosted. In air and pure water without sacrificial agents, under Xe lamp and natural sunlight, the H2O2 photogeneration rate of PD&#8208;COF2 is 6103 and 3646 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively. Further experimental and theoretical inspections demonstrate that introducing phenanthridine units into COFs smoothly modulates the charge carrier dynamics and thermodynamically favors the generation of crucial OOH* and OH* intermediates in the ORR and WOR paths, respectively. Additionally, this is the first time the neutral phenanthridine moiety serves as the photooxidation unit for 2e&#8208; WOR towards H2O2 photoproduction. The current work sheds light on exploring novel catalytic centers for high&#8208;performance H2O2 evolution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Diatomic catalysts, especially those with heteronuclear active sites, have recently attracted significant attention for their advantages over single&#8208;atom catalysts in reactions with relatively high energy barrier, e.g. oxygen evolution reaction. Rational design and synthesis of heteronuclear diatomic catalysts are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report macrocyclic precursor constrained strategy to fabricate series of transition metal (MT, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, or Cu)&#8208;noble (MN, Ir or Ru) centers in carbon material. One notable&#160;performance trend is observed in the order of Cu&#8208;MN &lt; Mn&#8208;MN &lt; Fe&#8208;MN &lt; MN &lt; Co&#8208;MN &lt; Ni&#8208;MN. However, the&#160;pathway has been not altered, still following the traditional adsorption reaction mechanism. The effect of the MT atoms on the&#160;performances could possibly originate from the distinct adsorption/desorption behaviors of key intermediates (i.e. *OH, *O and/or *OOH), strongly implying that &#916;G*OOH&#8208;&#916;G*OH could be used as the performance descriptor. We believe that our work provides useful strategy for synthesis of diatomic active sites with sole coordination configuration and varied composition, and in&#8208;depth insight to their catalytic mechanism, which could be used for further optimization of diatomic catalysts towards oxygen electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicon in Si3Cu3&#8722; Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations have identified the global minimum structure of the 16&#8208;valence electron Si3Cu3&#8208; cluster, which features a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) in a rhombic arrangement. The Si3 and Cu3 triangles are interconnected by an Si2/Cu2 edge, forming an ordered chain&#8208;like structure. Besides the conventional 2c&#8208;2e &#963;&#8208;bond connecting Si3 and Cu3, the stability of this cluster is reinforced by a delocalized 3c&#8208;2e &#963;&#8208;bond in Cu3 and a &#960;&#8208;bond in Si3. Our study provides rare experimental confirmation of a planar hypercoordinate heavier Group 14 element, opening possibilities for exploring similar structures in two&#8208;dimensional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ethanol processable inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid hole transporting layers enabled 20.12% efficiency organic solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, a high&#8208;performance inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid hole transporting layer (HTL) was developed using ethanol&#8208;soluble alkoxide precursors and a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM). Three metal oxides&#8212;vanadium oxide (VOx), niobium oxide (Nb2O5), and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5)&#8212;were synthesized through successive low&#8208;temperature (100 &#176;C) thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments of their respective precursors: vanadium oxytriethoxide (EtO&#8208;V), niobium ethoxide (EtO&#8208;Nb), and tantalum ethoxide (EtO&#8208;Ta). Among these, the Nb2O5 film exhibited excellent transmittance, a high work function, and good conductivity, along with a more compact and uniform structure featuring fewer interfacial defects, which facilitated efficient charge extraction and transport. Furthermore, the deposition of a SAM of (2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (2PACz) on top of Nb2O5 further passivated defects, enhancing interfacial contact with the photoactive layer. The resulting inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid HTL of Nb2O5/2PACz demonstrated excellent compatibility with various photoactive blends, achieving impressive power conversion efficiencies of 19.44%, 19.18%, and 20.12% for the PM6:L8&#8208;BO, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, and D18:BTP&#8208;eC9 based organic solar cells, respectively. 20.12% is the best performance for bulk heterojunction organic solar cells with binary components as the photoactive layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Non&#8208;Equilibrium Solvation Structure&#160;in&#160;Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Wide&#8208;Temperature and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs) encounters significant challenges due to aggressive electrode chemistry. Recently, locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) have garnered attention for their exceptional stability with both Li anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes.&#160;However, there remains a limited understanding of how diluents in LCILEs affect the thermodynamic stability of the solvation structure and transportation dynamics of Li+ ions. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature LCILEs with 1,3&#8208;dichloropropane (DCP13) diluent to construct a non&#8208;equilibrium solvation structure under external&#160;electric field, wherein the DCP13 diluent enters the Li+ ion solvation sheath to enhance Li+ ion transport and suppress oxidative side reactions at high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2, NCM90).Consequently, a Li/NCM90 cell utilizing this LCILE achieves a high capacity retention of 94% after 240 cycles at 4.3 V, also operates stably at high cut&#8208;off voltages from 4.4 to 4.6 V and over a wide temperature range from &#8208;20 to 60 &#176;C. Additionally, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with this LCILE simultaneously achieves high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and stable cycling, manifesting the practical feasibility. This work redefines the role of diluents in LCILEs, providing inspiration for electrolyte design in developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes with Emission up to 1010 nm: Synthesis, Structures, and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) circularly polarized absorbing or emitting materials offer distinct advantages over their visible&#8208;light counterparts and have attracted considerable interest across various fields. Materials exhibiting NIR chiroptical properties with high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F) are particularly rare. In this study, we report the synthesis of a series of helical nanographenes (1, 2, 3, and 4), where perylene is fused with one to four hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (sub)units via a strategy involving Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition followed by Scholl reaction. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis confirmed their structures, revealing helicene moieties integrated into a highly contorted framework. Benefiting from a similar distribution pattern of frontier molecular orbitals to perylene and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, compounds 1&#8208;4 demonstrate respectable &#934;F values of 31.9%, 15.0%, 13.7%, and 6.5%, respectively, with emission maxima reaching up to 1010 nm. Their enantiopure forms, isolated by preparative chiral HPLC, exhibit distinct circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence across a broad spectral range, extending from the ultraviolet to the NIR.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation of Indoles with N&#8208;Triftosylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a general rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intermolecular dearomative cyclopropanation of indoles using trifluoromethyl N&#8208;triftosylhydrazones as carbene precursors. The reaction enables the rapid construction of diverse cyclopropane fused indolines bearing a trifluoromethylated quaternary stereocenter in high enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee). This mild method exhibits a broad substrate scope, is compatible with various functional groups, and can even be utilized for the late&#8208;stage diversification of complex bioactive molecules. DFT calculations suggest that the formation of a key zwitterionic intermediate is responsible for the chiral induction. Overall, this approach opens up new possibilities for asymmetric cyclopropanation of challenging aromatic heterocyclic compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>High&#8208;voltage sodium metal batteries (SMBs) present a viable pathway towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;based batteries due to the competitive cost advantage and abundant supply of sodium resources. However, they still suffer from severe capacity decay induced by the notorious decomposition of the electrolyte under high voltage and unstable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). In addition, the high reactivity of Na metal and flammable electrolytes push SMBs to their safety limits. Herein, a special dual&#8208;anion aggregated Na+ solvation structure is designed in a nonflammable trimethyl phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, and a gradient CEI enriched with phosphorus and boron compounds is formed on the cathode. This thin and stable interphase effectively suppresses the parasitic reaction, improves the interfacial stability of the cathode, and facilitates Na+ transport through the interface by the synergistic effect of multi&#8208;components, thus optimizing the cycling stability and safety of SMBs. The Na0.95Ni0.4Fe0.15Mn0.3Ti0.15O2//Na batteries employing such electrolyte provide a discharge capacity of 167.5 mA h g&#8722;1 and high retention in the capacity of 85.2% after 800 cycles at 1 C. This approach offers a general strategy for the design of flame&#8208;retardant high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and the practical application of SMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Resistance Gene&#8208;Guided Discovery of the Molecular Basis for Biosynthesis of the Fatty Acid&#160;Synthase Inhibitor Cerulenin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cerulenin (1) is the first reported natural fatty acid synthase inhibitor and has been intensively researched for its antifungal, anticancer and anti&#8208;obesity properties. However, the molecular basis for its biosynthesis has remained a mystery for six decades. Here, we have identified the polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster (cer) responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 from two Sarocladium species using a self&#8208;resistance gene mining approach, which we validated via heterologous reconstitution of cer cluster in an Aspergillus nidulans host. Expression of various combinations of cer genes uncovered key pathway intermediates, electrocyclisation products derived from PKS&#8208;encoded polyenoic acids, and a suite of 13 new analogues of 1. This enabled us to establish a biosynthetic pathway to 1 that starts with a C12 polyketide precursor with both E and Z double bonds and involves a complex series of epoxidations, double bond shifts, E/Z isomerisation and epoxide reduction. Using in vitro assays, we further validated the roles of amidotransferase CerD in amidation, and oxidase CerF and reductase CerE in the final two&#8208;electron oxidation and enone reduction steps towards 1. These findings expand our understanding of complex tailoring modifications in highly reducing PKS pathways and pave the way for the engineered biosynthesis of cerulenin analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen bonds enable efficient photoreduction of sulfur&#8208;containing heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalcogen bonding interactions have attracted significant attention in a broad chemistry community, with a particular focus on their ability to stabilise the key transition states in various organic synthetic routes. In this work, we demonstrate that they can also be harnessed in selective photoredox reactions, which cannot be otherwise achieved with alternative approaches to photoreduction. We demonstrate this concept through the photoreduction of the sulfur&#8208;containing DNA nucleoside precursor thioanhydrouridine to 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;thiouridine, revealing the previously unrecognized role of bisulfide in this process. Based on quantum chemical simulations, we identify a stable chalcogen&#8208;bonding complex of the hydrosulfide anion and thionhydrouridine (HS&#8208;&#8230;S contacts), which enables directional photoinduced electron transfer, resulting in the formation of non&#8208;canonical DNA nucleoside. We also disprove the possibility that photoreduction of thioanhydronucleosides could be initiated by hydrated electrons generated from irradiated bisulfide anions which do not interact with the chromophore. Finally, we show that selective photoreduction mediated by chalcogen bonds can only occur for chromophores, which exhibit sufficiently long excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the locally&#8208;excited states to undergo transition to the productive charge transfer state. These findings can be further used in the design of similar photoredox reactions which can employ the potential of chalcogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emitting Helically Twisted Conjugated Frameworks Consisting of Alternant Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Units and Multiple Boron Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel design strategy to construct bright and narrow near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission materials with suppressed shoulder peaks can significantly enhance their performance in various applications. Herein, we have successfully synthesized a series of helically twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A conjugated systems bridged by boron atoms, achieving bright red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissions with notably narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) values of 35 nm (0.08 eV) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 80%. These compounds display redshifted emissions up to 753 nm in higher concentrations. Cis/trans configurational isomers of multi&#8208;boron&#8208;bridged molecule BN3 exhibit similar photophysical properties. The unique combination of boron&#8208;induced coordination&#8208;enhanced charge transfer (CE&#8208;CT) and the helically twisted conjugated framework is pivotal in achieving the redshifted, narrowband emission. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of BN2 and BN3&#8208;a reveals that the extension of boron&#8208;bridged D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A skeletons significantly increases the distortion of the skeleton. Systematic theoretical calculations show how the boron CE&#8208;CT mechanism, in conjunction with the helical twist, leads to the narrowing of emission bands while simultaneously red&#8208;shifting them into the NIR region. This work could open new avenues for the development of advanced materials with tailored optical properties, particularly in the challenging and highly sought&#8208;after NIR spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Carbazole&#8208;Tailored Luminescent Triarylmethyl Radical and its Stable Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel luminescent radicals, characterized by their unique doublet emission, endows a significant challenge. In this study, we reported the synthesis of a luminescent neutral radical, BCzAnM&#8208;R, tailored by two carbazolyl groups and an anthryl group to achieve a nonalternant structure. It exhibited near&#8208;infrared emission with a peak at 1020 nm in toluene. Interestingly, its corresponding cation, BCzAnM&#8208;C, was synthesized through an unconventional SnCl2&#8208;mediated reduction&#8208;aromatization&#8208;oxidation reaction in one&#8208;pot and gram&#8208;scale. The cation demonstrated remarkable stability for up to weeks in ambient conditions and facilitated the silica&#8208;gel chromatography isolation as an organic salt with SnCl3&#8208;&#160;as the counter ion. The carbazolyl groups effectively modulate molecular structures, photophysical properties, and stabilities. Notably, BCzAnM&#8208;R represents the first luminescent triarylmethyl radical with two carbazolyl groups directly attached to the central carbon.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Amplified Plasma Membrane Rupture by Membrane&#8208;Anchoring NIR&#8208;II Small Molecule Design for Improved Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunotherapy is a promising cancer treatment method for eradicating tumor cells by enhancing the immune response. However, there are several major obstacles to conventional phototherapy&#8208;mediated immune responses, including inadequate immunogenicity and immunosuppressive environment. Here, we present a novel photoimmunotherapy modality&#8212;the development of membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule inducing plasma membrane rupture (PMR) by NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;stimulation, thus evoking cell necrotic death and enhancing antitumor immunotherapy. Our top&#8208;performing membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule (CBT&#8208;3) exhibits temperature&#8208;tunable PMR efficiency, allowing rapid necrotic death in cancer cells at 50 &#956;M dose by using exogenous NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated mild photothermal effect (1064 nm, 0.6 W cm&#8722;2). Further evidence indicated that this gentle therapeutic approach activated inflammatory signaling pathways in cells, enhanced immunogenic cell death, and reshaped the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, ultimately promoting systemic antitumor immune responses in vivo. This study represents the first instance of utilizing NIR&#8208;II photo&#8208;amplified PMR effect based on membrane&#8208;anchoring small molecule, providing a novel avenue for advancing cancer photoimmunotherapy.</dc:description>

Herein, we develop a self&#8208;polycondensation flux synthesis strategy that can produce olefin&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) platforms with high crystallinity and porosity as the supports of Pd nanoparticles for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). A series of "two in one" monomers integrating aldehyde and methyl reactive groups are rationally designed to afford COFs with square&#8208;shaped pores and ultrahigh chemical stability (e.g., strong acid or alkali environments for &gt;1 month). Functionalizing Fluorine significantly boosts the hydrophobicity of fluoro&#8208;functionalized COFs, which can inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhance ENRR performances. The COFs loading Pd nanoparticles show high NH3 production yields up to 90.0 &#177; 2.6 &#956;g&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;mgcat.&#8722;1 and the faradaic efficiency of 44% at &#8722;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, the best comprehensive performance among all reported COFs. Meanwhile, the catalysts are easy to recover and recycle, as demonstrated by their use for 15 cycles and 17 hours, with good performance retention. This work not only provides a new synthesis strategy for olefin&#8208;linked COFs, but also paves a new avenue for the design of highly efficient ENRR catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogenations are fundamentally and industrially important reactions that are atom economical paths to synthesize value&#8208;added products from feedstock chemicals. The cooperative effects of two or more metal centers in multimetallic active sites is a successful strategy to activate small molecules and facilitate catalytic reactions, and this strategy has been recently applied to catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Furthermore, heterobimetallic complexes have been well&#8208;documented to provide novel reaction pathways and improved selectivity, compared to their homo&#8208;bimetallic and monometallic analogues. This minireview provides a historical perspective on the development of heterobimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates and describes recent developments in this burgeoning research area.</dc:description>

         <title>Modifications of Prenyl Side Chains in Natural Product Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in understanding the enzymatic machinery responsible for the modifications of prenyl side chains and elucidating their roles in natural product biosynthesis. This interest stems from the pivotal role such modifications play in shaping the structural and functional diversity of natural products, as well as from their potential applications to synthetic biology and drug discovery. In addition to contributing to the diversity and complexity of natural products, unique modifications of prenyl side chains are represented by several novel biosynthetic mechanisms. Representative unique examples of epoxidation, dehydrogenation, oxidation of methyl groups to carboxyl groups, unusual C&#8208;C bond cleavage and oxidative cyclization are summarized and discussed. By revealing the intriguing chemistry and enzymology behind these transformations, this comprehensive and comparative review will guide future efforts in the discovery, characterization and application of modifications of prenyl side chains in natural product biosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen Photocatalytic Generation by Silanized TiO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A commercial TiO2 sample, used as received or hydrothermally treated to increase surface hydroxylation, has been functionalized by surface modification with hexadecyltrimethoxysilane. The anchoring of the&#160;silane has been characterized by&#160;FTIR and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopies, and the grafting density was determined by thermogravimetric and N2 physisorption analyses. The silane moieties induce a partial decrease of the shielding of the valence electrons of the Ti ions at the surface, and a local modification of their crystal field, as demonstrated by XPS and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, respectively. The changes in coordination and the produced oxygen vacancies result in the formation of Ti3+ defects localized in the sub&#8208;surface region, as revealed by EPR spectroscopy. These paramagnetic centers are stabilized in the silanized samples, as the electron transfer to O2 is efficiently inhibited even under UV irradiation. However, the amount of Ti3+ centers appears to be correlated with the singlet oxygen (1O2) formation rate. Accordingly, epoxidation of limonene under UV light, chosen as a model photocatalytic reaction triggered by 1O2, occurred with higher selectivity when TiO2 was silanized and upon simultaneous NIR irradiation. These evidences suggest that in the silanized sample 1O2 may be generated through F&#246;rster&#8208;type energy transfer from excited sub&#8208;surface Ti3+ centers.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Hydrotrifluoromethylation of Unactivated Olefins Enabled by Voltage&#8208;Gated Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present the first successful hydrotrifluoromethylation of unactivated olefins under electrochemical conditions. Commercially available trifluoromethyl thianthrenium salt (TT+&#8208;CF3BF4&#8208;, Ep/2 = &#8211;0.85 V vs Fc/Fc+) undergoes electrochemical reduction to generate CF3 radicals which add to olefins with exclusive chemoselectivity. The resulting carbon centered radical undergoes a second cathodic reduction, instead of a classical HAT process, to generate a carbanion that can be terminated by protonation from solvent. The use of MgBr2 (+0.20 V onset oxidation potential) plays a key role as an enabling sacrificial reductant for the reaction to operate in an undivided cell. Guided by cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies, fine&#8208;tuning the solvent system, trifluoromethylating reagent&#8217;s counteranion and careful selection of redox processes, this work led to the development of a voltage&#8208;gated electrosynthesis by pairing two redox processes with a narrow potential difference (&#916;E &#8776; 1.00 V) allowing the reaction to proceed with two important advances: (a) high reactivity and selectivity towards hydrotrifluoromethylation over undesired dibromination, and (b) an unprecedented functional group tolerance, including aniline, phenols, unprotected alcohol, epoxide, trialkyl amine, and several redox sensitive heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>When Metal Complexes Evolve, and a Minor Species Is the Most Active: the Case of Bis(Phenanthroline)Copper in the Catalysis of Glutathione Oxidation and Hydroxyl Radical Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several copper&#8208;ligands, including 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (Phen), have been investigated for anticancer purposes based on their capacity to bind excess copper (Cu) in cancer tissues and form redox active complexes able to catalyse the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately leading to oxidative stress and cell death. Glutathione (GSH) is a critical compound as it is highly concentrated intracellularly and can reduce and dissociate copper(II) from the ligand forming poorly redox&#8208;active copper(I)&#8208;thiolate clusters. Here we report that Cu&#8208;Phen2 &#160;speciation evolves in physiologically relevant GSH concentrations. Experimental and computational experiments suggest that at pH 7.4 mostly copper(I)&#8208;GSH clusters are formed, but a minor species of copper(I) bound to one Phen and forming ternary complexes with GSH (GS&#8208;Cu&#8208;Phen) is the redox active species, oxidizing quite efficiently GSH to GSSG and forming HO&#8226; radicals. This minor active species becomes more populated at lower pH, such as typical lysosomal pH 5, resulting in faster GSH oxidation and HO&#8226; production. Consistently, cell culture studies showed lower toxicity of Cu&#8208;Phen2 upon inhibition of lysosomal acidification. Overall, this study underscores that sub&#8208;cellular localisation can considerably influence the speciation of Cu&#8208;based drugs and that minor species can be the most redox&#8208; and biologically&#8208; active.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 Over 800 Hours</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology for green hydrogen production. Although the normal current densities of AEMWEs are below 3 A&#183;cm&#8208;2, operating them at higher current densities represents an efficient, but little&#8208;explored approach to decrease the total cost of hydrogen production. We show here that a benchmark AEMWE has an operational lifetime of only seconds at an ultrahigh current density of 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2. By using a more conductive and robust AEM, and judicious choices of ionomers, catalyst, and porous transport layer, we have developed AEMWEs that stably operate at 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2 with extended lifetimes. The optimized AEMWE has an operational lifetime of more than 800 hours, a 5&#8208;order magnetite improvement over the current benchmark. The cell voltage is only 2.3 V at 10 A&#183;cm&#8208;2, comparable to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices operating at current densities lower than 3 A&#183;cm&#8208;2.

The cell voltage is only 2.3 V at 10 A&#183;cm-2, comparable to those of the state-of-the-art devices operating at current densities lower than 3 A&#183;cm-2. This work demonstrates the potential of ultrahigh current density AEMWEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Electron&#8208;Density Distribution of UCl4&#160;and Its Topology from X&#8208;ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of $5f$ electrons in actinide complexes and materials is still poorly understood and represents a serious challenge and opportunity for experiment and theory. The study of the electron density distribution of the ground state of such systems through X&#8208;ray diffraction represents a unique opportunity to quantitatively investigate different chemical bonding interactions at once, but was considered ``almost impossible'' on heavy&#8208;atom systems, until very recently. Here, we present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the electron density distribution in UCl$_4$ crystals and comparison with the previously reported spin density distribution from polarized neutron diffraction. All approaches provide a consistent picture in terms of electron and spin density distribution, and chemical bond characterization. More importantly, the synergy between experiments and quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations allows to highlight the remarkable&#160;sensitivity of X&#8208;ray diffraction to $5f$ electrons in materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Evidence of a Stable RNA G&#8208;triplex Structure at Physiological Temperature in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Genome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RG1 is a quadruplex&#8208;forming sequence in the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome proposed as possible therapeutic target for COVID&#8208;19. We demonstrate that the dominant conformation of RG1 under physiological conditions differs from the parallel quadruplex previously assumed. Through comprehensive investigations employing CD, UV, NMR, DSC, gel electrophoresis, MD simulations, in silico spectroscopy and the use of truncated RG1 sequences, we have identified this stable conformation as an RNA G&#8208;triplex composed of two G&#8208;triads. We believe this previously unreported RNA structure could serve as a novel therapeutic target. Our findings open new avenues for further studies on the presence and biological role of RNA G&#8208;triplexes in vivo.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonds involving the oxygen atoms of intermediates that result from copper&#8208;mediated O2 activation play a key role for controlling the reactivity of Cux/O2 active sites in metalloenzymes and synthetic model complexes. However, structural insight into H&#8208;bonding in such transient species as well as thermodynamic information about proton transfer to or from the O2&#8208;derived ligands is scarce. Here we present a detailed study of the reversible interconversion of a &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxodicopper(II) complex ([1]+) and its &#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo congener ([2]+) via (de)protonation, including the isolation and structural characterization of several H&#8208;bond donor (HBD) adducts of [1]+ and the determination of binding constants. For one of these adducts a temperature&#8208;dependent &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo/&#956;1,1&#8208;hydroperoxo equilibrium associated with reversible H+&#8208;translocation is observed, its thermodynamics investigated experimentally and computationally, and effects of H&#8208;bonding on spectroscopic parameters of the CuII2(&#956;1,2&#8208;O2) species are revealed. DFT calculations allowed to fully map and correlate the trajectories of H+&#8208;transfer and &#956;1,2&#8208;peroxo&#8594;&#956;1,1&#8208;peroxo rearrangement.

         <title>A Highly Conjugated Nickel(II)&#8208;Acetylide Framework for Efficient Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of transition&#8208;metal single atoms as molecular functional entities into the skeleton of graphdiyne (GDY) to construct novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;acetylide frameworks, known as metalated graphynes (MGYs), is a promising strategy for developing efficient catalysts, which can combine the tunable charge transfer of GDY frameworks, the catalytic activity of metal and the precise distribution of single metallic centers. Herein, four highly conjugated MGY photocatalysts based on NiII, PdII, PtII, and HgII were synthesized for the first time using the &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; strategy through the use of M&#8211;C bonds (&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;M&#8211;C&#8801;C&#8211;).

         <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CeO2 catalysts crystal facets (100), (110) and (111) with monatomic Pt and Au clusters drive H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction. Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH4 selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. This study offers new insights into tuning active sites for regulating product selectivity.







Abstract
Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

Product selectivity was regulated by varying the spatial distances between dual active sites. The (100) facet showed 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO, while the (110) and (111) facets showed CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product selectivity of solar-driven CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100&#8201;%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is 33.5&#8201;% and 97.6&#8201;%, respectively. Notably, the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4&#8197;&#956;mol/g/h, and the solar-to-chemical energy efficiency of 0.23&#8201;% is 33.8 times higher than that under non-concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high-density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a high&#8208;precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV&#8208;1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV&#8208;1.







Abstract
The sulfane sulfur pool, comprised of persulfide (RS&#8208;SH) and polysulfide (RS&#8208;SnH) derived from hydrogen sulfide (H2S), has emerged as a major player in redox biochemistry. Mitochondria, besides energy generation, serve as significant cellular redox hubs, mediate stress response and cellular health. However, the effects of endogenous mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) remain largely uncharacterized as compared with their cytosolic counterparts, cytosolic sulfane sulfur (CSS). To investigate this, we designed a novel artificial substrate for mitochondrial 3&#8208;mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3&#8208;MST), a key enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Using cells expressing a mitochondrion&#8208;localized persulfide biosensor, we demonstrate this tool's ability to selectively enhance MSS. While H2S was previously known to suppress human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1), we found that MSS profoundly affected the HIV&#8208;1 life cycle, mediating viral reactivation from latency. Additionally, we provide evidence for the role of the host's mitochondrial redox state, membrane potential, apoptosis, and respiration rates in managing HIV&#8208;1 latency and reactivation. Together, dynamic fluctuations in the MSS pool have a significant and possibly conflicting effect on HIV&#8208;1 viral latency. The precision tools developed herein allow for orthogonal generation of persulfide within both mitochondria and the cytosol and will be useful in interrogating disease biology.

&lt;p&gt;We report a high-precision biorthogonal tool for the enhancement of mitochondrial sulfane sulfur (MSS) that leverages the activity and localization of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), an enzyme involved in MSS biosynthesis. Cells exposed to the newly developed MSS generator reactivate HIV-1 from latency in a cellular model of HIV-1.

         <title>Front Cover: Organocatalyzed Carbonylation of Alkyl Halides Driven by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonylation reactions introduce a carbonyl group (C=O) into a molecule to produce key chemicals including carboxylic acids, esters, and amides that are abundant in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and plastics. In their Research Article (e202410928), Robert S. Paton, Garret M. Miyake et al. developed a photocatalytic carbonylation strategy, which enables the conversion of alkyl halides to esters or amides under metal&#8208;free conditions. Additionally, this strategy allows for complete incorporation of the 13C isotope.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Bridging Mechanism for Bimetallic Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;site bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction. The crucial role of hybrid dual sites is determined and assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water. A record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at 18&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for oxygen evolution and a low voltage for overall water splitting was achieved on these heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8722;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8722;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in situ formed Fe&#8722;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4&#8197;mV at current density of 18.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8722;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.

         <dc:description>
In aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, additive molecules with high permanent dipole moment can effectively substitute the coordination of H2O with charge carriers through relatively strong ion&#8211;dipole interactions, resulting in a water&#8208;lean environment of solvated Zn2+. Lone&#8208;pair electrons of oxygen and fluorinated features of the additive molecules also reinforce the interfacial affinity of metallic zinc, associated with the exclusion of neighboring water to facilitate reversible zinc planarized deposition. Details of this research are reported by Jianwei Li, Guoliang Chai et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407439).

         <title>Size&#8208;Increased All&#8208;Phenylene Molecular Spoked Wheels &#8211; A Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular spoked wheels containing fluorene spokes were successfully prepared and characterized by various methods, including scanning tunneling microscopy. Their synthetic accessibility was correlated with quantum chemical calculations using geometric and energetic criteria, the former extracted from the theoretically proposed mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling, the latter from experimental cyclophane synthesis.







Abstract
A lateral expansion of molecular spoked wheels (MSWs) based on an all&#8208;phenylene backbone is described. The MSWs contain a central hub, six spokes, and a rim that is formed by a sixfold Yamamoto coupling of the respective non&#8208;cyclized dodecabromo precursor yielding MSWs with up to 30 phenylene rings in the perimeter. Attempts to prepare compounds of such size without flexible side groups at the spokes were unsuccessful, most probably due to an aggregation and accompanying oligomerization of the precursors during the cyclization. To overcome these problems, fluorene units are inserted into the spokes. These contain additional alkyl chains and lead to a curvature of the wheels. Quantum chemical calculations on the mechanism of the Yamamoto coupling lead to geometry and strain&#8208;related criteria for the successful rim closure to the respective MSW. Subsequently, MSWs are prepared with four and even six phenylene units at each edge of the hexagonal wheels. The resulting MSWs are characterized by spectroscopic methods, and additionally some of them are visualized via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

         <title>A Direct Route to closo&#8208;SBnCln Thiaboranes from Simple Electron&#8208;Precise Synthons: The Different Role of Chalcogen Bonding in SB5Cl5 and SB11Cl11 Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur has been inserted into polyhedral closo&#8208;boranes of various sizes by co&#8208;pyrolyzing the simple electron&#8208;precise synthons S2Cl2 and B2Cl4 at 280&#8201;&#176;C, closo&#8208;SB5Cl5, closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 and closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 having been the main products of such thermodynamically driven reaction. MS spectra and computations evidenced the recurrent formation of further closo&#8208;SBnCln , with n=4, 6, 10, and also with 12 designed for the supra&#8208;icosahedral architecture.







Abstract
Six&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB5Cl5 (1) and ten&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;1&#8208;SB9Cl9 (2) thiaboranes have been prepared, besides the already known 12&#8208;vertex closo&#8208;SB11Cl11 (3), from the co&#8208;pyrolysis reaction of B2Cl4 with S2Cl2 at 280&#8201;&#176;C in vacuo.

They were further characterized by one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional 11B NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray structure determination for 1 and 3. Ab initio/GIAO/NMR computations support octahedral, bicapped square&#8208;antiprismatic, and icosahedral geometries for 1, 2 and 3, respectively, as expected based on their closo&#8208;electron counts. 1 is the first isolated example of a neutral polyhedral closo&#8208;thiaborane with a cluster size smaller than ten vertices. The solid&#8208;state structure of 3 is one of the rare examples of a single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure determination of an icosahedral heteroborane reported. The corresponding crystal&#8208;packing forces show the different role of chalcogen bonding in these octahedral and icosahedral crystals.

         <dc:description>
We explored the Polymer&#8208;Derived Ceramic route to design and synthesize a transition metal&#8208;free sodium&#8208;doped amorphous SiBN ceramic, for small molecule activation and catalysis. The distribution of molecular Na+ and B sites in amorphous silicon nitride amplified B and N site reactivity, forming a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif upon H2 exposure. This FLP&#8208;inspired approach promises advances in main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Interest is growing in transition metal&#8208;free compounds for small molecule activation and catalysis. We discuss the opportunities arising from synthesizing sodium&#8208;doped amorphous silicon&#8208;boron&#8208;nitride (Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN). Na+ cations and 3&#8208;fold coordinated BIII moieties were incorporated into an amorphous silicon nitride network via chemical modification of a polysilazane followed by pyrolysis in ammonia (NH3) at 1000&#8201;&#176;C. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms of hydrogen (H2) activation within Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN structure. This material design approach allows the homogeneous distribution of Na+ and BIII moieties surrounded by SiN4 units contributing to the transformation of the BIII moieties into 4&#8208;fold coordinated geometry upon encountering H2, potentially serving as frustrated Lewis acid (FLA) sites. Exposure to H2 induced formation of frustrated Lewis base (FLB) N&#8722;= sites with Na+ as a charge&#8208;compensating cation, resulting in the in situ formation of a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) motif (&#8801;BFLA&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#948;+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;:N&#8722;(Na+)=). Reversible H2 adsorption&#8208;desorption behavior with high activation energy for H2 desorption (124&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) suggested the H2 chemisorption on Na&#8208;doped a&#8208;SiBN. These findings highlight a future landscape full of possibilities within our reach, where we anticipate main&#8208;group&#8208;mediated small molecule activation will have an important impact on the design of more efficient catalytic processes and the discovery of new catalytic transformations.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Inspired Multicomponent Electrical Double Layer Structure Design for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by high&#8208;entropy concept, an multicomponent (MC) electrical double layer (EDL) structure is constructed by the addition of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions into electrolytes. Benefitting from the synergistic effect between these additives, the Zn|Cu half cell achieves a high average CE of 99.5&#8201;% with a high Zn utilization of 51.3&#8201;% and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibits a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.







Abstract
Regulating the electrical double layer (EDL) structure can enhance the cycling stability of Zn metal anodes, however, the effectiveness of this strategy is significantly limited by individual additives. Inspired by the high&#8208;entropy (HE) concept, we developed a multicomponent (MC) EDL structure composed of La3+, Cl&#8722;, and BBI anions by adding dibenzenesulfonimide (BBI) and LaCl3 additives into ZnSO4 electrolytes (BBI/LaCl3/ZnSO4). Specifically, La3+ ions accumulate within EDL to shield the net charges on the Zn surface, allowing more BBI anions and Cl&#8722; ions to enter this region. Consequently, this unique MC EDL enables Zn anodes to simultaneously achieve uniform electric field, robust SEI layer, and balanced reaction kinetics. Moreover, the synergistic parameter &#8211; a novel descriptor for quantifying collaborative improvement &#8211; was first proposed to demonstrates the synergistic effect between BBI and LaCl3 additives. Benefitting from these advantages, Zn metal anodes achieved a high reversibility of 99.5&#8201;% at a depth of discharge (DoD) of 51.3&#8201;%, and Zn|MnO2 pouch cells exhibited a stable cycle life of 100&#8197;cycles at a low N/P ratio of 2.9.

Small Fish, big moves: In their Research Article (e202411438), Michael Decker et&#8197;al. showcased small molecules targeting the allosteric site of the M1 receptor, which can be activated (or inactivated) by light and in turn enhance natural signalling at this receptor. Such a compound therefore was able to enhance locomotion in zebrafish larvae mediated by the M1, which also plays an important role in human cognition and memory.

         <title>Back Cover: Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophane incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) is reported by Gang He et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202410525).

         <title>Novel Dissymmetric Formal Quinoidal Molecules End&#8208;Capped by Dicyanomethylene and Triphenylphosphonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel dissymmetric quinoidal molecules end&#8208;capped by dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium were reported and their formation mechanism was proposed. The respective zwitterionic forms make contributions to their ground state structures. Of particular note is the observation that their emissions can be switched on by increasing the solution viscosity, by dispersing them in polymer matrix, or upon binding with certain proteins.







Abstract
A number of quinoidal molecules with symmetric end&#8208;capping groups, particularly dicyanomethylene units, have been synthesized for organic optoelectronic materials. In comparison, dissymmetric quinoidal molecules, characterized by end&#8208;capping with different groups, are less explored. In this paper, we present the unexpected formation of new formal quinoidal molecules, which are end&#8208;capped with both dicyanomethylene and triphenylphosphonium moieties. The structures of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules were firmly verified by single crystal structural analyses. On the basis of the control experiments and DFT calculations, we proposed the reaction mechanism for the formation of these dissymmetric quinoidal molecules. The respective zwitterionic forms should make contributions to the ground state structures of these quinoidal molecules based on the analysis of their bond lengths and aromaticity and Mayer Bond Orbital (MBO) calculation. This agrees well with the fact that negative solvatochromism was observed for these quinoidal molecules. Although these new quinoidal molecules are non&#8208;emissive both in solutions and crystalline states, they become emissive with quantum yields up to 51.4&#8201;% after elevating the solvent viscosity or dispersing them in a PMMA matrix. Interestingly, their emissions can also be switched on upon binding with certain proteins, in particular with human serum albumin.

Copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks with unstable Cu coordination centers are electrochemically reduced to highly dispersed Cu subnanoclusters supported on the remaining MOF structure. The synergistic effect of the Cu subnanoclusters promotes *CO&#8211;*CO coupling to generate *CH2CHO species, leading to an excellent electrocatalytic CO2&#8722;to&#8722;EtOH performance, as reported by Jin Huang et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409270).

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Propelled Oscillatory Motion of Perylenediimides on Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale autonomous oscillatory motion was achieved upon the reduction of a perylenediimide disk at the solid&#8208;water interface. This redox&#8208;activated, self&#8208;propelled system can be modulated through variations in chemical structure and molecular alignment, offering a unique avenue for the construction of molecularly designed active matter.







Abstract
The emergence of macroscopic self&#8208;propelled oscillatory motion based on molecular design has attracted continual attention in relation to autonomous systems in living organisms. Herein, a series of perylenediimides (PDIs) with various imide side chains was prepared to explore the impact of molecular design and alignment on the self&#8208;propelled motion at the air&#8208;water interface. When placed on an aqueous solution containing a reductant, a solid disk of neutral PDI was reduced to form the water&#8208;soluble, surface&#8208;active PDI dianion species, which induces a surface tension gradient in the vicinity of the disk for self&#8208;propelled motion. We found that centimeter&#8208;scale oscillatory motion could be elicited by controlling the supply rate of PDI dianion species through the reductant concentration and the structure of the imide side chains. Furthermore, we found that the onset and speed of the self&#8208;propelled motion could be changed by the crystallinity of PDI at the water surface. This design principle using &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and their self&#8208;assemblies could advance self&#8208;propelled, non&#8208;equilibrium systems powered by chemical energy.

         <title>Cationic Foldamer&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Cages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented organocatalytic asymmetric entry to a range of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer catalysis was developed. The utilization of this protocol enables the remote desymmetric functionalization of prochiral cages with high levels of enantioselectivities. Notably, diverse late&#8208;stage molecular editing of chiral prism&#8208;like cages was primed for an array of high&#8208;value chiral compounds.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of shape&#8208;persistent molecular cages, particularly those resembling prisms, exerts significant influence on their application&#8208;specific functionalities. Although methods exist for fabricating inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages, strategies for catalytic asymmetric synthesis of these structures in a diversity&#8208;oriented fashion remain unexplored. Herein, we introduce an unprecedented organocatalytic desymmetrization approach for the generation of inherently chiral prism&#8208;like cages via phosphonium&#8208;containing foldamer&#8208;catalyzed SNAr reactions. This methodology establishes a topological connection, enabling the facile assembly of a wide range of versatile stereogenic&#8208;at&#8208;cage building blocks possessing two highly modifiable groups. Furthermore, subsequent stereospecific transformations of the remaining chlorides and/or ethers afford convenient access to numerous functionally relevant chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage molecules.

         <title>Biocatalytic Ether Lipid Synthesis by an Archaeal Glycerolprenylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrastable geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Remarkably, it does so through carbocation&#8208;type chemistry in a fully solvent&#8208;exposed active site.







Abstract
Although ethers are common in secondary natural products, they are an underrepresented functional group in primary metabolism. As such, there are comparably few enzymes capable of constructing ether bonds in a general fashion. However, such enzymes are highly sought after for synthetic applications as they typically operate with higher regioselectivity and under milder conditions than traditional organochemical approaches. To expand the repertoire of well characterized ether synthases, we herein report on a promiscuous archaeal prenyltransferase from the scarcely researched family of geranylgeranylglyceryl phosphate synthases (GGGPSs or G3PSs). We show that the ultrastable Archaeoglobus fulgidus G3PS makes various (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;configured prenyl glycerol ethers from the corresponding pyrophosphates while exerting perfect control over the configuration at the glycerol unit. Based on experimental and computational data, we propose a mechanism for this enzyme which involves an intermediary prenyl carbocation equivalent. As such, this study provides the fundamental understanding and methods to introduce G3PSs into the biocatalytic alkylation toolbox.

         <title>Chemiexcitation Acceleration of 1,2&#8208;Dioxetanes by Spiro&#8208;Fused Six&#8208;Member Rings with Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetanes bearing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with different electron&#8208;withdrawing motifs were shown to have an accelerated chemiexcitation and increased stability compared to previously reported 1,2&#8208;dioxetanes. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe containing a six&#8208;member sulfone unit exhibited increased detection sensitivity toward &#946;&#8208;galactosidase expressing bacteria in growth medium.







Abstract
The chemiluminescent light&#8208;emission pathway of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane luminophores attracts growing interest within the scientific community. Dioxetane probes undergoing rapid flash&#8208;type chemiexcitation exhibit higher detection sensitivity than those with a slow glow&#8208;type chemiexcitation rate. We discovered that dioxetanes fused to non&#8208;strained six&#8208;member rings, with hetero atoms or inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, present both accelerated chemiexcitation rates and elevated chemical stability compared to dioxetanes fused to four&#8208;member strained rings. DFT computational simulations supported the chemiexcitation acceleration observed by spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member rings with inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing groups of dioxetanes. Specifically, a spiro&#8208;dioxetane with a six&#8208;member sulfone ring exhibited a chemiexcitation rate 293&#8208;fold faster than that of spiro&#8208;adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane. A turn&#8208;ON dioxetane probe for the detection of the enzyme &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, containing the six&#8208;member sulfone unit, exhibited a S/N value of 108 in LB cell growth medium. This probe demonstrated a substantial increase in detection sensitivity towards E. coli bacterial cells expressing &#946;&#8208;galactosidase, with an LOD value that is 44&#8208;fold more sensitive than that obtained by the adamantyl counterpart. The accelerated chemiexcitation and the elevated chemical stability presented by dioxetane containing a spiro&#8208;fused six&#8208;member ring with a sulfone inductive electron&#8208;withdrawing group, make it an ideal candidate for designing efficient turn&#8208;on chemiluminescent probes with exceptionally high detection sensitivity.

         <title>Simultaneous In Vivo Imaging of Neutrophil Elastase and Oxidative Stress in Atherosclerotic Plaques Using a Unimolecular Photoacoustic Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our innovative unimolecular multiple&#8208;activatable photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) ingeniously integrates specific recognition sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH into a single molecular platform, thereby enabling the simultaneous monitoring of NE activity and oxidative stress with minimal cross&#8208;reactivity, by modulating the photoinduced electron transfer and conjugation effect, respectively.







Abstract
Atherosclerosis, a major global health concern with high morbidity and mortality rates, involves complex interactions of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic enzymes. Conventional imaging methods struggle to capture the dynamic biochemical processes in atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we introduce a novel unimolecular photoacoustic probe (UMAPP) designed with specific binding sites for neutrophil elastase (NE) and the redox pair O2&#8901;&#8722;/GSH, enabling real&#8208;time monitoring of oxidative stress and activated neutrophils in plaques. UMAPP, comprising a boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) core linked to a hydrophilic NE&#8208;cleavable tetrapeptide and dual oxidative stress&#8208;responsive catechol moieties, facilitates NE&#8208;mediated modulation of photoinduced electron transfer impacting photoacoustic intensity at 685&#8197;nm (PA685). Furthermore, oxidation and reduction of catechol groups by O2&#8901;&#8722; and GSH induce reversible, ratiometric changes in the photoacoustic spectrum (PA745/PA685 ratio). Initial UMAPP applications successfully distinguished atherosclerotic and healthy mice, evaluated pneumonia&#8216;s effect on plaque composition and verified the probe&#8216;s effectiveness in drug&#8208;treatment studies by detecting molecular alterations before visible histopathological changes. The integrated molecular imaging capabilities of UMAPP offer promising advancements in atherosclerosis diagnosis and management, enabling early and accurate identification of vulnerable plaques.

         <title>Supramolecular Anchoring of Fe(III) Molecular Redox Catalysts into Graphitic Surfaces Via CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile model has been developed for supramolecular anchoring including CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, between iron porphyrin catalysts and graphitic surfaces, enabling a high&#8208;performance molecular electrode for aqueous CO2 electroreduction.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical devices require solid anodes and cathodes for the easy assembling of the whole cell and thus redox catalysts need to be deposited on the electrodes. Typical catalyst deposition involves drop casting, spin coating, doctor blading or related techniques to generate modified electrodes where the active catalyst in contact with the electrolyte is only a very small fraction of the deposited mass. We have developed a methodology where the redox catalyst is deposited at the electrode based on supramolecular interactions, namely CH&#8208;&#960; and &#960;&#8211;&#960; between the catalyst and the surface. This generates a very well&#8208;defined catalysts&#8208;surface structure and electroactivity, together with a very large catalytic response. This approach represents a new anchoring strategy that can be applied to catalytic redox reactions in heterogeneous phase and compared to traditional methods involves about 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude less mass deposition to achieve comparable activity and with very well&#8208;behaved electroactivity and stability.

         <title>Spatial Engineering of Heterotypic Antigens on a DNA Framework for the Preparation of Mosaic Nanoparticle Vaccines with Enhanced Immune Activation against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens (hetero&#8208;POINT) has been developed to rationalize the design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. Immunological investigations reveal that the pattern of heterotypic antigen distribution yields distinct humoral and mucosal immune effects, highlighting the significance of the spatial placement of the antigens in structure&#8211;activity relationships.







Abstract
Mosaic nanoparticle vaccines with heterotypic antigens exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antiviral capabilities, but the impact of antigen proportions and distribution patterns on vaccine&#8208;induced immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a DNA nanotechnology&#8208;based strategy for spatially assembling heterotypic antigens to guide the rational design of mosaic nanoparticle vaccines. By utilizing two aptamers with orthogonal selectivity for the original SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike trimer and Omicron receptor&#8208;binding domain (RBD), along with a DNA soccer&#8208;ball framework, we precisely manipulate the spacing, stoichiometry, and overall distribution of heterotypic antigens to create mosaic nanoparticles with average, bipolar, and unipolar antigen distributions. Systematic in vitro and in vivo immunological investigations demonstrate that 30 heterotypic antigens in equivalent proportions, with an average distribution, lead to higher production of broad&#8208;spectrum neutralizing antibodies compared to the bipolar and unipolar distributions. Furthermore, the precise assembly utilizing our developed methodology reveals that a mere increment of five Omicron RBD antigens on a nanoparticle (from 15 to 20) not only diminishes neutralization against the Omicron variant but also triggers excessive inflammation. This work provides a unique perspective on the rational design of mosaic vaccines by highlighting the significance of the spatial placement and proportion of heterotypic antigens in their structure&#8211;activity mechanisms.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion-rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy-saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high-entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrS&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra-low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; sites and the constructed &#8220;soft-acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard-acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical-chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value-added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Customizing H2O&#8208;Poor Electric Double Layer and Boosting Texture Exposure of Zn (101) Plane towards Super&#8208;High Areal Capacity Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catastrophic dendrite hyperplasia and parasitic reactions severely impede the future deployment of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Controlling zinc orientation growth is considered to be an effective method to overcome the aforementioned concerns, especially for regulating the (002) plane of deposited Zn. Unfortunately, Zn (002) texture is difficult to obtain stable cycling under high deposition capacity resulting from its large lattice distortion and nonuniform distribution in electric field. Herein, different from traditional cognition, a crystallization orientation regulation tactic is proposed to boost Zn (101) texture exposure and inhibit zinc dendrite proliferation during plating/stripping. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate the malate molecules preferentially adsorb on the Zn (002) facet, leading to the texture exposure of distinctive Zn (101) plane. Meanwhile, the &#8211;COOH and &#8211;OH groups of malate molecules exhibit strong adsorption on the Zn anode surface and chelate with Zn2+, achieving&#160;H2O&#8208;poor&#160;electrical double layer. Very impressively, the multifunctional malate additive enlists zinc anode to survive for 600 h under a harsh condition of 15 mAh cm&#8722;2/15 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the symmetric cell harvests highly&#8208;reversible cycling life of 6600 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2/1.25 mAh cm&#8722;2, remarkably outperforming the ZnSO4 electrolyte. The assembled Zn//MnO2 full cells also demonstrate prominent electrochemical reversibility.</dc:description>

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Restocking Strategy for the Direct Reuse of Degraded LiFePO4 Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable development of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries calls for efficient recycling technologies for spent LFP (SLFP). Even for the advanced direct material regeneration (DMR) method, multiple steps including separation, regeneration, and electrode refabrication processes are still needed. To circumvent these intricacies, new regeneration methods that allow direct electrode reuse (DER) by rejuvenating SLFP electrodes without damaging its structure are desired. Here, a 0.1 M lithium triethyl borohydride/tetrahydrofuran solution, which has the proper reductive capability to reduce Fe3+ in SLFP to Fe2+ without alloying with the aluminum current collector, is selected as the lithiation/regeneration reagent to restock the Li loss and regenerate SLFP electrodes. By soaking the SLFP electrodes in the lithiation solution, we successfully rejuvenated the crystal structure and electrochemical activity of SLFP electrodes with structural integrity within only 6 minutes at room temperature. When being directly reused, the regenerated LFP electrodes deliver a high specific capacity of 162.6 mAh g&#8208;1 even after being exposed to air for 3 months. The DER strategy presents significant economic and environmental benefits compared with the DMR method. This research provides a timely and innovative solution for recycling spent blade batteries using large&#8208;sized LFP electrodes, boosting the closed&#8208;loop development of LFP batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ryanodane Diterpenoids Garajonone and 3&#8208;epi&#8208;Garajonone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ryanodane diterpenes are structurally complex natural products that are well&#8208;known for their high degree of oxidation and the challenges associated with synthesizing them within the terpene class. Herein, we present a two&#8208;stage synthetic strategy that draws inspiration from the broad biosynthesis of terpenes, allowing us to successfully achieve the first chemical synthesis of garajonone, a ryanodane diterpenoid that occurs naturally at low abundance, as well as its epimer, 3&#8208;epi&#8208;garajonone. The key to this success lies in the rapid construction of the carbon framework of target molecule by employing an early&#8208;stage palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck/carbonylative esterification cascade annulation, followed by successive late&#8208;stage selective redox manipulation to establish the desired oxidation state of the molecule. This research not only showcases the synthesis of garajonone and its epimer but also provides a platform for the chemical synthesis of other members and analogs within this complex diterpenoid family.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Pillared Interlayer Design for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is a promising way to attain higher energy density at lower cost beyond the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion battery technology. However, the major issues blocking their practical application are the sluggish kinetics and parasitic shuttling reactions for sulfur and polysulfides. Here, pillaring multilayer graphene with the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) demonstrates the substantial impact of a versatile interlayer design in tackling those issues. Unlike regular composite separators reported so far, the participation of tri&#8208;metallic Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn MOF (NCM&#8208;MOF) as pillars supports the construction of an ion&#8208;channel interconnected interlayer structure, unexpectedly balancing the interfacial concentration polarization, spatially confining the soluble polysulfides and vastly affording lithiophilic sites for highly efficient polysulfide sieving/conversion. As a demonstration, we show that the MOF&#8208;pillared interlayer structure enables outstanding capacity (1634 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1C) and longevity (average capacity decay of 0.034% per cycle in 2000 cycles) of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Besides, the multilayer separator can be readily integrated into the high&#8208;nickel cathode (LiNi0.91Mn0.03Co0.06O2)&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which efficiently suppresses the undesired phase evolution upon cycling. These findings suggest the potential of &#8220;gap&#8208;filling&#8221; materials in fabricating multi&#8208;functional separators, bring forward the pillared interlayer structure for energy&#8208;storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silver&#8211;Isocyanide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied due to their versatile applications and easily tunable structures. However, heteroatom&#8208;metal coordination dominates the MOFs community, and the rational synthesis of carbon&#8211;metal coordination&#8208;based MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MOFs based on silver&#8211;carbon linkages are synthesized through the coordination between silver(I) salt and isocyanide&#8208;based monomers at ambient condition. The as&#8208;synthesized 2D MOFs possess well&#8208;defined crystalline structures and a staggered AB stacking mode. Most interestingly, these 2D MOFs, without &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between layers, exhibit narrow bandgaps down to 1.42 eV. As electrochemical catalysts for converting CO2 to CO, such 2D MOFs demonstrate Faradaic efficiency over 92%. Surprisingly, the CO2 reduction catalyzed by these MOFs indicates favorable adsorption of CO2 and *COOH on the active carbon sites of the isocyanide groups rather than on silver sites. This is attributed to the critical &#963; donor role of isocyanides and the corresponding ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8211;transfer effect. This work not only paves the way toward a new family of MOFs based on metal&#8211;isocyanide coordination but also offers a rare platform for understanding the electrocatalysis processes on strongly polarized carbon species.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Electron Channels Enable Contact Prelithiation of Li&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes with Ultrahigh Li&#8208;Source Utilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Contact prelithiation is widely used for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the low Li&#8208;source utilization suffering from the deteriorated contact interfaces results in cycling degeneration. Herein, Li&#8722;Ag alloy&#8208;based artificial electron channels (AECs) are established in Li source/graphite anode contact interfaces to promote Li&#8208;source conversion. Due to the shielding effect of the Li&#8722;Ag alloy (50 at. % Li) on Li&#8208;ion diffusion, the dry&#8208;state corrosion of contact interfaces is restricted. The unblocked electronic conduction across the AEC&#8208;involved interface not only facilitates the Li source conversion but also accelerates the prelithiation kinetics during the wet&#8208;state process, resulting in an ultrahigh Li&#8208;source utilization (90.7%). Thereby, implementing AEC&#8208;assisted prelithiation in a LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 pouch cell yields a 35.8% increase in energy density and stable cycling over 600 cycles. This finding affords significant insights into the construction of an efficient prelithiation technology toward the development of high&#8208;energy LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Cu11Ag3 Nanotips for Ultrahigh Yield Rate of Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (NRA) offers a sustainable approach for NH3 production and NO3&#8208; removal but suffers from low NH3 yield rate (&lt;1.20 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2). We present bimetallic Cu11Ag3 nanotips with tailored local environment and tip&#8208;enhanced effects, which achieve an ultrahigh NH3 yield rate of 2.36 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 at a low applied potential of &#8208;0.33 V vs. RHE, a high Faradic efficiency (FE) of 98.8%, and long&#8208;term operation stability at 1800 mg&#8208;N L&#8208;1 NO3&#8208;, outperforming most of the recently reported catalysts. At a NO3&#8208; concentration as low as 15 mg&#8208;N L&#8208;1, it still delivers a high FE of 86.9% and an NH3 selectivity of 93.8%. Operando ATR&#8208;FTIR spectra, finite&#8208;element method, and DFT calculations reveal that the Cu11Ag3 exhibits reduced adsorption energy barrier of *N intermediates, favorable water dissociation for *H generation and high energy barrier for H2 formation, while its tip&#8208;enhanced enrichment promoting NO3&#8208; accumulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving the Lithography Sensitivity of Atomically Precise Tin&#8208;Oxo Nanoclusters via Heterometal Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tin&#8208;oxo clusters are increasingly recognized as promising materials for nanolithography technology due to their unique properties, yet their structural impacts on lithography performance remain underexplored. This work explores the structural impacts of heterometal strategies on the performance of tin&#8208;oxo clusters in nanolithography, focusing on various metal dopants and their coordination geometries. Specifically, SnOC&#8208;1(In), SnOC&#8208;1(Al), SnOC&#8208;1(Fe), and SnOC&#8208;2 were synthesized and characterized. These clusters demonstrate excellent solubility, dispersibility, and stability, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;quality films via spin&#8208;coating for lithographic applications. Notably, this work innovatively employs nano&#8208;infrared (nano&#8208;IR), neutron reflectivity (NR), and X&#8208;ray reflectivity (XRR) measurements to confirm film homogeneity. Upon electron beam lithography (EBL), all four materials achieve 50 nm line patterns, with SnOC&#8208;1(In) demonstrating the highest lithography sensitivity. This enhanced sensitivity is attributed to indium dopants, which possess superior EUV absorption capabilities and unsaturated coordination environments. Further studies on exposure mechanisms indicated that Sn&#8211;C bond cleavage generates butyl free radicals, promoting network formations that induce solubility&#8208;switching behaviors for lithography. These findings underscore the efficacy of tailored structural design and modulation of cluster materials through heterometal strategies in enhancing lithography performance, offering valuable insights for future material design and applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulky Phosphazenium Salt Controlling Chemoselective Terpolymerization of Epoxide, Anhydride and CO2: From Well&#8208;Defined Block to Truly Random Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copolymers with precise compositions and controlled sequences are great appealing for high&#8208;performance polymeric materials, but their synthesis is very challenging. In this study, tetrakis[tris(dimethylamino)phosphoranylidenamino]  phosphonium chloride  (P5Cl) and triethylboron (TEB) were chosen as the binary catalyst to synthesize both well&#8208;defined block and truly random poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers via the one&#8208;pot/one&#8208;step terpolymerization of epoxide/anhydride/CO2 under metal&#8208;free conditions. The bulky nature of phosphazenium cation not only led to loose cation&#8722;anion pairs and enhanced the reactivity, but also provided the chain&#8208;end an appropriate protection and improved the controllability. In particular, P5Cl/TEB with a molar ratio of 1/0.5 showed an extraordinary chemoselectivity for ring&#8208;opening alternating copolymerization (ROAC) of cyclohexene oxide (CHO) and phthalic anhydride (PA) first and then ROAC of CHO/CO2. Thus, well&#8208;defined block polyester&#8208;polycarbonate copolymers were synthesized by CHO/PA/CO2 terpolymerization. The chemoselectivity was easily tuned and the ROAC of CHO/PA and ROAC of CHO/CO2 occurred simultaneously with P5Cl/TEB = 1/2, producing truly random poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers from CHO/PA/CO2. In addition, this P5Cl/TEB catalyst and the strategy to regulate its chemoselectivity are versatile for various anhydrides, epoxides and initiators. Thus, poly(ester&#8208;carbonate) copolymers with varying sequences, compositions, and topologies are successfully synthesized, making it possible to compare their properties and to expand their applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial&#160;Lithium Channels Built from Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In sharp contrast to numerous artificial potassium channels developed over the past decade, the study of artificial lithium&#8208;transporting channels has remained limited. We demonstrate here the use of an interesting class of polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM) for constructing artificial lithium channels. These PIM&#8208;derived lithium channels show exceptionally efficient (&#947;Li+ &gt; 40 pS) and highly selective transport of Li+ ions, with selectivity factors of &gt; 10 against both Na+ and K+. By simply adjusting the initial reaction temperature, we can tune the transport property in a way that PIMs synthesized at initial reaction temperatures of 60 &#176;C and 80&#176;C exhibit improved transport efficiency and selectivity, respectively, in the dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine&#160; membrane.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) are important gaseous biological signaling molecules that are involved in complex cellular pathways. A number of physiological processes require both H2S and NO, which has led to the proposal that different H2S/NO&#8226; crosstalk species, including thionitrite (SNO&#8211;) and perthionitrite (SSNO&#8211;), are responsible for this observed codependence. Despite the importance of these S/N hybrid species, the reported properties and characterization, as well as the fundamental pathways of formation and subsequent reactivity, remain poorly understood. Herein we report new experimental insights into the fundamental reaction chemistry of pathways to form SNO&#8211; and SSNO&#8211;, including mechanisms for proton&#8208;mediated interconversion. In addition, we demonstrate new modes of reactivity with other sulfur&#8208;containing potential crosstalk species, including carbonyl sulfide (COS).</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Methylation of Cyclic Ether Towards Highly Elastic Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Silicon&#8208;based Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes offer high theoretical capacity for lithium&#8208;ion batteries but suffer from severe volume changes and continuous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation. Here, we address these challenges by selective methylation of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), thus shifting the unstable bulk polymerization to controlled interfacial reactions and resulting in a highly elastic SEI. Comparative studies of 2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (2MDOL) and 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (4MDOL) reveal that 4MDOL, with its larger ring strain and more stable radical intermediates due to hyperconjugation effect, promotes the formation of high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymeric species at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This elastic, polymer&#8208;rich SEI effectively accommodates volume changes of Si and inhibits continuous side reactions. Our designed electrolyte enables Si&#8208;based anode to achieve 85.4% capacity retention after 400 cycles at 0.5 C without additives, significantly outperforming conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes. Full cells also demonstrate stable long&#8208;term cycling. This work provides new insights into molecular&#8208;level electrolyte design for high&#8208;performance Si anodes, offering a promising pathway toward next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries with enhanced energy density and longevity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast Production of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Covalent Enzyme Immobilization with Boosted Enzymatic Catalysis by Solar&#8208;Driven Photothermal Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new enzyme&#8208;immobilization systems to stabilize their dynamic structures and meanwhile enhance their catalytic activity is of great significance but very challenging. Herein, we design and fabricate a class of robust mesoporous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via Michael addition&#8208;elimination reaction. It is found that highly crystalline COFs can be produced in 10 min, which is attributed to the promoting effect of the intramolecular hydrogen bond activation. The COFs rich in hydroxyl groups can be facilely post&#8208;modified by epibromohydrin to covalently immobilize enzymes with both high loading and activity. Furthermore, we create a solar&#8208;driven photothermal&#8208;promoted strategy by introducing photoactive azo groups to COF carriers, which can boost the enzyme catalytic performance (lipase) with much higher conversion of various racemic substrates and chiral resolution upon solar light irradiation. The heterogeneous biocatalysts also demonstrate exceptional reusability and stability. This work provides a green and energy&#8208;efficient approach to facilitate the scale application of enzyme&#8208;immobilized biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction Induces Hydrogen Spillover and Platinum Utilization in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The substantial promotion of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance relies on the breakup of the Sabatier principle, which can be achieved by the alternation of the support and electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) is noticed. Due to the utilization of tungsten disulfides as support for platinum (Pt@WS2), surprisingly, Pt@WS2 demands only 31 mV overpotential to attain 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in acidic HER test, corresponding to a 2.5&#8208;fold higher mass activity than benchmarked Pt/C. The pH dependent electrochemical measurements associated with H2&#8208;TPD and in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy indicate a hydrogen spillover involved HER mechanism is confirmed. The WS2 support triggers a higher hydrogen binding strength for Pt leading to the increment in hydrogen concentration at Pt sites proved by upshifted d band center as well as lower Gibbs free energy of hydrogen, favourable for hydrogen spillover. Besides, the WS2 shows a comparably lower effect on Gibbs free energy for different Pt layers (&#8208;0.50 eV layer&#8208;1) than carbon black (&#8208;0.88 eV layer&#8208;1) contributing to a better Pt utilization. Also, the theoretical calculation suggests the hydrogen spillover occurs on the 3rd Pt layer in Pt@WS2; moreover, the energy barrier is lowered with increment in hydrogen coverage on Pt.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright Nanocomposites based on Quantum Dot&#8208;Initiated Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating quantum dots (QDs) into polymer matrix to form nanocomposites without compromising the QD photoluminescence (PL) is crucial to emerging QD light&#8208;emitting and solar energy conversion fields. However, the most widely&#8208;used bulk polymerization technique, where monomers serve as the QD solvent, usually leads to QD PL quenching caused by radical initiators. Here we demonstrate high&#8208;brightness nanocomposites with near&#8208;unity PL quantum yield (QY), through a novel QDs&#8208;catalyzed (&#8208;initiated) bulk polymerization without using any radical initiators. Different from previous reports where QDs were designed as photo&#8208;sensitizers/catalysts (always with cocatalysts) and hence non&#8208;emissive in catalytic conditions, our QDs combine high brightness with highly effective catalysis, a combination that was previously considered to be hardly possible. In our case, apart from emitting light (at a large probability), the photoexcited QDs act as &#8216;overall reaction&#8217; catalysts by simultaneously employing photoexcited electrons and holes to produce active radicals without the need of any sacrificial agents. These active radicals, though with a small amount, are sufficient to initiate effective chain reaction&#8208;dominated bulk polymerization, eliminating the requirement of extra radical initiators. This study provides new insights for understanding and development of QDs for energy applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Cell&#8208;Mediated Catalyst&#8208;Free Spontaneous Polymerization of Zwitterionic Methacrylates for Preparation of Probiotic&#8208;Loaded Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Living cell&#8208;mediated polymerization offers promising applications in biomaterials, yet its further biological utilization is hindered by the need for metal ions or radical initiators with available methods. In this study, we introduce a living cell&#8208;mediated polymerization that leverages the intrinsic metabolic activities of living cells to initiate and sustain free radical polymerization of zwitterionic methacrylates. The polymerization proceeded in the absence of transition metal catalysts, radical initiators, or light sources. The conversion of zwitterionic methacrylate strongly correlated with cellular activities and achieved a maximum conversion of 98% within 48 hours. Living cells efflux redox power across membranes through metabolism and that terminal electron fluxes are captured by zwitterionic methacrylates pre&#8208;assembled on the living cell surface to initiate radical polymerization reactions. The polymerization caused significant changes to the cell membrane surface and synthesized hydrogels with tailored mechanical properties. The polymer hydrogel obtained via probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 was able to release the in&#8208;situ encapsulated molecules, which demonstrated living cell&#8208;mediated polymer hydrogel as a vehicle for the delivery of both cellular and molecular therapeutic agents. This research offered a green and efficient method for synthesizing bioactive materials and advancing the field of cellular therapeutics and drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of Synergistic Two&#8208;Color Covalent Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of highly wavelength resolved reactivity information for complex photochemical reaction processes allows the establishment of multi&#8208;color reaction modes. One particularly powerful mode is the synergistic two&#8208;color reaction, where two colors of light have to be present in the same volume element to either enable or enhance photochemical reactivity that leads to a specific photoproduct. Herein, we introduce a two&#8208;color synergistic photochemical reaction system based on a diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) photoswitch and the cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization of a bridged ring&#8208;strained azobenzene (SA), which respond to ultraviolet (365 nm) and visible light (430 nm), respectively, with different rates, forming a well&#8208;defined heterocyclic photoadduct, DIOSA, that we structurally confirm via single crystal x&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). To quantitatively capture the effectiveness of the dual&#8208;color irradiation as a function of the reaction conditions such as light intensity and starting material ratio as a function of product yield, we introduce a parameter, the photochemical synergistic ratio. A reduced synergistic ratio&#160;&#8211; that extrapolates to conditions of infinitesimal conversions &#8211; allows to compare the efficiency of the synergistic photochemistry at varying reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions has now become the vogue in C&#8722;H bond functionalization chemistry. Exploration of such diverse interactions such as hydrogen bonding, Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions etc. and their subsequent integration with palladium catalysis becomes pivotal in redefining the sustainability aspects associated with transition metal catalysis. The precise engineering of templates and their diligent correlation with respect to the substrate, becomes the cornerstone in these strategies.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalysis has stood as a pivotal force in synthetic transformations for decades, maintaining its status as a paramount tool in the realm of C&#8722;H bond activation. While functionalization at proximal positions has become commonplace, achieving selective and sustainable access to distal positions continues to captivate scientific endeavors. Recently, a noteworthy trend has emerged, focusing on the utilization of non&#8208;covalent interactions to address the challenges associated with remote functionalization. The integration of these non&#8208;covalent interactions into palladium catalysis stands as a justified response to the demands of achieving selective transformations at distal positions. This review delves into the latest advancements and trends surrounding the incorporation of non&#8208;covalent interactions within the field of palladium catalysis. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to emphasize that multifunctional templates, particularly those harnessing hydrogen bonding, present an elegant and sophisticated approach to activate C&#8722;H bonds in a highly directed fashion. These templates showcase versatility and demonstrate potential applications across diverse contexts within the area of remote functionalization.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Intercalating Supramolecular Hydrogels for Tunable Thermal and Viscoelastic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce DNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) that leverage the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA as a cross&#8208;linking mechanism. These DISHs exhibit tunable endothermic or exothermic driven material properties via strategic choice of intercalator. Interestingly, acridine&#8208;PEG cross&#8208;linkers showing increasing elasticity with increasing temperature, suggesting these materials are joined by purely entropic forces.







Abstract
Polymeric supramolecular hydrogels (PSHs) leverage the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of non&#8208;covalent interactions between polymer chains to govern their structural characteristics. As these materials are formed via endothermic or exothermic equilibria, their thermal response is challenging to control without drastically changing the nature of the chemistry used to join them. In this study, we introduce a novel class of PSHs utilizing the intercalation of double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) as the primary dynamic non&#8208;covalent interaction. The resulting dsDNA intercalating supramolecular hydrogels (DISHs) can be tuned to exhibit both endothermically or exothermically driven binding through strategic selection of intercalators. Bifunctional polyethylene glycol (MW~2000&#8197;Da) capped with intercalators of varying hydrophobicity, charge, and size (acridine, psoralen, thiazole orange, and phenanthridine) produced DISHs with comparable moduli (500&#8211;1000&#8197;Pa), but unique thermal viscoelastic responses. Notably, acridine&#8208;based cross&#8208;linkers displayed invariant and even increasing relaxation times with temperature, suggesting an endothermic binding mechanism. This methodology expands the set of structure&#8208;properties available to biomass&#8208;derived DNA biomaterials and promises a new material system where a broad set of thermal and viscoelastic responses can be obtained due to the sheer number and variety of intercalating molecules.

         <title>Triphenylphosphine Oxide: A Versatile Covalent Functionality for Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently linking molecules to the surfaces of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is challenging yet crucial for the versatile function of SWCNTs. We show that the direct covalent SWCNT functionalization with triphenylphosphine oxide yields a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched carbon nanomaterial platform exhibiting superior dispersibility, thermal stability and electrochemical ion response.







Abstract
Broadening the scope of functionalities that can be covalently bound to single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is crucial for enhancing the versatility of this promising nanomaterial class in applied settings. Here we report the covalent linkage of triphenylphosphine oxide [Ph3P(O)] to SWCNTs, a hitherto overlooked surface functionality. We detail the synthesis and structural characterization of a new family of phosphine oxide&#8208;functionalized diaryliodonium salts that can facilitate direct Ph3P(O) transfer and afford novel SWCNTs with tunable Ph3P(O) content (SWCNT&#8208;P). The molecularly&#8208;distributed and robust nature of the covalent Ph3P(O) attachment in SWCNT&#8208;P was supported by a combination of characterization methods including Raman, infrared, UV/Vis&#8208;NIR and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies coupled with thermogravimetric analysis. Electron microscopy further revealed the effectiveness of the Ph3P(O) moiety for de&#8208;bundling SWCNTs to yield SWCNT&#8208;P with superior dispersibility and processability. Finally, electrochemical studies established that SWCNT&#8208;P is sensitive to the presence of Li+, Na+ and K+ wherein the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett Lewis acidity parameters of the ions were quantitatively transduced by Ph3P(O) to electrochemical responses. This work hence presents a synthetic, structural, spectroscopic and electrochemical foundation for a new phosphorus&#8208;enriched responsive nanomaterial platform featuring the Ph3P(O) functionality.

         <title>Cell Surface Engineering by Phase&#8208;Separated Coacervates for Antibody Display and Targeted Cancer Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tripeptide forms phase&#8208;separated coacervates, which functionalize the surface of NK cells, display an anti&#8208;HER2 mAb within the coacervate layer on the cell surface, and guide the NK cells to recognize and kill HER2+ cancer cells.







Abstract
Cell therapies such as CAR&#8722;T have demonstrated significant clinical successes, driving the investigation of immune cell surface engineering using natural and synthetic materials to enhance their therapeutic performance. However, many of these materials do not fully replicate the dynamic nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study presents a cell surface engineering strategy that utilizes phase&#8208;separated peptide coacervates to decorate the surface of immune cells. We meticulously designed a tripeptide, Fmoc&#8722;Lys&#8722;Gly&#8722;Dopa&#8722;OH (KGdelta; Fmoc=fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; delta=Dopa, dihydroxyphenylalanine), that forms coacervates in aqueous solution via phase separation. These coacervates, mirroring the phase separation properties of ECM proteins, coat the natural killer (NK) cell surface with the assistance of Fe3+ ions and create an outer layer capable of encapsulating monoclonal antibodies (mAb), such as Trastuzumab. The antibody&#8208;embedded coacervate layer equips the NK cells with the ability to recognize cancer cells and eliminate them through enhanced antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). This work thus presents a unique strategy of cell surface functionalization and demonstrates its use in displaying cancer&#8208;targeting mAb for cancer therapies, highlighting its potential application in the field of cancer therapy.

         <title>Exocyclic and Linker Editing of Lys63&#8208;linked Ubiquitin Chains Modulators Specifically Inhibits Non&#8208;homologous End&#8208;joining Repair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic modifications to cyclic peptide CP2 followed by screening through in vitro cellular studies, yielding CP7, significantly enhance cell permeability and apoptosis&#8208;inducing activity. CP7 acts as a selective inhibitor of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ), increasing sensitivity to ionizing radiation, and suggesting a promising strategy for enhancing radiation therapy efficacy.







Abstract
Despite the great advances in discovering cyclic peptides against protein targets, their reduced aqueous solubility, cell permeability, and activity of the cyclic peptide restrict its utilization in advanced biological research and therapeutic applications. Here we report on a novel approach of structural alternation of the exocyclic and linker parts that led to a new derivative with significantly improved cell activity allowing us to dissect its mode of action in detail. We have identified an effective cyclic peptide (CP7) that induces approximately a 9&#8208;fold increase in DNA damage accumulation and a remarkable increase in apoptotic cancer cell death compared to the reported molecule. Notably, treating cells with CP7 leads to a dramatic decrease in the efficiency of non&#8208;homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs), which is accompanied by an increase in homologous recombination (HR) repair. Interestingly, treating BRCA1&#8208;deficient cells with CP7 restores HR integrity, which is accompanied by increased resistance to CP7. Additionally, CP7 treatment increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that CP7 is a selective inhibitor of NHEJ, offering a potential strategy to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy.

         <title>Enhanced Alkene Oxidative Cleavage in Water via Photoexcited FeIV Species within Covalent Organic Framework Thin Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the catalytic activity of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O towards alkene scission in water, facilitated by the hydrophobic COF backbone. The COF acts as a photosensitizer and structural support, enhancing reaction efficiency by proximity effect. The method achieves up to 75&#8201;% yield, producing selectively aldehydes or ketones, and is recyclable for four cycles.







Abstract
The oxidative cleavage of alkenes is a crucial step in synthesizing key organic molecules featuring carbonyl functional groups prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals. We introduce a photochemical method for heterogeneous C=C bond cleavage, employing photo&#8208;catalytically generated [(bTAML)FeIV&#8722;O&#8722;FeIV(bTAML)]&#8722; species (where bTAML stands for biuret&#8208;modified tetraamido macrocyclic ligand) in aqueous environments under gentle conditions. Leveraging the photosensitizing properties of Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) and their advantageous morphological traits as films, we enhance the reaction by closely associating the substrate with the catalyst. This study marks the inaugural demonstration of Fe2IV&#8208;&#956;&#8208;oxo radical cation and FeIV=O species facilitating alkene cleavage in water against a backdrop of a hydrophobic COF. Through comprehensive mechanistic studies, including control experiments, we confirm that these two high&#8208;valent iron oxo species collaborate to cleave alkenes, forming an intermediate epoxide. Our approach yields moderate to high success across various alkenes, displaying diverse functional groups (achieving up to 75&#8201;% yield) with notable efficiency and selectivity towards aldehyde/ketone products. Moreover, the heterogeneous COF film, immobilizing (Et4N)2[FeIII(Cl)bTAML], exhibits exceptional recyclability, enduring up to four cycles.

         <title>Encapsulation of Sn Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters in Multichannel Carbon Matrix for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF, a flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries, is synthesized with uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in a multichannel carbon matrix. This design ensures a size&#8208;dependent electrochemical performance with enhanced K+ diffusion kinetics and cycling stability. Theoretical calculations clarify electron transfer and energy barriers of intermediates. In situ XRD and XANES analysis reveals the K+ storage mechanisms.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;small particle sizes are particularly significant to create advanced energy storage materials. Herein, Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters encapsulated in nitrogen&#8208;doped multichannel carbon matrix (denoted as Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF) are designed by a facile and controllable route as flexible anode for high&#8208;performance potassium ion batteries (PIBs). The uniformly dispersed Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters in multichannel carbon matrix can be precisely identified, which ensure us to clarify the size influence on the electrochemical performance. The sub&#8208;nanoscale effect of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF restrains electrode pulverization and enhances the K+ diffusion kinetics, leading to the superior cycling stability and rate performance. As freestanding anode in PIBs, Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF manifests superior K+ storage properties, such as exceptional cycling stability ( around 331&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 150&#8197;cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1) and rate capability. Especially, the Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF||KFe[Fe(CN)6] full cell demonstrates impressive reversible capacity of around 167&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.4&#8197;A g&#8722;1 even after 200 cycles. Theoretical calculations clarify that the ultrafine Sn sub&#8208;nanoclusters are beneficial for electron transfer and contribute to the lower energy barriers of the intermediates, thereby resulting in promising electrochemical performance. Comprehensive investigation for the intrinsic K+ storage process of Sn&#8208;SCs@MCNF is revealed by in situ analysis. This work provides vital guidance to design sub&#8208;nanoscale functional materials for high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Tuning the Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction between Ni and Fe Atoms in Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts to Boost CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distance effect and inter&#8208;metal interaction of dual&#8208;atom catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction are demonstrated. The NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibits superior activity compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding configurations. The N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance of around 2.7&#8197;&#197; facilitate the adsorption of *COOH and promote the desorption of *CO, thus enhancing the performance.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are promising for applications in electrochemical CO2 reduction due to the enhanced flexibility of the catalytic sites and the synergistic effect between dual atoms. However, precisely controlling the atomic distance and identifying the dual&#8208;atom configuration of DACs to optimize the catalytic performance remains a challenge. Here, the Ni and Fe atomic pairs were constructed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support in three different configurations: NiFe&#8208;isolate, NiFe&#8208;N bridge, and NiFe&#8208;bonding. It was found that the NiFe&#8208;N bridge catalyst with NiN4 and FeN4 sharing two N atoms exhibited superior CO2 reduction activity and promising stability when compared to the NiFe&#8208;isolate and NiFe&#8208;bonding catalysts. A series of characterizations and density functional theory calculations suggested that the N&#8208;bridged NiFe sites with an appropriate distance between Ni and Fe atoms can exert a more pronounced synergy. It not only regulated the suitable adsorption strength for the *COOH intermediate but also promoted the desorption of *CO, thus accelerating the CO2 electroreduction to CO. This work provides an important implication for the enhancement of catalysis by the tailoring of the coordination structure of DACs, with the identification of distance effect between neighboring dual atoms.

         <title>Programmable Reconfiguration of Supramolecular Bottlebrush Block Copolymers: From Solution Self&#8208;Assembly to Co&#8208;Crystallization&#8208;Assistant Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics, nanospheres and multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings are obtained by solution and co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly, which not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domain.







Abstract
Achieving structural reconfiguration of supramolecular bottlebrush block copolymers toward topological engineering is of particular interest but challenging. Here, we address the creation of supramolecular architectures to discover how assembled topology influences the structured aggregates, combining hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) bottlebrush block copolymers and electrostatic interaction induced polymer/inorganic eutectics. We first design H&#8208;bonding linear&#8208;brush block copolymer P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), bearing linear block P(NBDAP&#8208;co&#8208;NBC) (poly(norbornene&#8208;terminated diaminopyridine&#8208;co&#8208;norbornene&#8208;terminated hexane)) with pendant H&#8208;bonding DAP (diaminopyridine) motifs, and PEO (poly(ethylene oxide)) densely grafted P(NBPEO) brush block. Thanks to H&#8208;bonding association between DAP and thymine (Thy), incorporation of Thy&#8208;functionalized polystyrene (Thy&#8208;PS65) enables solution self&#8208;assembly and formation of H&#8208;bonded bottlebrush block copolymers, generating augmented nanospheres with increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 amount. Noteworthy that integration of inorganic cluster silicotungstic acid (STA) to P(NBC&#8208;co&#8208;NBDAP)&#8208;b&#8208;P(NBPEO), endows the formation of PEO/STA eutectic core. Therefore, co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly at the interfaces of polymeric, inorganic and supramolecular chemistry is realized, reflecting multi&#8208;stage morphology transformation from hexagonal platelets, needle&#8208;like, curved rod&#8208;like micelles, finally to end&#8208;to&#8208;end closed rings, by gradually increasing Thy&#8208;PS65 while fixing STA content. Interestingly, such solution self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;crystallization&#8208;assistant self&#8208;assembly strategy not only endows unique nanostructure transition, also induce in&#8208;to&#8208;out reconfiguration of PS domains. These findings clearly provide unique methodology towards programmable fabrication of geometrical objects promising in smart materials.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogel Network with Toughly Interfacial Chemistry for Dendrite&#8208;Free Flexible Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. This work offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.







Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), coupled with low cost and safe, are considered as one of the most promising energy storage candidates for wearable electronics. Hydrogel electrolytes present a compelling alternative to liquid electrolytes due to their remarkable flexibility and clear advantages in mitigating parasitic side reactions. However, hydrogel electrolytes suffer from poor mechanical properties and interfacial chemistry, which limits them to suppressed performance levels in flexible ZIBs, especially under harsh mechanical strains. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired multifunctional hydrogel electrolyte network (polyacrylamide (PAM)/trehalose) with improved mechanical and adhesive properties was developed via a simple trehalose network&#8208;repairing strategy to stabilize the interfacial chemistry for dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;life flexible ZIBs. As a result, the trehalose&#8208;modified PAM hydrogel exhibits a superior strength and stretchability up to 100&#8197;kPa and 5338&#8201;%, respectively, as well as strong adhesive properties to various substrates. Also, the PAM/trehalose hydrogel electrolyte provides superior anti&#8208;corrosion capability for Zn anode and regulates Zn nucleation/growth, resulting in achieving a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.8&#8201;%, and long&#8208;term stability over 2400&#8197;h. Importantly, the flexible Zn//MnO2 pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling performance under different bending conditions, which offers a great potential in flexible energy&#8208;related applications and beyond.

         <title>Heteroatoms&#8208;Stabilized Single Palladium Atoms on Amorphous Zeolites: Breaking the Tradeoff between Catalytic Activity and Selectivity for Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on heteroatom (B, Al, or Ga)&#8208;containing amorphous zeolite, achieves the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the semihydrogenation of alkynes, demonstrating a recorded turnover frequency value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and high styrene selectivity (95&#8201;%).







Abstract
As a fundamental industrial catalytic process, the semihydrogenation of alkynes presents a challenge in striking a balance between activity and selectivity due to the issue of over&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we develop an efficient catalytic system based on single&#8208;atom Pd catalysts supported on boron&#8208;containing amorphous zeolites (Pd/AZ&#8722;B), achieving the tradeoff breaking between the activity and selectivity for the selective hydrogenation of alkynes. Advanced characterizations and theoretical density functional theory calculations confirm that the incorporated B atoms in the Pd/AZ&#8722;B can not only alter the geometric and electronic properties of Pd atoms by controlling the electron migration from Pd but also mitigate the interaction between alkene and the catalyst supports. This boosts the exceptional catalytic efficacy in the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene under mild conditions (298&#8197;K, 2&#8197;bar H2), achieving a recorded turnover frequency (TOF) value of 24198&#8197;h&#8722;1 and demonstrating 95&#8201;% selectivity to styrene at full conversion of phenylacetylene. By comparison, the heteroatom&#8208;free amorphous zeolite&#8208;anchored Pd nanoparticles and the commercial Lindlar catalyst have styrene selectivities of 73&#8201;% and 15&#8201;%, respectively, under identical reaction conditions. This work establishes a solid foundation for developing highly active and selective hydrogenation catalysts by controllably optimizing their electronic and steric properties.

         <title>Spatial&#8208;coupled Ampere&#8208;level Electrochemical Propylene Epoxidation over RuO2/Ti Hollow&#8208;fiber Penetration Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ampere&#8208;level propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) is achieved over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) in a membraneless reactor, in virtue of the synergetic combination of both the penetration effect and the spatial&#8208;coupling strategy, exhibiting specificity propylene oxide (PO) production of over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency (FEPO) and a maximum 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 PO partial current density (jPO), with significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.







Abstract
The electrochemical propylene epoxidation reaction (PER) provides a promising route for ecofriendly propylene oxide (PO) production, instantly generating active halogen/oxygen species to alleviate chloride contamination inherent in traditional PER. However, the complex processes and unsatisfactory PO yield for current electrochemical PER falls short of meeting industrial application requirements. Herein, a spatial&#8208;coupling strategy over RuO2/Ti hollow&#8208;fiber penetration electrode (HPE) is adopted to facilitate efficient PO production, significantly improving PER performance to ampere level (achieving over 80&#8201;% PO faradaic efficiency and a maximum PO current density of 859&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). The synergetic combination of the penetration effect of HPE and the spatial&#8208;coupled reaction sequence, enables the realization of ampere&#8208;level PO production with high specificity, exhibiting significant potentials for economically viable PER applications.

         <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging P and Fe from spent LiFePO4 cathodes, in situ generated PO43&#8722; and NiOOH/Fe3(PO4)2 heterointerfaces effectively inhibit chlorine oxidation while promoting OH&#8722; adsorption and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through electrostatic modulation. The resulting catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline seawater.







Abstract
The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8722; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8722; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237&#8197;mV to attain a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3&#8201;% activity loss after 600&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Catalytic Structural Isomerisation as a Route to &#945;&#8208;Arylated Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, dual catalytic method for the structural isomerisation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;make tertiary allylic alcohols into &#945;&#8208;arylated ketones is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include a two&#8208;step homologation of diaryl ketone drug molecules.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A mild, dual catalytic method for the structural isomerisation of easy-to-make tertiary allylic alcohols into &#945;-arylated ketones is reported. Applications of this straightforward approach include a two-step homologation of diaryl ketone drug molecules.

         <title>Water&#8208;Involved Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen Triple&#8208;Bond Monomer Based Polymerization toward Processable Functional Polyamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful polymerization of water, isocyanide, and chlorooxime was established toward polyamide with a novel modifiable architecture. Through hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction, emissive units were introduced to the polyamide, which emission colors could range from blue to red. The refractive index (n) of polyamides was also significantly improved and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers.







Abstract
Polyamide plays a pivotal role in engineering thermoplastics. Constrained by the harsh conditions and arduous procedures for its industrial synthesis, developing facile synthesis of polyamides is still challengeable and holds profound significance. Herein, we successfully utilized water as one of the monomers to synthesize functional polyamides under ambient conditions. A powerful multicomponent polymerization of water, isocyanides, and chlorooximes was established in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Soluble and thermally stable polyamides with high weight&#8208;average molecular weights (up to 53 900) were obtained in excellent yields (up to 95&#8201;%). The polymerization exhibits unique polymerization&#8208;induced emission characteristics, successfully converting non&#8208;emissive monomers into unconventional emissive polymers. Notably, the resultant polyamides could undergo effective post&#8208;modification via the hydroxyl&#8208;yne click reaction. By incorporating various functional groups into the polyamide, its emission color could be fine&#8208;tuned from blue to green and to red. Remarkably, the refractive index (n) of the polyamide at 589&#8197;nm could be increased from 1.6173 to 1.7227 and the &#916;n could be unprecedentedly as high as 0.1054 for non&#8208;heavy atom&#8208;containing polymers after post&#8208;modification, and its micron&#8208;thick films exhibited excellent transparency in the visible region. Thus, this work not only establishes a powerful polymerization toward novel polyamides but also opens up an avenue for their versatile functionalization.

         <title>Visualization of Electrooxidation on Palladium Single Crystal Surfaces via In Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed schematic of the entire electrooxidation reaction pathway on the Pd single crystal surface can be outlined by obtaining the direct spectroscopic evidence of *OH and *OO intermediates via in situ Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that surface&#8208;adsorbed ClO4&#8722; ions can facilitate the deprotonation process of *OH and accelerate the electrooxidation process.







Abstract
The electrooxidation of catalyst surfaces is across various electrocatalytic reactions, directly impacting their activity, stability and selectivity. Precisely characterizing the electrooxidation on well&#8208;defined surfaces is essential to understanding electrocatalytic reactions comprehensively. Herein, we employed in situ Raman spectroscopy to monitor the electrooxidation process of palladium single crystal. Our findings reveal that the Pd surface's initial electrooxidation process involves forming *OH intermediate and ClO4&#8722; ions facilitate the deprotonation process, leading to the formation of PdOx. Subsequently, under deep electrooxidation potential range, the oxygen atoms within PdOx contribute to creating surface&#8208;bound peroxide species, ultimately resulting in oxygen generation. The adsorption strength of *OH and the coverage of ClO4&#8722; can be adjusted by the controllable electronic effect, resulting in different oxidation rates. This study offers valuable insights into elucidating the electrooxidation mechanisms underlying a range of electrocatalytic reactions, thereby contributing to the rational design of catalysts.

         <title>Front Cover: Programmable Chemical Evolution with Natural/non&#8208;natural Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying evolution to create bioactive molecules beyond natural building blocks (BBs) is crucial for chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the application of evolution with many different non&#8208;natural BBs remains challenging. In their Research Article (e202409746), Yixin Zhang, Fazheng Ren, Weilin Lin et&#8197;al. developed a programmable chemical evolution approach using natural/non&#8208;natural BBs. It starts from creating ancestral molecules, followed by evolving high&#8208;affinity peptidomimetic binders in just a few generations within an astronomically large combinatorial space.

Subtractive two&#8208;photon biofabrication facilitates spatiotemporal tissue engineering and drug testing in the laboratory. However, it necessitates the rational design of cell&#8208;compatible, photolabile macromolecular networks that cleave rapidly upon laser exposure. In their Communication (e202404599), Xiao&#8208;Hua Qin and co&#8208;workers develop coumarin&#8208;based photodegradable hydrogels that enable two&#8208;photon direct laser writing of complex 3D microfluidic networks at 300 mm s&#8722;1. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept laser&#8208;guided tissue morphogenesis is demonstrated at micron&#8208;scale resolution.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal operando Raman spectroscopy, combined with kinetic analysis under controlled chemical conditions, was employed to investigate the formation of carbon aggregates on the catalyst surface and their kinetic impact during methane dry reforming on a Rh/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst, as reported by Matteo Monai, Matteo Maestri et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202408668). In the cover image, an increased CO2 content (depicted by the hot air balloon) relative to methane (represented by the basket) inhibits methane from leading to coke formation, symbolized by the mountains (Cover design: Lia Tagliavini).

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Dissolution&#8208;Recrystallization: A Novel Mechanism for Fluorochromic Detection of Th4+ Using Color&#8208;Tunable Luminescent Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution&#8211;recrystallization of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) opens exciting possibilities for fluorochromic detection of radionuclides. In their Research Article (e202410453), Jian Lin et al. introduce a novel method for detecting Th4+ ions using a series of color&#8208;tunable luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based MOFs. The inherent instability of MOFs is leveraged to enable Th4+ detection through an unprecedented dissolution&#8211;recrystallization mechanism, transforming a perceived limitation into a valuable tool for fluorochromic sensing of radionuclides.

         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;activatable cyanine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizer (PS) is reported by Jing Lin and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202408064). The &#8220;dormant&#8221; PS in normal cells, depicted in gray, transforms into its &#8220;active mode&#8221; (red) upon entering tumor cells through the portal, where it is activated by the acidic tumor microenvironment and generates toxic singlet oxygen under 808&#8197;nm light irradiation, selectively killing tumor cells and minimizing damage to normal tissues.

         <title>Front Cover: Allostery at a Protein&#8208;Protein Interface Harboring an Intermolecular Motional Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic networks are important devices for allosteric regulation of protein function. In their Communication (e202411472), Rasmus Linser and co&#8208;workers use NMR spectroscopy and simulations to show that intermolecular association can make a connection for such networks to arise from segments previously bearing unrelated motion. Awareness of this kind of constructive, switchable modulation could help understanding and exploiting allosteric modulators for pharmacological or biotechnological avenues.

         <title>Front Cover: Transforming Red Phosphorus Photocatalysis: Dual Roles of Pre&#8208;Anchored Ru Single Atoms in Defect and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring ruthenium (Ru) single atoms in crystalline red phosphorus boosts its photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance. Yun Hau Ng, Lin Jing et al. highlight in their Research Article (e202409179) the dual role of this innovative strategy in repairing undesired phosphorus defects and enabling Ru nanoparticle anchoring. This results in extended charge lifetimes and enhanced interfacial charge transfer, leading to a &#8220;simple&#8221; yet highly efficient photocatalytic system for hydrogen production.

         <title>Ene&#8208;Reductase&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization of Simple Cyclohexanones to Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) system is reported that facilitates the direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to give substituted phenols. The process entails successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds and leverages molecular oxygen from the air to drive the reaction cycle. This approach serves as a robust alternative to conventional synthetic methods.







Abstract
Direct aromatization of cyclohexanones to synthesize substituted phenols represents a significant challenge in modern synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe a novel ene&#8208;reductase (TsER) catalytic system that converts substituted cyclohexanones into the corresponding phenols. This process involves the successive dehydrogenation of two saturated carbon&#8208;carbon bonds within the six&#8208;membered ring of cyclohexanones and utilizes molecular oxygen to drive the reaction cycle. It demonstrates a versatile and efficient approach for the synthesis of substituted phenols, providing a valuable complement to existing chemical methodologies.

         <title>In situ Construction of Single&#8208;Atom Electronic Bridge on COF to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the photocatalytic process, Ru atoms are anchored in situ by COF&#8208;Cu3TG, forming a single&#8208;atom electronic bridge between layers. This, combined with the selection of small&#8208;sized metal cluster, facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electrons, significantly enhancing the photocatalytic HER capability.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production is one of the most valuable technologies in the future energy system. Here, we designed a metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with both small&#8208;sized metal clusters and nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands, named COF&#8208;Cu3TG. Based on our design, small&#8208;sized metal clusters were selected to increase the density of active sites and shorten the distance of electron transport to active sites. While another building block containing nitrogen&#8208;rich organic ligands acted as a node that could in situ anchor metal atoms during photocatalysis and form interlayer single&#8208;atom electron bridges (SAEB) to accelerate electron transport. Together, they promoted photocatalytic performance. This represented the further utilization of Ru atoms and was an additional application of the photosensitizer. N2&#8208;Ru&#8208;N2 electron bridge (Ru&#8208;SAEB) was created in situ between the layers, resulting in a considerable enhancement in the hydrogen production rate of the photocatalyst to 10.47&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Through theoretical calculation and EXAFS, the existence position and action mechanism of Ru&#8208;SAEB were reasonably inferred, further confirming the rationality of the Ru&#8208;SAEB configuration. A sufficiently proximity between the small&#8208;sized Cu3 cluster and the Ru&#8208;SAEB was found to expedite electron transfer. This work demonstrated the synergistic impact of small molecular clusters with Ru&#8208;SAEB for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Axial Self&#8208;Driven X&#8208;Ray Detection by a Two&#8208;Dimensional Biaxial Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection was achieved by using the multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric material BA2EA2Pb3I10 for the first time. It presents ultra&#8208;low detection limits along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis (19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) at zero bias, which was two orders of magnitude lower than commercial &#945;&#8208;Se.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskite ferroelectrics combining spontaneous polarization and excellent semiconducting properties is an ideal platform for enabling self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection. However, achievements to date have been only based on uniaxiality, which increases the complexity of device fabrication. Multi&#8208;axial ferroelectric materials have multiple equivalent polarization directions, making them potentially amenable to multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection, but the report on these types of materials is still a huge blank. Herein, a high&#8208;quality (BA)2(EA)2Pb3I10 (1) biaxial ferroelectric single crystal was successfully grown, which exhibited significant spontaneous polarization along the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) was exhibited along both the c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis, with open circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.23&#8197;V and 0.22&#8197;V, respectively. Then, the BPVE revealed along the inversion of polarized direction with the polarized electric fields. Intriguingly, due to the BPVE of 1, 1 achieved multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven X&#8208;ray detection for the first time (c&#8208;axis and b&#8208;axis) with relatively high sensitivities and ultralow detection limits (17.2&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 19.4&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively). This work provides a reference for the subsequent use of multi&#8208;axial ferroelectricity for multi&#8208;axial self&#8208;driven optoelectronic detection.

         <title>Crosslink&#8208;Enhanced Emission&#8208;Dominated Design Strategy for Constructing Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots With Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated strategy was proposed, achieving desired Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). Combined with experiments and theoretical calculations, crosslinking, conjugation and steric hindrance factors were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission.







Abstract
Self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) with advantageous crosslinked nano&#8208;structures have attracted considerable attention in metal&#8208;free room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, whereas their RTP emissions are still limited to short wavelength. Expanding their RTP emissions to Near&#8208;Infrared (NIR) range is attractive but suffers from the difficulties in constructing narrow energy levels and inhibiting intense non&#8208;radiative decay. Herein, a crosslink&#8208;enhanced emission (CEE)&#8208;dominated construction strategy was proposed, achieving desired NIR RTP (710&#8197;nm) in self&#8208;protective CPDs for the first time. Structural factors, i.e., crosslinking (covalent&#8208;bond CEE), conjugation (conjugated amine with bridging N&#8722;H and C=C group), and steric hindrance (confined&#8208;domain CEE), were confirmed indispensable for triggering NIR RTP emission in CPDs. Contrast experiments and theoretical calculations further revealed the rationality of the design strategy originating from CEE in terms of promoting the narrow energy level emission of triplet excitons and inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative quenching. This work not only firstly achieves NIR RTP in self&#8208;protective CPDs but also helps understand the origin of NIR RTP to further guide the synthesis of diverse CPDs with efficient long&#8208;wavelength RTP emission.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

The development of mechanically robust, chemically stable, and yet recyclable polymers represents an essential undertaking in the context of advancing a circular economy for plastics. Here, we introduce a novel cleavable &#946;&#8208;(1,3&#8208;dioxane)ester (DXE) linkage, synthesized through the catalyst&#8208;free reaction of &#946;&#8208;ketoester and 1,3&#8208;diol, to cross&#8208;link poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for the formation of high&#8208;performance thermosets with inherent chemical recyclability. PVA, modified with &#946;&#8208;ketoester groups through the transesterification reaction with excess tert&#8208;butyl acetoacetate, undergoes cross&#8208;linking reactions with the unmodified 1,3&#8208;diols within PVA itself upon thermal treatment. The cross&#8208;linking architecture improves PVA&#8217;s mechanical properties, with Young's modulus and toughness that can reach up to 656&#8197;MPa and 84&#8197;MJ&#8201;cm&#8722;3, i.e. approximately 3&#8208; and 12&#8208;fold those of linear PVA, respectively. Thermal treatment of the cross&#8208;linked PVA polymers under acid conditions leads to deconstruction of the networks, enabling the excellent recovery (&gt;90&#8201;%) of PVA. In the absence of either thermal or acidic treatment, the cross&#8208;linked PVA maintains its dimensional stability. We show that the recovery of PVA is also possible when the treatment is performed in the presence of other plastics commonly found in recycling mixtures. Furthermore, PVA&#8208;based composites comprising carbon fibers and activated charcoal cross&#8208;linked by the DXE linkages are also shown to be recyclable with recovery of the PVA and the fillers.

         <title>A Metal&#8211;Sulfur&#8211;Carbon Catalyst Mimicking the Two&#8208;Component Architecture of Nitrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimicking metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst, composed of S&#8722;C&#8208;supported ruthenium single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs), was designed for electrochemical nitrate reduction. Leveraging the synergistic effects of SAs and NPs, this two&#8208;component M&#8722;S&#8722;C catalyst exhibits an exceptional ammonia yield rate of 37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The production of ammonia (NH3) from nitrogen sources involves competitive adsorption of different intermediates and multiple electron and proton transfers, presenting grand challenges in catalyst design. In nature nitrogenases reduce dinitrogen to NH3 using two component proteins, in which electrons and protons are delivered from Fe protein to the active site in MoFe protein for transfer to the bound N2. We draw inspiration from this structural enzymology, and design a two&#8208;component metal&#8211;sulfur&#8211;carbon (M&#8722;S&#8722;C) catalyst composed of sulfur&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium (Ru) single atoms (SAs) and nanoparticles (NPs) for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to NH3. The catalyst demonstrates a remarkable NH3 yield rate of ~37&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of ~97&#8201;% for over 200&#8197;hours, outperforming those consisting solely of SAs or NPs, and even surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical investigations reveal the critical role of Ru SAs with the coordination of S in promoting the formation of the HONO intermediate and the subsequent reduction reaction over the NP&#8208;surface nearby. Such process results in a more energetically accessible pathway for NO3&#8722; reduction on Ru NPs co&#8208;existing with SAs. This study proves a better understanding of how M&#8722;S&#8722;Cs act as a synthetic nitrogenase mimic during ammonia synthesis, and contributes to the future mechanism&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Anti&#8208;Ohmic Behaviour in Diradicaloid Molecular Wires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular conductance increases with length at a significant rate in a series of bis(indeno)acene molecular wires. The rapid shrinking of the HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap induced by the singlet diradicaloid character of these compounds is responsible for the observed behaviour. These results pave the way to long&#8208;range, efficient coherent tunnelling charge transport.







Abstract
Open&#8208;shell materials bearing multiple spin centres provide a key route to efficient charge transport in single&#8208;molecule electronic devices. They have narrow energy gaps, and their molecular orbitals align closely to the Fermi level of the metallic electrodes, thus allowing efficient electronic transport and higher conductance. Maintaining and stabilising multiple open&#8208;shell states&#8212;especially in contact with metallic electrodes&#8212;is however very challenging, generally requiring a continuous chemical or electrochemical potential to avoid self&#8208;immolation of the open&#8208;shell character. To overcome this issue, we designed, synthesised, and measured the conductance of a series of bis(indeno) fused acenes, where stability is imparted by a close&#8208;shell quinoidal conformation in resonance with the diradical electronic configuration. We show here that these compounds have anti&#8208;ohmic behaviour, with conductance increasing with increasing molecular length, at an unprecedented rate and across the entire bias window (

&#177;1.3V

 ${\pm 1.3\ V}$



). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations support our findings, showing the rapidly narrowing HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap, unique to these diradicaloid structures, is responsible for the observed behaviour. Our results provide a framework for achieving efficient transport in neutral compounds and demonstrate the promise that diradicaloid materials have in single&#8208;molecule electronics, owing to their great stability and unique electronic structure.

         <title>Standardized Parts for Activation of Small GTPase Signaling in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a plug and play approach for the direct control of small GTPase activation in living cells. This approach is applied to the temporal control of filopodia formation, membrane ruffling, cell retraction, and MAPK signaling.







Abstract
Small GTPases comprise a superfamily of over 167 proteins in the human genome and are critical regulators of a variety of pathways including cell migration and proliferation. Despite the importance of these proteins in cell signaling, a standardized approach for controlling small GTPase activation within living cells is lacking. Herein, we report a split&#8208;protein&#8208;based approach to directly activate small GTPase signaling in living cells. Importantly, our fragmentation site can be applied across the small GTPase superfamily. We highlight the utility of these standardized parts by demonstrating the ability to directly modulate the activity of four different small GTPases with user&#8208;defined inputs, providing the first plug and play system for direct activation of small GTPases in living cells.
