         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective [3+2] Cycloaddition of Azomethine Ylides Using Planar
Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Imidazoline N,O&#8208;ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a facile synthetic route toward a novel series of imidazolinyl&#8208;[2.2]paracyclophanol (UCD&#8208;Imphanol) ligands possessing central and planar chirality. Both sets of diastereomeric ligands were successfully purified by column chromatography. The preliminary application of this family ligands showed excellent activities in the asymmetric Zn&#8208;catalyzed azomethine ylide cycloaddition. Enantioenriched pyrrolidines, in a substrate scope of 20 examples, were accessed in high levels of  endo  /  exo  ratios (up to &gt;99/1) and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99% ee) with excellent yields (up to 99%) by using (  S  ,  S  ,  S  P  )&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol/(  S  ,  S  ,  R  P  )&#8208;UCD&#8208;Imphanol, respectively.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A saddle&#8208;shaped nanocarbon molecule was synthesized, which revealed the existence of negative Gauss curvatures on a &gt;3&#8208;nm molecular structure possessing 192 &#960;&#8208;electrons. &#160;The synthesis&#160; was &#160;facilitated by a protocol developed with Design&#8208;of&#8208;Experiments optimizations and machine&#8208;learning predictions, and spectroscopy and crystallography&#160; were &#160;used to reveal the saddle&#8208;shaped structure of the molecule. Solution&#8208;phase analyses&#160; showed &#160;the presence of dimeric assembly, and crystallographic analyses&#160; revealed &#160;the stacked dimeric structures. The stacked crystal structure&#160; was &#160;scrutinized by various methods, including Gauss curvatures derived from the discrete surface theory of geometry, to reveal the important role of the molecular Gauss curvature in dimeric assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of a Fluorinated&#8208;Squaramide Covalent Organic Framework for the Highly Efficient and Board&#8208;Spectrum Removal of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The escalating contamination by per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has become an urgent issue in recent years, and the structural diversity of PFAS is the major challenge for effective pollution control. Herein, we take the intrinsic advantages of squaramide and prepare a new two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (FSQ&#8208;1) that exhibits board&#8208;spectrum PFAS affinity. The tailor&#8208;made linker forges hydrogen bond donors, hydrogen bond acceptors, and flurophilic segments into one framework. The obtained material exhibits multipoint and multitype affinity to PFAS with different structures, by which high&#8208;efficient and board&#8208;spectrum removal of various PFAS can be simultaneously achieved. Notably, the thermodynamic profiles provided by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments further illustrate the underlying mechanism of the board&#8208;spectrum affinity. The FSQ&#8208;1 can also be applied for efficient PFAS extraction in trace&#8208;level PFAS analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation of a Hybrid 1&#8208;Bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene Heteroarene Anion Derivative</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The B(C  6  F  5  )  2  substituted borole  2  was obtained from the phenyl bis(trimethylsilylethynyl) borane SMe  2  adduct (  1  &#8729;SMe  2  ) by a synthetic sequence containing a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction. Subsequent thermolysis at 50 &#176;C converted it to the bicyclic borenium/ borate zwitterion  3  . Photolysis of  3  gave the diboracyclohexadiene derivative  4  &#8231;SMe  2  , which after ligand exchange with N,N&#8208;dimesitylim&#8208;idazolylidene and deprotonation gave the 1&#8208;bora&#8208;3&#8208;boratabenzene anion derivative as its potassium salt  6  . Some unique follow&#8208;up reactions of the unsaturated diboron containing six&#8208;membered heterocycles were investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Combinatorial Self&#8208;Assembly of Coordination Cages with Systematically Fine&#8208;Tuned Cavities for Efficient Co&#8208;Encapsulation and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable arrangement of different ligands in a single assembly will not only bring increased complexity but also offers a new route to  fine&#8208;tune  the function of the designed architecture.  We report here a combinatorial self&#8208;assembly with enPd(NO  3  )  2  and three different ligands (  L  1&#8208;3  ), which gave rise to a family of six palladium&#8208;organic cages  (  C1&#8208;6  ) with systematically varied shapes and cavities, including three new heteroleptic (  Pd  5  L  1  2  L  2  ,  Pd  5  L  1  2  L  3  ,  Pd  4  L  2  L  3  ), one new homoleptic (  Pd  4  L  3  2  ) cage, and two known homoleptic (  Pd  6  L  1  4  ,  Pd  4  L  2  2  ) cages  . Emergent functions due to the fusion of two half cavities on the heteroleptic cages from their parent homoleptic cages have been observed:  the heteroleptic  cages can form ternary complexes by co&#8208;encapsulation of both aromatic and aliphatic guests, while their homoleptic counterparts can only form binary complexes. Such a forced co&#8208;encapsulation effect endows the heteroleptic cages with enhanced catalytic power for the Knoevenagel condensation.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Geminal Hydroborative Cyclization of Enynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disclosed here is the first geminal (  gem&#8208;  ) hydroborative cyclization of enynes. Different from known hydroborative cyclizations, this process adds hydrogen and boron to the same position, leading to a new reaction mode. With [Cp*RuCl]  4  as catalyst, a range of  gem  &#8208;hydroborated bicyclic products bearing a cyclopropane unit could be rapidly assembled from simple enyne substrates. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided important insights into the reaction mechanism. Notably, two major competing pathways may operate with substrate&#8208;dependence. 1,6&#8208;Enynes favor initial oxidative cyclometalation to form a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate prior to engaging hydroborane, while other enynes (e.g., 1,7&#8208;enynes) that lack strong propensity toward cyclization prefer initial alkyne  gem  &#8208;(H,B)&#8208;addition to form an &#945;&#8208;boryl ruthenium carbene followed by intramolecular olefin cyclopropanation. This process also represents the first ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed enyne hydroborative cyclization.</dc:description>

Notably, two major competing pathways may operate with substrate-dependence. 1,6-Enynes favor initial oxidative cyclometalation to form a ruthenacyclopentene intermediate prior to engaging hydroborane, while other enynes (e.g., 1,7-enynes) that lack strong propensity toward cyclization prefer initial alkyne  gem  -(H,B)-addition to form an &#945;-boryl ruthenium carbene followed by intramolecular olefin cyclopropanation. This process also represents the first ruthenium-catalyzed enyne hydroborative cyclization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescence or Phosphorescence? The Metallic Composition of Nanocluster Kernel Does Matter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains challenging to manipulate the nature of photoluminescence as fluorescence or phosphorescence for a correlated cluster series. In this work, two correlated nanoclusters, Au  5  Ag  11  (SR)  8  (DPPOE)  2  and Pt  1  Ag  16  (SR)  8  (DPPOE)  2  with comparable structure features, were controllably synthesized and structurally determined. These two alloy nanoclusters displayed distinct photoluminescent nature &#8213; the Au  5  Ag  11  nanocluster was fluorescent, whereas the Pt  1  Ag  16  nanocluster was phosphorescent. The decay processes of excited electrons of these two nanoclusters have been explicitly mapped out by both experimental and theoretical approaches, disclosing mechanisms of their fluorescence and phosphorescence. Specifically, the metallic compositions of the nanocluster kernels mattered in determining their photoluminescent nature. The results herein provide an intriguing nanomodel that enables us to grasp the origin of photoluminescence at the atomic level, which further paves the way for fabricating novel nanoclusters or cluster&#8208;based nanomaterials with customized photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Total Syntheses of Five Lycopodium Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein that by exploiting the commonly shared bicyclic decahydroquinoline motif, a gold&#8208;catalyzed enamide&#8208;alkyne cycloisomerization reaction&#160;is developed to access the tricyclic cores in a simple way, which further serve as an advanced platform for the divergent enantioselective collective total syntheses of five&#160;  Lycopodium  alkaloids, belonging to three different structural types, in a concise and protecting group&#8208;free fashion. The key transformations in the second phase include: 1) a transannular reductive Heck cyclization for installation of the azepane ring in fawcettidine, fawcettimine, and lycoposerramine Q; 2) a domino Mukaiyama hydration/Grob fragmentation process for construction of the ten&#8208;membered lactam system in phlegmariurine B; 3) a Fukuyama&#8217;s one&#8208;pot protocol for construction of the 2&#8208;pyridone motif in lycoposerramine R. The newly developed strategy is expected to pave the way to the synthesis of other structurally related  Lycopodium  alkaloids.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Biocatalytic Synthesis of Sustainable Surfactants by Selective Amide Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;alkanoyl&#8208;N&#8208;methylglucamides (MEGAs) are non&#8208;toxic surfactants widely used as commercial ingredients, but more sustainable syntheses towards these compounds are highly desirable. Here, we present a biocatalytic route towards MEGAs and analogues using a truncated carboxylic acid reductase construct tailored for amide bond formation (CARmm&#8208;A). CARmm&#8208;A is capable of selective amide bond formation without the competing esterification reaction observed in lipase catalysed reactions. &#160;A kinase was implemented to regenerate ATP from polyphosphate and by thorough reaction optimisation using design of experiments, the amine concentration needed for amidation was significantly reduced. The wide substrate scope of CARmm&#8208;A was exemplified by the synthesis of 24 commercially relevant amides, including selected examples on a preparative scale. This work establishes acyl&#8208;phosphate mediated chemistry as a highly selective strategy for biocatalytic amide bond formation in the presence of multiple competing alcohol functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Fluoroalkylphosphorylation of Unactivated Alkenes by&#160;Radical&#8211;Mediated Alkoxyphosphine Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel distal radical rearrangement of alkoxyphosphine is developed for the first time and applied to the regioselective radical fluoroalkylphosphorylation of unactivated olefins. By employing a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step reaction of&#160;(bis)homoallylic alcohols&#65292;organophosphine chlorides, and fluoroalkyl iodides under CFL (compact fluorescence light) irradiation, a series of fluoroalkyl&#8208;phosphorylated alkyl iodides and alcohols are easily synthesized by regiospecific installing a phosphonyl onto the inner carbon of terminal olefins and further iodination/hydroxylation. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration undergoes a distinctive radical cyclization/&#946;&#8208;scission on the lone electron pair of phosphorous, resulting in the C&#8208;P bond formation and C&#8208;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Synthesis of Tunicamycin V and Discovery of a Cytostatic DPAGT1 Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A short total synthesis of tunicamycin V (  1  ), a non&#8208;selective phosphotransferase inhibitor, is achieved via a B&#252;chner&#8208;Curtius&#8208;Schlotterbeck type reaction. Tunicamycin V can be synthesized in 15 chemical steps from D&#8208;galactal with 21% overall yield. The established synthetic scheme is operationally very simple and flexible to introduce building blocks of interest. The inhibitory activity of one of the designed analogues  28  against human dolichyl&#8208;phosphate  N  &#8208;acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase 1 (DPAGT1) shows 12.5&#8208;times greater than  1  . While tunicamycins are cytotoxic molecules with a low selectivity, the novel analogue  28  displays selective cytostatic activity against breast cancer cell lines including a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;containing molecules are mostly derived from ammonia (NH  3  ). Ammonia activation has been demonstrated for single transition metal centers as well as for low&#8208;valent main group species. Phosphinidenes, mono&#8208;valent phosphorus species, can be stabilized by phosphines, giving so&#8208;called phosphanylidenephosphoranes of the type RP(PR&#8217;  3  ). We demonstrate the facile, metal&#8208;free NH  3  activation using ArP(PMe  3  ), affording for the first time isolable secondary aminophosphines ArP(H)NH  2  . DFT studies reveal that two molecules of NH  3  act in concert to facilitate an NH  3  for PMe  3  exchange. Furthermore, H  2  NR and HNR  2  activation is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here &#8220;sandwich&#8221; diimine&#8208;copper (I) catalysts for C(sp3)&#8208;H bond functionalization. Reactions of alkanes and ethers with trimethylsilyldiazomethane, ethyl diazoacetate, and trifluoromethyl&#8208;diazomethane have been demonstrated. We also report C(sp3)&#8208;H bond methylation, benzylation, and diphenylmethylation by diazomethane, phenyldiazomethanes, and diphenyldiazomethane. These reactions are rare examples of base&#8208;metal catalyzed, intermolecular C(sp3)&#8208;H functionalizations by employing unactivated diazocompounds. Electrophilicity and unique steric environment of &#8220;sandwich&#8221;&#8208;copper catalysts are likely reasons for their catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Optical organosilanes have been demonstrated as versatile chiral reagents in synthetic chemistry since Sommer and Corriu&#8217;s early seminal contributions. Among those charming silicon&#8208;containing chiral architectures, monohydrosilane, bearing a Si&#8211;H bond on the silicon center, hold its unique position due to its facile transformations via stereospecific Si&#8208;carbon or Si&#8208;heteroatom bond formation reactions. In addition, those compounds have also been leveraged as chiral reagents for alcohol resolution, chiral auxiliaries, mechanism probes, as well as potential optoelectronic materials. This minireview comprehensively summarizes the synthesis and synthetic applications of the silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilane, particularly the advances in transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of this class of functional molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>PdFe Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Metallene for N2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdFe1 single&#8208;atom alloy metallene is demonstrated as an effective and robust catalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), delivering an NH3 yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE). Combined theoretical computations and operando XAS/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N2 activation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and high electrocatalytic stability.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys hold great promise for electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), while the comprehensive experimental/theoretical investigations of SAAs for the NRR are still missing. Herein, PdFe1 single&#8208;atom alloy metallene, in which the Fe single atoms are confined on a Pd metallene support, is first developed as an effective and robust NRR electrocatalyst, delivering exceptional NRR performance with an NH3 yield of 111.9&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1, a Faradaic efficiency of 37.8&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V (RHE), as well as a long&#8208;term stability for 100&#8197;h electrolysis. In&#8208;depth mechanistic investigations by theoretical computations and operando X&#8208;ray absorption/Raman spectroscopy indentify Pd&#8208;coordinated Fe single atoms as active centers to enable efficient N2 activation via N2&#8208;to&#8208;Fe &#963;&#8208;donation, reduced protonation energy barriers, suppressed hydrogen evolution and excellent thermodynamic stability, thus accounting for the high activity, selectivity and stability of PdFe1 for the NRR.

         <title>Supramolecular Rotaxane&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Modal Probes for Cancer Biomarker Imaging**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rotaxane&#8208;based platform is introduced for the design of multi&#8208;modality molecular imaging probes. Cooperative capture synthesis with architectural control is used to make viable cancer&#8208;specific imaging agents based on molecularly interlocked rotaxanes that feature radiometal ion complexes for positron emission tomography imaging, fluorescent probes for optical detection, and small&#8208;molecules or monoclonal antibodies for tumour targeting.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules present opportunities to construct therapeutic drugs and diagnostic imaging agents but harnessing supramolecular chemistry to make biologically active probes in water is a challenge. Here, we describe a rotaxane&#8208;based approach to synthesise radiolabelled proteins and peptides for molecular imaging of cancer biomarkers in vivo. Host&#8211;guest chemistry using &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208; and cucurbit[6]uril&#8208;catalysed cooperative capture synthesis produced gallium&#8208;68 or zirconium&#8208;89 radiolabelled metallo[4]rotaxanes. Photochemical conjugation to trastuzumab led to a viable positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. The rotaxane architecture can be tuned to accommodate different radiometal ion complexes, other protein&#8208; or peptide&#8208;based drugs, and fluorophores for optical detection. This technology provides a platform to explore how mechanical bonding can improve drug delivery, enhance tumour specificity, control radiotracer pharmacokinetics, and reduce dosimetry.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent approach to the formation of polysubstituted biscyclopropyl methanol derivatives was developed as a new entry to the formation of skipped dienal possessing two distant quaternary carbon stereocenters within acyclic systems with excellent diastereoselectivity







Abstract
The diastereoselective double carbometalation reaction of cyclopropenes provides, in a single&#8208;pot operation, two &#969;&#8208;ene&#8208;[1,1]&#8208;bicyclopropyl ester derivatives. One regioisomer then undergoes a Pd&#8208;catalyzed addition of aryl iodide to provide skipped dienes possessing several distant stereocenters including two congested quaternary carbon centers with excellent diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8211;carbon bond insertion of &#945;&#8208;diazo esters into secondary benzylic halides is reported. Herein, the carbon chain elongation of acyclic benzylic halides and ring expansion in cyclic versions were realized to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;halo carbonyl compounds with excellent diastereoselectivity. Computational study charted a specific mechanism involving the Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cleavage/re&#8208;formation of a carbon&#8211;halogen bond.







Abstract
We report a formal carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) bond insertion via the reaction of secondary benzylic halides (fluorides, chlorides, and bromides) with &#945;&#8208;diazo esters catalyzed by Lewis acid catalysts. Secondary benzylic halides underwent elongation to afford &#945;,&#946;&#8208;diaryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;haloesters diastereoselectively. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the present formal C&#8722;C bond insertion was the result of Lewis acid&#8208;promoted cleavage and the re&#8208;formation of a carbon&#8211;halogen bond and that the aryl&#8208;migration step determined the diastereoselectivity. Various diarylmethyl halides and &#945;&#8208;diazo esters were applicable to this reaction system. In addition, ring expansion in cyclic benzylic chlorides was accomplished.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Parameritannin&#8197;A2, a Branched Epicatechin Tetramer with Two Double Linkages</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By overcoming steric constraints, a stereoselective total synthesis of the branched tetramer parameritannin&#8197;A2 was achieved. As a key step of the approach, a Pummerer/Friedel&#8211;Crafts cascade enabled the de novo construction of the middle flavan unit for its regioselective linkage to the bottom flavan unit.







Abstract
The first total synthesis of parameritannin&#8197;A2 (1), a branched epicatechin (EC) tetramer is reported. The &#8220;phloroglucinol trick&#8221; was used to circumvent two synthetic issues encountered when assembling four EC units, namely, the steric constraint and the formation of the C4&#8722;C6 interflavan linkage. As a substructure of the middle EC unit, phloroglucinol enabled the single&#8208;step assembly of two EC units (top and side) through A&#8208;type linkages. The middle EC unit was constructed by conducting a newly developed three&#8208;carbon flavan annulation via a Pummerer/Friedel&#8211;Crafts cascade reaction to furnish a trimeric intermediate bearing a thio&#8208;leaving group at C4 position, which allowed the final installation of the bottom EC unit.

         <title>Asymmetric Double Hydroxycarbonylation of Alkynes to Chiral Succinic Acids Enabled by Palladium Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining two distinct phosphine ligands, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes to chiral succinic acids was achieved in a one&#8208;pot manner. The alkyne carbonylation was dictated by the achiral monophosphine to afford branched acrylic acids, while the resulting intermediates further underwent Pd/chiral bisphosphine&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydroxycarbonylation.







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric double hydroxycarbonylation of terminal alkynes was developed by using relay catalysis, providing a highly efficient route to chiral succinic acids (41 examples, 76&#8211;94&#8201;%, 94&#8211;99&#8201;% ee). Key to success was the combinatorial use of a Pd precursor with two distinct phosphine ligands in one pot. The synthetic utilities of this protocol were showcased in the facile synthesis of key intermediates for chiral pharmaceuticals.

         <title>A Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Small&#8208;Molecule Metal&#8208;Carrying Prochelator: A Novel Prodrug Design Strategy for Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stimulus&#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator was developed as a novel strategy for the prodrug design of metal complexes. The metal&#8208;carrying prochelator can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation reaction for the in situ synthesis of a bioactive metal complex for targeted therapy.







Abstract
Selective activation of prodrugs is an important approach to reduce the side effects of disease treatment. We report a prodrug design concept for metal complexes, termed &#8220;metal&#8208;carrying prochelator&#8221;, which can co&#8208;carry a metal ion and chelator within a single small&#8208;molecule compound and remain inert until it undergoes a specifically triggered intramolecular chelation to synthesize a bioactive metal complex in situ for targeted therapy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we designed a H2O2&#8208;responsive small&#8208;molecule prochelator, DPBD, based on the strong chelator diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and copper. DPBD can carry Cu2+ (DPBD&#8208;Cu) and respond to elevated H2O2 levels in tumor cells by releasing DTC, which rapidly chelates Cu2+ from DPBD&#8208;Cu affording a DTC&#8211;copper complex with high cytotoxicity, realizing potent antitumor efficacy with low systemic toxicity. Thus, with its unique intramolecularly triggered activation mechanism, this concept based on a small&#8208;molecule metal&#8208;carrying prochelator can help in the prodrug design of metal complexes.

         <dc:description>
Using a Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photocatalyst a rapid trans to cis isomerization for a range of pharmacological agents based&#8208;on an alkene core is achieved. These include combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4), a clinical candidate in oncology, and resveratrol derivatives, allowing their selective in cellulo activation. This provides a new platform for the rapid in situ activation of unmodified pharmacological agents.







Abstract
A Ru(bpy)3Cl2 photocatalyst is applied to the rapid trans to cis isomerization of a range of alkene&#8208;containing pharmacological agents, including combretastatin A&#8208;4 (CA&#8208;4), a clinical candidate in oncology, and resveratrol derivatives, switching their configuration from inactive substances to potent cytotoxic agents. Selective in cellulo activation of the CA&#8208;4 analog Res&#8208;3M is demonstrated, along with its potent cytotoxicity and inhibition of microtubule dynamics.

         <title>Actuation of Liquid Crystalline Elastomers at or Below Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomers are reported with actuation temperatures at or below ambient temperature are prepared via a sequential thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8211;ene reaction scheme based on the monomer C6BAPE. The reduction in actuation temperature is accompanied by an increase in actuation rate (&gt;6&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1). The low actuation temperatures achieved are promising for use in many applications at ambient temperature or below.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are an emerging class of material actuators. LCE undergo macroscopic dimensional changes when subjected to a stimulus. The large stimuli&#8208;response of LCE is associated with thermotropic disruption of order. Historically, comparatively high temperatures are required to disrupt orientation in LCE to achieve meaningful work output. Here, we introduce an approach to prepare LCE via thiol&#8208;Michael/thiol&#8211;ene reactions that actuate at or below ambient temperature. Alignment was imparted to the LCE by mechanical alignment and 3D printing. The LCE materials detailed here achieve strains of 40&#8201;% with a maximum deformation rate of 6.5&#8201;%&#8201;&#176;C&#8722;1. The functional utility of the tunability of the thermotropic response of these materials is illustrated in reconfiguration triggered via body heat and sequential actuation of a multi&#8208;material element.

         <title>Traceless Benzylic C&#8722;H Amination via Bifunctional N&#8208;Aminopyridinium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H amination chemistry via traceless bifunctional nitrogen activation is reported. Sequential C&#8722;H aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling with aryl boronic acids affords the products of aryl nitrene insertion into C&#8722;H bonds. These products are unavailable by direct nitrene insertion due to the intrinsic instability of aryl nitrenes. The described method can be applied in the context of pharmacologically active molecules.







Abstract
C&#8722;H amination reactions provide the opportunity to streamline the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing organic small molecules. The impact of intermolecular C&#8722;H amination methods, however, is currently limited the frequent requirement for the amine precursors to bear activating groups, such as N&#8208;sulfonyl substituents, that are both challenging to remove and not useful synthetic handles for subsequent derivatization. Here, we introduce traceless nitrogen activation for C&#8722;H amination&#8212;which enables application of selective C&#8722;H amination chemistry to the preparation of diverse N&#8208;functionalized products&#8212;via sequential benzylic C&#8722;H N&#8208;aminopyridylation followed by Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling with aryl boronic acids. Unlike many C&#8722;H amination reactions that provide access to protected amines, the current method installs an easily diversifiable synthetic handle that serves as a lynchpin for C&#8722;H amination, deaminative N&#8722;N functionalization sequences.

         <title>Layered Organic Metal Chalcogenides (OMCs): From Bulk to Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, organic metal chalcogenides are a type of newly emerging 2D materials, which are exquisitely desired but impossible to realize by traditional methods for the synthesis of 2D materials. This Minireview gives a perspective on the structural design of bulk precursors, exfoliation methods, applications, and discusses research directions based on recently published work.







Abstract
The modification of inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with organic functional motifs is in high demand for the optimization of their properties, but it is still a daunting challenge. Organic metal chalcogenides (OMCs) are a type of newly emerging 2D materials, with metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, these materials are extremely desirable but impossible to realize by traditional methods. Both the inorganic layer and organic functional motifs of OMCs are highly designable and thus provide this type of 2D materials with enormous variety in terms of their structure and properties. This Minireview aims to review the latest developments in OMCs and their bulk precursors. Firstly, the structure types of the bulk precursors for OMCs are introduced. Second, the synthesis and applications of OMC 2D materials in photoelectricity, catalysis, sensors, and energy transfer are explored. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for future research on OMCs are discussed.

         <title>Boosting Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence of Lanthanide in Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskites via Breakdown of the Local Site Symmetry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, lanthanide (Ln3+)&#8208;doped near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emitting double perovskites (DPs) suffer from low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we develop a new class of NIR&#8208;emitting DPs based on Ln3+&#8208;doped Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6. Benefiting from the Na+&#8208;induced breakdown of local site symmetry in the Cs2AgBiCl6  DPs, effective NIR emissions of Ln3+&#160;are realized through Bi3+&#160;sensitization. Specifically, 7.3&#8208;fold and 362.9&#8208;fold enhanced NIR emissions of Yb3+&#160;and Er3+  are achieved in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6  DPs relative to those in Na&#8208;free Cs2AgBiCl6  counterparts, respectively. The optimal absolute NIR PLQYs for Yb3+  and Er3+  in Cs2Ag0.2Na0.8BiCl6  DPs are determined to be 19.0% and 4.3%, respectively. Raman spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations verify the sublattice distortion in Cs2(Na/Ag)BiCl6  DPs via Na+  doping. These findings provide fundamental insights into the design of efficient NIR&#8208;emitting Ln3+&#8208;doped DPs for versatile optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Planar Five&#8208;Membered Aromatic Ring Stabilized by Only Two &#960;&#8208;Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many chemicals known today are partially or fully aromatic, since a ring framework experiences additional stabilization through the delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electrons. While aromatic rings with equal numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons and ring atoms such as benzene are particularly stable, those with the minimally required two &#960;&#8208;electrons are very rare and yet remain limited to three&#8208; and four&#8208;membered rings if not stabilized in the coordination sphere of heavy metals. Here we report the facile synthesis of a dipotassium cyclopentagallene, a unique example of a five&#8208;membered aromatic ring stabilized by only two &#960;&#8208;electrons. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a planar Ga5 ring with almost equal gallium&#8211;gallium bond lengths, which together with computational and spectroscopic data confirms its aromatic character. Our results prove that aromatic stabilization goes far beyond what has previously been assumed as minimum &#960;&#8208;electron count in a five&#8208;atom ring fragment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report the first total syntheses of tricyclic mutanobactins A and B, lipopeptides incorporating a thiazepanone, isolated from  Streptococcus mutans  , a member of the human oral microbiome. A rapid, solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) based route delivers these natural products from a cascade of cyclization reactions. This versatile process was also employed in a streamlined synthesis of mutanobactin D.

         <title>Chemoselective Oxyfunctionalization of Functionalized Benzylic Compounds with a Manganese Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whilst allowing for easy access to synthetically versatile motifs and for modification of bioactive molecules, the chemoselective benzylic oxidation reactions of functionalized alkyl arenes remain challenging. Reported in this study is a new non&#8208;heme Mn catalyst stabilized by a bipiperidine&#8208;based tetradentate ligand, which enables methylene oxidation of benzylic compounds by H2O2, showing high activity and excellent chemoselectivity under mild conditions. The protocol tolerates an unprecedentedly wide range of functional groups, including carboxylic acid and derivatives, ketone, cyano, azide, acetate, sulfonate, alkyne, amino acid, and amine units, thus providing a low&#8208;cost, more sustainable and robust pathway for the facile synthesis of ketones, increase of complexity of organic molecules, and late&#8208;stage modification of drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Directing the Morphology, Packing, and Properties of Chiral MetalOrganic Frameworks by Cation Exchange</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We show that metal&#8208;organic frameworks, based on tetrahedral pyridyl ligands, can be used as a morphological and structural template to form a series of isostructural crystals having different metal ions and properties. An iterative crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal conversion has been demonstrated by consecutive cation exchanges. The primary manganese&#8208;based crystals are characterized by an uncommon space group (  P622  ). The packing includes chiral channels that can mediate the cation exchange, as indicated by energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy on microtome&#8208;sectioned crystals. The observed cation exchange is in excellent agreement with the Irving&#8208;Williams series (Mn &lt; Fe &lt; Co &lt; Ni &lt; Cu &gt; Zn) associated with the relative stability of the resulting coordination nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the metal cation controls the optical and magnetic properties. The crystals maintain their morphology, allowing a quantitative comparison of their properties at both the ensemble and single&#8208;crystal level.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CH4 via Pd&#7519;+&#8208;assisted Hydrodeoxygenation over CeO2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, noble metal doped two&#8208;dimensional metal oxide nanosheets are designed to realize selective CO  2  photoreduction to CH  4  . As a prototype, Pd&#8208;doped CeO  2  nanosheets are fabricated, where the active sites of Pd  &#948;+  (2 &lt; &#948; &lt; 4) and Ce  3+  &#8208;O  v  are revealed by quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra and in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra. Moreover, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectra of D  2  O photodissociation and desorption verify the existence of the Pd&#8208;OD bond, implying that Pd  &#948;+  sites can participate in water oxidation to deliver H* species for facilitating the protonation of the intermediates. Furthermore, theoretical calculations suggest the Pd doping could regulate the formation energy barrier of the key intermediates CHO* and CH  3  O*, thus making CO  2  reduction to CH  4  become the favorable process. Accordingly, Pd&#8208;doped CeO  2  nanosheets achieve nearly 100% CH  4  selectivity of CO  2  photoreduction, with the raising CH  4  evolution rate of 41.6 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208;crystal Diversity of Surface Barriers in Zeolites on Mass Transport by Using Super&#8208;Resolution Microimaging of Time&#8208;Resolved Guest Profiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of nanoporous crystalline materials are closely related to mass transfer of guest molecules. However, the fundamental knowledge of mass transfer, and in particular the surface barriers controlled by the permeation of guest molecules through the external surfaces of materials, is still incomplete. The diversity of surface permeability at single crystal level, caused by the varying origins of surface transport resistance, hinders the rational materials design and deserves deep understanding. Here, we proposed to probe the molecular transport in single zeolite crystals with fluorescent 4&#8208;(4&#8208;diethylaminostyryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylpyridinium iodide (DAMPI) using super&#8208;resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). It showed that both the inter&#8208; and intra&#8208;crystal diversity of surface barriers could be monitored by detecting the diffusion behaviors on the center and surface planes in single crystals. This adds a new perspective for studying the origins of the surface barriers as well as the molecular transport mechanisms in nanoporous materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An Ultrastable 155&#8208;Nuclei Silver Nanocluster Protected by Thiacalix[4]arene and Cyclohexanethiol for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiacalix[4]arenes have emerged as a family of macrocyclic ligands to protect metal nanoparticles, but it remains a great challenge to solve the mystery of their structures at the atomic level, especially for those larger than 2 nm. Here, we report the largest known mixed&#8208;valence silver nanocluster [Ag155(CyS)40(TC4A)5Cl2] (Ag155) protected by deprotonated cyclohexanethiol (CySH) and macrocyclic ligand p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylthiacalix[4]arene (H4TC4A). Its single crystal structure consists of a metallic core of four concentric shells, Ag13@Ag42@Ag30@Ag70, lined with a protective organic skin of 40 CyS&#8211; and 5 TC4A4&#8211; and 2 Cl&#8211;. Ag155 manifests an unusual pseudo&#8208;5&#8208;fold symmetry dictated by the intrinsic metal atom packing and the regioselective distribution of mixed protective ligands. This work not only reveals a macrocyclic ligand effect on the formation of a large silver nanocluster but also provides a new structural archetype for comprehensively perceiving their interface and metal kernel structures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This work develops the Polyolefin Active&#8208;Ester Exchange (PACE) process to afford well&#8208;defined polyolefin&#8208;polyvinyl block copolymers.   &#945;   &#8208;Diimine Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed   olefin polymerizations were investigated through in&#8208;depth kinetic studies in comparison to an analog to establish the critical design that facilitates catalyst activation. Simple transformations lead to a diversity of functional groups forming polyolefin macroinitiators or macro&#8208;mediators for various subsequent controlled polymerization techniques. Preparation of block copolymers with different architectures, molecular weights, and compositions was demonstrated with ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP), nitroxide&#8208;mediated polymerization (NMP), and photoiniferter reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PI&#8208;RAFT). The significant difference in the properties of polyolefin&#8208;polyacrylamide block copolymers was harnessed to carry out polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) and study the nanostructure behaviors.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Dependent Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Helical Assemblies Based on Tartaric Acid&#8208;Derived Acylhydrazones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Helical assemblies based on chiral tartaric acid derived acylhydrazones intriguingly exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission through modulation between excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and excimer emissions. By virtue of chirality transfer during the self&#8208;assembly process, an unprecedented ExD inverted or ON/OFF circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switch was developed. This type of advanced CPL material can potentially be applicable in higher&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and encryption.







Abstract
Here, we combined the merits of emergent excitation&#8208;dependent (ExD) emission and circularly polarized luminescence to develop an excitation&#8208;dependent circularly polarized luminescence (ExD CPL) material showing unique features. A series of acylhydrazones based on a chiral tartaric skeleton was designed and found to self&#8208;assemble into helical nanostructures through non&#8208;covalent bonds. The helical assemblies showed ExD CPL due to the cooperation of chirality transfer and excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT). Remarkably, not only the emission wavelength could be tuned by the excitation wavelength but the handedness of CPL could be modulated in an inverted or ON/OFF manner as well, thus leading to the first example of an ExD inverted or ON/OFF switchable CPL system. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations were carried out to explain the inversion of ExD CPL. This work provided a new insight into the unprecedented handedness controllable ExD CPL, which showcased a new paradigm of the advanced CPL materials.

         <title>What Is the Smallest Zeolite That Could Be Synthesized?**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermodynamic analysis and molecular simulations indicate that zeolites as small as 4&#8197;nm can be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Compact size&#8208;dependent isomers outcompete zeolites at smaller sizes.







Abstract
Zeolites with a few unit cells are promising as catalyst and adsorbents. The quest to synthesize the smallest zeolites has recently resulted in 4 to 8&#8197;nm nanozeolites, about 2 to 4 unit cells. These findings pose the question of what is the smallest zeolite that could be obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. Here we address this question using molecular simulations and thermodynamic analysis. The simulations predict that amorphous precursors as small as 4&#8197;nm can crystallize zeolites, in agreement with the experiments. We find that interfacial forces dominate the structure of smaller particles, resulting in size&#8208;dependent compact isomers that have ring and pore distributions different from open framework zeolites. The instability of zeolites smaller than 3&#177;0.5&#8197;nm precludes a classical mechanism of nucleation from solution or through assembly of small nanoslabs.

         <title>Unexpected White Phosphorus (P4) Activation Modes with Silylene&#8208;Substituted o&#8208;Carboranes and Access to an Isolable 1,3&#8208;Diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene</title>

         <dc:description>
New metal&#8208;free white phosphorus (P4) activation modes have been observed using divalent SiII atoms bonded to a 1,2&#8208;dicarborane scaffold: while two molar equivalents of the silylene&#8208;phosphine 1 are capable of co&#8208;activating one molecule of white phosphorus, yielding the P5&#8208;chain containing species 2, the degradation of P4 using the bis(silylene) analogue 3 affords the first isolable 1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene 4 with a Si=P&#8722;Si=P delocalized skeleton.







Abstract
New types of metal&#8208;free white phosphorus (P4) activation are reported. While the phosphine&#8208;silylene&#8208;substituted dicarborane 1, CB&#8208;SiP (CB=ortho&#8208;C,C&#8242;&#8208;C2B10H10, Si=PhC(tBuN)2Si, P=P[N(tBu)CH2]2), activates white phosphorus in a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio to yield the P5&#8208;chain containing species 2, the analogous bis(silylene)&#8208;substituted compound 3, CB&#8208;Si2, reacts with P4 in the molar ratio of 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 to furnish the first isolable 1,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;2,4&#8208;disilabutadiene (Si=P&#8722;Si=P&#8208;containing) compound 4. For the latter reaction, two intermediates having a CB&#8208;Si2P4 and CB&#8208;Si2P2 core could be observed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The compounds 2 and 4 were characterized including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Their electronic structures and mechanisms were investigated by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>4&#8208;Aminothiophenol Photodimerization Without Plasmons**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photodimerization of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) is demonstrated to occur in the absence of any plasmonic mediators, previously considered a paradigm for driving this type of photo&#8208;oxidation. An alternative pathway, based on direct activation of singlet oxygen, is demonstrated. These results provide new insights in light&#8208;driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.







Abstract
The photodimerization of 4&#8208;aminothiophenol (PATP) into 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimercaptobenzene (DMAB) has been extensively utilized as a paradigm reaction to probe the role of surface plasmons in nanoparticle&#8208;mediated light&#8208;driven processes. Here I report the first observation of the PATP&#8208;to&#8208;DMAB photoreaction in the absence of any plasmonic mediators. The reaction was observed to occur with different kinetics either for PATP adsorbed on non&#8208;plasmonic nanoparticles (TiO2, ZnO, SiO2) or deposited as macroscopic droplets. Confocal microRaman spectroscopy enabled to investigate the reaction progress in different plasmon&#8208;free contexts, either aerobic or anaerobic, suggesting a new interpretation of the photodimerization process, based on direct laser&#8208;induced activation of singlet oxygen species. These results provide new insights in light&#8208;driven redox processes, elucidating the role of sample morphology, light and oxygen.

         <title>Delicate and Fast Photochemical Surface Modification of 2D Photoresponsive Organosilicon Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline 2D Si&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film was prepared with photoresponsive hexamethyltrisilane groups anchored to its surface. The fluorescence of the resulting film was turned on by UV light irradiation which causes a superhydrophobic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophilic transformation. Fluorescent patterns, such as QR codes and logos, could be easily etched onto the MOF film endowing it with luminescent and hydrophilic patterns.







Abstract
Photoresponsive arylsilanes have been fascinating molecules for decades because of their unique photophysical characteristics and surface chemistry. Here we report the synthesis and fabrication of a crystalline two&#8208;dimensional trisilyl metal&#8211;organic framework (TSiMOF) orderly installed with the classical photoresponsive hexamethyltrisilane groups on the surface. Irradiated by UV light under air in minutes the fluorescence of the TSiMOF is turned on simultaneously with an intriguing surface transformation from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic. Thus, multifarious luminescent and hydrophilic patterns including logos, characters and Quick Response codes, etc. with good resolution are readily generated on the facilely fabricated TSiMOF film. The mechanism of this transformation is revealed by control experiments that the superficial trimethylsilyl groups suffering photochemical oxidation have been converted to hydroxyl groups.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Guided Stepwise Assembly of High&#8208;Nuclearity Lanthanide Hydroxide Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deliberately introduced anions guide the hierarchical assembly of the series of high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide hydroxide cluster intermediates Er12, Er34, and Er48 toward the complete sodalite cage of Er60,.







Abstract
The ability to construct complex molecular architectures with precise control is critical for realizing molecule&#8208;based materials and functions. Using the assembly of a 60&#8208;metal complex of ErIII with histidine as an example, we demonstrate the rational assembly of otherwise synthetically elusive polynuclear lanthanide hydroxide clusters directed by the combined set of I&#8722; and CO32&#8722; as templates. We succeeded in the stepwise transformation starting from Er12 to Er60 by way of two key intermediates Er34 and Er48. The Er12, Er34, and Er48 core motifs represent respectively 1/6, 1/2, and 3/4 of the complete sodalite cage of Er60. This work, representing a rare example of rationally constructing high&#8208;nuclearity lanthanide clusters guided by judiciously chosen templates, is expected to stimulate more future efforts for the controllable synthesis of complex molecular or supramolecular architectures with unprecedented structural sophistication and possibly useful properties.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Operando spectroscopy&#160;captures the dynamic behavior of ceria&#8208;supported Pd single atoms, clusters and nanoparticles during CO oxidation. In the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200434),&#160;Emiel&#8197;J.&#8197;M. Hensen et&#8197;al.&#160;elucidate the catalytic role of different Pd species using a combination of in situ spectroscopy with transient and steady&#8208;state kinetic analysis. Highly dispersed Pd&#8208;oxo species and interfacial Pd sites catalyze low&#8208;temperature CO oxidation, while metallic Pd contributes to the activity at elevated temperature.

         <title>Programming Receptor Clustering with DNA Probabilistic Circuits for Enhanced Natural Killer Cell Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA probabilistic circuits were engineered to precisely regulate artificial receptor clustering on the cell membrane, which could allow modulation of the natural killer cell&#8211;cancer cell interactions to promote efficient cancer cell killing. This study provides an effective tool for precise control over cellular recognition and cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.







Abstract
Developing strategies to enhance the recognition ability of immune cells is important to the success of cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we report programming receptor clustering on membrane with DNA probabilistic circuits for enhanced immune cell recognition. By designing the circuit output to activate receptors for binding to adjacent receptors, we can engineer DNA probabilistic circuits for programmable regulation of receptor clustering. The generated receptor clusters show higher binding affinity to target cancer cells and improved membrane&#8208;anchoring stability compared with monomers. We demonstrate that programming receptor clustering could allow to modulate the recognition capability of natural killer cells and control natural killer cell&#8211;cancer cell interactions to promote efficient cancer cell killing. This work provides insights for precise control over cellular recognition and opens new opportunities for the development of cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Cobalt(III)/Chiral Carboxylic Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides via C&#8722;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantioselective synthesis of benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides has been achieved using an achiral cobalt(III) catalyst and a pseudo&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric H8&#8208;binaphthyl chiral carboxylic acid. The hybrid catalytic system enables a rapid access to benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides from readily available sulfoximines and dioxazolones with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Among sulfoximine derivatives containing a chiral sulfur center, benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides are important for applications in medicinal chemistry. Here, we report that the combination of an achiral cobalt(III) catalyst and a pseudo&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric H8&#8208;binaphthyl chiral carboxylic acid enables the asymmetric synthesis of benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides from sulfoximines and dioxazolones via enantioselective C&#8722;H bond cleavage. With the optimized protocol, benzothiadiazine&#8208;1&#8208;oxides with several functional groups can be accessed with high enantioselectivity.

         <title>Catalytic Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Protonation for the Synthesis of Chiral Allenes: Synergistic Effect of the Counterion and Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pudovik addition/[1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement mediated by a chiral ScIII/N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide complex led to axially chiral trisubstituted allenes with a diarylphosphinate moiety. A synergistic effect of the counterion and water enabled regio&#8208; and enantioselective protonation after [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. Intramolecular dearomatization of N&#8208;Ph&#8208;substituted products gave bridged polycyclic architectures through stereospecific Himbert reaction.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective tandem Pudovik addition/[1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;alkynylketoamides with diarylphosphine oxides was achieved with a N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/ScIII complex as the catalyst. This protocol features broad substrate scope, high regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity, and good functional&#8208;group compatibility, providing a straightforward route to various trisubstituted allenes with a diarylphosphinate functionality in good yields with high enantioselectivities (up to 97&#8201;% yield, 96&#8201;% ee). Control experiments and theoretical calculations revealed that a synergistic effect of the counterion and water was critical for the regio&#8208; and enantioselective protonation after [1,2]&#8208;phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. The synthetic utility of this methodology was demonstrated by the conversion of products into complex bridged polycyclic architectures through intramolecular dearomatizing arene/allene cycloaddition.

         <title>Catalytic Decomposition of Long&#8208;Chain Olefins to Propylene via Isomerization&#8208;Metathesis Using Latent Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene&#8208;Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ruthenium temperature&#8208;activated, thermally stable olefin metathesis (ethenolysis) catalysts are reported for the catalytic decomposition of long&#8208;chain olefins such as 1&#8208;octadecene or methyl oleate into propylene. The reaction occurs via isomerization&#8208;metathesis using the (RuHCl)(CO)(PPh3)3 isomerization co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
One of the most exciting scientific challenges today is the catalytic degradation of non&#8208;biodegradable polymers into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks. The mild pyrolysis of polyolefins, including high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), results in pyrolysis oils containing long&#8208;chain olefins as major products. In this paper, novel bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene ruthenium (BICAAC&#8722;Ru) temperature&#8208;activated latent olefin metathesis catalysts, which can be used for catalytic decomposition of long&#8208;chain olefins to propylene are reported. These thermally stable catalysts show significantly higher selectivity to propylene at a reaction temperature of 75&#8201;&#176;C compared to second generation Hoveyda&#8211;Grubbs or CAAC&#8722;Ru catalysts under ethenolysis conditions. The conversion of long&#8208;chain olefins (e.g., 1&#8208;octadecene or methyl oleate) to propylene via isomerization&#8208;metathesis is performed by using a (RuHCl)(CO)(PPh3)3 isomerization co&#8208;catalyst. The reactions can be carried out at a BICAAC&#8722;Ru catalyst loading as low as 1&#8197;ppm at elevated reaction temperature (75&#8201;&#176;C). The observed turnover number and turnover frequency are as high as 55&#8201;000 and 10&#8201;000&#8197;molpropylene&#8201;molcatalyst&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively.

         <title>Trap Inlaid Cationic Hybrid Composite Material for Efficient Segregation of Toxic Chemicals from Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid composite aerogel material has been systematically fabricated by encapsulating an active nanosized cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron in a stable hierarchical porous metal&#8211;organic gel matrix. The hybrid aerogel demonstrated efficient and highly selective extraction of metal&#8208;based toxic oxoanions in both batch and dynamic column exchange experiments from simulated industrial wastewater and natural ground water systems.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;based oxoanions are potentially toxic pollutants that can cause serious water pollution. Therefore, the segregation of such species has recently received significant research attention. Even though several adsorbents have been employed for effective management of chemicals, their limited microporous nature along with non&#8208;monolithic applicability has thwarted their large&#8208;scale real&#8208;time application. Herein, we developed a unique anion exchangeable hybrid composite aerogel material (IPcomp&#8208;6), integrating a stable cationic metal&#8211;organic polyhedron with a hierarchically porous metal&#8211;organic gel. The composite scavenger demonstrated a highly selective and very fast segregation efficiency for various hazardous oxoanions such as, HAsO42&#8722;, SeO42&#8722;, ReO4&#8722;, CrO42&#8722;, MnO4&#8722;, in water, in the presence of 100&#8208;fold excess of other coexisting anions. The material was able to selectively eliminate trace HAsO42&#8722; even at low concentration to well below the AsV limit in drinking water defined by WHO.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Driven Highly Selective Catalytic Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Towards Tunable Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient photocatalyst has been developed for the oxidation of a key biomass&#8208;derived intermediate, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural, by anchoring a Ru complex onto CdS quantum dots. Tunable production of 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid can be achieved with high conversion (&gt;81&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%).







Abstract
Owing to the easy over&#8208;oxidation, it is a promising yet challenging task to explore renewable carbon resources to control the sunlight&#8208;driven selective catalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), producing important chemical feedstocks, namely, less&#8208;oxidized 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) and 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA). Herein, we have developed a photocatalyst by anchoring a Ru complex on CdS quantum dots, which achieves selective oxidation of HMF toward DFF or HMFCA with high conversion (&gt;81&#8201;%) and selectivity (&gt;90&#8201;%), based on the controllable generation of two oxygen radicals under different atmospheres. Such selective conversion can also work well outside the laboratory by using natural sunlight. In particular, the selective production of HMFCA through photocatalytic HMF oxidation is achieved for the first time. More importantly, our photocatalyst is applicable for the selective oxidation of other compounds with hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

         <title>Photocaging of Activity&#8208;Based Ubiquitin Probes via a C&#8208;Terminal Backbone Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocaged cell&#8208;permeable Ub&#8208;PA and diUb&#8208;Dha probes that can be activated on demand to label DUBs in vivo have been developed using a C&#8208;terminal backbone modification strategy. These new Ub&#8208;ABPs are temporally blocked and activated through installing a light&#8208;sensitive group (e.g. nitrobenzyl) at the backbone amide bond of the Ub Gly75 residue.







Abstract
Photocaged, activity&#8208;based ubiquitin (Ub) probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) have been developed for the time&#8208;resolved probing of deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activities, but many Ub&#8208;ABPs are still challenging to photocage because their warheads (e.g. propargylamide (PA) or dehydroalanine (Dha)) are difficult to temporally block and activate. Here, we describe a new C&#8208;terminal backbone modification strategy for the construction of photocaged Ub&#8208;ABPs in which a light&#8208;sensitive group is placed at the backbone amide bond of the Ub Gly75. This strategy enabled the facile generation of cell&#8208;permeable photocaged Ub&#8208;PA and Dha probes that could be activated to capture DUBs after photo&#8208;irradiation, and were used to profile DUBs in cells under specially designed conditions (e.g. in cells experiencing oxidative stress) or DUBs with isopeptide linkage selectivity. This backbone modification strategy is anticipated to provide a general solution for the development of photocaged Ub ABPs bearing any warheads for DUB profiling.

         <title>Site&#8208;Sensitive Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CO over Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermodynamic bottleneck of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is unlocked by the incorporation of twinning planes into normal fcc&#8208;phase Au NPs. A forty&#8208;fold improvement in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity is achieved, with near perfect CO selectivity.







Abstract
We demonstrate a new case of materials&#8211;gene engineering to precisely design photocatalysts with the prescribed properties. Based on theoretical calculations, a phase&#8208;doping strategy was proposed to regulate the pathways of CO2 conversion over Au nanoparticles (NPs) loaded TiO2 photocatalysts. As a result, the thermodynamic bottleneck of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion is successfully unlocked by the incorporation of stable twinning crystal planes into face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase Au NPs. Compared to bare pristine TiO2, the activity results showed that the loading of regular fcc&#8208;Au NPs raised the CO production by 18&#8208;fold but suppressed the selectivity from 84&#8201;% to 75&#8201;%, whereas Au NPs with twinning (110) and (100) facets boosted the activity by nearly 40&#8208;fold and established near unity CO selectivity. This enhancement is shown to originate from a beneficial shift in the surface reactive site energetics arising at the twinned stacking fault, whereby both the CO reaction energy and desorption energy were significantly reduced.

     alt="Site-Sensitive Selective CO2 Photoreduction to CO over Gold Nanoparticles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thermodynamic bottleneck of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion is unlocked by the incorporation of twinning planes into normal &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt;-phase Au NPs. A forty-fold improvement in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction activity is achieved, with near perfect CO selectivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate a new case of materials&#8211;gene engineering to precisely design photocatalysts with the prescribed properties. Based on theoretical calculations, a phase-doping strategy was proposed to regulate the pathways of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion over Au nanoparticles (NPs) loaded TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photocatalysts. As a result, the thermodynamic bottleneck of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion is successfully unlocked by the incorporation of stable twinning crystal planes into face-centered cubic (&lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt;) phase Au NPs. Compared to bare pristine TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the activity results showed that the loading of regular &lt;i&gt;fcc&lt;/i&gt;-Au NPs raised the CO production by 18-fold but suppressed the selectivity from 84&#8201;% to 75&#8201;%, whereas Au NPs with twinning (110) and (100) facets boosted the activity by nearly 40-fold and established near unity CO selectivity. This enhancement is shown to originate from a beneficial shift in the surface reactive site energetics arising at the twinned stacking fault, whereby both the CO reaction energy and desorption energy were significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Separation by Creating Band Bending in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Improved Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A representative metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, was integrated with MoO3 or V2O5. Given their suited work functions and energy levels, band bending of the MOF occurs, giving rise to improved charge separation. Accordingly, the activity of the MOF composites toward photocatalytic H2 production gets considerably enhanced. This is an unprecedented report with evidence on semiconductor&#8208;like band bending of MOFs.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively studied as a class of semiconductor&#8208;like materials in photocatalysis. However, band bending, which plays a crucial role in semiconductor photocatalysis, has not yet been demonstrated in MOF photocatalysts. Herein, a representative MOF, MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, is integrated with the metal oxides (MoO3 and V2O5) that feature appropriate work functions and energy levels to afford the corresponding MOF composites. Surface photovoltage results demonstrate band bending in the MOF composites, which gives rise to the built&#8208;in electric field of MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2, boosting the charge separation. As a result, the MOF composites present 56 and 42&#8197;times higher activities, respectively, compared to the pristine MOF for photocatalytic H2 production. Upon depositing Pt onto the MOF, &#8764;6&#8197;times higher activity is achieved. This work illustrates band bending of MOFs for the first time, supporting their semiconductor&#8208;like nature, which would greatly promote MOF photocatalysis.

         <title>Protein Flexibility and Dissociation Pathway Differentiation Can Explain Onset of Resistance Mutations in Kinases**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gleevec has the same binding affinity yet different dissociation times against Wild&#8208;Type and N368S&#8208;mutated Abl kinase. All&#8208;atom enhanced molecular dynamics simulations explain why.







Abstract
Understanding how mutations render a drug ineffective is a problem of immense relevance. Often the mechanism through which mutations cause drug resistance can be explained purely through thermodynamics. However, the more perplexing situation is when two proteins have the same drug binding affinities but different residence times. In this work, we demonstrate how all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations using recent developments grounded in statistical mechanics can provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for such variances. We discover dissociation mechanisms for the anti&#8208;cancer drug Imatinib (Gleevec) against wild&#8208;type and the N368S mutant of Abl kinase. We show how this point mutation triggers far&#8208;reaching changes in the protein's flexibility and leads to a different, much faster, drug dissociation pathway. We believe that this work marks an efficient and scalable approach to obtain mechanistic insight into resistance mutations in biomolecular receptors that are hard to explain using a structural perspective.

         <title>Porous Organic Salts: Diversifying Void Structures and Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines were self&#8208;assembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding to form porous organic salts. This study demonstrates the advantages of diverse porous organic salts, such as all&#8208;organic, extremely facile preparation methods, diverse void structures and environments, and excellent CO2 adsorption properties.







Abstract
Porous organic salts (POSs) are porous organic materials, in which various aromatic sulfonic acids and amines are regularly self&#8208;assembled by charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonding. POSs exhibit high solubility in highly polar solvents. Therefore, they are prepared via facile recrystallization and exhibit high recyclability. In this study, tetrahedral&#8208;structured tetrasulfonic acid and triphenylmethylamine (TPMA) were combined to construct POSs with rigid diamond networks called diamondoid porous organic salts (d&#8208;POSs). Furthermore, by introducing substituents (e.g., F, Cl, Br, or I) at the para&#8208;positions of benzene rings of TPMA, these substituents were exposed on the void surface of d&#8208;POSs, and their diamond networks were distorted. This induced the formation of a variety of void structures and environments in the d&#8208;POSs, which significantly affected their gas adsorption behavior. In particular, the d&#8208;POS from TPMA substituted by fluorine exhibited very high CO2 adsorption of 182&#8197;mL(STP)&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;atm in all&#8208;organic porous materials.

         <title>Thioester&#8208;Assisted Sortase&#8208;A&#8208;Mediated Ligation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sortase A was found to mediate the efficient and irreversible ligation of a protein/peptide containing a C&#8208;terminal thioester with another protein/peptide bearing an N&#8208;terminal Gly, with broad tolerance for a wide variety of LPxT&#8208;derived sequences. The thioester&#8208;assisted SrtA&#8208;mediated ligation strategy enabled the expedient preparation of proteins bearing various N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminal labels and post&#8208;translationally modified proteins.







Abstract
Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated ligation, a popular method for protein labeling and semi&#8208;synthesis, is limited by its reversibility and dependence on the LPxTG motif, where &#8220;x&#8221; is any amino acid. Here, we report that SrtA can mediate the efficient and irreversible ligation of a protein/peptide containing a C&#8208;terminal thioester with another protein/peptide bearing an N&#8208;terminal Gly, with broad tolerance for a wide variety of LPxT&#8208;derived sequences. This strategy, the thioester&#8208;assisted SrtA&#8208;mediated ligation, enabled the expedient preparation of proteins bearing various N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminal labels, including post&#8208;translationally modified proteins such as the Ser139&#8208;phosphorylated histone H2AX and Lys9&#8208;methylated histone H3, with less dependence on the LPxTG motif. Our study validates the chemical modification of substrates as an effective means of augmenting the synthetic capability of existing enzymatic methods.

         <title>Tunable CHA/AEI Zeolite Intergrowths with A Priori Biselective Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agents: Controlling Enrichment and Implications for Selective Catalytic Reduction of NOx</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled CHA/AEI zeolite intergrowth materials were prepared with ab&#8208;initio&#8208;selected biselective organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs), which were gleaned from high&#8208;throughput simulation analysis of OSDA&#8208;zeolite interactions. Efficient selective catalytic reduction of NOx was performed with the resulting materials. This method guides the preparation of zeolite intergrowths toward more complex structures with unique catalytic properties.

A novel ab initio methodology based on high&#8208;throughput simulations has permitted designing unique biselective organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) that allow the efficient synthesis of CHA/AEI zeolite intergrowth materials with controlled phase compositions. Distinctive local crystallographic ordering of the CHA/AEI intergrowths was revealed at the nanoscale level using integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC STEM). These novel CHA/AEI materials have been tested for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx, presenting an outstanding catalytic performance and hydrothermal stability, even surpassing the performance of the well&#8208;established commercial CHA&#8208;type catalyst. This methodology opens the possibility for synthetizing new zeolite intergrowths with more complex structures and unique catalytic properties.

&lt;p&gt;Controlled CHA/AEI zeolite intergrowth materials were prepared with ab-initio-selected biselective organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs), which were gleaned from high-throughput simulation analysis of OSDA-zeolite interactions. Efficient selective catalytic reduction of NOx was performed with the resulting materials. This method guides the preparation of zeolite intergrowths toward more complex structures with unique catalytic properties.

         <title>Intermolecular Energy Gap&#8208;Induced Formation of High&#8208;Valent Cobalt Species in CoOOH Surface Layer on Cobalt Sulfides for Efficient Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduced intermolecular energy gap between the valence band maximum of CoOOH and the conduction band minimum of Co precursors can promote the formation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#8208;active high&#8208;valent Co4+ species, and enhance the OER performance. This finding provides a new design principle for transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts will undergo surface reconstruction to form active oxyhydroxide&#8208;based hybrids, which are regarded as the &#8220;true&#8208;catalysts&#8221; for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Much effort has been devoted to understanding the surface reconstruction, but little on identifying the origin of the enhanced performance derived from the substrate effect. Herein, we report the electrochemical synthesis of amorphous CoOOH layers on the surface of various cobalt sulfides (CoS&#945;), and identify that the reduced intermolecular energy gap (&#916;inter) between the valence band maximum (VBM) of CoOOH and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of CoS&#945; can accelerate the formation of OER&#8208;active high&#8208;valent Co4+ species. The combination of electrochemical and in situ spectroscopic approaches, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), operando electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman, reveals that Co species in the CoOOH/Co9S8 are more readily oxidized to CoO2/Co9S8 than in CoOOH and other CoOOH/CoS&#945;. This work provides a new design principle for transition metal&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Enantioselective Carbo&#8208;Esterification of Styrenes Enabled by a Perfluoroalkylated&#8208;PyBox Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed perfluoroalkylated&#8208;PyBox ligand and copper catalysis is reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand&#8208;decelerated system, in which the ligand decelerates the reaction, but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of ligand.







Abstract
Chiral lactones are found in many natural products. The reaction of simple alkenes with iodoacetic acid is a powerful method to build lactones, but the enantioselective version of this reaction has not been implemented to date. Herein, we report the efficient catalytic radical enantioselective carbo&#8208;esterification of styrenes enabled by a newly developed CuI&#8208;perfluoroalkylated PyBox system. Simple styrenes have been converted to useful chiral lactones, whose synthetic applications are showcased. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is a rare example of an efficient ligand&#8208;decelerated system, in which the ligand decelerates the reaction, but the reaction is still efficient with reduced amounts of ligand. This uncommon catalytic system may inspire further consideration of the effect of ligands in asymmetric catalysis.

         <title>Adatom Bonding Sites in a Nickel&#8208;Fe3O4(001) Single&#8208;Atom Model Catalyst and O2 Reactivity Unveiled by Surface Action Spectroscopy with Infrared Free&#8208;Electron Laser Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With surface&#8208;sensitive action spectroscopy and DFT simulations, the binding site of Ni single atoms on Fe3O4(001) has been elucidated. These Ni single atoms can activate O2 to superoxide in contrast to bare Fe3O4(001) and subsurface Ni atoms in Fe3O4(001).







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom (SA) catalysis presently receives much attention with its promise to decrease the cost of the active material while increasing the catalyst's performance. However, key details such as the exact location of SA species and their stability are often unclear due to a lack of atomic level information. Here, we show how vibrational spectra measured with surface action spectroscopy (SAS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations can differentiate between different adatom binding sites and determine the location of Ni and Au single atoms on Fe3O4(001). We reveal that Ni and Au adatoms selectively bind to surface oxygen ions which are octahedrally coordinated to Fe ions. In addition, we find that the Ni adatoms can activate O2 to superoxide in contrast to the bare surface and Ni in subsurface positions. Overall, we unveil the advantages of combining SAS and DFT for improving the understanding of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Rapid High&#8208;Contrast Photoreversible Coloration of Surface&#8208;Functionalized N&#8208;Doped TiO2 Nanocrystals for Rewritable Light&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals are synthesized with controllable TiIII stability, displaying reversible color switching between whitish and black upon light illumination and controlled oxidation. They can be used as a rewritable material to produce high&#8208;resolution printing and writing with excellent cyclability, promising for applications such as optical data recording, smart windows, and oxygen sensors.







Abstract
Pristine titanium dioxide (TiO2) changes color from white to black when it is reduced from TiIV to TiIII by photoexcited electrons. However, the black coloration requires substantial light energy to create, and it vanishes instantaneously upon exposure to air. This work reports the synthesis of surface&#8208;functionalized N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals that rapidly change color (i.e., within seconds) from whitish to black under low&#8208;power irradiation with excellent color stability in atmospheric conditions. The N&#8208;doping plays a critical role in promoting the surface&#8208;adsorption of polyol groups to stabilize the TiIII species and accelerate the coloration process. A rewritable paper fabricated using these nanocrystals exhibits excellent writing and erasing reversibility in response to UV irradiation and oxygen exposure. The low&#8208;cost, rapid response, excellent reversibility, and good color stability are vital advantages of N&#8208;doped TiO2 nanocrystals for color&#8208;switching applications.

         <title>Superchaotropic Boron Clusters as Membrane Carriers for the Transport of Hydrophilic Cargos</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Montenegro, Nau and co&#8208;workers abandoned the typical amphiphilic model of membrane transport and proposed a new chaotrope&#8208;mediated transport principle. They utilized superchaotropic boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. This groundbreaking work is a conceptual innovation and may have a profound impact on cell&#8208;biological, neurobiological, physiological, and pharmaceutical studies.







Abstract
Design of membrane transporters is important in pharmaceutical drug delivery and bioimaging. Traditionally, the amphiphilic transport mechanism has governed the design of membrane carriers over the last 50&#8197;years. Recently, Montenegro, Nau and co&#8208;workers discarded classical amphiphilic models and proposed a new transport principle based on the chaotropic effect. They utilized globular boron clusters as membrane carriers to transport a broad range of hydrophilic cargo. Herein, we highlight this recent pioneering work, which is a landmark for membrane transport.

         <title>Tailoring Coordination in Conventional Ether&#8208;based Electrolytes for Reversible Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium (Mg) batteries based on conventional electrolytes are seriously plagued by the formation of the ion&#8208;blocking passivation layer on the Mg metal anode. By tracking the Mg  2+  solvation sheath, this work links the passivation components to the Mg  2+  &#8208;solvents (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, DME) coordination and the consequent thermodynamically unstable DME molecules. On this basis, we propose a methodology to tailor solvation coordination by introducing the additive solvent with extreme electron richness. Oxygen atoms in phosphorus&#8208;oxygen groups compete with that in carbon&#8208;oxygen groups of DME for the coordination with Mg  2+  , thus softening the solvation sheath deformation. Meanwhile, the organophosphorus molecules in the rearranged solvation sheath decompose on the Mg surface, increasing the Mg  2+  transport and electrical resistance by three and one orders of magnitude, respectively. Consequently, the symmetric cells exhibit superior cycling performance of over 600 cycles with low polarization.</dc:description>

         <title>A Deep Eutectic Solvent Thermomorphic Multiphasic System for Biocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applicability of a thermomorphic multiphasic system (TMS) composed of a hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (DES) and an aqueous potassium phosphate buffer with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) phase change for homogeneous biocatalysis was investigated. A lidocaine&#8208;based DES with fatty acid oleic acid as hydrogen bond donor was studied. Phase diagrams were determined and presented within this study. We tested different additional components to the solvent system and observed a decrease of the cloud point of ca. 0.026&#160;&#176;C per concentration unit. Distribution studies were performed revealing a clear distribution of the protein in the aqueous buffer phase (&gt;95%) whereas the hydrophobic substrate and educt accumulate &gt;95% in the DES&#8208;enriched layer. Finally, a horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reduction was performed in a larger scale experiment and the biocatalyst could be recycled by simply removing the DES phase for three recycling runs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Unusual Oxidative Rearrangement Catalyzed by a Divergent Member of the 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Dioxygenase Superfamily during Biosynthesis of Dehydrofosmidomycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The biosynthesis of the natural product dehydrofosmidomycin involves an unusual transformation in which 2&#8208;(trimethylamino)ethylphosphonate is rearranged, desaturated and demethylated by the enzyme DfmD, a divergent member of the 2&#8208;oxoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase superfamily. Although other members of this enzyme family catalyze superficially similar transformations, the combination of all three reactions in a single enzyme has not previously been observed. By characterizing the products of  in vitro  reactions with labeled and unlabeled substrates, we show that DfmD performs this transformation in two steps, with the first involving desaturation of the substrate to form 2&#8208;(trimethylamino)vinylphosphonate, and the second involving rearrangement and demethylation to form methyldehydrofosmidomycin. These data reveal significant differences from the desaturation and rearrangement reactions catalyzed by other family members.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Compensation in a Displacement Mg2+ Storage Cathode through Polyselenide&#8208;Mediated Anion Redox</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Mg2+&#8208;storage mechanism underlying Cu2&#8722;xSe, a typical chalcogenide cathode, is a displacement reaction with anionic charge compensation, which is simultaneously accompanied by a polyselenide&#8208;mediated dissolution process. The addition of Mo6S8 reduces the irreversible capacity and improves the electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Chalcogenides have been viewed as important conversion&#8208;type Mg2+&#8208;storage cathodes to fulfill the high volumetric energy density promise of magnesium (Mg) batteries. However, the low initial Columbic efficiency and the rapid capacity degradation remain challenges for the chalcogenide cathodes, as the clear Mg2+&#8208;storage mechanism has yet to be clarified. Herein, we illustrate that the charge storage mechanism of the Cu2&#8722;xSe cathode is a reversible displacement reaction along with a polyselenide (PSe) mediated solution process of anion&#8208;compensation. The unique anion redox improves charge storage, while the dissolution of PSe also leads to performance degradation. To address this issue, we introduce Mo6S8 into the Cu2&#8722;xSe cathode to immobilize PSe, which significantly improves performance, especially the reversible capacity (from 140&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 to 220&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work provides inspiration for the modification of the Mg2+&#8208;storage cathode, which is a milestone for high&#8208;performance Mg batteries.

         <dc:description>Coenzyme NADH regeneration is crucial for sustained photoenzymatic catalysis of CO2  reduction. However, light&#8208;driven NADH regeneration still suffers from the low regeneration efficiency and requires the combined use of homogeneous Rh complex. Herein, a Rh complex&#8208;based electron transfer unit was chemically attached onto the linker of MIL&#8208;125&#8208;NH2. The coupling between the light&#8208;harvesting iminopyridine unit and electron&#8208;transferring Rh&#8208;complex facilitated the photo&#8208;induced electron transfer for the NADH regeneration with the yield of 66.4% in 60 mins for 5 cycles. The formate dehydrogenase was further deposited onto the hydrophobic layer of the membrane by reverse filtering technique, which form the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid reaction interface around the enzyme site, could demonstrate enhanced formic acid yield of 9.5 mM in 24 hours coupled with the  in&#8208;situ  regenerated NADH. The work could shed light on the construction of integrated inorganic&#8208;enzyme hybrid system for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Chirality of Perylene Diimides: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perylene diimide has been extensively studied as a &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule for the construction of chiral small molecules and helical supramolecular aggregates, such as twisted ribbons and helical fibers. This Minireview discusses the strategies for designing chiral perylene diimides through chemical modifications and assembly, as well as the chiroptical and biological applications of chiral perylene diimides.







Abstract
Chirality is a particularly important concept in nature and exists at all length scales, ranging from the molecular level to the supramolecular level. Over the last two decades, various design strategies have been developed to construct chiral materials based on perylene diimides (PDIs) and to mimic the chiral assembly process in biological systems, but applications of these chiral aggregates are still at an early stage. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the synthesis and properties of chiral PDIs. The chirality in PDI&#8208;based materials can be generated by three different approaches: from the twisted planes of PDIs, the chiral substituents of PDIs, and the co&#8208;assembly of achiral PDIs and chiral guests. A comprehensive understanding of the applications of chiral PDIs as well as potential future developments is also provided.

         <title>Guest Alignment and Defect Formation during Pore Filling in Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guest@MOF functionalities are strongly influenced by the degree of pore filling, the orientation of the guest as well as by structural changes of the host. We report a correlative study of these host&#8211;guest interactions as a function of the pore filling using combined polarisation&#8208;dependent ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy and gas sorption.







Abstract
The degree of pore filling is an important parameter for defining guest@MOF properties in applications including electronics, optics, and gas separation. However, the interplay of key aspects of host&#8211;guest interactions, such as a quantitative description of the guest alignment or the structural integrity of the host as function of pore filling are yet to be determined. Polarisation&#8208;dependent infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflection configuration combined with gas sorption allowed to simultaneously study the orientation of the guest molecule and structural changes of the MOF framework during the pore filling process. Thereby we found, that initially randomly oriented guest molecules align with increasing pore filling during adsorption from the gas phase. At the same time, the framework itself undergoes a reversible, guest molecule&#8208;dependent rotation of the aromatic linker and a linker detachment process, which induce defects.

         <title>A Photoacoustic&#8208;Fluorescent&#160;Imaging Probe for Proteolytic Gingipains Expressed by Porphyromonas gingivalis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyromonas gingivalis  is a keystone pathogen in periodontal disease. We herein report a dual&#8208;modal fluorescent and photoacoustic imaging probe for the detection of gingipain proteases secreted by  P. gingivalis  . Upon proteolytic cleavage by Arg&#8208;specific gingipain (RgpB), five&#8208;fold photoacoustic enhancement and &gt;100&#8208;fold fluorescence activation was measured with detection limits of 1.1 nM RgpB and 5.0E4 CFU/mL bacteria in vitro. RgpB activity was imaged in porcine jaws with low&#8208;nanomolar sensitivity. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated in gingival crevicular fluid samples from subjects with and without periodontal disease, wherein activation was correlated to qPCR&#8208;based detection of  P. gingivalis  (Pearson&#8217;s r = 0.71). Finally, photoacoustic imaging of RgpB&#8208;cleaved probe was achieved in murine brains ex vivo, with relevance and potential utility for disease models of general infection by  P. gingivalis  , motivated by the recent biological link between gingipains and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</dc:description>

         <title>Ball Milling Solid&#8208;state Synthesis of Highly Crystalline Prussian Blue Analogue Na2&#8208;xMnFe(CN)6 Cathodes for All&#8208;climate Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With a series of merits, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have been considered superior cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Their commercialization, however, still suffers from inferior stability, considerable [Fe(CN)  6  ] defects and interstitial water in the framework, which are related to the rapid crystal growth. Herein, a &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; nanoreactor is proposed to synthesize highly crystallized PBAs with decreased defects and water, which show both superior specific capacity and rate capability in SIBs. The air&#8208;stability, all&#8208;climate, and full&#8208;cell properties of our PBA have also been evaluated, and it exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and higher volume yield than its counterpart synthesized via the water&#8208;based co&#8208;precipitation method. Furthermore, their highly reversible sodium&#8208;ion storage behavior has been measured and identified via multiple in situ techniques. This work could pave the way for the PBA&#8208;based SIBs in grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Interfacial Stability Model with Na&#8208;K Liquid Alloy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the Na&#8208;K liquid alloy with a charge selective interfacial layer is developed to achieve an impressively long cycling life with small overpotential on a sodium super&#8208;ionic conductor (NASICON) SSE. With this unique multi&#8208;cation system as the platform, we further propose a unique model that contains a chemical decomposition domain and a kinetic decomposition domain for the interfacial stability model. Based on such model, two charge selection mechanisms are proposed with dynamic chemical kinetic equilibrium and electrochemical kinetics as the manners of control, respectively, and both are validated by the electrochemical measurements with microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations.

With this unique multi-cation system as the platform, we further propose a unique model that contains a chemical decomposition domain and a kinetic decomposition domain for the interfacial stability model. Based on such model, two charge selection mechanisms are proposed with dynamic chemical kinetic equilibrium and electrochemical kinetics as the manners of control, respectively, and both are validated by the electrochemical measurements with microscopic and spectroscopic characterizations. This study provides an effective design for high-energy-density solid-state battery with alkali Na-K anode, but also presents a novel approach to understand the interfacial chemical processes that could inspire and guide future designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diazaphospholene&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Reactions from Aryl Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diazaphospholenes are widely used as hydride transfer catalysts, however their use in radical reactions is a recently emerging area. Here, we show prior stoichiometric radical cyclizations of aryl iodides mediated by diazaphospholene hydrides are made catalytic by the combination of phenylsilane and alkali metal salts to regenerate the diazaphospholene hydride. The scope was expanded to include aryl bromides, which benefit from visible light irradiation. Twenty one substrates underwent cyclization, including a dearomative cyclization. Extension to six intermolecular radical hydroarylations with arenes, thiophenes, and a pyridine was also accomplished.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast&#8208;Scanning Potential&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Highly Sensitive Sensing of Dopamine in Living Rat Brain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing techniques for highly sensitive neurotransmitter assay is essential for understanding physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate a fast&#8208;scanning potential (FSP)&#8208;gated organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), featuring an implantable carbon fiber gate electrode polarized with a FSP, for highly sensitive sensing of dopamine (DA) in a living rat brain. The configuration combines the selectivity of fast&#8208;scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with the high sensitivity of an OECT. The combined uses of FSP as a gating mode and the transconductance (  g  m  ) as a sensing parameter further improve the sensing performance in terms of sensitivity, limit of detection, reproducibility and stability. The FSP&#8208;OECT exhibits a sensitivity of 0.899 S M  &#8208;1  and a low limit of detection down to 5 nM and was validated for  in vivo  monitoring of the basal level and electrically stimulated release of DA.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Reduction of Secondary Amides to Imines Catalysed by Schwartz&#8217;s Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The partial reduction of amides is a challenging transformation that must overcome the intrinsic stability of the amide bond and exhibit high chemoselective control to overcome overreduction to amine products. To address this challenge, we describe a zirconium&#8208;catalysed synthesis of imines by the reductive deoxygenation of secondary amides. This reaction exploits the excellent chemoselectivity of Schwartz&#8217;s reagent (Cp  2  Zr(H)Cl) and utilises (EtO)  3  SiH as a mild stoichiometric reductant to enable catalyst turnover. The reaction generally proceeds with high yields (19 examples, 51 to 95% yield) and tolerates a variety of functional groups (alkene, ester, nitro, etc.). Stoichiometric mechanistic investigations suggest the regeneration of the active [Zr]&#8211;H catalyst is achieved through the metathesis of Si&#8211;H and Zr&#8211;OR &#963;&#8208;bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Lattice Oxygen in Layered Lithium Oxides through Cation Vacancies for Enhanced Urea Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the high valent nickel&#8208;based oxides exhibit promising catalytic activity for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the fundamental questions concerning the origin of high performance and their structure&#8208;activity correlations remain to be elucidated. Here, we unveil the underlying enhanced mechanism of UOR by employing a series of prepared cation vacancy controllable LiNiO2 (LNO) model catalysts. Impressively, the optimized layered LNO&#8208;2 exhibits an extremely low overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 along with excellent stability after the 160 h test. Operando characterisations combined with the theoretical analysis reveal the activated lattice oxygen in layered LiNiO2 with moderate cation vacancies trigger charge disproportion of Ni site to form Ni4+ species, facilitating deprotonation in lattice oxygen involved catalytic process.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical recycling of poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) to the cyclic monomer L&#8208;lactide is hampered by low selectivity and by epimerization and elimination reactions, impeding its use on a large scale. The high number of side reactions originates from the high ceiling temperature (Tc) of L&#8208;lactide, which necessitates high temperatures or multistep reactions to achieve recycling to L&#8208;lactide. To circumvent this issue, we utilized the impact of solvent interactions on the monomer&#8208;polymer equilibrium to decrease the Tc of L&#8208;lactide. Analyzing the observed Tc in different solvents in relation to their Hildebrand solubility parameter revealed a &#8220;like recycles like&#8221; relationship. The decreased Tc, obtained by selecting solvents that interact strongly with the monomer (dimethyl formamide or the green solvent &#947;&#8208;valerolactone), allowed chemical recycling of high molecular weight poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) directly to L&#8208;lactide, within 1&#8208;4 h at 140 &#176;C, with &gt; 95% conversion and 98&#8208;99% selectivity. Recycled L&#8208;lactide was isolated and repolymerized with high control over molecular weight and dispersity, closing the polymer loop.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BP unsaturated unit is a very attractive functional group as it provides novel reactivity and unique physical properties. Nonetheless, applications remain limited so far due to the bulky nature of B/P&#8208;protecting groups, required to prevent oligomerization. Herein, we report the synthesis and isolation of a  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized phosphaborene, bearing a trimethylsilyl (TMS) functionality at the P&#8208;terminal, as a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable crystalline solid accessible via facile NHC&#8208;induced trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) elimination from its phosphinoborane precursor. This phosphaborene compound, bearing a genuine B=P bond, exhibits a remarkable ability for undergoing P&#8208;centre metathesis reactions, which allows the isolation of a series of unprecedented phosphaborenes. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations provide insights into the B=P bonding situation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective, intermolecular  vicinal  fluoroamination of &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl styrenes has been achieved by enantioselective I(I)/I(III) catalysis. Leveraging C  2  &#8208;symmetric resorcinol&#8208;based aryl iodide catalysts, it has been possible to intercept the transient iodonium intermediate using simple nitriles, which function as both the solvent and nucleophile.  In situ  Ritter reaction provides direct access to the corresponding amides (up to 89% yield,  e.r.  93:7). This main group catalysis paradigm inverts the intrinsic regioselectivity of the uncatalyzed process, thereby providing facile access to tertiary, benzylic stereocenters bearing both CF  3  and F groups. Privileged phenethylamine pharmacophores can be generated in which there is complete local partial charge inversion (CF  3  d  &#8208;  /F  d  &#8208;  versus CH  3  d  +  /H  d  +  ). Crystallographic analyses of representative &#946;&#8208;fluoroamide products reveal highly pre&#8208;organized conformations that manifest the stereoelectronic  gauche  effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Photochemical Nitrile Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical reactivity of nitrile imines is of great utility in organic synthesis with applications rapidly expanding into the materials and life sciences. Yet, our understanding of the electronic and molecular structures of nitrile imines remains incomplete and the elementary mechanism of their photoinduced generation is entirely unknown. Here, femtosecond infrared spectroscopy after 266 nm&#8208;excitation of 2,5&#8208;diphenyltetrazole has been carried out to temporally resolve the formation and structural relaxation dynamics of the nascent diphenylnitrile imine in liquid solution under ambient conditions. The infrared&#8208;spectroscopic evolution is interpreted by an initial sequence of intersystem crossings within 250 fs followed by the cleavage of N2 with formation of a structurally relaxed nitrile imine on the adiabatic ground&#8208;state singlet surface within a few tens of picoseconds. The infrared spectrum supports the notion of a &#8220;floppy&#8221; nitrile imine molecule whose equilibrium character ranges from fully propargylic to fully allenic in the room temperature liquid solution.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Nanoribbon with Multiple Substitutional Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N=9 nitrogen&#8208;doped armchair graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) (N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs) with multiple substitutional sites were synthesized. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the doped sites of N atoms play a significant role in modulating the electronic structures of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs (semiconducting for (C&#8722;C), metallic for (C&#8722;N) and (N&#8722;N)).







Abstract
Doped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with heteroatoms are a principal strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic structures of GNRs for future device applications. Here, we successfully synthesized the N=9 nitrogen&#8208;doped armchair GNR on the Au(111) surface. Due to the flexibility of precursor molecules, three different covalent bonds (C&#8722;C, C&#8722;N, N&#8722;N) are formed in the GNR backbone. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy analysis together with band structure calculations reveals that the band gap of the N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs (C&#8722;C) will be enlarged compared to pristine 9&#8208;AGNRs, and the C&#8722;N bond and N&#8722;N bond at the isolated site of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8722;C) will introduce new defect states near the Fermi level. DFT calculations reveal that the electronic structure of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8722;C) shows semiconductor character, while N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8722;N) and N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (N&#8722;N) display metallic character. Our results provide a promising route for creating more complex molecular heterostructures with tunable band gaps, which may be useful for future molecular electronics and memory device applications.

         <title>Sulfur in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical versatility of sulfur allows the formation of several dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs). This Review summarizes the advances achieved with each DSB, together with some applications. In addition, dynamic multilevel systems in which two or more DSBs are combined in the same system are discussed.







Abstract
Sulfur has been important in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) since the beginning of the field. Mainly as part of disulfides and thioesters, dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs) have a leading role in several remarkable reactions. Part of this success is due to the almost ideal properties of DSBs for the preparation of dynamic covalent systems, including high reactivity and good reversibility under mild aqueous conditions, the possibility of exploiting supramolecular interactions, access to isolable structures, and easy experimental control to turn the reaction on/off. DCC is currently witnessing an increase in the importance of DSBs. The chemical flexibility offered by DSBs opens the door to multiple applications. This Review presents an overview of all the DSBs used in DCC, their applications, and remarks on the interesting properties that they confer on dynamic chemical systems, especially those containing several DSBs.

         <title>Hyperbranched Polyborate: A Non&#8208;conjugated Fluorescent Polymer with Unanticipated High Quantum Yield and Multicolor Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonaromatic hyperbranched polyborate was successfully synthesized. It exhibits multicolor emission and unanticipated high fluorescence quantum yield (54.1&#8201;%). This is due to the &#8220;rigid&#8211;flexible synergistic effect&#8221; of the rigid BO3 planar and the aliphatic flexible carbon chains as well as the through&#8208;space dative bond in the compact aggregate structure.







Abstract
Non&#8208;conjugated fluorescent polymers have attracted great attention due to their excellent biocompatibility and environmental friendliness. However, it remains a huge challenge to obtain a polymer with high fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and multicolor emission simultaneously. Herein, we reported three kinds of nonaromatic hyperbranched polyborates (P1&#8211;P3) with multicolor emission, surprisingly, P2 also exhibits an unanticipated high QY (54.1&#8201;%). The natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results revealed that the synergistic effect of rigid BO3 planar and flexible carbon chain, as well as the through&#8208;space dative bond in supramolecular aggregate, were the key factors contributing to the ultrahigh QY of P2. Moreover, the applications of P2 in Fe3+ ions detection and cell imaging were also investigated. This work provides a new perspective for designing non&#8208;conjugated fluorescent polymers with both high QY and multicolor emission.

         <title>Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Inorganic Chiral Photonic Crystals Doped with Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic chiral photonic crystals (CPCs) are prepared by the co&#8208;assembly of non&#8208;chiral nanowires and quantum dots (QDs) via simple Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer deposition. The composite thin film exhibits precise modulation of sign, position, and intensity of the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) peaks, a giant absolute dissymmetry factor (|glum|) up to 0.25, and unique CPL characteristics near the photonic band gap.







Abstract
Chiral semiconductor nanostructures have received enormous attention due to their emerging circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. However, compared with well&#8208;studied photoluminescence (PL), the reported CPL is much weaker and more challenging to be modulated. Herein, we describe a new approach for acquiring the intense and tunable CPL from inorganic chiral photonic crystals (CPCs) doped with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Unprecedentedly, the sign, position and intensity of CPL peaks can be precisely controlled by manipulating either the photonic band gap of CPCs or luminescence wavelength of QDs and a giant absolute dissymmetry factor |glum| up to 0.25 is obtained. More importantly, the origin of the CPL modulation is clearly elucidated by both experiment and theory. This work lays the foundation for the construction of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance CPL&#8208;based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral semiconductor nanostructures have received enormous attention due to their emerging circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties. However, compared with well-studied photoluminescence (PL), the reported CPL is much weaker and more challenging to be modulated. Herein, we describe a new approach for acquiring the intense and tunable CPL from inorganic chiral photonic crystals (CPCs) doped with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). Unprecedentedly, the sign, position and intensity of CPL peaks can be precisely controlled by manipulating either the photonic band gap of CPCs or luminescence wavelength of QDs and a giant absolute dissymmetry factor |&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;| up to 0.25 is obtained. More importantly, the origin of the CPL modulation is clearly elucidated by both experiment and theory. This work lays the foundation for the construction of next-generation high-performance CPL-based devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Proteoform&#8208;Selective Imaging of Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mass spectrometry imaging of tissues using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization provides first insights into the effect of post&#8208;translational modifications on the differential expression of individual proteoforms in biological tissues, which is important for understanding their function and interactions.







Abstract
Unraveling the complexity of biological systems relies on the development of new approaches for spatially resolved proteoform&#8208;specific analysis of the proteome. Herein, we employ nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nano&#8208;DESI MSI) for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of biological tissues. Nano&#8208;DESI generates multiply charged protein ions, which is advantageous for their structural characterization using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) directly on the tissue. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments demonstrate that nano&#8208;DESI MSI combined with on&#8208;tissue top&#8208;down proteomics is ideally suited for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of tissue sections. Using rat brain tissue as a model system, we provide the first evidence of differential proteoform expression in different regions of the brain.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Atroposelective Click Cycloaddition of Azides and Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective click cycloaddition of azides and alkynes for rapid and modular access to atropisomeric triazoles is reported. This click process features very mild reaction conditions, superior efficiency and enantioselectivity, broad substrate scope and facile scalability. The racemization study and further derivatizations demonstrate the good configurational stability of obtained axially chiral triazole products.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of azides and alkynes is the leading click chemistry technology and has been widely used in drug discovery, biology and material sciences. However, the development of a modular and scalable enantioselective click cycloaddition remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we report a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective click cycloaddition of azides and alkynes for rapid and modular access to atropisomeric triazoles in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The process is mild, efficient and scalable, and features broad substrate scope.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free C&#8722;H Functionalization via Diaryliodonium Salts with a Chemically Robust Dummy Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step C&#8722;H functionalization applicable to both electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient arenes is described. The method does not require a transition&#8208;metal catalyst and allows rapid structural diversification through the incorporation of various functionalities into complex molecules.







Abstract
A two&#8208;step strategy for the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes using unsymmetrical iodonium salts as versatile synthetic linchpins is presented. The key to the success of this strategy is the identification of the 3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;isoxazolyl (DMIX) group as a superior dummy ligand, which enables not only site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization to afford unsymmetrical iodonium salts, but also highly selective aryl transfer during the subsequent metal&#8208;free coupling reaction. Both electron&#8208;rich and moderately electron&#8208;deficient arenes can be converted into the iodonium salts through C&#8722;H functionalization, allowing for diverse structural elaboration by metal&#8208;free C&#8722;N, C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, and C&#8722;O coupling.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of 2,3,4&#8208;Trisubstituted 3&#8208;Pyrrolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective arylative cyclization process of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;sulfonamide acrylates with (hetero)arylboronic acids was developed for the synthesis of chiral 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines (up to 99&#8201;% ee). A series of computational studies supported the syn/anti rotation of alkenyl&#8208;Ni intermediate and the excellent enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The development of synthetic methods to produce highly functionalized chiral 3&#8208;pyrrolines is of indisputable importance because of their prevalence in natural and synthetic bioactive molecules. Unfortunately, previous general cycloaddition approaches using allenoates, could not synthesize 3,4&#8208;disubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines. Herein, an original approach to yield 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted 3&#8208;pyrrolines with chirality at the 2&#8208;position is presented. A NiII/Fc&#8208;i&#8208;PrPHOX catalytic system facilitated a redox&#8208;neutral highly stereoselective process that exhibited an enantioselectivity of up to 99&#8201;%. Enantioenriched 3&#8208;pyrrolines can be converted to other valuable classes of N&#8208;heterocycles.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equal Ratio Cocrystal Engineering to Improve Charge Transport Characteristics of Organic Semiconductors: A Case Study on Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The packing structures of organic semiconductors can be tailored through non&#8208;equal ratio cocrystallization, which leads to significantly improved charge transport characteristics relative to the single&#8208;component material. As an example, a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystal displays a more appropriate herringbone stacking structure with a pronounced increase in both the electronic coupling and intermolecular distances compared to the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 cocrystal and single&#8208;component crystal.







Abstract
Rare studies of cocrystal engineering have focused on improving carrier mobility of organic semiconductors mainly because of the generation of ambipolarity, the alteration of the charge carrier polarity or the reduction of electronic couplings. Herein, we utilize indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole (IC) as the model compound and 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthraquinone (DPAO) and 9&#8208;fluorenone (FO) as the coformers to construct IC2&#8208;DPAO and IC&#8208;FO cocrystals with 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratios, respectively, through hydrogen bonds and donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Interestingly, the more appropriate packing structure, possessing not only enhanced electronic couplings but also increased intermolecular distances, is achieved in IC2&#8208;DPAO, which shows an improved carrier mobility of 0.11&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 by four orders of magnitude relative to the IC crystal. These results suggest that non&#8208;equal ratio cocrystal engineering opens up the possibility to develop organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport behaviors.

These results suggest that non-equal ratio cocrystal engineering opens up the possibility to develop organic semiconductors with enhanced charge transport behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sensitive, Efficient and Portable Analysis of Molecular Exchange Processes by Hyperpolarized Ultrafast NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperpolarized ultrafast diffusion exchange spectroscopy method is introduced, which allows highly sensitive and efficient quantification of molecular exchange rates by using low&#8208;cost, low&#8208;field, single&#8208;sided and portable NMR instruments. The method can be used to investigate exchange processes in many fields ranging from intra&#8208;extracellular exchange of metabolites to atmospheric surfactant solutions.







Abstract
Molecular exchange processes are ubiquitous in nature. Here, we introduce a method to analyze exchange processes by using low&#8208;cost, portable, single&#8208;sided NMR instruments. The inherent magnetic field inhomogeneity of the single&#8208;sided instruments is exploited to achieve diffusion contrast of exchange sites and spatial encoding of 2D data. This so&#8208;called ultrafast diffusion exchange spectroscopy method shortens the experiment time by two to four orders of magnitude. Furthermore, because full 2D data are measured in a single scan (in a fraction of a second), the sensitivity of the experiment can be improved by several orders of magnitude using so&#8208;called nuclear spin hyperpolarization methods (in this case, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization). As the first demonstration of the feasibility of the method in various applications, we show that the method enables quantification of intra&#8208; and extracellular exchange of water in a yeast cell suspension.

         <title>carba&#8208;Nucleopeptides (cNPs): A Biopharmaceutical Modality Formed through Aqueous Rhodamine&#8197;B Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exchanging the amino acid side chains of a polypeptide with C&#8722;N linked nucleobases forms oligonucleotide&#8208;like structures (aza&#8208;nucleopeptides) with favorable physiochemical properties. Connecting the nucleobase to the peptide through a C&#8722;C bond can promote new, beneficial noncovalent interactions. A general method to make C&#8722;C linked carba&#8208;nucleopeptides in batch, parallel, and flow using aqueous Rhodamine&#8197;B photoredox catalysis is reported.







Abstract
Exchanging the ribose backbone of an oligonucleotide for a peptide can enhance its physiologic stability and nucleic acid binding affinity. Ordinarily, the eneamino nitrogen atom of a nucleobase is fused to the side chain of a polypeptide through a new C&#8722;N bond. The discovery of C&#8722;C linked nucleobases in the human transcriptome reveals new opportunities for engineering nucleopeptides that replace the traditional C&#8722;N bond with a non&#8208;classical C&#8722;C bond, liberating a captive nitrogen atom and promoting new hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. We report the first late&#8208;stage synthesis of C&#8722;C linked carba&#8208;nucleopeptides (cNPs) using aqueous Rhodamine&#8197;B photoredox catalysis. We prepare brand&#8208;new cNPs in batch, in parallel, and in flow using three long&#8208;wavelength photochemical setups. We detail the mechanism of our reaction by experimental and computational studies and highlight the essential role of diisopropylethylamine as a bifurcated two&#8208;electron reductant.

         <title>Exploring Equilibria between Aluminium(I) and Aluminium(III): The Formation of Dihydroalanes, Masked Dialumenes and Aluminium(I) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monomeric AlI compound is used as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of AlIII dihydrides. This leads to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. The transient formation of new, previously inaccessible AlI species is demonstrated through reactivity studies and theory.







Abstract
The design of new reductive routes to low oxidation state aluminium (Al) compounds offers the opportunity to better understand redox processes at the metal centre and develop reactivity accordingly. Here, a monomeric AlI compound acts as a stoichiometric reducing agent towards a series of AlIII dihydrides, leading to the formation of new low oxidation state species including symmetric and asymmetric dihydrodialanes, and a masked dialumene. These compounds are formed by a series of equilibrium processes involving AlI, AlII and AlIII species and product formation can be manipulated by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions. The transient formation of monomeric AlI compounds is proposed: this is shown to be energetically viable by computational (DFT) investigations and reactivity studies show support for the formation of AlI species. Importantly, despite the potential for the equilibrium mixtures to lead to ill&#8208;defined reactivity, controlled reactivity of these low oxidation state species is observed.

         <title>Electrostatically Directed Long&#8208;Range Self&#8208;Assembly of Nucleotides with Cationic Nanoparticles To Form Multifunctional Bioplasmonic Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A slow and steady aggregation process unveils the ability of ATP and other nucleotides to undergo a long&#8208;range self&#8208;assembly process in the presence of cationic gold nanoparticles and divalent ions. The inherent properties of ATP and AuNP are well retained in the self&#8208;assembled bioplasmonic network.







Abstract
Precise control over interparticle interactions is essential to retain the functions of individual components in a self&#8208;assembled superstructure. Here, we report the design of a multifunctional bioplasmonic network via an electrostatically directed self&#8208;assembly process involving adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP). The present study unveils the ability of ATP to undergo a long&#8208;range self&#8208;assembly in the presence of cations and gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Modelling and NMR studies gave a qualitative insight into the major interactions driving the bioplasmonic network formation. ATP&#8208;Ca2+ coordination helps in regulating the electrostatic interaction, which is crucial in transforming an uncontrolled precipitation into a kinetically controlled aggregation process. Remarkably, ATP and AuNP retained their inherent properties in the multifunctional bioplasmonic network. The generality of electrostatically directed self&#8208;assembly process was extended to different nucleotide&#8211;nanoparticle systems.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Complexation&#8208;Induced Aggregation Based on Pyrene&#8208;Modified Cyclodextrins for Improved Electronic Circular Dichroism and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of di&#8208;pyrene&#8208;substituted &#947;&#8208;CD in water showed significantly high chiroptical activities and gave gabs and glum values up to 4.3&#215;10&#8722;2 and 5.3&#215;10&#8722;2, respectively. Meanwhile, it provided remarkable chiral emission performance, with the BCPL and BiCPL values reaching 338.6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 169.3&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
Several &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives mono&#8208; or di&#8208;substituted by pyrenes at the primary rim of the CD were demonstrated to aggregate into nano&#8208;strips in aqueous solutions, with the pyrene moieties interpenetrating into &#947;&#8208;CD cavities. The hydrophobic complexation&#8208;induced aggregation provides a rigid chiral environment for the pyrenes and leads to significant electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities, giving unprecedently high gabs and glum values up to 4.3&#215;10&#8722;2 and 5.3&#215;10&#8722;2, respectively. The aggregates lead to excimer emission with high quantum yields and show BCPL and BiCPL up to 338. 6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and 169.3&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, respectively.

&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values up to 4.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Meanwhile, it provided remarkable chiral emission performance, with the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt; values reaching 338.6&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 169.3&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &#947;-cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives mono- or di-substituted by pyrenes at the primary rim of the CD were demonstrated to aggregate into nano-strips in aqueous solutions, with the pyrene moieties interpenetrating into &#947;-CD cavities. The hydrophobic complexation-induced aggregation provides a rigid chiral environment for the pyrenes and leads to significant electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities, giving unprecedently high &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; values up to 4.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 5.3&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The aggregates lead to excimer emission with high quantum yields and show &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;CPL&lt;/sub&gt; up to 338. 6&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 169.3&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphdiyne: A New Carbon Allotrope for Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pristine graphdiyne shows strong electrochemiluminescent emission with S2O82&#8722; as the coreactant, which is different with other carbon allotropes and widens the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) family.







Abstract
Graphdiyne (GDY), a well&#8208;known 2D carbon allotrope, demonstrates increasing fantastic performance in various fields owing to its outstanding electronic properties. Owing to its unique properties, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology is one powerful tool for understanding fundamental questions and for ultrasensitive sensing and imaging. Here, we firstly find that GDY without any functionalization or treatment shows a strong ECL emission with potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) as coreactant, which is totally different with other carbon allotropes. Mechanistic study indicates that the ECL emission of GDY is generated by the surface state transition. Interestingly, ECL is generated at 705&#8197;nm in the near infrared region with an ECL efficiency of 424&#8201;% compared to that of Ru(bpy)3Cl2/K2S2O8. The study demonstrates a new character of GDY in ECL investigation and sets the stage for the development of GDY for emerging applications, including imaging and light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>A Silylene&#8208;Stabilized Germanium Analogue of Alkynylaluminum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silylene&#8208;stabilized germanium analogue of alkynylaluminum, namely the digermynyl aluminum complex, was synthesized and characterized, which features a linear AlGeGe skeleton with a Ge=Ge double bond and a polarized Ge&#8722;Al bond. It readily reacted with H2, CS2 and TolNCO under mild conditions to give an unprecedented germylenyl aluminum complex and germanium&#8208;containing heterocycles, highlighting its utility as a synthon for the preparation of novel aluminum and germanium compounds.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;developed metal acetylides, the heavier analogues of the type REEM (E=Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; M=metals) have not been reported to date. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a silylene&#8208;stabilized germanium analogue of alkynylaluminum (4) by the reaction of a silylene&#8208;stabilized digermavinylidene (3) with 0.25&#8197;equiv of (AlCp*)4 in THF at 80&#8201;&#176;C. The structure of 4 has been unambiguously characterized by spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and DFT calculations, and features a linear AlGeGe skeleton with a Ge=Ge double bond and a polarized Ge&#8722;Al bond. Complex 4 shows excellent reactivity towards small molecules such as H2, CS2 and TolNCO, and this allows for the construction of the structurally intriguing germylenyl aluminum complex (5) and the germacycles (6, 7).

         <title>A Facile Approach to Produce Star Polymers based on Coordination Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many efforts have been devoted to preparing star polymers. The relative research by coordination polymerization, the most powerful stereoselective process to endow polymers super properties, lags far behind those achieved by radical polymerization and ionic polymerization. Herein, we propose a facile strategy to prepare star polymer with regular arms based on coordination polymerization via an insertion reaction between carbon&#8208;heteroatom unsaturated bond and the metal&#8208;alkyl species. Terminating a living  cis  &#8208;1,4&#8208;selective isoprene polymerization by isocyanate as cross&#8208;linker (  CL  ), star polyisoprene with low polydispersity was obtained at high yield (91.8%). Kinetic study showed the star polymer was formed via step growth procedure. The types of  CL  and the ratio of [  CL  ]  0  :[Cat.]  0  are key factors to determine the arm number and the yield of star polymer. Finally, synthetic IR rubber with green strength up to 1.99 MPa superior to the natural rubber (1.43 MPa) was prepared for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Thionitrite (SNO&#8211;) and Perthionitrite (SSNO&#8211;) are Simple Synthons for Nitrosylated Iron Sulfur Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S/N crosstalk species derived from the interconnected reactivity of H  2  S and NO facilitate the transport of reactive sulfur and nitrogen species in signaling, transport, and regulatory processes. We report here that simple Fe  2+  ions, such as those that are bioavailable in the labile iron pool (LIP), react with thionitrite (SNO  &#8211;  ) and perthionitrite (SSNO  &#8211;  ) to yield the dinitrosyl iron complex [Fe(NO)  2  (S  5  )]  &#8211;  .

         <dc:description>Nucleophilic aromatic BH substitution reaction of carboranes is uncommon, compared to the electrophilic one.&#160;This work reported a pyridine&#8208;enabled transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free regioselective nucleophilic aromatic cage B(4)&#8722;H amination of 1,2&#8208;diaryl&#8208;o&#8208;carboranes with magnesium bisamides, giving a series of B(4)&#8208;aminated  o&#8208;carboranes. DFT calculations showcased a stepwise B&#8208;N formation/B&#8208;H cleavage process, in which Mg&#8208;H formation/cage closure is the rate&#8208;determining step. Unprecedentedly, in the presence of 4,4&#180;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;dipyridyl (dtbpy), a tandam B(4)&#8208;amination/cage isomerization reaction of  o&#8208;carboranes was discovered for the facile preparation of B(2)&#8208;aminated  m&#8208;carboranes. Control experiments indicated that magnesium complex, bidentate ligand (dtbpy) and reaction temperature were crucial in cage isomerization process. This direct nucleophilic aromatic cage B&#8208;H amination reaction offers an alternative strategy for selective amination of  o&#8208; and  m&#8208;carboranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Dioxide Capture at Nucleophilic Hydroxide Sites in Oxidation&#8208;Resistant Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) from industrial point sources and direct air capture are necessary to combat global climate change. A particular challenge faced by amine&#8208;based sorbents&#8212;the current leading technology&#8212;is poor stability towards O2. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 chemisorption in &#947;&#8208;cylodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (CD&#8208;MOFs) occurs via HCO3&#8722; formation at nucleophilic OH&#8722; sites within the framework pores, rather than via previously proposed pathways. The new framework KHCO3 CD&#8208;MOF possesses rapid and high&#8208;capacity CO2 uptake, good thermal, oxidative, and cycling stabilities, and selective CO2 capture under mixed gas conditions. Because of its low cost and performance under realistic conditions, KHCO3 CD&#8208;MOF is a promising new platform for CCS. More broadly, our work demonstrates that the encapsulation of reactive OH&#8722; sites within a porous framework represents a potentially general strategy for the design of oxidation&#8208;resistant adsorbents for CO2 capture.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A previously proposed triene of the lindenane skeleton was synthesized, characterized and identified as the common intermediate for the non&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of natural lindenane oligomers through linear, [4+2]&#8208;type and [6+6]&#8208;type homo&#8208; and heterodimerization under simulated physiological conditions.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant Photoredox Catalysis Triggers Nitric Oxide Release for Antibacterial Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a robust tool for chemical synthesis. However, it remains challenging to implement photoredox catalysis under physiological conditions due to the complex microenvironment and the quenching of photocatalyst by biologically relevant molecules such as oxygen. Here, we report that UV&#8208;absorbing  N,N  &#8242;&#8208;dinitroso&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine derivatives can be selectively activated by  fac  &#8208;Ir(ppy)  3  photocatalyst within micellar nanoparticles under visible light irradiation (e.g., 500 nm) through photoredox catalysis in aerated aqueous solutions to form quinonediimine (QDI) residues with concomitant release of NO. Notably, the formation of QDI derivatives can actively scavenge the reactive oxygen species generated by  fac  &#8208;Ir(ppy)  3  , thus avoiding oxygen quenching of the photocatalyst. Further, we exemplify that the oxygen&#8208;tolerant photoredox catalysis&#8208;mediated NO release can not only kill planktonic bacteria  in vitro  but also efficiently treat MRSA infections  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Click chemistry is a concept wherein modular synthesis is used for rapid functional discovery. To this end, continuous discovery of clickable chemical transformations is the pillar to support the development of this field. This report details the development of a clickable C3&#8208;H selenylation of indole that is suitable for on&#8208;plate parallel and DNA&#8208;encoded library (  SeDEL) synthesis via bioinspired LUMO activation strategy. This reaction is modular, robust and highly site&#8208;selective, and it features simple and mild reaction system (catalyzed by nonmetallic B(C6F5)3  at room temperature), high yields and excellent functional group compatibility. Using this method, a library of 1350 indole&#8208;selenides was parallel synthesized in an efficient and practical manner, enabling the rapid identification of  3ai  as a promising compound with nanomolar antiproliferative activity in cancer cells via in situ phenotypic screening. These results indicate the great potential of this new clickable selenylation reaction in highthroughput medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Induced Selectivities in Gold(I) Catalysis&#8212;The Benefit of Using Bulky Tri&#8208;(ortho&#8208;biaryl)phosphine Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of gold(I) complexes bearing bulky tri&#8208;(ortho&#8208;biaryl)phosphine ligands were synthesized. They were shown to exhibit remarkable catalytic activities thus demonstrating their value as synthetic tools in organic chemistry.







Abstract
The confinement of a catalytic site is an efficient strategy to control a reaction and modulate its selectivity. In the present work, a new class of structurally simple and easily accessible bulky tri&#8208;(ortho&#8208;biaryl)phosphine ligands were accessed, and their gold(I) complexes synthesized. Their X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the comparative evaluation of their VBur% and G steric parameters against a series of gold complexes commonly employed in catalysis demonstrated their confined nature. Despite their notable steric congestion, these complexes exhibited remarkable catalytic activities and unusual selectivities, both in nature and level, that make them unique in the field of synthetic homogeneous gold catalysis.

         <title>Synthesis of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Complexes by Chloronium Ion Abstraction from 2&#8208;Chloroazolium Salts Using Electron&#8208;Rich Phosphines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chloronium ion abstraction from 2&#8208;chloroimidazolium salts using tris(1,3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino)phosphine 1 rapidly affords the free N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and chlorophosphonium ions (1&#8208;Cl)+. The dechlorination can be used for the site&#8208;selective metallation of unsymmetric 2&#8208;chloroazole/2&#8208;chloroazolium bis&#8208;NHC precursors by phosphine&#8208;mediated chloronium ion abstraction followed by an oxidative addition reaction to give heterobimetallic complexes.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are commonly prepared by deprotonation of azolium salts using strong anionic bases. This reaction is often unselective, yielding alkali metal NHC complexes or dimerized NHCs. Alternatively, free NHCs are obtained by the dechlorination of 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts using electron&#8208;rich phosphines. PPh3, PCy3, and PtBu3 are unsuitable for Cl+ abstraction, while the sterically encumbered tris(1,3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino)phosphine 1 selectively removes Cl+ from 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts. Since bulky 1 does not bind to metal complexes, it was used for the preparation of NHC complexes via in&#8197;situ Cl+ abstraction from 2&#8208;chloroazolium salts. The dechlorination was employed for the site&#8208;selective monometallation with IrI, IrIII, RhI, RhIII, and RuII of a bis&#8208;NHC precursor composed of a 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazolium and a 2&#8208;chlorobenzimidazole group, followed by the preparation of the heterobimetallic IrIII/PdII complex [18](BF4)2 by a dechlorination/oxidative addition reaction sequence.

         <title>Oxidative Fluorination of Heteroatoms Enabled by Trichloroisocyanuric Acid and Potassium Fluoride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In synthetic method development, the most rewarding path is seldom a straight line. While our initial entry into pentafluorosulfanyl (SF  5  ) chemistry did not go according to plan (due to inaccessibility of reagents such as SF  5  Cl at the time), a &#8220;detour&#8221; led us to establish mild and inexpensive oxidative fluorination conditions that made aryl&#8208;SF  5  compound synthesis more accessible. The method involved the use of potassium fluoride and trichloroisocyanuric acid (TCICA) &#8211; a common swimming pool disinfectant &#8211; as opposed to previously employed reagents such as F  2  , XeF  2  , HF, and Cl  2  . Thereafter, curiosity led us to explore applications of TCICA/KF as a more general approach to the synthesis of fluorinated Group 15, 16, and 17 heteroatoms in organic scaffolds; this, in turn, prompted SC&#8208;XRD, VT&#8208;NMR, computational, and physical organic studies. Ultimately, it was discovered that  TCICA/KF can be used to synthesize SF  5  Cl  , enabling SF  5  chemistry in an unexpected way.</dc:description>

         <title>Photouncaging of Carboxylic Acids from Cyanine Dyes with Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared light (NIR; 650&#8211;900 nm) offers unparalleled advantages as a biocompatible stimulus. The development of photocages that operate in this region represents a fundamental challenge due to the low energy of the excitation light. Herein, we repurpose cyanine dyes into photocages that are available on a multigram scale in three steps and efficiently release carboxylic acids in aqueous media upon irradiation with NIR light up to 820 nm. The photouncaging process is examined using several techniques, providing evidence that it proceeds via photooxidative pathway. We demonstrate the practical utility in live HeLa cells by delivery and release of the carboxylic acid cargo, that was otherwise not uptaken by cells in its free form. In combination with modularity of the cyanine scaffold, the realization of these accessible photocages will fully unleash the potential of the emerging field of NIR&#8208;photoactivation and facilitate its widespread adoption outside the photochemistry community.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Nanoscale Roughness and Polarity in Odd&#8208;Even Effect of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dependency of substrate roughness on wetting properties of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been studied extensively, but most previous studies used limited selection of probing liquid and range of surface roughness. These studies disregarded the limit to observation of sub&#8208;nanometer odd&#8208;even parity effect, hence are inconclusive. In this work we report the role of solvent polarity on the roughness&#8208;dependency of wetting behavior of SAMs by studying static con&#8208;tact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag&#8208;based substrate with different surface morphology. By overlapping the roughness ranges with previous studies on Au, the limitation of surface roughness (RMS = 1 nm) to observation of the odd&#8208;even effect using water as probing liquid was confirmed, but other probing liquid yielded different roughness&#8208;dependent behaviors, with more polar solvent showing more roughness&#8208;dependent behavior. Based on these observations, we concluded that there exists a phase&#8208;transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness, molecule chain length whose determination is dependent on the probing liquid.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dependency of substrate roughness on wetting properties of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) has been studied extensively, but most previous studies used limited selection of probing liquid and range of surface roughness. These studies disregarded the limit to observation of sub-nanometer odd-even parity effect, hence are inconclusive. In this work we report the role of solvent polarity on the roughness-dependency of wetting behavior of SAMs by studying static con-tact angle of a variety of probing liquids, with different polarities, on SAMs formed on Ag-based substrate with different surface morphology. By overlapping the roughness ranges with previous studies on Au, the limitation of surface roughness (RMS = 1 nm) to observation of the odd-even effect using water as probing liquid was confirmed, but other probing liquid yielded different roughness-dependent behaviors, with more polar solvent showing more roughness-dependent behavior. Based on these observations, we concluded that there exists a phase-transition like behavior in SAMs due to substrate roughness, molecule chain length whose determination is dependent on the probing liquid.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Transesterification of Non&#8208;Activated Esters Promoted by Small Molecules Mimicking the Active Site of Hydrolases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of small molecules able to mimic the active site of hydrolytic enzymes has been largely pursued in the recent decades. The high reaction rates and specificity showed by natural hydrolases presents an attractive target, and yet the preparation of suitable small molecule mimics remains challenging, requiring activated substrates to achieve productive outcomes. Here we present small synthetic artificial enzymes which mimic the catalytic site and the oxyanion hole of chymotrypsin and N&#8208;terminal hydrolases&#160;and are able to perform, for the first time, the transesterification of a non&#8208;activated ester such as ethyl acetate with methanol under mild and neutral reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective (8+3) Cycloadditions by Activation of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes Employing Chiral Br&#248;nsted Base Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel enantioselective (8+3) cycloaddition between donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and heptafulvenoids catalysed by a chiral bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base is described. Importantly, the reaction, which leverages an anionic activation strategy, is divergent from prototypical Lewis&#8208;acid activation protocols. A series of cyclopropylketones react with tropones affording the desired (8+3) cycloadducts in high yield and enantiomeric excess. For barbiturate substituted heptafulvenes, the (8+3) cycloaddition with cyclopropylketones proceeds in good yield, excellent diastereoselectivity and high enantiomeric excess. The experimental work is supported by DFT calculations, which indicate that the bifunctional organocatalyst activates both the donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropane and tropone; the reaction proceeds in a step&#8208;wise manner with the ring&#8208;closure being the stereodetermining step</dc:description>

         <title>Picolinamides and Iodoalkynes Enable Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed syn&#8208;Aminoalkynylation of Di&#8208; and Trisubstituted Alkenes to Give Pyrrolidines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, syn&#8208;selective aminoalkynylation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted olefins to afford pyrrolidines is developed. The combination of iodoalkynes and a picolinamide as nucleophile is shown to be essential for the observed reactivity. Furthermore, the picolinamide enables the rapid synthesis of cyclization substrates through a C&#8722;H activation approach.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkynylation of electronically unbiased olefins with iodoalkynes is reported. The picolinamide auxiliary enables for the first time the syn&#8208;selective aminoalkynylation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes to afford the corresponding pyrrolidines in up to 97&#8201;% yield and as single diastereomers. Furthermore, through a C&#8722;H activation approach, the picolinamide allows the rapid synthesis of functionalized olefins, which are suitable cyclization precursors. Facile and orthogonal deprotection of the amides and SiiPr3&#8208;acetylenes in the products, and a subsequent Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction is demonstrated.

         <title>Fluorescent Microswimmers Based on Cross&#8208;&#946; Amyloid Nanotubes and Divergent Cascade Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shaped through millions of years of evolution, the spatial localization of multiple enzymes in living cells employs extensive cascade reactions to enable highly coordinated multimodal functions. Herein, by utilizing a complex divergent cascade, we exploit the catalytic potential as well as templating abilities of streamlined cross&#8208;&#946; amyloid nanotubes to yield two orthogonal roles simultaneously. The short peptide based paracrystalline nanotube surfaces demonstrated the generation of fluorescence signals within entangled networks loaded with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH).&#160;The nanotubular morphologies were further used to generate cascade&#8208;driven microscopic motility through surface entrapment of sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and catalase (Cat). Moreover, a divergent cascade network was initiated by upstream catalysis of the substrate molecules through the surface mutation of catalytic moieties. Notably, the resultant downstream products led to the generation of motile fluorescent microswimmers by utilizing the two sets of orthogonal properties and, thus, mimicked the complex cascade&#8208;mediated functionalities of extant biology.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides are an important class of organic compounds which find broad application in organic and pharmaceutical chemistry. Herein we describe the development of novel biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic methods for the enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides by exploiting ketoreductase (KRED) enzymes. Four KREDs were discovered from a pool of 384 enzymes identified and isolated through a metagenomic approach.

KRED253 and KRED384 catalysed the enantioselective synthesis of &#946;&#8208;hydroxysulfides bearing a stereocentre at the C&#8722;S bond with opposite enantioselectivities by dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of racemic &#945;&#8208;thioaldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Multilevel Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness and Multicolor Room Temperature Phosphorescence Emission Based on a Single&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are limited reports about the transformation of pure organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness at different RTP emission wavelengths under external stimuli. It is difficult to ensure efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) in different states based on single&#8208;component system. This research reported the conversion of organic single&#8208;component small molecule 1,2&#8208;bis (4&#8208;alkoxyphenyl) ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (N&#8208;BOX) with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness between high&#8208;efficiency blue and yellow RTP by grinding or thermal annealing N&#8208;BOX crystal. The RTP emission of the N&#8208;BOX in crystalline state was easy to be adjusted by external stimuli (grinding or thermal annealing) due to its incompact packing, which led to phase transition and generated unique multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. Particularly, the RTP quantum yield of 7&#8208;BOX with multilevel stimuli&#8208;responsiveness reached 68.4 %, which provides an opportunity for regulation of the pure organic RTP smart optical materials.</dc:description>

It is difficult to ensure efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) in different states based on single-component system. This research reported the conversion of organic single-component small molecule 1,2-bis (4-alkoxyphenyl) ethane-1,2-dione (N-BOX) with multilevel stimuli-responsiveness between high-efficiency blue and yellow RTP by grinding or thermal annealing N-BOX crystal. The RTP emission of the N-BOX in crystalline state was easy to be adjusted by external stimuli (grinding or thermal annealing) due to its incompact packing, which led to phase transition and generated unique multilevel stimuli-responsiveness. Particularly, the RTP quantum yield of 7-BOX with multilevel stimuli-responsiveness reached 68.4 %, which provides an opportunity for regulation of the pure organic RTP smart optical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic P,O&#8208;Coordinated Nickel(II) Catalysts for Carbonylative Polymerization of Ethylene: Unexpected Productivity   via   Subtle Electronic Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide affords polyketones materials with excellent mechanical strength, photodegradability, surface and barrier properties. Unlike the widely used and rather expensive Pd catalysts, Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative polymerization is very difficult since the strong binding affinity of CO to Ni deactivates the highly electrophilic metal center easily. In this study, various cationic [P,O]&#8208;coordinated Ni complexes were synthesized using the electronic modulation strategy, and the catalyst with strong electron&#8208;donating substituents exhibits an excellent productivity of 10  4  g polymer (g Ni)  &#8208;1  , which represents a rare discovery that Ni complex could operate with such exceptional efficiency in comparison with Pd catalysts. Notably, those Ni catalysts were also efficient for terpolymerization of ethylene, propylene with CO for producing commercial polyketone materials with low melting temperatures and easy processibility.</dc:description>

A 2D copper&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, DUT&#8208;134(Cu), self&#8208;assembles into carpet&#8208;like mesocrystals offering enhanced accessibility of open metal sites for air&#8208;filtration applications.







Abstract
Clean air is an indispensable prerequisite for human health. The capture of small toxic molecules requires the development of advanced materials for air filtration. Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials offer highly accessible surface areas but for real&#8208;world applications their assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical mesostructures is essential. DUT&#8208;134(Cu) ([Cu2(dttc)2]n, dttc=dithieno[3,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylate]) is a metal&#8211;organic framework forming platelet&#8208;shaped particles, that can be organized into complex structures, such as millimeter large free&#8208;standing layers (carpets) and tubes. The structured material demonstrates enhanced accessibility of open metal sites and significantly enhanced H2S adsorption capacity in gas filtering tests compared with traditional bulk analogues.

         <title>Mediating Oxidation of Thioethers with Iodine&#8212;A Mild and Versatile Pathway to Trigger the Formation of Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for the formation of peptide hydrogels utilizing a mediating redox reaction based on the oxidation of thioethers with iodine is presented. Protons generated during oxidation trigger the efficient hydrogelation of peptides from alkaline precursor solutions.







Abstract
The development of redox&#8208;triggerable peptide hydrogels poses fundamental challenges, since the highly specific peptide architectures required inevitably limit the versatility of such materials. A powerful, yet rarely applied approach to bypass those barriers is the application of a mediating redox reaction to gradually decrease the pH during hydrogel formation. We report a versatile strategy to trigger the formation of peptide hydrogels from readily accessible acid&#8208;triggerable gelators by generating protons by oxidation of thioethers with triiodide. Adding thiodiglycol as a readily available thioether auxiliary to the basic precursor solution of a peptide gelator efficiently yielded hydrogels after mixing with triiodide, as studied in detail for Nap&#8208;FF and demonstrated for other peptides. Furthermore, incorporation of the thioether moiety in the gelator backbone via the amino acid methionine, as shown for the tailormade Nap&#8208;FMDM peptide, reduces the number of required additives.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Plasmonic Nanodevice for Cascade Signal Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the creation of self&#8208;assembled nanodevices with specific biological functions, one of the fundamental challenges is amplifying initial, faint signals that cannot be detected or transmitted directly. Herein, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, dynamic DNA origami plasmonic nanodevice that converts trace stimuli signals to detectable NIR CD responses.







Abstract
Here, we describe a DNA circuit&#8208;aided, origami nanodevice&#8208;based plasmonic system, which performs DNA&#8208;regulated, cascade amplification of faint chemical/biological signals. In this system, two gold&#8208;nanorods (GNRs) are co&#8208;assembled onto a DNA lock&#8208;containing, tweezer&#8208;like DNA origami template. Logic circuits serve as recognition and amplification elements for specific messengers, producing DNA keys for driving conformational changes of the plasmonic nanodevices. In the presence of input signals including nucleic acids, adenosines, chiral tyrosinamides or specific receptors expressed by tumor cells, the plasmonic nanodevices can be activated to perform dynamic structural motions, reporting robust responses via plasmonic circular dichroism (CD) spectral changes. This DNA nanodevice&#8208;based system provides a different design to enrich the strategies for constructing synthetic nanomachines, enabling the customized bottom&#8208;up nanostructure construction for sensitive biological signaling.

         <title>Organic Branched Heterostructures with Optical Interconnects for Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronic functions remains challenging. Optical interconnections based on organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) have been synthesized through a sequential self&#8208;assembly process. The accurate spatial organization has been applied to the generation of 2D barcodes.







Abstract
Optical interconnects exhibit superior potential in the precise regulation of photon transmission for organic photonic circuits. However, the rational design of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronics remains challenging. Herein, we designed organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) with accurate spatial organization for optical interconnection. Notably, the precise regulation of OBHs has been controllably achieved including the trunk morphologies and the branched microwire number. Significantly, these as&#8208;prepared OBHs inherently exhibit the multichannel coupling outputs and the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide characteristics, leading to various outcoupling signals with tunable intensity and emission colors. The optical interconnects are realized due to the occurrence of exciton conversion and photon propagation between branch and trunk at the heterojunction, benefiting the application possibilities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) optical barcodes.

         <title>Glutathione Depletion&#8208;Induced Activation of Dimersomes for Potentiating the Ferroptosis and Immunotherapy of &#8220;Cold&#8221; Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>

Vesicles based on cinnamaldehyde dimers (CDC dimersomes) were prepared to enhance the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. The dimersomes depleted intracellular glutathione (GSH) by in&#8197;situ Michael addition and underwent breakage during GSH depletion, which promoted the release of the drug contained inside the vesicle and switching &#8220;ON&#8221; of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes.







Abstract
The abundant glutathione (GSH) in &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors weakens ferroptosis therapy and the immune response. Inspired by lipids, we fabricated cinnamaldehyde dimers (CDC) into lipid&#8208;like materials to form dimersomes capable of depleting GSH and delivering therapeutics to potentiate the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of breast cancer. The dimersomes exhibited superior storage stability for over one year. After reaching the tumor, they quickly underwent breakage in the cytosol owing to the conjugation of hydrophilic GSH on CDC by Michael addition, which not only triggered the drug release and fluorescence switch &#8220;ON&#8221;, but also led to the depletion of intracellular GSH. Ferroptosis was significantly enhanced after combination with sorafenib (SRF) and elicited a robust immune response in&#8197;vivo by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells and the priming of CD8+ T cells. As a result, the CDC@SRF dimersomes cured breast cancer in all the mice after four doses of administration.

         <title>Superstable and Intrinsically Self&#8208;Healing Fibrous Membrane with Bionic Confined Protective Structure for Breathable Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing fibrous membrane with bionic confined protective structure is constructed through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The breathable self&#8208;healing fibrous membrane imitates not only the sensing function, but also the healing process of biological skin, exhibiting great potential for the next&#8208;generation advanced bionic artificial skins.







Abstract
Considerable effort has been devoted to the fabrication of electronic skin that can imitate the self&#8208;healing and sensing function of biological skin. Almost all self&#8208;healing electronic skins are composed of airtight elastomers or hydrogels, which will cause skin inflammation. Fibrous membranes are ideal materials for preparing highly sensitive breathable electronic skins. However, the development of intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with high stability is still a challenge. Here, a novel interface protective strategy is reported to develop intrinsically self&#8208;healing fibrous membranes with a bionic confined structure for the first time, which were further assembled into an all&#8208;fiber structured electronic skin through interfacial hydrogen bonding. The electronic skin is multifunctional with self&#8208;powering, self&#8208;healing, breathability, stretchability, and thermochromism functionalities, which is highly promising for application in intelligent wearable sensing systems.

         <title>Ferroelectric Lithography in Single&#8208;Component Organic Enantiomorphic Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of di(benzylamino)&#8208;substituted muconic derived organic enantiomers were discovered as the first muconic&#8208;based ferroelectrics. They show remarkable ferroelectric lithography with the desired domain structure such as the panda&#8208;like one being precisely achieved by applying a local electric field on a predefined pattern in the thin films, which is rarely found in organic ferroelectrics.







Abstract
Organic ferroelectrics are flexible, lightweight, and bio&#8208;friendly, promising for bio&#8208;harmonized electronic devices, while their ferroelectric lithography remains relatively unexplored. Here, by introducing homochirality and ZE photoisomerization, we obtained a pair of organic enantiomorphic ferroelectrics, di(benzylamino)&#8208;substituted derivatives of muconic acids, the first ferroelectrics in the muconic family. Their ferroelectric and chiral features were confirmed by the polarization&#8211;electric field hysteresis loops and circular dichroism spectra, respectively. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements demonstrate that the desired domain structure can be precisely achieved by applying a local electric field on a predefined pattern in their thin films. Moreover, thermogravimetric analyses reveal that their ferroelectricity can persist up to above 550&#8197;K. The precise pattern lithography and excellent thermal stability make them competitive candidates for ferroelectric lithography.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles through Asymmetric Electrophilic Aromatic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient method for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles has been developed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide array of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles bearing ansa chains with varied length (12&#8208;member to 19&#8208;member) and various functional groups were generated using this method with high to excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An efficient approach for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles (paracyclophanes) has been disclosed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide range of chiral macrocycles bearing varied ring sizes (16 to 23&#8208;membered) and functional group&#8208;containing ansa chains were readily afforded using this method, with excellent yields and high enantioselectivities (23 examples, up to 99.5&#8201;:&#8201;0.5 er). Experimental studies and DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism and origin of stereoselectivities of these reactions. Preliminary utilization of the planar&#8208;chiral macrocycle as chiral organocatalyst showcased the potential applications of these novel chiral skeletons.

         <title>Colloidal Bismuth Chalcohalide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable and versatile colloidal synthetic method to prepare mixed anion semiconductor nanocrystals of the V&#8211;VI&#8211;VII group, namely bismuth chalcohalides, is presented. The chemical stability and the optical absorption properties of the colloidal bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals may set this class of materials as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;harvesting purposes.







Abstract
Here we present a colloidal approach to synthesize bismuth chalcohalide nanocrystals (BiEX NCs, in which E=S, Se and X=Cl, Br, I). Our method yields orthorhombic elongated BiEX NCs, with BiSCl crystallizing in a previously unknown polymorph. The BiEX NCs display a composition&#8208;dependent band gap spanning the visible spectral range and absorption coefficients exceeding 105&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The BiEX NCs show chemical stability at standard laboratory conditions and form colloidal inks in different solvents. These features enable the solution processing of the NCs into robust solid films yielding stable photoelectrochemical current densities under solar&#8208;simulated irradiation. Overall, our versatile synthetic protocol may prove valuable in accessing colloidal metal chalcohalide nanomaterials at large and contributes to establish metal chalcohalides as a promising complement to metal chalcogenides and halides for applied nanotechnology.

         <title>Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes: Synthesis, Structures, and Ring Reconstruction via Atom Transfer under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monoazadichalcogenasumanenes was synthesized that are deep &#960;&#8208;bowls with the bowl&#8208;depth reaching up to 0.95&#8197;&#197;, and thus exceeding that of corannulene. They undergo ring reconstruction under acidic conditions, as a result of protonation&#8208;induced chalcogen atom transfer.







Abstract
Buckybowls have unique properties that can be tailored by embedding main&#8208;group elements into their &#960;&#8208;scaffolds. Herein, a synthetic approach is developed for producing monoazadichalcogenasumanenes (4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b) derived from sumanene by replacing its three benzylic carbons with one nitrogen and two chalcogen atoms (S for 4&#8201;a/4&#8201;b, Se for 6&#8201;a/6&#8201;b, Te for 7&#8201;a/7&#8201;b). Monoazadichalcogenasumanenes are deeper &#960;&#8208;bowls than trichalcogensumanenes as the C&#8722;N bond is much shorter than C&#8722;X (X=S, Se, Te). The bowl&#8208;depth of 4&#8201;b (0.95&#8197;&#197;) is greater than that of corannulene (0.85&#8197;&#197;). The nitrogen atom donates electron density to the entire &#960;&#8208;system that makes monoazadichalcogenasumanenes electron&#8208;rich. They undergo ring reconstruction of chalcogenophene ring via transferring a chalcogen atom from one molecule to another under acidic conditions. The nitrogen and chalcogen atoms play crucial role on this reaction.

         <title>Investigation of Carboxylic Acid Isosteres and Prodrugs for Inhibition of the Human SIRT5 Lysine Deacylase Enzyme**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SAR study of mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors of the sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) hydrolase, containing isosteres of an essential carboxylic acid moiety, furnished heterocycles with excellent potency and slow, tight&#8208;binding kinetics against the enzyme. Evaluation of selected compounds in cells revealed that transient masking of the heterocycle provided improved inhibitors with a high level of target engagement in cultured cells.







Abstract
Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) is a protein lysine deacylase enzyme that regulates diverse biology by hydrolyzing &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;carboxyacyllysine posttranslational modifications in the cell. Inhibition of SIRT5 has been linked to potential treatment of several cancers but potent compounds with activity in cells have been lacking. Here we developed mechanism&#8208;based inhibitors that incorporate isosteres of a carboxylic acid residue that is important for high&#8208;affinity binding to the enzyme active site. By masking of the tetrazole moiety of the most potent candidate from our initial SAR study, we achieved potent and cytoselective growth inhibition for the treatment of SIRT5&#8208;dependent leukemic cancer cell lines in culture. Thus, we provide an efficient, cellularly active small molecule that targets SIRT5, which can help elucidate its function and potential as a future drug target. This work shows that masked isosteres of carboxylic acids are viable chemical motifs for the development of inhibitors that target mitochondrial enzymes, which may have applications beyond the sirtuin field.

         <title>A General Design Strategy Enabling the Synthesis of Hydrolysis&#8208;Resistant, Water&#8208;Stable Titanium(IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thorough characterization of aqueous stable bidentate chelate systems with Ti4+ including speciation, DFT, and structural characterization of key complexes is reported. Hexadentate analogs of the high&#8208;performing bidentate chelators were also assessed and were assessed for the potential use in kit&#8208;based PET imaging with 45Ti4+.







Abstract
Despite its prevalence in the environment, the chemistry of the Ti4+ ion has long been relegated to organic solutions or hydrolyzed TiO2 polymorphs. A knowledge gap in stabilizing molecular Ti4+ species in aqueous environments has prevented the use of this ion for various applications such as radioimaging, design of water&#8208;compatible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and aqueous&#8208;phase catalysis applications. Herein, we show a thorough thermodynamic screening of bidentate chelators with Ti4+ in aqueous solution, as well as computational and structural analyses of key compounds. In addition, the hexadentate analogues of catechol (benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol) and deferiprone (3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4(1H)&#8208;pyridone), TREN&#8208;CAM and THPMe respectively, were assessed for chelation of the 45Ti isotope (t1/2=3.08&#8197;h, &#946;+=85&#8201;%, E&#946;+=439&#8197;keV) towards positron emission tomography (PET) imaging applications. Both were found to have excellent capacity for kit&#8208;formulation, and [45Ti]Ti&#8208;TREN&#8208;CAM was found to have remarkable stability in vivo.

         <title>Intramolecular Partners in Asymmetric Catalysis Copolymerization: Highly Enantioselective and Controllable at Enhanced Temperatures and Low Loadings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent enantioselectivity, activity and no transesterification side reactions were achieved in the asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxides and anhydrides at low catalyst loadings or/and enhanced temperatures via intramolecularly bimetallic and multichiral synergistic catalysis.







Abstract
Asymmetric copolymerization of meso&#8208;epoxide and anhydride is a powerful strategy for preparing various isotactic polyesters with two contiguous stereogenic centers. However, the previous binary systems suffered from slow rates at low loadings, poor enantioselectivities and transesterification reactions at enhanced temperatures. Herein, we report novel dinuclear aluminium complexes with multiple chiralities and ammonium salts anchored on ligand frameworks. These bifunctional catalysts exhibit high activities and enantioselectivities for epoxides/anhydrides copolymerizations at harsh conditions via intramolecularly synergistic catalysis, affording polyesters with unprecedented molecular weights and narrow distributions. Notably, no transesterification reactions were observed, significantly different from the binary catalyst/cocatalyst pairs. This study represents a rare example regarding temperature&#8208;independent asymmetric induction for preparing chiral polymers from achiral monomers.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Electron Density Study of the Chemical Bonding Origin of Glass Formation in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical bonding difference between the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni MOF and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni was investigated by 25&#8197;K X&#8208;ray electron density analysis, and multi&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography establishing the correlation between chemical bonding and meltability in MOFs. Then systematic tuning of the thermal stability with Co doping was demonstrated in a series of CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3&#8211;0.003) MOF solid solutions.







Abstract
Glass&#8208;forming metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have novel applications, but the origin of their peculiar melting behavior is unclear. Here, we report synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction electron densities of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni. Electron density analysis shows that the Zn&#8722;N bonds are more ionic than the Co&#8722;N bonds, which have distinct covalent features. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectra reveal the onset of significant imidazolate bond weakening in Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni above 673&#8197;K. Melting can be controlled by tuning the metal&#8211;ligand and imidazole bonding strength as shown from thermal analysis of nine solid&#8208;solution CoxZn1&#8722;x&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x=0.3 to 0.003) MOFs, and a mere 4&#8201;% Co&#8208;doping into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni results in thermal decomposition instead of melting. The present findings demonstrate the key role of the metal&#8211;ligand bonds and imidazolate bonds in controlling the delicate balance between melting and decomposition processes in this class of ZIF compounds.

&lt;p&gt;The chemical bonding difference between the glass-forming Zn-ZIF-zni MOF and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co-ZIF-zni was investigated by 25&#8197;K X-ray electron density analysis, and multi-temperature Raman spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography establishing the correlation between chemical bonding and meltability in MOFs. Then systematic tuning of the thermal stability with Co doping was demonstrated in a series of Co&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Potential Cathodes with Nitrogen Active Centres for Quasi&#8208;Solid Proton&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly proposed 2,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene bis((ethylsulfonyl)amide) (HDC) can deliver a high working potential and stable cycle performance over 2000&#8197;cycles in a stainless&#8208;steel case based on a nitrogen active centre.







Abstract
Although proton&#8208;ion batteries have received considerable attention owing to their reliability, safety, toxin&#8208;free nature, and low cost, their development remains in the early stages because of lacking proper electrolytes and cathodes for facilitating a high output voltage and stable cycle performance. We present a novel cathode based on active nitrogen centre, which provides a flat discharge plateau at 1&#8197;V with a capacity of 115&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and excellent stability. Moreover, a quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte was developed to overcome the issue of corrosion, broaden the potential window of the electrolyte, and prevent the active material from dissolving. While using the unique as&#8208;developed electrolyte, the newly designed cathode retained 89.67&#8201;% of its original capacity after 2000&#8197;cycles. Finally, we demonstrated the excellent cycle performance of the as&#8208;developed metal&#8208;free, flexible, soft&#8208;packed battery. Notably, even when a portion of the battery was cut off, it continued to function normally.

         <title>Modular Access to Diverse Chemiluminescent Dioxetane&#8208;Luminophores through Convergent Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores was developed. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible.







Abstract
Adamantyl&#8208;dioxetane luminophores are an important class of chemiluminescent molecular probes for diagnostics and imaging. We have developed a new efficient synthetic route for preparation of adamantyl&#8208;enolether as precursors for dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores. The synthesis is convergent, using an unusual Stille cross&#8208;coupling reaction employing a stannane&#8208;enolether, to directly afford adamantyl&#8208;enolether. In a following simple step, the dioxetane is obtained by oxidation of the enolether precursor with singlet&#8208;oxygen. The scope of this synthetic route is broad since a large number of haloaryl substrates are either commercially available or easily accessible. Such a late&#8208;stage derivatization strategy simplifies the rapid exploration of novel luminogenic molecular structures in a library format and simplifies the synthesis of known dioxetane luminophores. We expect that this new synthetic strategy will be particularly useful in the design and synthesis of yet unexplored dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores.

Treating a super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole with 2&#8197;equivalents of cis&#8208;protected [M(dppp)(OTf)2] as the metal corners (M=Pt, Pd; dppp=1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane) has led to the formation of a dinuclear metallobridged cavitand. Inclusion complexes of the metallocavitand are formed as single conformers and the dimensions of their open portals are dependent of the included guests.







Abstract
A super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole equipped with four oxazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyrazinyl units at its upper rim is reported. Its PtII/PdII&#8208;metallobridged cavitand counterparts were obtained by treatment with 2&#8197;equiv of cis&#8208;protected metal corners, [M(dppp)(OTf)2] (dppp=1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane). The metal corners arranged their axial phenyl substituents near the aromatic walls of the cavitand leading to the formation of inclusion complexes as single conformers. We characterized the inclusion complexes in solution using NMR spectroscopy. Selected complexes were also characterized in the gas&#8208;phase and in the solid&#8208;state using mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The dimensions of the open portals of the dinuclear complexes were found to be dependent on the included guest. The results of DFT calculations served to explain the dissimilar complexation&#8208;induced shifts observed in the dinuclear inclusion complexes with mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;formamide guests.

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Controlled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylic Allylation of Unactivated Electron&#8208;Deficient Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of unactivated heterocyclic aromatic compounds is described. The selective deprotonation of benzylic sites is hypothesized to be controlled by the original coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)2. In addition to the pro&#8208;nucleophiles, readily available bromide and chloride electrophiles could be used.







Abstract
Heterocycles are widespread in pharmaceuticals but methods for their transition metal&#8208;catalyzed functionalization remain limited. This report describes a general, mild, and effective nickel&#8208;catalyzed benzylic allylation and benzylation of 14 types of heterocyclic aromatic compounds, including pyridines, pyrazines, pyrimidines, pyridazines, triazines, benzimidazoles, oxazoles, thiazoles, as well as 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;indoles. The exquisite selectivity for benzylic sites at the 2&#8208;position is hypothesized to be controlled by coordination of a heterocyclic nitrogen to Zn(TMP)2 subverting generally presumed pKa&#8217;s of benzylic protons. Furthermore, the broad range of heterocyclic substrates, the diversity of electrophiles, and excellent functional group compatibility suggest its future application to synthesis of complex molecules and library diversification in drug discovery.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrothermal Flow&#8208;Enhanced Magneto Biosensor for Highly Sensitive Protein Detection in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast magneto biosensor, which employs AC electrothermally driven flow (ACEF) for accelerated mass transport and enhanced immunocomplex formation, is developed for highly sensitive protein measurement in whole blood samples.







Abstract
Current diagnostic tests for sensitive protein detection rely on immunological techniques, such as ELISA, which require sample purification, multiple washing steps and lengthy incubation, hindering their use for rapid testing. Here, we report a simple electrothermal flow&#8208;enhanced biosensor for ultrafast, high sensitivity measurements of protein biomarkers in whole blood. Magnetic nanobeads dually&#8208;labeled with a detection antibody and enzyme reporter are used to form immunocomplexes with the target protein, which are readily transported to the sensor via magnetic concentration. The incorporation of electrothermal flows enhances immunocomplex formation, allowing for rapid and sensitive detection without requiring blood purification or lengthy incubation. Proof of concept was carried out using Plasmodium falciparum histidine&#8208;rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria parasite biomarker, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 5.7&#8197;pg&#8201;mL&#8722;1 (95&#8197;fM) in whole blood in 7&#8197;min. The speed, sensitivity and simplicity of this device make it attractive for rapid diagnostic testing.

         <title>Tandem Macrolactone Synthesis: Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Exiguolide by a Macrocyclization/Transannular Pyran Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic tandem reaction integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was developed to access tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones in a single step from readily available linear precursors. To illustrate the feasibility of the synthetic strategy, an antitumor marine macrolide, (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, was synthesized in just 13 steps from a commercially available compound.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones were synthesized by integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition under gold and ruthenium catalysis. Single&#8208;step access to a variety of 14&#8208; to 20&#8208;membered macrolactones containing a tetrahydropyran ring was possible from readily available linear precursors in good yields and with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. A 13&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, an anticancer marine macrolide, showcased the feasibility of our tandem reaction sequence for macrolactone synthesis and also demonstrated the power of transannular reactions for rapid assembly of the tetrahydropyran rings of the target natural product.

         <title>4&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Butyric Acid&#8208;Assisted In Situ Passivation Strategy for Superstable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbX3 Quantum Dots in Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CsPbX3 (CPX) QDs via in situ crystallization with synergistic effects of BBA and OLA in polar solvent is proposed. The results not only provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents but also shed more light on their surface chemistry.







Abstract
A crucial challenge is to develop an in situ passivation treatment strategy for CsPbX3 (CPX, X=Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (QDs) and simultaneously retain their luminous efficiency and wavelength. Here, a facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CPX QDs via in situ crystallization with the synergistic effect of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyric acid (BBA) and oleylamine (OLA) in polar solvents including aqueous solution and a possible fundamental mechanism are proposed. Monodispersed CsPbBr3 (CPB) QDs obtained in water show high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 86.4&#8201;% and their PL features of CPB QDs have no significant change after being dispersed in aqueous solution for 96&#8197;h, which implies the structure of CPB QDs is unchanged. The results provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents and shed more light on their surface chemistry.

         <title>Sustainable Thioetherification via Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Photoactivation Using Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex thioetherification was developed using simple organic compounds (thianthrenium salts and thiols) and visible&#8208;light irradiation under open&#8208;to&#8208;air conditions. This protocol allows the retention of the C&#8722;X bond, as well as the late&#8208;stage thioetherification of biomolecules.







Abstract
The synthesis of sulfides has been widely studied because this functional subunit is prevalent in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals, as well as being a useful synthetic platform for further elaboration. Thus, various methods to build C&#8722;S bonds have been developed, but typically they require the use of precious metals or harsh conditions. Electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategies have emerged as versatile and sustainable ways to achieve C&#8722;S bond formation, avoiding challenges associated with previous methods. This work describes an open&#8208;to&#8208;air, photoinduced, site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H thioetherification from readily available reagents via EDA complex formation that tolerates a wide range of different functional groups. Moreover, C(sp2)&#8722;halogen bonds remain intact using this protocol, allowing late&#8208;stage installation of the sulfide motif in various bioactive scaffolds, while allowing yet further modification through more traditional C&#8722;X bond cleavage protocols. Additionally, various mechanistic investigations support the envisioned EDA complex scenario.

         <title>Synthesis of FeIII and FeIV Cyanide Complexes Using Hypervalent Iodine Reagents as Cyano&#8208;Transfer One&#8208;Electron Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes react with iron(II) and iron(III) complexes as cyano&#8208;transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants. This approach enables the straightforward synthesis of iron(III) and iron(IV) cyanide complexes, which have been thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray diffraction, EPR, M&#246;ssbauer and NMR spectroscopies and computational methods.







Abstract
We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano &#955;3&#8208;iodanes as group transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants to synthesize FeIII and FeIV cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high&#8208;valent FeIV compounds without &#960;&#8208;donor ligands (such as oxido (O2&#8722;), imido (RN2&#8722;) or nitrido (N3&#8722;)) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an FeIV cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeCN] (4) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from FeII precursor [(N3N&#8242;)FeLi(THF)] (1) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The FeIV complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII] (3) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of FeII with 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(1H)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of FeIII cyanide complex [(N3N&#8242;)FeIII(CN)(Li)(THF)3] (2&#8208;LiTHF). Complexes 4 and 2&#8208;LiTHF have been structurally characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano &#955;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-iodanes as group transfer one-electron oxidants to synthesize Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high-valent Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; compounds without &#960;-donor ligands (such as oxido (O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), imido (RN&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) or nitrido (N&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;)) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; cyanide complex [(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8242;)FeCN] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; precursor [(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8242;)FeLi(THF)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8242;)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; with 1-cyano-3,3-dimethyl-3-(1H)-1,2-benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; cyanide complex [(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&#8242;)Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)(Li)(THF)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2-Li&lt;sup&gt;THF&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;). Complexes &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2-Li&lt;sup&gt;THF&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; have been structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoaffinity Capture Compounds to Profile the Magic Spot Nucleotide Interactomes**
</title>

Molecular fishing: A family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds enables the identification of putative Magic Spot Nucleotide receptors by a chemoproteomics approach. The resulting datasets cover several bacterial species, correlate with distinct nucleotide phosphorylation patterns and represent high&#8208;value starting points for future investigations into the complex stringent response mechanism.







Abstract
Magic Spot Nucleotides (MSN) regulate the stringent response, a highly conserved bacterial stress adaptation mechanism, enabling survival under adverse external challenges. In times of antibiotic crisis, a detailed understanding of stringent response is essential, as potentially new targets for pharmacological intervention could be identified. In this study, we delineate the MSN interactome in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium applying a family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds. We introduce MSN probes covering a diverse phosphorylation pattern, such as pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp. Our chemical proteomics approach provides datasets of putative MSN receptors both from cytosolic and membrane fractions that unveil new MSN targets. We find that the activity of the non&#8208;Nudix hydrolase ApaH is potently inhibited by pppGpp, which itself is converted to pGpp by ApaH. The capture compounds described herein will be useful to identify MSN interactomes across bacterial species.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Nucleophilic Allylation of Azinium Ions with Allylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic allylations of pyridinium and quinolinium ions with allylboronates are reported. Transmetalation of the allylboronate with gold produces nucleophilic allylgold(I) species that add to the 4&#8208;position of the azinium ion with complete regioselectivity to give functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines and 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insight.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed nucleophilic allylations of pyridinium and quinolinium ions with various allyl pinacolboronates are reported. The reactions are completely selective with respect to the site of the azinium ion that is attacked, to give various functionalized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines and 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines. Evidence suggests that the reactions proceed through nucleophilic allylgold(I) intermediates formed by transmetalation from allylboronates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided mechanistic insight.

         <title>Light&#8208;Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvester Using Photoactive Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porphyrin metal&#8211;organic framework membrane has been fabricated by a facile cathodic deposition method. The high ion selectivity and permeability endow the MOF membrane with a great performance in osmotic energy harvesting, and this performance can be further improved by the photoactive porphyrin ligands upon light irradiation.







Abstract
High ion selectivity and permeability, as two contradictory aspects for the membrane design, highly hamper the development of osmotic energy harvesting technologies. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra&#8208;small and high&#8208;density pores and functional surface groups show great promise in tackling these problems. Here, we propose a facile and mild cathodic deposition method to directly prepare crack&#8208;free porphyrin MOF membranes on a porous anodic aluminum oxide for osmotic energy harvesting. The abundant carboxyl groups of the functionalized porphyrin ligands together with the nanoporous structure endows the MOF membrane with high cation selectivity and ion permeability, thus a large output power density of 6.26&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 is achieved. The photoactive porphyrin ligands further lead to an improvement of the power density to 7.74&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 upon light irradiation. This work provides a promising strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance osmotic energy harvesting systems.

         <title>Single Stabilizing Point Mutation Enables High&#8208;Resolution Co&#8208;Crystal Structures of the Adenosine A2A Receptor with Preladenant Conjugates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;stable adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) containing a single point mutation in the transmembrane regions was developed by imitating an allosteric Na+ through introduction of a basic amino acid residue. This allowed the determination of high&#8208;resolution co&#8208;crystal structures with newly designed PEGylated and fluorophore&#8208;labeled Preladenant derivatives, which belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists endowed with outstanding selectivity.







Abstract
The G protein&#8208;coupled adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) is an important new (potential) drug target in immuno&#8208;oncology, and for neurodegenerative diseases. Preladenant and its derivatives belong to the most potent A2AAR antagonists displaying exceptional selectivity. While crystal structures of the human A2AAR have been solved, mostly using the A2A&#8208;StaR2 protein that bears 9 point mutations, co&#8208;crystallization with Preladenant derivatives has so far been elusive. We developed a new A2AAR construct harboring a single point mutation (S913.39K) which renders it extremely thermostable. This allowed the co&#8208;crystallization of two novel Preladenant derivatives, the polyethylene glycol&#8208;conjugated (PEGylated) PSB&#8208;2113, and the fluorophore&#8208;labeled PSB&#8208;2115. The obtained crystal structures (2.25&#8197;&#197; and 2.6&#8197;&#197; resolution) provide explanations for the high potency and selectivity of Preladenant derivatives. They represent the first crystal structures of a GPCR in complex with PEG&#8208; and fluorophore&#8208;conjugated ligands. The applied strategy is predicted to be applicable to further class A GPCRs.

         <title>Transforming Dyes into Fluorophores: Exciton&#8208;Induced Emission with Chain&#8208;like Oligo&#8208;BODIPY Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dark BODIPY dyes are able to fully recover their fluorescence properties when linked via a flexible ethylene tether. Various excited state deactivation channels are shown to become drastically mitigated by formation of stable excitons within conformationally unstable, discrete superstructures. This study might open doors to a novel assay for detection and visualization of spatial, molecular encounters.







Abstract
Herein we present a systematic study demonstrating to which extent exciton formation can amplify fluorescence based on a series of ethylene&#8208;bridged oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. A set of non&#8208; and weakly fluorescent BODIPY motifs was selected and transformed into discrete, chain&#8208;like oligomers by linkage via a flexible ethylene tether. The prepared superstructures constitute excitonically active entities with non&#8208;conjugated, Coulomb&#8208;coupled oscillators. The non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels of Internal Conversion (IC), also combined with an upstream reductive Photoelectron Transfer (rPET) and Intersystem Crossing (ISC) were addressed at the monomeric state and the evolution of fluorescence and (non&#8208;)radiative decay rates studied along the oligomeric series. We demonstrate that a &#8220;masked&#8221; fluorescence can be fully reactivated irrespective of the imposed conformational rigidity. This work challenges the paradigm that a collective fluorescence enhancement is limited to sterically induced motional restrictions.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polymer Brushes for Protein Capture and Release in Biological Environments**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;responsive polymer brushes are presented that are compatible with electrochemical control. The brushes can be reversibly switched between protein binding and repelling states at fully physiological conditions with respect to salt, pH and buffering capacity. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle experiments are shown for applications such as non&#8208;fouling, patterning and controlled release of proteins in biological environments.







Abstract
Interfaces functionalized with polymers are known for providing excellent resistance towards biomolecular adsorption and for their ability to bind high amounts of protein while preserving their structure. However, making an interface that switches between these two states has proven challenging and concepts to date rely on changes in the physiochemical environment, which is static in biological systems. Here we present the first interface that can be electrically switched between a high&#8208;capacity (&gt;1&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2) multilayer protein binding state and a completely non&#8208;fouling state (no detectable adsorption). Switching is possible over multiple cycles without any regeneration. Importantly, switching works even when the interface is in direct contact with biological fluids and a buffered environment. The technology offers many applications such as zero fouling on demand, patterning or separation of proteins as well as controlled release of biologics in a physiological environment, showing high potential for future drug delivery in vivo.

         <title>Identifying Performance Descriptors in CO2 Hydrogenation over Iron&#8208;Based Catalysts Promoted with Alkali Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron carbides (FeCx) presence in Fe&#8208;based catalysts does not secure efficient CO2 hydrogenation to C2+&#8208;hydrocarbons. The efficiency depends on the ability of FeCx to activate CO, CO2 and H2. The kinetics of these processes is affected by perturbation of electronic properties of Fe in FeCx by an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb or Cs) promoter. This knowledge can be valued for the design of catalysts for other reactions where such promoters are used.







Abstract
Alkali metal promoters have been widely employed for preparation of heterogeneous catalysts used in many industrially important reactions. However, the fundamentals of their effects are usually difficult to access. Herein, we unravel mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the role of alkali metals in CO2 hydrogenation over Fe&#8208;based catalysts through state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques, spatially resolved steady&#8208;state and transient kinetic analyses. The promoters affect electronic properties of iron in iron carbides. These carbide characteristics determine catalyst ability to activate H2, CO and CO2. The Allen scale electronegativity of alkali metal promoter was successfully correlated with the rates of CO2 hydrogenation to higher hydrocarbons and CH4 as well as with the rate constants of individual steps of CO or CO2 activation. The derived knowledge can be valuable for designing and preparing catalysts applied in other reactions where such promoters are also used.

         <title>Steric Modulation of Spiro Structure for Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating a three&#8208;dimensional spiro unit into multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, the device efficiency is increased to nearly 1.5&#8197;times that of the unhindered emitter. Notably, the linkage pattern with spatial interaction and hindrance can maintain the narrow FWHM and curb unfavorable redshifts at a high doping ratio.







Abstract
A multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecule with a fused, planar architecture tends to aggregate at high doping ratios, resulting in broad full width at half maximum (FWHM), redshifting electroluminescence peaks, and low device efficiency. Herein, we propose a mono&#8208;substituted design strategy by introducing spiro&#8208;9,9&#8242;&#8208;bifluorene (SBF) units with different substituted sites into the MR&#8208;TADF system for the first time. As a classic steric group, SBF can hinder interchromophore interactions, leading to high device efficiency (32.2&#8211;35.9&#8201;%) and narrow&#8208;band emission (&#8776;27&#8197;nm). Particularly, the shield&#8208;like molecule, SF1BN, seldom exhibits a broadened FWHM as the doping ratio rises, which differs from the C3&#8208;substituted isomer and unhindered parent emitter. These results manifest an effective method for constructing highly efficient MR&#8208;TADF emitters through a spiro strategy and elucidate the feasibility for steric modulation of the spiro structure in &#960;&#8208;framework.

         <title>Revisiting the Bonding Model for Gold(I) Species: The Importance of Pauli Repulsion Revealed in a Gold(I)&#8208;Cyclobutadiene Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel AuI&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex for which reduced Pauli repulsion yields an &#951;1 instead of &#951;4&#8208;coordination is presented. This combined experimental and theoretical study motivates a reformulation of the gold(I)&#8208;&#960;&#8208;ligand bonding model to include Pauli repulsion as a key element. Further analysis of gold(I)&#8208;alkynes corroborates this conclusion.







Abstract
Understanding the bonding of gold(I) species has been central to the development of gold(I) catalysis. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of the first gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene complex, accompanied with bonding analysis by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy decomposition analysis methods. Analysis of possible coordination modes for the new species not only confirms established characteristics of gold(I) bonding, but also suggests that Pauli repulsion is a key yet hitherto overlooked element. Additionally, we obtain a new perspective on gold(I)&#8208;bonding by comparison of the gold(I)&#8208;cyclobutadiene to congeners stabilized by p&#8208;, d&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals. Consequently, we refine the gold(I) bonding model, with a delicate interplay of Pauli repulsion and charge transfer as the key driving force for various coordination motifs. Pauli repulsion is similarly determined as a significant interaction in AuI&#8208;alkyne species, corroborating this revised understanding of AuI bonding.

Consequently, we refine the gold(I) bonding model, with a delicate interplay of Pauli repulsion and charge transfer as the key driving force for various coordination motifs. Pauli repulsion is similarly determined as a significant interaction in Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;-alkyne species, corroborating this revised understanding of Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of functional gels with anion&#8208;coordinated architecture junctions will open up a new avenue for the design and fabrication of a broad range of smart materials. In their Communication (e202201793), Dong Yang and co&#8208;workers report a series of C2&#8208;symmetric anion&#8208;binding ligands equipped with ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(urea) and amine or amide ends, which generated A2L3 triple helical architectures upon self&#8208;assembly with phosphate ions. Hierarchical intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the terminal amine/amide groups and urea moieties resulted in the formation of functional gels.

         <dc:description>
The generation of an active [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase , the most efficient enzyme for H2 production, requires the synthesis of a complex metal center, the H&#8208;cluster, which is responsible for the reversible reduction of protons to H2. In their Communication (e202203413), Joan&#8197;B. Broderick and co&#8208;workers show that the last step of this synthesis, which consists of the assembly of the azadithiolate bridging molecule, involves the aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein from the glycine cleavage system.

Glutathione (GSH) is abundant in &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors and adversely affects ferroptosis therapy and immune response. In their Research Article (e202202843), Minjie Sun and co&#8208;workers developed cinnamaldehyde&#8208;dimer&#8208;based vesicles (CDC dimersomes) capable of depleting intracellular GSH via Michael addition to potentiate the ferroptosis and immunotherapy of breast cancer by turning the &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor into a &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor. CDC is the first drug&#8208;dimer&#8208;based vesicle applied for immune activation, inspiring the future design of functional vesicles.

The adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR), which is activated by the extracellular nucleoside adenosine, belongs to the family of G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). A2AAR antagonists are beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and have shown potential as novel checkpoint inhibitors in cancer immunotherapy. The illustration shows a new A2AAR crystal in complex with a fluorescence&#8208;labeled antagonist integrated into the cell membrane. Details of the study are reported by Christa&#8197;E. M&#252;ller and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202115545).

         <title>Exovinylene Cyclic Carbonates: Multifaceted CO2&#8208;Based Building Blocks for Modern Chemistry and Polymer Science</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exovinylene cyclic carbonates are emerging multifaceted scaffolds in organic chemistry and polymer sciences. This Review covers catalytic concepts for the synthesis of these heterocycles from CO2 and describes the large portfolio of organic synthons and highly relevant functional polymers that are now accessible via their smart chemical transformation, generally under mild conditions.







Abstract
Carbon dioxide is a renewable, inexhaustible, and cheap alternative to fossil resources for the production of fine chemicals and plastics. It can notably be converted into exovinylene cyclic carbonates, unique synthons gaining momentum for the preparation of an impressive range of important organic molecules and functional polymers, in reactions proceeding with 100&#8201;% atom economy under mild operating conditions in most cases. This Review summarizes the recent advances in their synthesis with particular attention on describing the catalysts needed for their preparation and discussing the unique reactivity of these CO2&#8208;based heterocycles for the construction of diverse organic building blocks and (functional) polymers. We also discuss the challenges and the future perspectives in the field.

         <title>The Limited Palette for Photonic Block&#8208;Copolymer Materials: A Historical Problem or a Practical Limitation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of block&#8208;copolymers into photonic films and pigments has drawn significant attention due to the tunability of the optical response. In this Scientific Perspective we identify and rationalize the limited range of monomers and polymerization methods employed to produce such structurally colored materials to date. By considering historical development and practical limitations, new strategies are proposed to inspire new research directions.







Abstract
Block&#8208;copolymer self&#8208;assembly has proven to be an effective route for the fabrication of photonic films and, more recently, photonic pigments. However, despite extensive research on this topic over the past two decades, the palette of monomers and polymers employed to produce such structurally colored materials has remained surprisingly limited. In this Scientific Perspective, the commonly used block&#8208;copolymer systems reported in the literature are summarized (considering both linear and brush architectures) and their use is rationalized from the point of view of both their historical development and physicochemical constraints. Finally, the current challenges facing the field are discussed and promising new areas of research are highlighted to inspire the community to pursue new directions.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Adhesive and Conductive Gels with Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of C2&#8208;symmetric anion&#8208;binding ligands equipped with ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(urea) and amine/amide ends were designed, which could firstly self&#8208;assemble into triple helicates by coordination with phosphate ions and subsequently form gels through multiple intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The obtained gels exhibit effective and stable adhesive properties, selective wettability, and conductivity.







Abstract
The fabrication of anion&#8208;coordinated assemblies into functional soft materials remains a major challenge. To this end, four C2&#8208;symmetric anion&#8208;binding ligands equipped with ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(urea) and amine or amide ends were designed, which generated A2L3 triple helical architectures upon self&#8208;assembly with phosphate ions. Hierarchical intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the terminal amine/amide groups and urea moieties resulted in the formation of functional gels. The obtained gels were further applied for conductive adhesion between different surfaces, displaying excellent flexibility and selective wettability. The viscoelastic gels constructed from anion&#8208;coordinated assemblies described in this work represent the first example of a new class of anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven smart materials.

         <title>[FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase: Defined Lysate&#8208;Free Maturation Reveals a Key Role for Lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;Protein in DTMA Ligand Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein (Hmet) of the glycine cleavage system (GCS) is shown to play a key role in maturation of the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase. Including Hmet, or Hmet plus other components of the GCS, allows maturation by purified HydE, HydF, and HydG in the absence of cell lysate for the first time.







Abstract
Maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase (HydA) involves synthesis of a CO, CN&#8722;, and dithiomethylamine (DTMA)&#8208;coordinated 2Fe subcluster that is inserted into HydA to make the active hydrogenase. This process requires three maturation enzymes: the radical S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) enzymes HydE and HydG, and the GTPase HydF. In vitro maturation with purified maturation enzymes has been possible only when clarified cell lysate was added, with the lysate presumably providing essential components for DTMA synthesis and delivery. Here we report maturation of [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase using a fully defined system that includes components of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), but no cell lysate. Our results reveal for the first time an essential role for the aminomethyl&#8208;lipoyl&#8208;H&#8208;protein of the GCS in hydrogenase maturation and the synthesis of the DTMA ligand of the H&#8208;cluster. In addition, we show that ammonia is the source of the bridgehead nitrogen of DTMA.

         <title>White&#8208;Light Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Chiral Copper(I) Coordination Polymer through Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of chiral CuI coordination polymers (1&#8208;P/M) were produced from achiral precursors by crystallization&#8208;driven symmetry&#8208;breaking assembly. The enantiomers feature unique helical layered structures and tunable dual&#8208;emission photoluminescence, achieving intrinsic &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8208;white emitting with an ultra&#8208;high color rendering index (93.4) and circularly polarized luminescence with a remarkable dissymmetry factor (8&#215;10&#8722;3) simultaneously.







Abstract
Achieving white&#8208;light emission, especially white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a single&#8208;phase material is challenging. Herein, a pair of chiral CuI coordination polymers (1&#8208;M and 1&#8208;P) have been prepared by the asymmetrical assembly of achiral ligands and Cu2I2 clusters. The compounds display dual emission bands and can be used as single&#8208;phase white&#8208;light phosphors, achieving a &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode with an ultra&#8208;high color rendering index (CRI) of 93.4 and an appropriate correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3632&#8197;K. Meanwhile, corresponding CPL signals with maximum dissymmetry factor |glum|=8&#215;10&#8722;3 have been observed. Hence, intrinsic white&#8208;light emission and CPL have been realized simultaneously in coordination polymers for the first time. This work gains insight into the nature of chiral assembly from achiral units and offers a prospect for the development of single&#8208;phase white&#8208;CPL materials.

         <title>Inhibition of Alkali Metal Reduction of 1&#8208;Adamantanol by London Dispersion Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
London dispersion (LD) effects limit the reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol, despite the use of excess alkali metals Li, Na and K. An unusual sodium complex featuring the adamantoxide and two datively&#8208;coordinated 1&#8208;adamantanol molecules was isolated. This structure showed that the adamantyl moieties cluster together on one&#8208;side of the NaO3 plane, and featured many intramolecular close contacts, as a result of the LD&#8208;effects present.







Abstract
A series of alkali metal 1&#8208;adamantoxide (OAd1) complexes of formula [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2], where M=Li, Na or K, were synthesised by reduction of 1&#8208;adamantanol with excess of the alkali metal. The syntheses indicated that only one out of every three HOAd1 molecules was reduced. An X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the sodium derivative shows that the complex features two unreduced HOAd1 donors as well as the reduced alkoxide (OAd1), with the Ad1 fragments clustered together on the same side of the NaO3 plane, contrary to steric considerations. This is the first example of an alkali metal reduction of an alcohol that is inhibited from completion due to the formation of the [M(OAd1)(HOAd1)2] complexes, stabilized by London dispersion effects. NMR spectroscopic studies revealed similar structures for the lithium and potassium derivatives. Computational analyses indicate that decisive London dispersion effects in the molecular structure are a consequence of the many C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;C interactions between the OAd1 groups.

         <title>Dinitrogen Coordination to a High&#8208;Spin Diiron(I/II) Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dinitrogen coordination to multiiron complexes is instrumental in understanding the reactivity of nitrogenases cofactors. The synthesis of a high&#8208;spin mixed&#8208;valent cis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;dinitrogen)diiron(I/II) complex obtained by a one&#8208;electron reduction of a diiron(II/II) precursor is reported. The electronic structure of the complex was studied using M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry, and DFT calculations, which support a S=7/2 ground state.







Abstract
Dinitrogen coordination to iron centers underpins industrial and biological fixation in the Haber&#8211;Bosch process and by the FeM cofactors in the nitrogenase enzymes. The latter employ local high&#8208;spin metal centers; however, iron&#8211;dinitrogen coordination chemistry remains dominated by low&#8208;valent states, contrasting the enzyme systems. Here, we report a high&#8208;spin mixed&#8208;valent cis&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;dinitrogen)diiron(I/II) complex [(FeBr)2(&#956;&#8208;N2)Lbis]&#8722; (2), where [Lbis]&#8722; is a bis(&#946;&#8208;diketiminate) cyclophane. Field&#8208;applied M&#246;ssbauer spectra, dc and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, and computational methods support a delocalized S=7/2 Fe2N2 unit with D=&#8722;5.23&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and consequent slow magnetic relaxation.

         <title>Nature of the Active Sites of Copper Zinc Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect between Cu and Zn enabling optimal adsorption of CO is reported. Through high throughput screening for optimal CO adsorption, two types of active sites were identified that effectively facilitated the C&#8722;C coupling, thus boosting the electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ products.







Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2ER) to multi&#8208;carbon chemical feedstocks over Cu&#8208;based catalysts is of considerable attraction but suffers with the ambiguous nature of active sites, which hinder the rational design of catalysts and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This paper describes a large&#8208;scale simulation to obtain realistic CuZn nanoparticle models and the atom&#8208;level structure of active sites for C2+ products on CuZn catalysts in CO2ER, combining neural network based global optimization and density functional theory calculations. Upon analyzing over 2000 surface sites through high throughput tests based on NN potential, two kinds of active sites are identified, balanced Cu&#8722;Zn sites and Zn&#8208;heavy Cu&#8722;Zn sites, both facilitating C&#8722;C coupling, which are verified by subsequent calculational and experimental investigations. This work provides a paradigm for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;based catalysts and may offer a general strategy to identify accurately the atomic structures of active sites in complex catalytic systems.

The feasibility of cooperative catalysis between chiral N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes and nickel in asymmetric reactions has been demonstrated convincingly. The high efficiency of this catalytic system enables the asymmetric allylic alkylation of isatin&#8208;derived enals with allylic carbonates and [3+3] annulation with racemic vinyl epoxides to provide straightforward access to highly enantioenriched 3,3&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted oxindoles. The great practicality of this method in organic synthesis has been showcased by facile product modification and enantioselective synthesis of the key building block to access (&#8722;)&#8208;debromoflustramine B.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation Using Silyl&#8208;Bipyridine Pincer Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
NNSi pincer ligands served as suitable ligands for iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based ligand was shown to be an excellent one. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.







Abstract
New ligands for the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aliphatic compounds were established. In sharp contrast to 6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 6&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline derivatives bearing a hydrosilylmethyl group (which would give a thermally stable NNSi pincer complex) served as suitable ligands for the reaction. Among them, a phenanthroline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand was shown to be an excellent ligand, and various aliphatic compounds were efficiently converted to the corresponding borylated products using the Ir/NNSi pincer catalyst system. The NNSi pincer ligand showed unique selectivity and enabled the iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation using pinacolborane [H&#8722;B(pin)] instead of B2(pin)2. The formation of an iridium complex bearing a quinoline&#8208;based NNSi pincer ligand from [IrCl(cod)]2 was observed, and the catalytic activity of the complex was demonstrated.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Thermal Redox Functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds with Carbon Electrophiles**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under thermal conditions, nickel&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H redox functionalization with carbon electrophiles has been advanced to forge value&#8208;added C(sp3)&#8722;C bonds in good to excellent efficiency. This method emphasizes the use of external Zn as reductant and di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide as an oxidant and shows remarkable compatibility with Ni&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
C(sp3)&#8722;H bond coupling with carbon electrophiles remains rarely explored under thermo&#8208;driven hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) conditions due to the challenge of integrating oxidation and reduction in a single operation. We report here a Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylation and alkylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with organohalides to forge C(sp3)&#8722;C bonds by merging economical Zn and tBuOOtBu (DTBP) as the external reductant and oxidant. The mild and easy&#8208;to&#8208;operate protocol enables facile carbofunctionalization of N&#8208;/O&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and cyclohexane C&#8722;H bonds, and preparation of a few intermediates of bioactive compounds and drug derivatives. Preliminary mechanistic studies implied addition of an alkyl radical to a NiII salt.

         <title>Overcoming Spectral Dependence: A General Strategy for Developing Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Ultra&#8208;Fluorogenic Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general tetrazine probe design strategy overcomes the spectral dependence of the energy transfer mechanism, endowing excellent fluorogenicity in the NIR window. The high specificity, signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and photostability of the synthesized probes make them highly suited for live&#8208;cell bioimaging and theranostics.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal fluorogenic dyes are indispensable tools in wash&#8208;free bioimaging of specific biological targets. However, the fluorogenicity of existing tetrazine&#8208;based bioorthogonal probes deteriorates as the emission wavelength shifts towards the NIR window, greatly limiting their applications in live cells and tissues. Herein, we report a generalizable molecular design strategy to construct ultra&#8208;fluorogenic dyes via a simple substitution at the meso&#8208;positions of various far&#8208;red and NIR fluorophores. Our probes demonstrate significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios (102&#8211;103&#8208;fold) in the range 586&#8211;806&#8197;nm. These results will greatly expand the applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in NIR bioimaging and biosensing.

         <title>A Kinetic and Fluorogenic Enhancement Strategy for Labeling of Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acridine&#8211;tetrazine probe &#8220;PINK&#8221; was designed to overcome previous shortcomings of bioorthogonal labeling within tightly packed chromatin of living cells. High&#8208;affinity intercalation of the probe enhances its inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction with vinyl&#8208;modified nucleic acids in both a kinetic and fluorogenic manner to allow for a &#8220;mix and measure&#8221; assay for DNA replication and RNA synthesis in living cells.







Abstract
Chemical modification of nucleic acids in living cells can be sterically hindered by tight packing of bioorthogonal functional groups in chromatin. To address this limitation, we report here a dual enhancement strategy for nucleic acid&#8208;templated reactions utilizing a fluorogenic intercalating agent capable of undergoing inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions with DNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine (VdU) or RNA containing 5&#8208;vinyl&#8208;uridine (VU). Reversible high&#8208;affinity intercalation of a novel acridine&#8211;tetrazine conjugate &#8220;PINK&#8221; (KD=5&#177;1&#8197;&#956;M) increases the reaction rate of tetrazine&#8211;alkene IEDDA on duplex DNA by 60&#8201;000&#8208;fold (590&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) as compared to the non&#8208;templated reaction. At the same time, loss of tetrazine&#8211;acridine fluorescence quenching renders the reaction highly fluorogenic and detectable under no&#8208;wash conditions. This strategy enables live&#8208;cell dynamic imaging of acridine&#8208;modified nucleic acids in dividing cells.

         <title>Biologically Safe, Versatile, and Smart Bismuthene Functionalized with a Drug Delivery System Based on Red Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bismuthene&#8208;loaded red phosphorus quantum dot (BP QD)&#8208; and DOX&#8208;based drug delivery system was constructed that is biologically safe, versatile, and exhibits smart light&#8208; and pH&#8208;responsiveness. The material showed an extremely high drug loading capacity (ca. 250&#8201;%) and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (ca. 54&#8201;%). The intrinsic photothermal properties of bismuthene and photodynamic effects of RP QDs enhanced the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are attracting attention for cancer therapy. However, high toxicity, insensitivity to external stimuli and single therapeutic modality are still key issues hindering their clinical application. Therefore, the construction of a safe, intelligent and versatile nanocomposite is needed to meet clinical expectations. Herein, we developed a nanocomposite of Bi@RP&#8208;PEG&#8208;DOX with 2D bismuthene loaded with 0D red phosphorus quantum dots and DOX. The nanocomposite with DOX loading capacity (ca. 250&#8201;%) and photothermal conversion efficiency (ca. 54&#8201;%) showed both photothermal and photodynamic effects and a sensitive response of drug release to the acidic tumor microenvironment or NIR II laser irradiation. The nanocomposite exhibits good biosafety. Through the X&#8208;ray attenuation properties of bismuth, the nanocomposite serves as an excellent CT contrast agent, providing potential to perform CT&#8208;guided therapy.

         <title>Hydrazone and Oxime Olefination via Ruthenium Alkylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Olefination of carbon&#8211;heteroatom double bonds is a powerful approach to access highly functionalized olefins. An approach is reported here that uses air&#8208;stable and commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes to promote C=N/olefin ring closure. The enabling strategy for this reaction is the use of hydrazones and oximes as readily accessible substrates that preferentially react with ruthenium alkylidenes, even in the presence of carbonyl groups.







Abstract
We describe the development of an efficient method for the olefination of hydrazones and oximes. The key design approach that enables this transformation is tuning of the energy/polarity of C=N &#960;&#8208;bonds by employing heteroatom functionalities (NR2, OR). The resulting hydrazones or oximes facilitate olefination with ruthenium alkylidenes. Through this approach, we show that air&#8208;stable, commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes provide access to functionalized alkenes (20 examples) in ring&#8208;closing reactions with yields up to 88&#8201;%.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric &#946;&#8208;Oxygen Elimination**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is reported. The reaction design utilizes the symmetry of meso&#8208;ketene acetal substrates and proceeds in the presence of a chiral zirconocene catalyst. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination, the application in diol and amino alcohol synthesis, and a DFT&#8208;supported stereochemical analysis are presented.







Abstract
A catalytic enantioselective &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination reaction is reported in the form of a zirconium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric opening of meso&#8208;ketene acetals. Furthermore, a regiodivergent &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;elimination is demonstrated. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, at low catalyst loadings, and produces chiral monoprotected cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols in good yield and enantiomeric excess. The combination with a Mitsunobu reaction or a one&#8208;pot hydroboration/Suzuki reaction sequence then gives access to additional diol and aminoalcohol building blocks. A stereochemical analysis supported by DFT calculations reveals that a high selectivity in the hydrozirconation step is also important for achieving high enantioselectivity, although it does not constitute the asymmetric step. This insight is crucial for the future development of related asymmetric &#946;&#8208;elimination reactions.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+1) Cycloaddition between Benzocyclobutenones and Styrene&#8208;Type Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual (4+1), instead of a normal (4+2), cycloaddition has been developed between benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type alkenes via the Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;C activation, which provides a distinct one&#8208;carbon ring expansion approach to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones.







Abstract
Herein, we describe a unique one&#8208;carbon ring&#8208;expansion strategy to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones from benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type olefins. The use of a cationic &#8220;ligandless&#8221; rhodium catalyst was the key for both high reactivity and selectivity towards the (4+1) product. Broad functional group tolerance, a good substrate scope, and scalability have been demonstrated. Computation studies reveal that the origin of the (4+1) selectivity is due to a facile &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway that reduces the overall barrier of the turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8722;C reductive elimination step.

         <title>Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalyzed Enantioselective Desymmetrization of 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridines by C(sp3)&#8722;H Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available symmetrical 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs) were used as substrates to obtain chiral Hantzsch&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;DHPs, which are frequently contained in pharmaceuticals. The inert C&#8722;H bond was converted into a versatile C&#8722;Br bond, which enabled the modification of the chiral 1,4&#8208;DHP derivatives with high efficiency by nucleophilic substitution. Furthermore, axially chiral 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were accessible by central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion.







Abstract
Described herein is the enantioselective synthesis of Hantzsch&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (DHPs), which are frequently contained in pharmaceuticals. Readily available symmetrical 1,4&#8208;DHPs were used as substrates, and the methyl group at the 2&#8208; or 6&#8208;position of the 1,4&#8208;DHP was selectively monobrominated by desymmetrizing enantioselective bromination. The inert C&#8722;H bond was converted into a versatile C&#8722;Br bond, which guaranteed the modification of the chiral 1,4&#8208;DHP derivatives with high efficiency. Furthermore, axially chiral 4&#8208;aryl pyridines were accessible by central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion.

         <title>A Hybrid Halide Perovskite Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MLAPbBr4 (MLA=melamine) features a layered perovskite structure consisting of highly distorted PbBr6 octahedra and planar MLA+ cations. As a result, it exhibits large birefringence up to 0.322@550&#8197;nm. This birefringence makes MLAPbBr4 capable of easily dividing incident light into two polarized rays (e&#8208;ray and o&#8208;ray).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals that can modulate the polarization of light play a significant role in modern optical devices including polarizing microscopes, optical isolators, and achromatic quarter&#8208;wave plates. To date, commercial birefringent crystals are exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds. Here we report a new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide, MLAPbBr4 (MLA=melamine), which features a (110)&#8208;oriented layered perovskite structure. Although the 6s2 lone&#8208;pair electrons of Pb2+ cations are stereochemically inert, MLAPbBr4 exhibits a birefringence of 0.322@550&#8197;nm, which exceeds those of all commercial birefringent crystals. The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that this birefringence should be ascribed to the highly dislocated &#960;&#8208;conjugation of MLA cations and high distortion of PbBr6 octahedra. This work highlights the persistently neglected great potential of hybrid halide perovskites as birefringent crystals.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activatable Spherical Nucleic Acids for Conditional Control of Protein Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light activatable spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) were designed to achieve programmable optical control of protein activity. The SNAs remain inert and can be remotely activated by NIR irradiation to function as an enzyme inhibitor, while addition of antidote DNA could further reverse the regulation function.







Abstract
Optical control of protein activity represents a promising strategy for precise modulation of biological processes. We report rationally designed, aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) capable of noninvasive and programmable regulation of target protein activity by deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The photoresponsive SNAs are constructed by integrating activatable aptamer modules onto the surface of upconversion nanoparticles. The SNAs remain inert but can be remotely reverted by NIR light irradiation to capture the target protein and thus function as an enzyme inhibitor, while introduction of antidote DNA could further reverse their inhibition functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of the SNAs as controllable anticoagulants for the NIR light&#8208;triggered regulation of thrombin function. Ultimately, the availability of diverse aptamers would allow the design to regulate the activities of various proteins in a programmable manner.

         <title>Aromaticity and Extrusion of Benzenoids Linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722;: Clar Has the Answer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clar has the answer! Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets justify the reason why the linked system of [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; and benzenoid drives to extrusion in the case of naphthalene or anthracene, but not for benzene, pyrene or perylene.







Abstract
Benzene and pyrene can be synthetically linked to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; keeping their aromaticity. In contrast, naphthalene and anthracene are extruded in the same reaction. We have proven that extrusion is only favorable if the number of Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextets remains constant. Thus, Clar has the answer to whether an attached polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon to [o&#8208;COSAN]&#8722; is extruded or not.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminate Catalyzes the Dehydrocoupling of Phenylphosphine Borane to High Molar Weight Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphosphinoboranes are an emerging class of p&#8208;block element&#8208;based polymers. To date, their synthesis with high molecular weights was reserved for catalysts featuring transition metals. Calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is introduced as the first transition metal&#8208;free catalytic system for the dehydropolymerization of phenylphosphine borane. Initial mechanistic investigations indicate metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity of the aluminate.







Abstract
High molar weight polyphosphinoboranes represent materials with auspicious properties, but their preparation requires transition metal&#8208;based catalysts. Here, calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate is shown to induce the dehydropolymerization of phosphine boranes to high molar mass polyphosphinoboranes (up to Mn=43&#8201;000&#8197;Da). Combined GPC and 31P DOSY NMR spectroscopic analyses, quantum chemical computations, and stoichiometric reactions disclose a P&#8722;H bond activation by the cooperative action of the square&#8208;planar aluminate and the electron&#8208;rich ligand framework. This first transition metal&#8208;free catalyst for P&#8722;B dehydrocoupling overcomes the problem of residual d&#8208;block metal impurities in the resulting polymers that might interfere with the reproducibility of the properties for this emerging class of inorganic materials.

         <title>Structural Insight of MOFs under Combined Mechanical and Adsorption Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new in situ pressure cell was designed that can follow materials under two combined stimuli: gas pressure and mechanical stress, providing structural insight into phase transformations of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The cell was used to gain direct evidence that mechanical stress can control MIL&#8208;53(Al) breathing behaviour with CO2, further paving the way for dynamic tuning of separation performance for compliant MOFs.







Abstract
External control over the pore size of flexible metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently emerged as an intriguing concept, with possible applications to gas storage and separation. In this work we present a new pressure cell capable for the first time of monitoring through in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction an adsorbent powder under combined uniaxial applied mechanical stress (up to 1&#8197;GPa) and gas pressure (up to 20&#8197;bar). The combined stress&#8211;pressure clamp (CSPC) cell was successfully exploited to follow the evolution of the CO2 breathing behaviour of the prototypical complex breathing MIL&#8208;53(Al) system under mechanical compression obtaining structural evidence that this MOF can be maintained in its closed pore state upon compression, precluding its re&#8208;opening at high gas pressure (&gt;7&#8197;bar). This novel setup shows potential for the in&#8208;operando exploration of flexible systems, in equilibrium and flow configurations.

         <title>In Vitro Biosynthesis of the [Fe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Cofactor Verifies the Proposed Biosynthetic Precursors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 22, May 23, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeGP cofactor is the prosthetic group of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase. The in vitro biosynthesis of this cofactor from synthesized precursors using the cell extract of a mutated strain of Methanococcus maripaludis provided evidence for the biosynthesis of the FeGP cofactor from 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinols, an organic CO donor, and/or CO and other substances. This method paves the way to analyze the biosynthetic machinery of this H2&#8208;activation cofactor.







Abstract
In the FeGP cofactor of [Fe]&#8208;hydrogenase, low&#8208;spin FeII is in complex with two CO ligands and a pyridinol derivative; the latter ligates the iron with a 6&#8208;acylmethyl substituent and the pyridinol nitrogen. A guanylylpyridinol derivative, 6&#8208;carboxymethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;guanylyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinol (3), is produced by the decomposition of the FeGP cofactor under irradiation with UV&#8208;A/blue light and is also postulated to be a precursor of FeGP cofactor biosynthesis. HcgC and HcgB catalyze consecutive biosynthesis steps leading to 3. Here, we report an in vitro biosynthesis assay of the FeGP cofactor using the cell extract of the &#916;hcgB&#916;hcgC strain of Methanococcus maripaludis, which does not biosynthesize 3. We chemically synthesized pyridinol precursors 1 and 2, and detected the production of the FeGP cofactor from 1, 2 and 3. These results indicated that 1, 2 and 3 are the precursors of the FeGP cofactor, and the carboxy group of 3 is converted to the acyl ligand.

         <title>Spontaneous Orthogonal Protein Crosslinking via a Genetically Encoded 2&#8208;Carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;Triazole</title>

A genetically encoded N2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;lysine (CATK) permits a spontaneous, quantitative, site&#8208;specific inter&#8208;strand crosslinking with a proximal Tyr in a small antibody&#8208;mimetic protein, generating a novel protein topology accompanied by improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic resistance.







Abstract
Here we report the design of N2&#8208;carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;lysines (CATKs) and their site&#8208;specific incorporation into proteins via genetic code expansion. When introduced into the protein dimer interface, CATKs permitted spontaneous, proximity&#8208;driven, site&#8208;selective crosslinking to generate covalent protein dimers in living cells, with phenyl&#8208;bearing CATK&#8208;1 exhibiting high reactivity toward the proximal Lys and Tyr. Furthermore, when introduced into the N&#8208;terminal &#946;&#8208;strand of either a single&#8208;chain VHH antibody or a supercharged monobody, CATK&#8208;1 enabled site&#8208;specific, inter&#8208;strand, orthogonal crosslinking with a proximal Tyr located on the opposing &#946;&#8208;strand. Compared with a non&#8208;crosslinked monobody, the orthogonally crosslinked monobody displayed improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic stability against an endosomal enzyme. The robust crosslinking reactivity of CATKs should facilitate the design of novel protein topologies with improved physicochemical properties.

         <title>Fluorinating the Solid Electrolyte Interphase by Rational Molecular Design for Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The lifespan of practical lithium (Li) metal batteries is severely hindered by the instability of Li metal anodes. Fluorinated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) emerges as a promising strategy to improve the stability of Li metal anodes. The rational design of fluorinated molecules is pivotal to constructing fluorinated SEI. Herein, design principles of fluorinated molecules are proposed. Fluoroalkyl (&#8211;CF2CF2&#8211;) is selected as an enriched F reservoir and the defluorination of C&#8211;F bond is driven by leaving groups on &#946;&#8208;site. An activated fluoroalkyl molecule (AFA), 2,2,3,3&#8208;tetraflurobutane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol dinitrate is unprecedentedly proposed to render fast and complete defluorination and generate uniform fluorinated SEI on Li metal anodes. In Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical conditions, the fluorinated SEI constructed by AFA undergoes 183 cycles, which is three times of the SEI formed by LiNO3. Furthermore, a Li&#8211;S pouch cell of 360 Wh kg&#8722;1 delivers 25 cycles with AFA. This work demonstrates rational molecular design principles of fluorinated molecules to construct fluorinated SEI for practical Li metal batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208;Shifted Water&#8208;Soluble BODIPY Photocages for Visualisation and Controllable Cellular Delivery of Signaling Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we developed a water&#8208;soluble caging group based on a &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY scaffold able to release carboxylate&#8208;containing cargo upon red light illumination (  &#955;  irr  = 633 nm). We performed mechanistic studies showing new insights into the principles of the photoreactivity of these cages and demonstrated a significant influence of the structure of a carboxylate cargo on the rate and efficiency of the uncaging process and its side reactions. We used it for selective delivery, visualisation, and photorelease of a signaling lipid in cell plasma and internal membranes. With this approach, we successfully induced Ca  2+  release in cells expressing the GPR40 receptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Approaches to Synthetic Drug Delivery Systems for Systemic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poor water solubility and&#160;low&#160;bioavailability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are major causes of friction the pharmaceutical industry and represent a formidable hurdle for pharmaceutical drug development. Drug delivery remains the major challenge for the application of new small molecule drugs as well as biopharmaceuticals. The three challenges for synthetic delivery systems are: (i) controlling drug&#160;distribution and&#160;clearance in the blood; (ii) solubilizing poorly water&#8208;soluble agents, and (iii) selectively targeting specific tissues. Although several&#160;polymer&#8208;based&#160;systems have addressed the first two&#160;demands&#160;and been translated into clinical practice, no targeted synthetic drug delivery system has reached the market. This review is designed to provide a background on the challenges and requirements for the design and translation of new&#160;polymer&#8208;based&#160;delivery systems. This report will focus on chemical approaches to drug delivery for systemic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation of in situ Generated Chiral Hypervalent Iodine Complexes via Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of in situ generated chiral aryl&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes obtained under oxidative reaction conditions was not yet observable with experimental techniques and their proposed structures are purely based on DFT calculations. Herein, we establish vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy as an applicable experimental technique to verify DFT&#8208;calculated chiral iodane structures. Based on a chiral triazole&#8208;substituted iodoarene catalyst, we were able to elucidate a yet undescribed cationic chiral iodane as the most populated intermediate under oxidative conditions with a significant intermolecular N&#8208;I&#8208;interaction and no significant interactions with tosylate or m&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid as potential anionic ligands. Instead, aggregation of these substrates was found, which resulted in the formation of a non&#8208;coordinating anionic hydrogen bonded complex. The importance of VCD as a crucial experimental observable is further highlighted by the fact that our initial structural proposal, that was purely based on DFT&#8208;calculations, could be falsified.</dc:description>
