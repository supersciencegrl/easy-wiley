         <title>Facet&#8208;selective deposition of ultrathin Al2O3 on copper nanocrystals for highly stable CO2 electroreduction to ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalysts based on Cu nanocrystals (NCs) for electrochemical CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;C  2+  conversion with high activity have been a subject of considerable interest, but poor stability and low selectivity for a single C  2+  product remain obstacles for realizing sustainable carbon&#8208;neutral cycles. Here, we used the facet&#8208;selective atomic layer deposition (FS&#8208;ALD) technique to selectively cover the (111) surface of Cu NCs with ultrathin Al  2  O  3  to increase the exposed facet ratio of (100)/(111), resulting in a faradaic efficiency ratio of C  2  H  4  /CH  4  for overcoated Cu NCs 22 times higher than that for pure Cu NCs. Peak performance of the overcoated catalyst (Cu NCs/Al  2  O  3  &#8208;10C) reaches a C  2  H  4  faradaic efficiency of 60.4% at a current density of 300 mA cm  &#8208;2  in 5 M KOH electrolyte, when using a gas diffusion electrode flow cell. Moreover, the Al  2  O  3  overcoating effectively suppresses the dynamic mobility and the aggregation of Cu NCs, which explains the negligible activity loss and selectivity degradations of Cu NCs/Al  2  O  3  &#8208;10C shown in stability tests.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Bridged Bicyclic Glycosyl Dioxacarbenium Ion&#160;by 1H and 13C NMR Spectroscopy: Importance of Conformation on Participation by Distal Esters.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;temperature NMR studies with a 4&#8208;  C  &#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;  O  &#8208;benzoyl galactopyranosyl donor enable for the first time the observation and characterization of a bridged bicyclic dioxacarbenium ion arising from participation by a distal ester. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal this bridged ion to decompose at temperatures above ~&#8208;30 &#176;C. In the absence of the methyl group, the formation of a bicyclic ion is not observed. It is concluded that participation by typical secondary distal esters in glycosylation reactions is disfavored in the ground state conformation of the ester from which it is stereoelectronically impossible. Methylation converts the secondary ester to a conformationally more labile tertiary, removes this barrier, and renders participation more favorable. Nevertheless, the minor changes in selectivity in model glycosylation reactions on going from the secondary to the tertiary esters at both low and room temperature argue against distal group participation being a major stereodirecting factor even for the tertiary system.</dc:description>

         <title>Cathodic electrodeposition of MOF films using hydrogen peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films can be made by cathodic electrodeposition, where a Br&#248;nsted base is formed electrochemically which deprotonates the MOF linkers that are present in solution as undissociated/partially dissociated weak acids. However, the co&#8208;deposition of metal and the narrow range of possible metal nodes limit the scope of this method. In this work, we propose the use of hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen peroxide assisted cathodic deposition or HPACD), to overcome these limitations. Electrochemical measurements indicate that in DMF, hydrogen peroxide is reduced to superoxide anions that deprotonate the carboxylic ligands. This single&#8208;electron reduction happens at much higher potentials than all previous reported methods. This prevents the co&#8208;deposition of metal and extends the range of possible metal nodes. Various pure MOF films (HKUST&#8208;1, MIL&#8208;53(Fe) and MOF&#8208;5) were prepared via this approach. HPACD was also used for the preparation of patterned MOF films and of flexible Cu&#8208;BTC coated paper membranes which rejects 99.1% of Rose Bengal from water with a permeance of 8.4 L m  &#8208;2  h  &#8208;1  bar  &#8208;1  .</dc:description>

         <title>Zeolite&#8208;Tailored Active Site Proximity for the Efficient Production of Pentanoic Biofuels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolite&#8208;tailored active site proximity, with well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm) confined within the internal cavities of zeolite&#8197;Y, significantly boosts the catalytic activity and selectivity for the direct hydrodeoxygenation of neat ethyl levulinate into pentanoic biofuels. Furthermore, La modification for zeolite&#8197;Y could improve the metal dispersion and the stability of zeolite during catalysis.







Abstract
Biofuel production can alleviate reliance on fossil resources and thus carbon dioxide emission. Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers collectively to a series of important biorefinery processes to produce biofuels. Here, well&#8208;dispersed and ultra&#8208;small Ru metal nanoclusters (ca. 1&#8197;nm), confined within the micropores of zeolite&#8197;Y, provide the required active site intimacy, which significantly boosts the chemoselectivity towards the production of pentanoic biofuels in the direct, one&#8208;pot HDO of neat ethyl levulinate. Crucial for improving catalyst stability is the addition of La, which upholds the confined proximity by preventing zeolite lattice deconstruction during catalysis. We have established and extended an understanding of the &#8220;intimacy criterion&#8221; in catalytic biomass valorization. These findings bring new understanding of HDO reactions over confined proximity sites, leading to potential application for pentanoic biofuels in biomass conversion.

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a TbIII&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of TbIII in Ln&#8208;MOFs led to turn&#8208;on sensing of organic analytes regardless of quenching oscillators. The presence of such a remote interaction mechanism during the turn&#8208;on sensing event was verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and molecular dynamic modelling investigations.







Abstract
Guided by a second&#8208;sphere interaction strategy, we fabricated a Tb(III)&#8208;based metal&#8212;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for turn&#8208;on sensing of methyl amine with ultra&#8208;low detection limit and high turn&#8208;on efficiency. MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with secondary coordination spheres that are densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Nonradiative routes were inhibited by binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand on the second coordination sphere, resulting in luminescence amplification. Such remote interacting mechanism involved in the turn&#8208;on sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and molecular dynamic simulation studies. The design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb(III) enabled the first turn&#8208;on sensing of organic amines in aqueous conditions. Our work suggests a promising strategy for high&#8208;performance turn&#8208;on sensing for Ln&#8208;MOFs and luminous materials driven by other metal chromophores.

         <title>Introducing A New Class of Sulfonyl Fluoride Hubs via Radical Chloro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes</title>

A new class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF) is introduced. BCASF can serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of a wide spectrum of alkenylsulfonyl fluorides.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro&#8208;fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as cis alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Bridged Bicyclic Nitrogen Scaffolds via Orthogonal Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21988-21996, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridged bicyclic nitrogen scaffolds are conformationally restricted analogues of important aminocarbo&#8208; and aminoheterocycles. Fixation of functional groups in a biologically active conformation provides efficient and selective ligands for various targets, featuring improved ADME parameters. Long synthetic sequences relying on traditional organic chemistry currently limit the drug discovery process. New step&#8208;economic synthetic procedures are therefore highly sought after.







Abstract
Bridged nitrogen bicyclic skeletons have been accessed via unprecedented site&#8208; and diastereoselective orthogonal tandem catalysis from readily accessible reactants in a step economic manner. Directed Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination of aminocyclohexane with gem&#8208;dibromoalkenes, followed by a consecutive intramolecular Cu&#8208;catalyzed amidation of the 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;alkenylated product delivers the interesting normorphan skeleton. The tandem protocol can be applied on substituted aminocyclohexanes and aminoheterocycles, easily providing access to the corresponding substituted, aza&#8208; and oxa&#8208;analogues. The Cu catalyst of the Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg reaction additionally avoids off&#8208;cycle Pd catalyst scavenging by alkenylated reaction product. The picolinamide directing group stabilizes the enamine of the 7&#8208;alkylidenenormorphan, allowing further product post functionalizations. Without Cu catalyst, regio&#8208; and diastereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H olefination is achieved.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorogenic Probe for Monitoring Ethylene in Living Cells and Plants</title>

Fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic probes were developed for rapid (&lt;2&#8197;min), highly selective, and quantitative detection of ethylene. Among the coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes developed, CEP&#8208;1 has the capacity to detect endogenous ethylene gas in living cells and plants.







Abstract
Ethylene (ET) is an important gaseous plant hormone. It is highly desirable to develop fluorescent probes for monitoring ethylene in living cells. We report an efficient RhIII&#8208;catalysed coupling of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides to ethylene in the presence of an alcohol. The newly discovered coupling reaction exhibited a wide scope of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides and excellent regioselectivity. We successfully developed three fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes (CEPs) using this strategy for the selective and quantitative detection of ethylene. CEP&#8208;1 exhibited the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of ethylene at 52&#8197;ppb in air. Furthermore, CEP&#8208;1 was successfully applied for imaging in living CHO&#8208;K1 cells and for monitoring endogenous&#8208;induced changes in ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana plants. These results indicate that CEP&#8208;1 has great potential to illuminate the spatiotemporal regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction in living biological systems.

An illustration of selectivity and activity on metals for nitric oxide reduction reaction is presented. Both selectivity and activity of NO reduction has been indicated by *N adsorption energy. There is a very little window to find both selective and active catalyst for the NO reduction in the volcano.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic denitrification is a promising technology for removing NOx species (NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722; and NO). For NOx electroreduction (NOxRR), there is a desire for understanding the catalytic parameters that control the product distribution. Here, we elucidate selectivity and activity of catalyst for NOxRR. At low potential we classify metals by the binding of *NO versus *H. Analogous to classifying CO2 reduction by *CO vs. *H, Cu is able to bind *NO while not binding *H giving rise to a selective NH3 formation. Besides being selective, Cu is active for the reaction found by an activity&#8208;volcano. For metals that does not bind NO the reaction stops at NO, similar to CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO. At potential above 0.3&#8197;V vs. RHE, we speculate a low barrier for N coupling with NO causing N2O formation. The work provides a clear strategy for selectivity and aims to inspire future research on NOxRR.

         <title>Can One Measure Resonance Raman Optical Activity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22004-22009, September 27, 2021. </description>

Measured resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) often did not agree with theoretical predictions. We uncover a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, that explains some of these inconsistencies. This combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman has also immense potential as a sensitive technique for applications in chemistry or biology.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) is commonly measured as the difference in intensity of Raman scattered right and left circularly polarized light, IR&#8722;IL, when a randomly polarized light is in resonance with a chiral molecule. Strong and sometimes mono&#8208;signate experimental RROA spectra of several chiral solutes were reported previously, although their signs and relative intensities could not be reproduced theoretically. By examining multiple light&#8208;matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite&#8208;lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by eCP&#8208;Raman, without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of eCP&#8208;Raman spectroscopy and for extracting true RROA experimentally.

By examining multiple light-matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP-Raman, a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite-lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by eCP-Raman, without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of eCP-Raman spectroscopy and for extracting true RROA experimentally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Transition Metal Vacancy Induced Oxygen Redox by Co2+/Co3+ Redox and Sodium&#8208;Site Doping for Layered Cathode Materials</title>

A P2&#8208;Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07&#9633;0.13]O2 (&#9633;: transition metal (TM) vacancy) cathode material is designed that contains vacancies and Co2+ in TM sites, and Mg2+ in both TM and Na sites. The synergic effect of low&#8208;valence Co2+/Co3+ redox and Mg2+ in sodium sites stabilizes the structure of this cathode material significantly during cycling.







Abstract
Anionic redox is an effective way to boost the energy density of layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;oxide cathodes for rechargeable batteries. However, inherent rigid nature of the TMO6 (TM: transition metals) subunits in the layered materials makes it hardly tolerate the inner strains induced by lattice glide, especially at high voltage. Herein, P2&#8208;Na0.8Mg0.13[Mn0.6Co0.2Mg0.07&#9633;0.13]O2 (&#9633;: TM vacancy) is designed that contains vacancies in TM sites, and Mg ions in both TM and sodium sites. Vacancies make the rigid TMO6 octahedron become more asymmetric and flexible. Low valence Co2+/Co3+ redox couple stabilizes the electronic structure, especially at the charged state. Mg2+ in sodium sites can tune the interlayer spacing against O&#8208;O electrostatic repulsion. Time&#8208;resolved in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction confirms that irreversible structure evolution is effectively suppressed during deep desodiation benefiting from the specific configuration. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that, deriving from the intrinsic vacancies, multiple local configurations of &#8220;&#9633;&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Na&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;&#8221;, &#8220;Mg&#8208;O&#8208;&#9633;&#8221; are superior in facilitating the oxygen redox for charge compensation than previously reported &#8220;Na&#8208;O&#8208;Mg&#8221;. The resulted material delivers promising cycle stability and rate capability, with a long voltage plateau at 4.2&#8197;V contributed by oxygen, and can be well maintained even at high rates. The strategy will inspire new ideas in designing highly stable cathode materials with reversible anionic redox for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Exporting Metal&#8208;Carbene Chemistry to Live Mammalian Cells: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intracellular Synthesis of Quinoxalines Enabled by N&#8722;H Carbene Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22017-22025, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that catalytic processes involving metal&#8211;carbene intermediates can be exported to the crowded magma of a live mammalian cell. In particular, reactions involving copper carbenes can be used for the synthesis of fluorescent cyclic products in cellular media, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8722;H carbene insertion. The method also allows the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions.







Abstract
Implementing catalytic organometallic transformations in living settings can offer unprecedented opportunities in chemical biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the number of biocompatible reactions so far discovered is very limited, and essentially restricted to uncaging processes. Here, we demonstrate the viability of performing metal carbene transfer reactions in live mammalian cells. In particular, we show that copper (II) catalysts can promote the intracellular annulation of alpha&#8208;keto diazocarbenes with ortho&#8208;amino arylamines, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8208;H carbene insertion. The potential of this transformation is underscored by the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions, and by demonstrating cell selective biological responses using targeted copper catalysts. Considering the wide reactivity spectrum of metal carbenes, this work opens the door to significantly expanding the repertoire of life&#8208;compatible abiotic reactions.

         <title>Brightening up Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Monosubstituted Polyacetylene by Conformation Control: Mechanism, Switching, and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21918-21926, September 27, 2021. </description>

A strategy is described that enables the conventionally non&#8208;luminescent monosubstituted polyacetylenes bearing no pendant fluorophore to light up and show a switchable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a large dissymmetric factor (glum, 10&#8722;1), multiple reversible stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, and quantitative detection by conformational transition of polyene backbone.







Abstract
The first example of luminescent monosubstituted polyacetylenes (mono&#8208;PAs) is presented, based on a contracted cis&#8208;cisoid polyene backbone. It has an excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) performance with a high dissymmetric factor (up to the order of 10&#8722;1). The luminescence stems from the helical cis&#8208;cisoid PA backbone, which is tightly fixed by the strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, thereby reversing the energy order of excited states and enabling an emissive energy dissipation. CPL switches are facilely achieved by the solvent and temperature through reversible conformational transition. By taking advantages of fast response and high sensitivity, the thin film of mono&#8208;PAs could be used as a CPL&#8208;based probe for quantitative detection of trifluoroacetic acid with a wider linear dynamic range than those of photoluminescence and circular dichroism. This work opens a new avenue to develop novel smart CPL materials through modulating conformational transition.

         <title>Quick and Easy Method to Dramatically Improve the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of an Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22070-22074, September 27, 2021. </description>

The electrochemical CO2 reduction activity of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, is dramatically enhanced by a simple one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction. The resulting complex, FeTPP, shows improved solubility. Its turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile is 7.3&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of relevant molecular catalysts.







Abstract
The development of artificial molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction is the key to solving energy and environmental problems. Although chemical modifications can generally improve the catalytic activity of this class of compounds, they often require complicated synthetic procedures. Here, we report a simple procedure that dramatically enhances electrochemical CO2 reduction activity. A one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction increased the solubility of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, in a variety of solvents, allowing the investigation of its catalytic performance under various conditions. Surprisingly, the turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) reached 7&#8201;300&#8201;000&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of current best&#8208;in&#8208;class molecular catalysts. This excellent catalytic activity originates from the unique reaction between the generated FeI species and CO2 in MeCN during catalysis. The present study offers a &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; method for obtaining an efficient catalytic system for electrochemical CO2 reduction.

KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis. Chemical genetics of KY02111 identified squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling and recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes an inherited heart disease.







Abstract
KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis of the mesoderm cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, yet its molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. The present study resolves the initially perplexing effects of KY02111 on Wnt signaling and subsequently identifies squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111 and its optimized version, KY&#8208;I. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946; signaling, but not Wnt signaling, and thereby recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited heart disease that involves a substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role of SQS in TGF&#946; signaling and cardiomyogenesis. KY02111 may find its use in ARVC modeling as well as serve as a chemical tool for studying TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling.

         <title>Saucer[n]arenes: Synthesis, Structure, Complexation, and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence Property</title>

Starting from 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes named saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) are synthesized by one&#8208;pot and templated methods. Saucer[n]arenes show strong fluorescence properties and form 1:1 complexes with various ammonium salts. Moreover, the chiral guests can induce the chirality of dynamically racemic saucer[n]arenes in the host&#8211;guest systems, which provides a new way to construct CPL organic materials.







Abstract
Macrocycles denoted as saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) were easily synthesized by the one&#8208;pot condensation of 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene (2,7&#8208;DMN) and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TFA or catalytic BF3&#8901;OEt2. With 1,1&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ium as the template, saucer[4]arene was selectively obtained. Crystal structures show that saucer[n]arenes are all composed of 2,7&#8208;DMN moiety bridged by the methylene groups at 1,6&#8208;positions: all of the 7&#8208;methoxy groups lie on one face, and all of the 2&#8208;methoxy groups lie on the other. Saucer[n]arenes exhibit strong fluorescence properties with the quantum yields of 19.6&#8201;% and 23.4&#8201;%. They form 1:1 complexes with ammonium salts in both solution and solid state (association constant up to 105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CDCl3). Chiral quaternary ammonium salts can induce the chirality of the dynamically racemic inherently chiral saucer[n]arenes in solution, and thus show mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.

         <title>Contrasting E&#8722;H Bond Activation Pathways of a Phosphanyl&#8208;Phosphagallene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22057-22061, September 27, 2021. </description>

We describe the synthesis and reactivity of a phosphanyl phosphagallene towards reagents with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds. These studies reveal that there are two competing reactivity pathways available for such bond activation reactions: a frustrated Lewis pair type of mechanism, and a competing pathway which results in the hydroelementation of the Ga=P double bond.







Abstract
The reactivity of the phosphanyl&#8208;phosphagallene, [H2C{N(Dipp)}]2PP=Ga(Nacnac) (Nacnac=HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) towards a series of reagents possessing E&#8722;H bonds (primary amines, ammonia, water, phenylacetylene, phenylphosphine, and phenylsilane) is reported. Two contrasting reaction pathways are observed, determined by the polarity of the E&#8722;H bonds of the substrates. In the case of protic reagents (&#948;&#8722;E&#8722;H&#948;+), a frustrated Lewis pair type of mechanism is operational at room temperature, in which the gallium metal centre acts as a Lewis acid and the pendant phosphanyl moiety deprotonates the substrates. Interestingly, at elevated temperatures both NH2iPr and ammonia can react via a second, higher energy, pathway resulting in the hydroamination of the Ga=P bond. By contrast, with hydridic reagents (&#948;+E&#8722;H&#948;&#8722;), such as phenylsilane, hydroelementation of the Ga=P bond is exclusively observed, in line with the polarisation of the Si&#8722;H and Ga=P bonds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Radical Hydro&#8208; and Aminooxygenation of Unactivated Alkenes Tuned by Ketoxime Carbonates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21997-22003, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable protocol for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated olefins under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has been developed. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated N&#8722;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates, followed by an oxygen&#8208;centered radical addition.







Abstract
A tunable photocatalytic method is reported for anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208; and aminooxygenation of unactivated alkenes using readily accessible ketoxime carbonates as the diverse functionalization reagents. Mechanistic studies reveal that this reaction is initiated through an energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;promoted N&#8722;O bond homolysis of ketoxime carbonates leading to alkoxylcarbonyloxyl and iminyl radicals under visible&#8208;light photocatalysis, followed by the addition of alkoxylcarbonyloxyl radical to alkenes. By taking advantage of the different stability of the iminyl radicals, the generated carbon radical either abstracts a hydrogen atom from the media to form the anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydrooxygenation product, or it is trapped by the persistent iminyl radical to furnish the aminooxygenation product. Notably, this is the first example of direct hydrooxygenation of unactivated olefins with anti&#8208;Markovnikov regioselectivity involving an oxygen&#8208;centered radical.

The intermetallic FePt@PtBi electrocatalyst with a L10&#8208;FePt core and a PtBi shell shows excellent ORR performance and stability, which are attributed to superimposed strain. Even after 30&#8201;000&#8197;cycles, the activity of the FePt@PtBi electrocatalyst is still as high as 0.79&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1, comfortably exceeding the DOE 2020 targets. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows a better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than benchmark Pt/C.







Abstract
The development of active and stable platinum (Pt)&#8208;based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good resistance to poisoning is a prerequisite for widespread practical application of fuel cells. An effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance is to tune or control the physicochemical state of the Pt surface. Herein, we show a general surface&#8208;engineering approach to prepare a range of nanostructured Pt alloys by coating with alloy PtBi shells. FePt@PtBi core&#8211;shell nanoparticles showed the best ORR performance with a mass activity of 0.96&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and a specific activity of 2.06&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively 7&#8197;times and 11&#8197;times those of the corresponding values for benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, FePt@PtBi shows much better tolerance to methanol and carbon monoxide than conventional Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The observed comprehensive enhancement in ORR performance of FePt@PtBi can be attributed to the increased compressive strain of the Pt surface due to in&#8208;plane shearing resulting from the presence of the large Bi atoms in the surface&#8208;structured PtBi overlayers, as well as charge displacement via Pt&#8208;Bi bonding which mitigates crossover issues.

&lt;p&gt;The development of active and stable platinum (Pt)-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts with good resistance to poisoning is a prerequisite for widespread practical application of fuel cells. An effective strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic performance is to tune or control the physicochemical state of the Pt surface. Herein, we show a general surface-engineering approach to prepare a range of nanostructured Pt alloys by coating with alloy PtBi shells.

         <title>Smart 131I&#8208;Labeled Self&#8208;Illuminating Photosensitizers for Deep Tumor Therapy</title>

Novel responsive nanoparticles based on Cerenkov resonance energy transfer are suitable for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of deep tumors without the need for exogenous light. The nanoparticles have low toxicity and few harmful side effects on normal tissue.







Abstract
Stimulating photosensitizers (PS) by Cerenkov radiation (CR) can overcome the light penetration limitation in traditional photodynamic therapy. However, separate injection of radiopharmaceuticals and PS cannot guarantee their efficient interaction in tumor areas, while co&#8208;delivery of radionuclides and PS face the problem of nonnegligible phototoxicity in normal tissues. Here, we describe a 131I&#8208;labeled smart photosensitizer, composed of pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (photosensitizer), a diisopropylamino group (pH&#8208;sensitive group), an 131I&#8208;labeled tyrosine group (CR donor), and polyethylene glycol, which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (131I&#8208;sPS NPs). The 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed low phototoxicity in normal tissues due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, but could self&#8208;produce reactive oxygen species in tumor sites upon disassembly. Upon intravenous injection, 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed great tumor inhibition capability in subcutaneous 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing Balb/c mice and orthotopic VX2 liver tumor bearing rabbits. We believed 131I&#8208;sPS NPs could expand the application of CR and provide an effective strategy for deep tumor theranostics.

         <title>Intrinsic ORR Activity Enhancement of Pt Atomic Sites by Engineering the d&#8208;Band Center via Local Coordination Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21911-21917, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;coordinated atomic Pt&#8208;Nx sites are theoretically predicted and experimentally realized, offering enhanced kinetics for four&#8208;electron electrochemical oxygen reduction. Exceptional activity is attributed to the tuning of the d&#8208;band electron center via local coordination asymmetry. This chemistry provides an effective guideline for atomic Pt catalysts in batteries and fuel cells.







Abstract
A considerable amount of platinum (Pt) is required to ensure an adequate rate for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Thus, the implementation of atomic Pt catalysts holds promise for minimizing the Pt content. In this contribution, atomic Pt sites with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co&#8208;coordination on a carbon matrix (PtNPC) are conceptually predicted and experimentally developed to alter the d&#8208;band center of Pt, thereby promoting the intrinsic ORR activity. PtNPC with a record&#8208;low Pt content (&#8776;0.026&#8197;wt&#8201;%) consequently shows a benchmark&#8208;comparable activity for ORR with an onset of 1.0 VRHE and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 VRHE. It also features a high stability in 15&#8201;000&#8208;cycle tests and a superior turnover frequency of 6.80&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.9 VRHE. Damjanovic kinetics analysis reveals a tuned ORR kinetics of PtNPC from a mixed 2/4&#8208;electron to a predominately 4&#8208;electron route. It is discovered that coordinated P species significantly shifts d&#8208;band center of Pt atoms, accounting for the exceptional performance of PtNPC.

         <title>Grotthuss Proton&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21838-21845, September 27, 2021. </description>

Two highly crystalline, robust covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were fabricated with intrinsic Grotthuss proton conductivity. The assembled covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based pseudocapacitors displayed both high energy density and high power density that surpassed that of all other reported COF&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the synthesis of two highly crystalline, robust, hydrophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that display intrinsic proton conduction by the Grotthuss mechanism. The enriched redox&#8208;active azo groups in the COFs can undergo a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making the COFs ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in situ hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three&#8208;electrode specific capacitance of 440&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, among the highest for COF&#8208;based supercapacitors, and can retain 90&#8201;% capacitance even after 10&#8201;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. This is the first example using Grotthuss proton&#8208;conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two&#8208;electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a maximum power density of 42&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, surpassing that of all reported COF&#8208;based systems.

By integration of the endocytotic process and the overexpressing enzyme within lysosome in cancer cells, we construct enzymatic programmable assemblies selectively in living cancer cells for glioblastoma cancer therapy.







Abstract
Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, western blot, and Bio&#8208;EM suggest the site&#8208;specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.

&lt;p&gt;Here we report on the design, synthesis, and assembly of an enzymatic programmable peptide system inspired by endocytic processes to induce molecular assemblies formation spatiotemporally in living cancer cells, resulting in glioblastoma cell death mainly in necroptosis. Our results indicate the stability and glycosylation of molecules play an essential role in determining the final bioactivity. Detailed mechanistic studies by CLSM, Flow cytometry, western blot, and Bio-EM suggest the site-specific formation of assemblies, which could induce the LMP and activate the downstream cell death pathway. Moreover, we also demonstrate that our strategy can boost the activity of commercial chemotherapy drug by escaping lysosome sequestration. We expected this work would be expanded towards artificial intelligent biomaterials for cancer therapy and imaging precisely.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Triggered Intracellular H+ Transients for Lamellipodia&#8208;Collapsed Antimetastasis and Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21905-21910, September 27, 2021. </description>

An NIR&#8208;activated H+ release strategy based on UMP NPs successfully achieves lamellipodia&#8208;collapsed antimetastasis and enhanced chemodynamic therapy. This metastasis&#8208;oriented anticancer strategy may offer a new option for tumor antimetastasis and tumor treatment in the field of nanomedicines.







Abstract
In solid tumors, tumor invasion and metastasis account for 90&#8201;% of cancer&#8208;related deaths. Cell migration is steered by the lamellipodia formed at the leading edge. These lamellipodia can drive the cell body forward by its mechanical deformation regulated by cofilin. Inhibiting cofilin activity can cause significant defects in directional lamellipodia formation and the locomotory capacity of cell invasion, thus contributing to antimetastatic treatment. Herein, a near infrared light (NIR)&#8208;controlled nanoscale proton supplier was designed with upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a core coated in MIL&#8208;88B for interior photoacids loading; this photoacids loading can boost H+ transients in cells, which converts the cofilin to an inactive form. Strikingly, inactive cofilin loses the ability to mediate lamellipodia deformation for cell migration. Additionally, the iron, which serves as a catalyticaly active center in MIL&#8208;88B, initiates an enhanced Fenton reaction due to the increased H+ in the tumor, ultimately achieving intensive chemodynamic therapy (CDT). This work provides new insight into H+ transients in cells, which not only regulates cofilin protonation for antimetastatic treatment but also improves chemodynamic therapy.

         <title>Precise Encoding of Triple&#8208;Bond Raman Scattering of Single Polymer Nanoparticles for Multiplexed Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21846-21852, September 27, 2021. </description>

Uniform polymer nanoparticles were constructed by green emulsion polymerization, overcoming the disadvantage of large &#960;&#8208;bond conjugation while keeping many triple bonds to realize stimulated Raman scattering imaging. 15 distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations were achieved by Raman shift/intensity encoding in the biological silence region (1800&#8211;2800&#8197;cm&#8722;1), thus providing a tool for high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy in combination with innovative tagging strategies offers great potential as a universal high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging tool. Here, we report rationally tailored small molecular monomers containing triple&#8208;bond units with large Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections, which can be polymerized at the nanoscale for enhancement of SRS contrast with smaller but brighter optical nanotags with artificial fingerprint output. From this, a class of triple&#8208;bond rich polymer nanoparticles (NPs) was engineered by regulating the relative dosages of three chemically different triple&#8208;bond monomers in co&#8208;polymerization. The bonding strategy allowed for 15 spectrally distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations. These accurately structured nano molecular aggregates, rather than long&#8208;chain macromolecules, could establish a universal method for generating small&#8208;sized biological SRS imaging tags with high sensitivity for high&#8208;throughput multi&#8208;color biomedical imaging.

         <title>Resolution of Lithium Deposition versus Intercalation of Graphite Anodes in Lithium Ion Batteries: An In Situ Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21860-21867, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ EPR cell with a well&#8208;defined electrochemical response is designed to understand the lithiation/deposition behavior occurring on the graphite anode of the Li&#8208;ion battery. Li deposition on the graphite electrode occurs at +0.04&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 0.04&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. The safe cut&#8208;off potential limit for the anode during high rate cycling and inhibition of Li deposition by a vinylene carbonate additive are revealed by in situ EPR.







Abstract
In situ electrochemical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is used to understand the mixed lithiation/deposition behavior on graphite anodes during the charging process. The conductivity, degree of lithiation, and the deposition process of the graphite are reflected by the EPR spectroscopic quality factor, the spin density, and the EPR spectral change, respectively. Classical over&#8208;charging (normally associated with potentials &#8804;0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li) are not required for Li metal deposition onto the graphite anode: Li deposition initiates at ca. +0.04&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) when the scan rate is lowered to 0.04&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. The inhibition of Li deposition by vinylene carbonate (VC) additive is highlighted by the EPR results during cycling, attributed to a more mechanically flexible and polymeric SEI layer with higher ionic conductivity. A safe cut&#8208;off potential limit of +0.05&#8197;V for the anode is suggested for high rate cycling, confirmed by the EPR response over prolonged cycling.

         <title>Charge Transfer from Donor to Acceptor in Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Enhanced Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22062-22069, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy to trigger charge transfer for improving photosensitization is the covalent modification of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Charge transfer from the PAH donor to the Bodipy acceptor in CMPs can facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8211;hole separation, leading to excellent performance for both energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer reactions.







Abstract
Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron&#8208;transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP&#8208;1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP&#8208;2&#8211;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8208;hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP&#8208;2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92&#8201;% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP&#8208;1 (32&#8201;%). Experiments and theory calculations demonstrate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of these CMPs, opening a new horizon for developing HAF heterogeneous photosensitizers with highly efficient sensitizing activity by rational structure regulation at a molecular level.

&lt;p&gt;Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron-transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy-atom-free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP-1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP-2&#8211;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron-hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy-/electron-transfer reactions.

Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for cocaine&#8208;induced long&#8208;term toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. We computationally identified, re&#8208;designed, and crystallized a novel BZEase. The obtained BZEase mutant shows a 427&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency toward BZE compared to WT BZEase. In vivo tests prove that the BZEase mutant is a promising treatment for BZE detoxification.







Abstract
Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for the long&#8208;term cocaine&#8208;induced toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. BZE is also the main contaminant following cocaine consumption. Here, we identified the bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) as a BZE&#8208;metabolizing enzyme (BZEase), which can degrade BZE into biological inactive metabolites (ecgonine and benzoic acid). CocE was redesigned by a reactant&#8208;state&#8208;based enzyme design theory. An encouraging mutant denoted as BZEase2, presented a &gt;400&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency against BZE compared with wild&#8208;type (WT) CocE. In vivo, a single dose of BZEase2 (1&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme has the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was also determined.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nanobodies Allow Dual&#8208;Color Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy in Untransfected Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22075-22080, September 27, 2021. </description>

Cell&#8208;permeable nanobodies equipped with a fluorophore and a photostabilizer are introduced as powerful tools for live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By using intramolecular photostabilization dynamic processes can be monitored in untransfected living cells.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy in living cells can be restricted by the availability of small molecule probes, which only exist against few targets and genetically encoded tags. Here, we expand the applicability of live&#8208;cell STED by engineering cell&#8208;permeable and highly fluorescent nanobodies as intracellular targeting agents. To ensure bright fluorescent signals at low concentrations we used the concept of intramolecular photostabilization by ligating a fluorophore along with the photostabilizer trolox to the nanobody using expressed protein ligation (EPL). Furthermore, these semi&#8208;synthetic nanobodies are equipped with a cleavable cell&#8208;penetrating peptide for efficient cellular entry, which enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP and mCherry, as well as two endogenous targets, nuclear lamins and the DNA replication and repair protein PCNA. We monitored cell division and DNA replication via confocal and STED microscopy thus demonstrating the utility of these new intracellular tools for functional analysis.

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Heterostructured SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 with High&#8208;Valence Mn3+/4+ for Improved Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22043-22050, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An epitaxially grown SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 heterostructure has been developed for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the effect of interfacial chemistry on ORR performance, the formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial in promoting the positive shift of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and improving catalytic activity.







Abstract
Heterostructured catalysts show outstanding performance in electrochemical reactions owing to their beneficial interfacial properties. However, the rational design of heterostructured catalysts with the desired interfacial properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics is challenging. Herein, we developed a SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 (SMOx&#8208;SMO) heterostructure through epitaxial growth, which demonstrated excellent electrocatalyst performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial for promoting a positive shift in the position of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and resulting in improved catalytic activity. When SMOx&#8208;SMO was applied as an air&#8208;electrode catalyst in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, a high output voltage and power density was achieved, with performance comparable to a battery prepared with Pt/C&#8208;IrO2 air&#8208;electrode catalysts, albeit with much better cycling stability.

         <title>Direct Amidation of Esters by Ball Milling**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21868-21874, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical ball&#8208;milling enabled the direct amidation of esters through simple coupling under basic conditions (see scheme). A wide range of esters underwent amidation by this method with an array of primary and secondary amides without the need for a bulk solvent, catalysts, or additives.







Abstract
The direct mechanochemical amidation of esters by ball milling is described. The operationally simple procedure requires an ester, an amine, and substoichiometric KOtBu and was used to prepare a large and diverse library of 78 amide structures with modest to excellent efficiency. Heteroaromatic and heterocyclic components are specifically shown to be amenable to this mechanochemical protocol. This direct synthesis platform has been applied to the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and agrochemicals as well as the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of an active pharmaceutical, all in the absence of a reaction solvent.

         <title>Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Methanol through Atomically Dispersed Sn Coupled with Defective CuO Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21979-21987, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared atomically dispersed Sn catalysts on defective CuO for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. The Faradaic efficiency of methanol could reach 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The catalyst was beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The *CO was then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.







Abstract
Using renewable electricity to drive CO2 electroreduction is an attractive way to achieve carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle and produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. As an important platform molecule and clean fuel, methanol requires 6&#8208;electron transfer in the process of CO2 reduction. Currently, CO2 electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity. Herein, we report the first work to design atomically dispersed Sn site anchored on defective CuO catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. It exhibits high methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability in a H&#8208;cell, which is the highest FE(methanol) with such high current density compared with the results reported to date. The atomic Sn site, adjacent oxygen vacancy and CuO support cooperate very well, leading to higher double&#8208;layer capacitance, larger CO2 adsorption capacity and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Operando experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the catalyst is beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The obtained key intermediate *CO is then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.

         <title>An Element&#8208;Substituted Cyclobutadiene Exhibiting High&#8208;Energy Blue Phosphorescence</title>

We report the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity and photophysical properties of a planar cyclic 4&#960; system, based on studies on a diazadiboretidine derivative, an isoelectronic heterocyclic analogue of cyclobutadiene. Diazadiboretidine, despite having the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels, displays blue phosphorescence, rather than thermally activated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
1,3,2,4&#8208;Diazadiboretidine, an isoelectronic heteroanalogue of cyclobutadiene, is an interesting chemical species in terms of comparison with the carbon system, whereas its properties have never been investigated experimentally. According to Baird's rule, H&#252;ckel antiaromatic cyclobutadiene acquires aromaticity in the lowest triplet state. Here we report experimental and theoretical studies on the ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity/aromaticity as well as the photophysical properties of an isolable 1,3,2,4&#8208;diazadiboretidine derivative. The crystal structure of the diazadiboretidine derivative revealed that the B2N2 ring adopts a planar rhombic geometry in the ground state. Yet, theoretical calculations showed that the B2N2 ring turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the diazadiboretidine derivative has the lowest singlet and triplet states lying at close energy levels and displays blue phosphorescence.

Chalcogen (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) phenyl and aryl functionalised anion receptors exhibit a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Variation of electron&#8208;withdrawing/&#8208;donating properties of triazole appended&#8208; or directly Te&#8208;bound&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituents facilitated linear free energy relationship (LFER) Hammett plot analysis revealing electronic modulation of halide anion selectivity in sigma&#8208;hole anion receptor design.







Abstract
A series of acyclic anion receptors containing chalcogen bond (ChB) and halogen bond (XB) donors integrated into a neutral 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;triazole pyridine scaffold are described, in which systematic variation of the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl substituents reveal a dramatic modulation in sigma&#8208;hole donor atom potency for anion recognition. Incorporation of strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluorophenyl units appended to the triazole heterocycle telluro&#8208; or iodo&#8208; donor atoms, or directly linked to the tellurium donor atom dramatically enhances the anion binding potency of the sigma&#8208;hole receptors, most notably for the ChB and XB receptors displaying over thirty&#8208;fold and eight&#8208;fold increase in chloride anion affinity, respectively, relative to unfluorinated analogues. Linear free energy relationships for a series of ChB based receptors reveal the halide anion recognition behaviour of the tellurium donor is highly sensitive to local electronic environments. This is especially the case for those directly appended to the Te centre (3&#8901;ChB), where a remarkable enhancement of strength of binding and selectivity for the lighter halides is observed as the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the Te&#8208;bonded aryl group increases, highlighting the exciting opportunity to fine&#8208;tune anion affinity and selectivity in ChB&#8208;based receptor systems.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Glycine from Oxalic Acid and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21943-21951, September 27, 2021. </description>

By electrochemical method, stable oxalic acid and nitrate substrates were coupled into an amino acid, glycine. Insertion of electrons resulted in their conversion into nucleophile and electrophile, respectively, which led to C=N bond formation between them, as well as the conversion of the reversible C=N double bond to a stable C&#8722;N single bond.







Abstract
In manufacturing C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing compounds, it is an important challenge to alternate the conventional methodologies that utilize reactive substrates, toxic reagents, and organic solvents. In this study, we developed an electrochemical method to synthesize a C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing molecule avoiding the use of cyanides and amines by harnessing nitrate (NO3&#8722;) as a nitrogen source in an aqueous electrolyte. In addition, we utilized oxalic acid as a carbon source, which can be obtained from electrochemical conversion of CO2. Thus, our approach can provide a route for the utilization of anthropogenic CO2 and nitrate wastes, which cause serious environmental problems including global warming and eutrophication. Interestingly, the coreduction of oxalic acid and nitrate generated reactive intermediates, which led to C&#8722;N bond formation followed by further reduction to an amino acid, namely, glycine. By carefully controlling this multireduction process with a fabricated Cu&#8211;Hg electrode, we demonstrated the efficient production of glycine with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of up to 43.1&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl (current density&#8776;90&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Identification of a Bromodomain&#8208;like Region in 15&#8208;Lipoxygenase&#8208;1 Explains Its Nuclear Localization</title>

Activity&#8208;based labeling of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity using the novel one&#8208;step labeling probe Labelox B enables detection of isoenzyme inhibitory selectivity in an ELISA&#8208;based assay and visualization of the localization of LOX activity in living cells. The observed nuclear localization was rationalized by identification of a bromodomain&#8208;like region in the 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 isoenzyme.







Abstract
Lipoxygenase (LOX) activity provides oxidative lipid metabolites, which are involved in inflammatory disorders and tumorigenesis. Activity&#8208;based probes to detect the activity of LOX enzymes in their cellular context provide opportunities to explore LOX biology and LOX inhibition. Here, we developed Labelox B as a potent covalent LOX inhibitor for one&#8208;step activity&#8208;based labeling of proteins with LOX activity. Labelox B was used to establish an ELISA&#8208;based assay for affinity capture and antibody&#8208;based detection of specific LOX isoenzymes. Moreover, Labelox B enabled efficient activity&#8208;based labeling of endogenous LOXs in living cells. LOX proved to localize in the nucleus, which was rationalized by identification of a functional bromodomain&#8208;like consensus motif in 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1. This indicates that 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 is not only involved in oxidative lipid metabolism, but also in chromatin binding, which suggests a potential role in chromatin modifications.

         <title>Integrating Hydrogen Production and Transfer Hydrogenation with Selenite Promoted Electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;Nitrotoluenes to E&#8208;Nitroethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 22010-22016, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluenes to carbon&#8208;added E&#8208;nitroethenes with wide substrate scope, high selectivity, and Faradaic efficiency is integrated with boosting H2 production or transfer hydrogenation over a bifunctional NiSe electrode. In situ formed hypervalent Ni&#948;+, surface adsorbed SeOx2&#8722;, and &#8722;NO2 adsorption of intermediate promote aqueous electrooxidation of &#945;&#8208;nitrotoluene to E&#8208;nitroethene.







Abstract

         <title>Electron&#8208;Deficient Heteroacenes that Contain Two Boron Atoms: Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence Based on a Push&#8211;Pull Effect**

Push&#8211;pull modification of acene scaffolds by incorporation of two electron&#8208;accepting boron atoms and two electron&#8208;donating planarized phenyl ether moieties renders the resulting compounds near&#8208;infrared (NIR) active. Of particular note is a thienothiophene&#8208;centered 10&#8208;ring&#8208;fused diboraheteroacene that exhibits a sharp NIR emission band with a narrow band width.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient heteroacenes that contain two tricoordinate boron atoms in their acene skeletons and planarized phenyl ether moieties at their periphery were synthesized via the borylation of silicon&#8208;bridged precursors. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis revealed quinoidal structures, which give rise to two&#8208;step reversible redox processes for both the reduction and oxidation. These compounds exhibit intense absorption and sharp fluorescence bands with vibronic structures in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region. These properties originate from the push&#8211;pull effect along the long axis of the molecule derived from the electron&#8208;donating ether moieties and the electron&#8208;accepting boron moieties. Of particular note is the NIR emission of the thienothiophene&#8208;centered heteroacene, which has a maximum at 952&#8197;nm with a narrow band width of 309&#8197;cm&#8722;1 in cyclohexane. A Franck&#8211;Condon analysis revealed the crucial role of the sterically less&#8208;hindered thienothiophene spacer in achieving this sharp emission band.

A Cu&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based large&#8208;scale, ultrathin nanosheet with numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks was developed for the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 under neutral conditions. This catalyst exhibits a superior FE
 of 70&#8201;% with a high current density (&#8722;183.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V under rarely reported neutral conditions and maintains FE
&gt;51&#8201;% over a wide potential range (&#8722;1.5 to &#8722;1.7&#8197;V) in a flow cell.







Abstract
The exploration of novel systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the production of hydrocarbons like CH4 remains a giant challenge. Well&#8208;designed electrocatalysts with advantages like proton generation/transferring and intermediate&#8208;fixating for efficient CO2RR are much preferred yet largely unexplored. In this work, a kind of Cu&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based large&#8208;scale (&#8776;1.5&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin nanosheet (&#8776;5&#8197;nm) has been successfully applied in electrochemical CO2RR. It exhibits a superior FE
 of 70&#8201;% with a high current density (&#8722;183.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V under rarely reported neutral conditions and maintains FE
&gt;51&#8201;% over a wide potential range (&#8722;1.5 to &#8722;1.7&#8197;V) in a flow cell. The high performance can be attributed to the construction of numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks through the integration of diaminotriazine with Cu&#8208;porphyrin, which is beneficial for proton migration and intermediate stabilization, as supported by DFT calculations. This work paves a new way in exploring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;based materials as efficient CO2RR catalysts.

         <title>Chiral Distorted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes Bearing a Nonagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene</title>

The larger the ring, the better the chiroptical properties: A new family of highly distorted nanographenes is presented incorporating for the first time a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle. The nonagon&#8208;containing [5]helicene results in an extremely twisted helical moiety and provides the final chiral PAHs with enhanced chiroptical properties.







Abstract
A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs|=4.2&#215;10&#8722;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.

Carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable symmetric surfaces were used to develop aggregation&#8208;induced emissive CD polymer gels with reversible two&#8208;switch&#8208;mode fluorescence (blue dispersed fluorescence and red AIE), followed by the fabrication of anisotropic swimming robots showing octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and autonomous locomotion on the water surface.







Abstract
Some living organisms such as the octopus have fantastic abilities to simultaneously swim away and alter body color/morphology for disguise and self&#8208;protection, especially when there is a threat perception. However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi&#8208;functional bio&#8208;inspired intelligent soft robotics.

         <title>Selective Electrosynthetic Hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Esters with Carbon Dioxide**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21832-21837, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrosynthetic hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated olefins with excellent regioselectivity is reported. The method requires no sacrificial electrode and is thus amenable to a flow configuration. The products are purified by simple crystallization. The synthesis of a precursor to ethosuximide, which contains an all&#8208;carbon quaternary center, illustrates the potential of the process. Finally, a robustness study has benchmarked the process for future users.







Abstract
The carboxylation of low&#8208;value commodity chemicals to provide higher&#8208;value carboxylic acids is of significant interest. Recently alternative routes to the traditional hydroformylation processes that used potentially toxic carbon monoxide and a transition metal catalyst have appeared. A significant challenge has been the selectivity observed for olefin carboxylation. Photochemical methods have shown a viable route towards the hydrocarboxylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes but rely on the use of an excess reducing or amine reagent. Herein we report our investigations of an electrochemical approach that is able to hydrocarboxylate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes with excellent regioselectivity and the ability to carboxylate hindered substrates to afford &#945;&#8208;quaternary center carboxylic acids. The reported process requires no chromatography and the products are purified by simple crystallization from the reaction mixture after work&#8208;up.

The ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state properties of a diazadiboretidine (DADBT) derivative, an isoelectronic heterocyclic analogue of cyclobutadiene, are reported by Henrik Ottosson, Hiromi Nakai, Tadaaki Ikoma, Takanori Fukushima, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21817. While the B2N2 ring of the DADBT derivative adopts a rhombic geometry in the ground state, it turns to a square geometry with a nonaromatic character in the lowest triplet state. Notably, the DADBT derivative displays blue phosphorescence in solution, providing insight into the photophysical properties of heterocyclic &#960;&#8208;systems.

An effective strategy to endow an acene skeleton with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission properties is reported by Shigehiro Yamaguchi and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;21853. The incorporation of boron and oxygen atoms furnishes a push&#8211;pull structure along the periphery of the acene skeleton. In particular, a thienothiophene&#8208;based diboraheteroacene exhibits a sharp NIR emission band with a narrow band width.

Escape from flatland. Increased saturation (fraction of sp3) is more likely to be successful when moving compounds through the drug development pipeline. Bridged nitrogen heterocycles have a huge potential in drug discovery, although long synthetic sequences are typically required. New step&#8208;economic and selective organic syntheses are therefore highly sought after. Bert U.&#8197;W. Maes et&#8197;al. describe in their Research Article on page&#8197;21988 the synthesis of the normorphan skeleton through challenging tandem catalysis. Cover design by Joris Snaet.

         <title>Catalytic Generation of Carbanions through Carbonyl Umpolung</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21624-21634, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel catalytic strategies for the generation of functionalized carbanionic species by carbonyl Umpolung are discussed in this Minireview. The application of metal catalysis and photocatalysis significantly facilitates the generation and conversion of carbanionic intermediates starting from carbonyl compounds.







Abstract
Carbonyl Umpolung is a powerful strategy in organic chemistry to construct complex molecules. Over the last few years, versatile catalytic approaches for the generation of acyl anion equivalents from carbonyl compounds have been developed, but methods to obtain alkyl carbanions from carbonyl compounds in a catalytic fashion are still at an early stage. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in the generation of alkyl carbanions through catalytic carbonyl Umpolung. Two different catalytic approaches can be utilized to enable the generation of alkyl carbanions from carbonyl compounds: the catalytic Wolff&#8211;Kishner reaction and the catalytic single&#8208;electron reduction of carbonyl compounds and imines. We discuss the reaction scope, mechanistic insights, and synthetic applications of the methods as well as potential future developments.

         <title>Defect Passivation in Lead&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals and Thin Films: Toward Efficient LEDs and Solar Cells</title>

Despite the defect&#8208;tolerance of lead&#8208;halide perovskites, defects at the surface of colloidal nanocrystals and grain boundaries in thin films play a critical role in charge&#8208;carrier transport and nonradiative recombination, which lowers the photoluminescence quantum yields, device efficiency, and stability. This Review summarizes the defects, their influence on the optical and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties, and passivation strategies to mitigate the effects of defects.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs), in the form of both colloidal nanocrystals (NCs) and thin films, have emerged over the past decade as leading candidates for next&#8208;generation, efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells. Owing to their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), LHPs efficiently convert injected charge carriers into light and vice versa. However, despite the defect&#8208;tolerance of LHPs, defects at the surface of colloidal NCs and grain boundaries in thin films play a critical role in charge&#8208;carrier transport and nonradiative recombination, which lowers the PLQYs, device efficiency, and stability. Therefore, understanding the defects that play a key role in limiting performance, and developing effective passivation routes are critical for achieving advances in performance. This Review presents the current understanding of defects in halide perovskites and their influence on the optical and charge&#8208;carrier transport properties. Passivation strategies toward improving the efficiencies of perovskite&#8208;based LEDs and solar cells are also discussed.

         <title>The First High&#8208;Pressure Chromium Oxonitridoborate CrB4O6N&#8212;an Unexpected Link to Nitridosilicate Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21801-21806, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature approach, CrB4O6N could be obtained as the first oxonitridoborate containing BO3N tetrahedra and building up a 3D framework. In contrast to other members of this substance class, the nitrogen atoms connect four boron atoms. Homeotypes can be found in the nitridosilicates MYbSi4N7 (M=Sr, Ba, Eu), which were the first to feature this fourfold connected nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
CrB4O6N crystallizes in the non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P63mc (no. 186) with the lattice parameters a=5.1036(1), c=8.3519(3)&#8197;&#197;, and a volume of 188.40(1)&#8197;&#197;3. It was synthesized in a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature experiment at 7&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K and represents the first high&#8208;pressure oxonitridoborate. It is built up of starlike&#8208;shaped entities of four BO3N tetrahedra, connected via one common nitrogen atom that resembles the fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen atoms in the homeotypic nitridosilicates MYbSi4N7 (M=Sr, Ba). Building up a network with channels that contain the Cr3+ ions, CrB4O6N contains for the first time a tetrahedral building unit in contrast to trigonal planar B(O/N)3 entities in all other known oxonitridoborates. The structural relations as well as the results of spectroscopic measurements and calculations on the chromium oxonitridoborate are discussed.

&lt;i&gt;mc&lt;/i&gt; (no. 186) with the lattice parameters &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=5.1036(1), &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=8.3519(3)&#8197;&#197;, and a volume of 188.40(1)&#8197;&#197;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It was synthesized in a high-pressure/high-temperature experiment at 7&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K and represents the first high-pressure oxonitridoborate. It is built up of starlike-shaped entities of four BO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N tetrahedra, connected via one common nitrogen atom that resembles the fourfold-coordinated nitrogen atoms in the homeotypic nitridosilicates MYbSi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Sr, Ba). Building up a network with channels that contain the Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, CrB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N contains for the first time a tetrahedral building unit in contrast to trigonal planar B(O/N)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; entities in all other known oxonitridoborates. The structural relations as well as the results of spectroscopic measurements and calculations on the chromium oxonitridoborate are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Template Guiding for the Encapsulation of Uniformly Subnanometric Platinum Clusters in Beta&#8208;Zeolites Enabling High Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>

A template&#8208;guidance protocol was reported for the synthesis of subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite. The metal ions are guided to the internal channels of the zeolite template through electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention because of their unique properties as heterogeneous catalysts. However, it is challenging to obtain uniformly distributed metal clusters under synthesis and reaction conditions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;guidance protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, with the metal ions anchored to the internal channels of the zeolite template via electrostatic interactions. Pt metal clusters with a narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22&#8197;nm have been obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with a broad range of Si/Al molar ratios (15&#8211;200). The uniformly distributed Pt clusters in Pt@H&#8208;beta are subject to strong electron withdrawal by the zeolite, which promotes transfer of active hydrogen, providing excellent activity and stability in hydrodeoxygenation reactions. A general strategy is thus proposed for the encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites with high thermal stability.

The catalyst&#8208;free direct 1,2&#8208;carboboration of ynamides with readily available dichloroboranes is presented. Valuable &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trisubstituted alkenylboronates are obtained in high yields with complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity under very mild conditions.







Abstract
Catalyst&#8208;free 1,2&#8208;carboboration of ynamides is presented. Readily available aryldichloroboranes react with alkyl&#8208; or aryl&#8208;substituted ynamides in high yields with complete regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity to valuable &#946;&#8208;boryl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;alkyl/aryl &#945;&#8208;aryl substituted enamides which belong to the class of trisubstituted alkenylboronates. The 1,2&#8208;carboboration reaction is experimentally easy to conduct, shows high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope. Gram&#8208;scale reactions and diverse synthetic transformations convincingly demonstrate the synthetic potential of this method. The reaction can also be used to access 1&#8208;boraphenalenes, a class of boron&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructures by Combining Crystallization&#8208;Driven and Molecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

Hierarchical fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures are accessible by utilizing the unique corona structure of patchy worm&#8208;like micelles immobilized on electrospun polymer fibers and the molecular self&#8208;assembly of a 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamide. The used combination of crystallization&#8208;driven and molecular self&#8208;assembly concepts can give access to a large variety of fibrillar superstructures with potential applications in filtration or catalysis.







Abstract
Combining the unique corona structure of worm&#8208;like patchy micelles immobilized on a polymer fiber with the molecular self&#8208;assembly of 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxamides (BTAs) leads to hierarchical superstructures with a fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like morphology. For this purpose, worm&#8208;like patchy micelles bearing pendant, functional tertiary amino groups in one of the corona patches were prepared by crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly and immobilized on a supporting polystyrene fiber by coaxial electrospinning. The obtained patchy fibers were then immersed in an aqueous solution of a tertiary amino&#8208;functionalized BTA to induce patch&#8208;mediated molecular self&#8208;assembly to well&#8208;defined fir&#8208;tree&#8208;like superstructures upon solvent evaporation. Interestingly, defined superstructures are obtained only if the pendant functional groups in the surface patches match with the peripheral substituents of the BTA, which is attributed to a local increase in BTA concentration at the polymer fibers&#8217; surface.

Based on the strategy of nucleic acid hydrolysis targeting chimera, 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;poly(A)4&#8208;modified chimeric oligonucleotides were developed for enhanced degradation of the envelope or spike RNA of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in vitro. The oligonucleotides can recognize specific viral RNA sequences and 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; poly(A)4 can activate RNase L to cleave them specifically.







Abstract
There is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs and alleviate the current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Herein we report the design and construction of chimeric oligonucleotides comprising a 2&#8242;&#8208;OMe&#8208;modified antisense oligonucleotide and a 5&#8242;&#8208;phosphorylated 2&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; poly(A)4 (4A2&#8208;5) to degrade envelope and spike RNAs of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. The oligonucleotide was used for searching and recognizing target viral RNA sequence, and the conjugated 4A2&#8208;5 was used for guided RNase L activation to sequence&#8208;specifically degrade viral RNAs. Since RNase L can potently cleave single&#8208;stranded RNA during innate antiviral response, degradation efficiencies with these chimeras were twice as much as those with only antisense oligonucleotides for both SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA targets. In pseudovirus infection models, chimera&#8208;S4 achieved potent and broad&#8208;spectrum inhibition of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its N501Y and/or &#916;H69/&#916;V70 mutants, indicating a promising antiviral agent based on the nucleic acid&#8208;hydrolysis targeting chimera (NATAC) strategy.

[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene 1 with carbodiimides and isocyanates yield four&#8208;membered metallaheterocyles 2&#8211;6. The carbodiimide cycloadditions are fully reversible at elevated temperature, as was also observed in reactions of compounds 4&#8211;6 with CO2.







Abstract
[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)]2) with carbodiimides [C(NR)2; R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy] and isocyanates [RNCO; R=Et, i&#8208;Pr, Cy] yielded four&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(X)NR]GaL (X=NR, R=i&#8208;Pr 2, Cy 3; X=O, R=Et 4, i&#8208;Pr 5, Cy 6). Compounds 4&#8211;6 reversibly react with CO2 via [2+2] cycloaddition at ambient temperature to the six&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(O)O]&#8208;&#956;&#8208;C(O)N(R)GaL (R=Et 7, i&#8208;Pr 8, Cy 9). Compounds 2&#8211;9 were characterized by IR and heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, while quantum chemical calculations provided a deeper understanding on the energetics of the reactions.

Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules with sound cardiovascular activities. Myxadazoles consist of a N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole ring was originated from the endogenous vitamin B12 metabolism pathway. A plausible C&#8722;N cross coupling is likely to coordinate the convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways that led to the final construction of the unique chemical scaffold of myxadazoles.







Abstract
There is a continuous need for novel microbial natural products to fill the drying&#8208;up drug development pipeline. Herein, we report myxadazoles from Myxococcus sp. SDU36, a family of novel chimeric small molecules that consist of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole and a linear fatty acid chain endowed with an isoxazole ring. The experiments of genome sequencing, gene insertion mutation, isotope labelling, and precursor feeding demonstrated that the fatty acid chain was encoded by a non&#8208;canonical PKS/NRPS gene cluster, whereas the origin of N&#8208;ribityl 5,6&#8208;dimethylbenzimidazole was related to the vitamin B12 metabolism. The convergence of these two distinct biosynthetic pathways through a C&#8208;N coupling led to the unique chemical framework of myxadazoles, which is an unprecedented hybridization mode in the paradigm of natural products. Myxadazoles exhibited potent vasculogenesis promotion effect and moderate antithrombotic activity, underscoring their potential usage for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

Bicyclic diarylethene&#8208;containing analogues of the sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1) can modulate activity of serine proteases in the nanomolar&#8211;micromolar range in highly efficient photocontrollable manner.







Abstract
A bicyclic peptide scaffold was chemically adapted to generate diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of serine protease Bos taurus trypsin&#8197;1 (T1). Starting from a prototype molecule&#8212;sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1)&#8212;we obtained light&#8208;controllable inhibitors of T1 with Ki in the low nanomolar range, whose activity could be modulated over 20&#8208;fold by irradiation. The inhibitory potency as well as resistance to proteolytic degradation were systematically studied on a series of 17&#8197;SFTI&#8208;1 analogues. The hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the structure of inhibitors and possibly the enzyme&#8211;inhibitor binding dynamics were affected by isomerization of the photoswitch. The feasibility of manipulating enzyme activity in time and space was demonstrated by controlled digestion of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and an antimicrobial peptide BP100&#8208;RW. Finally, our design principles of diarylethene photoswitches are shown to apply also for the development of other serine protease inhibitors.

         <title>Imaging of Cancer Cells and Dictated Cytotoxicity Using Aptamer&#8208;Guided Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)&#8208;Generated G&#8208;Quadruplex Chains</title>

The versatility of DNA nanotechnology enables the aptamer&#8208;guided hybridization chain reaction (HCR)&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains to a discriminative imaging of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The permeation of ZnIIPPIX functionalized nanowires into the malignant TNBC cells leads to a selective cytotoxicity and an effective photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) treatment toward cancer cells.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides powerful tools for developing cancer theranostics. Here we introduce the autonomous surface&#8208;nucleolin&#8208;guided HCR that leads to the polymerization of G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, in which the ZnII&#8208;protoporphyrin IX is intercalated. We demonstrate that MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 (Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells, TNBC) with overexpressed surface nucleolin were able to induce HCR leading to the formation of the ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, while the M10 epithelial breast cells served as control. The ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded nanowires allow the selective imaging of TNBC, and their permeation into the TNBC leads to selective cytotoxicity and guided photodynamic therapy toward the cancer cells due to structural perturbation of the membranes. The aptamer&#8208;guided HCR&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains may serve as a versatile tool to target TNBC featuring poor prognosis and high pathological risk of recurrence, thus offering a promising theranostic platform.

         <title>Revealing Ammonia Quantification Minefield in Photo/Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21728-21731, September 27, 2021. </description>

The analytical methods for the detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2&#8197;ppm in photo/electrocatalytic N2 fixation are evaluated rigorously, reliably, and insightfully. The low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification minefield was indicated and a rigorous ammonia detection flowchart as well as another reference standard to achieve a more accurate and responsible ammonia detection in photo/electrocatalysis was concluded.







Abstract
Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis has recently developed fast while the ammonia yields over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH3 brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error&#8208;prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;The analytical methods for the detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2&#8197;ppm in photo/electrocatalytic N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation are evaluated rigorously, reliably, and insightfully. The low-concentration ammonia quantification minefield was indicated and a rigorous ammonia detection flowchart as well as another reference standard to achieve a more accurate and responsible ammonia detection in photo/electrocatalysis was concluded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis has recently developed fast while the ammonia yields over state-of-the-art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH3 brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error-prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low-concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hard X&#8208;Ray Nanotomography for 3D Analysis of Coking in Nickel&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21772-21777, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of coke in nickel&#8208;based catalyst particles can be investigated by ptychographic X&#8208;ray computed tomography with sub&#8208;100&#8197;nm resolution. Based on localized changes of electron density between the activated and coked catalysts, the location of coke can be resolved in 3D at the nanoscale. This approach can be used to study different catalyst deactivation pathways on multiple length scales from nm to &#956;m.







Abstract
Understanding catalyst deactivation by coking is crucial for knowledge&#8208;based catalyst and process design in reactions with carbonaceous species. Post&#8208;mortem analysis of catalyst coking is often performed by bulk characterization methods. Here, hard X&#8208;ray ptychographic computed tomography (PXCT) was used to study Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for CO2 methanation and CH4 dry reforming after artificial coking treatment. PXCT generated quantitative 3D maps of local electron density at ca. 80&#8197;nm resolution, allowing to visualize and evaluate the severity of coking in entire catalyst particles of ca. 40&#8197;&#956;m diameter. Coking was primarily revealed in the nanoporous solid, which was not detectable in resolved macropores. Coke formation was independently confirmed by operando Raman spectroscopy. PXCT is highlighted as an emerging characterization tool for nanoscale identification, co&#8208;localization, and potentially quantification of deactivation phenomena in 3D space within entire catalyst particles.

         <title>Active in Sleep: Iron Guanidine Catalyst Performs ROP on Dormant Side of ATRP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21795-21800, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthogonal catalysis combining two polymerization mechanisms in a one&#8208;pot synthesis enables facile production routes to block copolymers. An iron guanidine catalyst is able to copolymerize styrene via ATRP and lactide via ROP simultaneously. By using the FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium for ROP both mechanisms proceed in a controlled manner without interference.







Abstract
Copolymers are the answer to property limitations of homopolymers. In order to use the full variety of monomers available, catalysts active in more than one polymerization mechanism are currently investigated. Iron guanidine catalysts have shown to be extraordinarily active in ROP of lactide and herein prove their versatility by also promoting ATRP of styrene. The presented iron complex is the first polymerizing lactide and styrene simultaneously to a defined block copolymer in a convenient one&#8208;pot synthesis. Both mechanisms work hand in hand with ROP using the dominantly present FeII species on the dormant side of the ATRP equilibrium. This orthogonal copolymerization by a benign iron catalyst opens up new pathways to biocompatible polymerization procedures broadening the scope of ATRP applications.

We show that protonated merocyanines can act as reversible photoacids even when buffered with NaOH, attaining tunable and fully reversible jumps of up to 3 pH units between pH&#8197;7 and 4.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;switchable buffer system based on a merocyanine photoacid is presented. Para&#8208;substitution of the indolium side with a methoxy group affords a compound suitable for making hydrolytically stable aqueous buffers whose pH can be tuned between 7 and 4 using 500&#8197;nm light.

Paramagnetic DUT&#8208;8(Ni) metal&#8211;organic frameworks were characterised over an extended temperature range with 1H&#8208;detected NMR techniques under fast magic&#8208;angle spinning. The sensitivity of the approach allows rapid access to structure and dynamics of the organic linkers as well as the electronic properties of the metal centres in these materials.







Abstract
We present a toolbox for the rapid characterisation of powdered samples of paramagnetic metal&#8211;organic frameworks at natural abundance by 1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR. Very fast MAS rates at room and cryogenic temperatures and a set of tailored radiofrequency irradiation schemes help overcome the sensitivity and resolution limits often associated with the characterisation of MOF materials. We demonstrate the approach on DUT&#8208;8(Ni), a framework containing Ni2+ paddle&#8208;wheel units which can exist in two markedly different architectures. Resolved 1H and 13C&#8197;resonances of organic linkers are detected and assigned in few hours with only 1&#8211;2&#8197;mg of sample at natural isotopic abundance, and used to rapidly extract information on structure and local internal dynamics of the assemblies, as well as to elucidate the metal electronic properties over an extended temperature range. The experiments disclose new possibilities for describing local and global structural changes and correlating them to electronic and magnetic properties of the assemblies.

         <title>Carbon Nitride Supported High&#8208;Loading Fe Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Activation of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate 1O2 with 100&#8201;% Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21751-21755, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (Fe1/CN) with a Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% was developed to generate 100&#8201;% 1O2 by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The adsorption of terminal O and oxidation of PMS by Fe&#8208;N4 sites played the most important roles for 1O2 generation with 100&#8201;% selectivity. As a result, the Fe1/CN activated PMS system exhibited strong resistance to various factors during the degradation of organic pollutants.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of 1O2. In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single&#8208;atoms catalyst (Fe1/CN) containing highly uniform Fe&#8208;N4 active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The Fe1/CN achieves generation of 100&#8201;% 1O2 by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p&#8208;chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single&#8208;atom sites, the Fe&#8208;N4 sites in Fe1/CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO5.&#8722;, and thereafter efficiently generate 1O2 with 100&#8201;% selectivity. In addition, the Fe1/CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS.

     alt="Carbon Nitride Supported High-Loading Fe Single-Atom Catalyst for Activation of Peroxymonosulfate to Generate 1O2 with 100&#8201;% Selectivity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon nitride supported Fe single-atom catalyst (Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CN) with a Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% was developed to generate 100&#8201;% &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). The adsorption of terminal O and oxidation of PMS by Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites played the most important roles for &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation with 100&#8201;% selectivity. As a result, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CN activated PMS system exhibited strong resistance to various factors during the degradation of organic pollutants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an excellent active species for the selective degradation of organic pollutions. However, it is difficult to achieve high efficiency and selectivity for the generation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this work, we develop a graphitic carbon nitride supported Fe single-atoms catalyst (Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CN) containing highly uniform Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; active sites with a high Fe loading of 11.2&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CN achieves generation of 100&#8201;% &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), which shows an ultrahigh p-chlorophenol degradation efficiency. Density functional theory calculations results demonstrate that in contrast to Co and Ni single-atom sites, the Fe-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites in Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CN adsorb the terminal O of PMS, which can facilitate the oxidization of PMS to form SO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and thereafter efficiently generate &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with 100&#8201;% selectivity. In addition, the Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CN exhibits strong resistance to inorganic ions, natural organic matter, and pH value during the degradation of organic pollutants in the presence of PMS. This work develops a novel catalyst for the 100&#8201;% selective production of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for highly selective and efficient degradation of pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling the Use of Alkyl Thianthrenium Salts in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21756-21760, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of thianthrenium salts have been developed that can undergo C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage and be used as reliable alkyl reagents. This ability has been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira and Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Alkyl groups are one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Here, a a series of thianthrenium salts have been synthesized that act as reliable alkylation reagents and readily engage in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira reactions to build C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under mild photochemical conditions. Diverse alkyl thianthrenium salts, including methyl and disubstituted thianthrenium salts, are employed with great functional breadth, since sensitive Cl, Br, and I atoms, which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches, are compatible. The generality of the developed alkyl reagents has also been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Kumada reactions.

         <title>A Wireframe DNA Cube: Antibody Conjugate for Targeted Delivery of Multiple Copies of Monomethyl Auristatin&#8197;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21691-21696, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for preparation of an antibody, DNA wireframe cube, drug conjugate with exactly seven copies of the cytotoxic drug MMAE is presented. The drug is conjugated to a DNA strand via a cleavable linker and the conjugate is used for preparing a DNA wireframe cube. The drug loaded cube is furthermore attached to the antibody Trastuzumab. The construct is used for targeted drug delivery of MMAE to a HER2 positive cell line in vitro and a dramatic decline in viability is observed only for cells that overexpress the HER2 receptor.







Abstract
In recent years, several antibody drug conjugates (ADC) have been accepted by the FDA as therapeutics against cancer. It is well&#8208;known that control of drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) is vital for the success of an ADC, which inspires the advancement of better and simpler methods for tight control of DAR. We present the development of an antibody DNA wireframe cube conjugate for precise control of DAR. The DNA wireframe cube consists of four single strands, which when folded present eight single stranded domains. One domain is bound to a monofunctionalized antibody DNA conjugate, and the seven others are attached to DNA functionalized with the potent tubulin inhibitor MMAE, thereby preparing an ADC with a DAR of precisely seven. The formation of the ADC is investigated by gel electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy. Lastly, the developed MMAE loaded ADC was used for targeted drug delivery in vitro.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction on Pd3Bi Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21741-21745, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform nanocrystals of intermetallic or solid&#8211;solution Pd3Bi alloy are prepared and demonstrated to exhibit intriguing phase dependence during electrochemical CO2 reduction in aqueous solution. The former can achieve unity formate selectivity and great CO poisoning resistance, while the latter has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60&#8201;%.







Abstract
Alloying is a general strategy for modulating the electronic structures of catalyst materials. Compared to more common solid&#8211;solution alloys, intermetallic alloys feature well&#8208;defined atomic arrangements and provide the unique platform for studying the structure&#8208;performance correlations. It is, unfortunately, synthetically challenging to prepare the nanostructures of intermetallic alloys for catalysis research. In this contribution, we prepare intermetallic Pd3Bi nanocrystals of a uniform size via a facile solvothermal method. These nanocrystals can phase&#8208;transform into solid solution alloy via thermal annealing while retaining a similar composition and size. In 0.1&#8197;M KHCO3 aqueous solution, the intermetallic Pd3Bi can selectively reduce CO2 to formate with high selectivity (&#8776;100&#8201;%) and stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.35&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, whereas the solid solution alloy has limited formate selectivity of &lt;60&#8201;%. Such unique phase&#8208;dependence is understood via theoretical simulations showing that the crystallographic ordering of Pd and Bi atoms within intermetallic alloys can suppress CO poisoning and enhance the *OCHO adsorption during electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate.

         <title>Picomole&#8208;Scale Synthesis and Screening of Macrocyclic Compound Libraries by Acoustic Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21702-21707, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach has been developed for synthesizing and screening large libraries of macrocyclic compounds at a picomole scale. The macrocycles were synthesized by combinatorially transferring reagents in 2.5&#8197;nL droplets to microwell plates using acoustic waves. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a library of 2700 macrocyclic compounds was synthesized and potent inhibitors of the protein&#8211;protein interaction p53&#8211;MDM2 were identified.







Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are an attractive class of therapeutic ligands against challenging targets, such as protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, the development of macrocycles as drugs is hindered by the lack of large combinatorial macrocyclic libraries, which are cumbersome, expensive, and time consuming to make, screen, and deconvolute. Here, we established a strategy for synthesizing and screening combinatorial libraries on a picomolar scale by using acoustic droplet ejection to combine building blocks at nanoliter volumes, which reduced the reaction volumes, reagent consumption, and synthesis time. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we assembled a 2700&#8208;member target&#8208;focused macrocyclic library that we could subsequently assay in the same microtiter synthesis plates, saving the need for additional transfers and deconvolution schemes. We screened the library against the MDM2&#8211;p53 protein&#8211;protein interaction and generated micromolar and sub&#8208;micromolar inhibitors. Our approach based on acoustic liquid transfer provides a general strategy for the development of macrocycle ligands.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure CO Electroreduction at Silver Produces Ethanol and Propanol</title>

Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is of great interest. Here, CO reduction was studied on silver at high surface coverage, as DFT results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. The results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol, ethylene glycol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO2, copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.

         <title>Cycloadditions with a Stable Charge&#8208;Separated Cyclobutadiene&#8208;Type Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon Ring Compound</title>

The reductive debromination of {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 with activated magnesium yields a cyclobutadiene&#8208;type silicon ring compound 2 with a charge&#8208;separated electronic situation, which undergoes cycloadditions with alkenes and alkynes to yield unsaturated bicyclic and tricyclic silicon ring compounds with Si=Si and/or C=C double bonds (3&#8211;6).







Abstract
Reductive debromination of {N(SiMe3)2}SiBr3 with Rieke magnesium results in the formation of the five&#8208;vertex silicon cluster with one bromine substituent Si5{N(SiMe3)2}5Br, 1, and the cyclobutadiene analogue 2 in a 1:1 ratio. The latter features a planar four&#8208;membered silicon ring with a charge&#8208;separated electronic situation. Two silicon atoms in 2 are trigonal planar and the other two trigonal pyramidal. In cycloadditions with ethylene, diethylacetylene, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, and 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene cyclic unsaturated ring compounds (3&#8211;6) were formed at room temperature in quantitative reactions. Two of the products (3 and 6) show photochemical isomerization with LED light (&#955;=405&#8197;nm) to afford saturated ring compounds 4&#8201;e and 6&#8242;.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Dioxygenation of (Aza&#8208;)Alkenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21723-21727, September 27, 2021. </description>

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular difunctionalization of (aza&#8208;)alkenols with excellent regioselectivity is reported. A new generation of C&#8208;6&#8208;modified Pyox ligands together with the use of unusual hypervalent iodine reagents as oxidants enabled the generation of acyloxy&#8208;functionalized heterocycles in excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
An oxidative Pd&#8208;catalyzed intra&#8208;intermolecular dioxygenation of (aza&#8208;)alkenols has been reported, with total regioselectivity. To study the stereoselectivity, different chiral ligands as well as different hypervalent&#8208;iodine compounds have been compared. In particular, by using a C&#8208;6 modified pyridinyl&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) ligand and hypervalent iodine bearing an aromatic ring, an excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity has been achieved.

A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of amidines has been developed for the synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers. A wide range of benzimidazole derivatives containing N&#8722;C axial chirality can be conveniently constructed in excellent yields and enantioselectivities by intramolecular amination.







Abstract
N&#8722;C Biaryl atropisomers are prevalent in natural products and bioactive drug molecules. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such molecules has not developed significantly. Particularly, the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers by stereoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination remains unprecedented. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy is presented for the synthesis of N&#8722;C axially chiral biaryl molecules. A broad spectrum of N&#8722;C axially chiral compounds was obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). The practicality of this reaction was validated in the synthesis of useful biological molecules.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Enantiopure Pyrrolidines by C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21708-21712, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple hydrocarbons such as alkanes are shown to be useful building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of heterocycles. They are converted in only two steps to pyrrolidines by application of stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reactions. Symmetrical and non&#8208;symmetrical enantiopure 2,5&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolidines are isolated in good yields.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure pyrrolidines is reported via a streamlined strategy relying on two sequential C&#8722;H functionalizations of simple hydrocarbons. The first step is a regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalytic nitrene C&#8722;H insertion. Then, a subsequent diastereoselective cyclization involving a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a N&#8208;centered radical leads to the formation of pyrrolidines that can then be converted to their free NH&#8208;derivatives.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Formation of Polymer Janus Discs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21668-21672, September 27, 2021. </description>

Nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs were fabricated from ABC triblock terpolymers through cross&#8208;linking and disassembly of prolate ellipsoidal particles. By varying the pore diameter of a Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane, the size of prolate ellipsoidal particles and the corresponding Janus discs can be well controlled.







Abstract
A straightforward method is presented for the preparation of nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs with controlled shape, size, and aspect ratio. The method relies on cross&#8208;linkable ABC triblock terpolymers and involves first the preparation of prolate ellipsoidal microparticles by combining Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane emulsification with evaporation&#8208;induced confinement assembly (EICA). By varying the pore diameter of the SPG membrane, we produce Janus discs with controlled size distributions centered around hundreds of nanometers to several microns. We further transferred the discs to water by mild sulfonation of PS to polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) and verified the Janus character by subsequent labelling with cationic nanoparticles. Finally, we show that the sulfonated Janus discs are amphiphilic and can be used as efficient colloidal stabilizers for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) emulsions.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane to Ethylene in a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21746-21750, September 27, 2021. </description>

Here we demonstrate efficient electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane at the anode in conjunction with CO2 electrolysis at the cathode in a solid oxide electrolyzer at reduced temperature.







Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is an important process in light olefin industry; however, the over&#8208;oxidation of ethane leads to low ethylene selectivity. Here, we report a novel approach to electrochemical oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane in anode in conjunction with CO2 reduction at cathode in a solid oxide electrolyser using a porous single&#8208;crystalline CeO2 electrode at 600&#8201;&#176;C. We identify and engineer the flux and chemical states of active oxygen species that evolve from the lattice at anode surface to activate and dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene via the reaction of epoxy species. Active oxygen species (O2&#8722;, O22&#8722; and O2&#8722;) at the anode surface effectively dehydrogenate ethane to ethylene, but O&#8722; species tend to induce deep oxidation. We demonstrate exceptionally high ethylene selectivity of 95&#8201;% and an ethane conversion of 10&#8201;% with a durable operation of 300&#8197;h.

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Induced Defects in MOF&#8208;Derived Single Cobalt Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 40, Page 21685-21690, September 27, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylation gives Co&#8208;N4 catalysts with rich defects for use in the oxygen reduction reaction. The defect near the Co&#8208;N4 site weakens the adsorption free energy of OOH on the cobalt active center, which significantly improves the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Co&#8208;N4 site and leads to a remarkable turnover frequency.







Abstract
Developing transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we report a decarboxylation&#8208;induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed&#8208;linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas&#8208;transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF&#8208;8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;900), Co@DMOF&#8208;900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double&#8208;layer capacitance show better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of the 6,10&#8208;Bicyclic Eunicellane Skeleton by the Bacterial Diterpene Synthase Bnd4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic and mechanistic characterization of Bnd4, a bacterial diterpene synthase and the first terpene synthase known to form the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic eunicellane skeleton. Isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the cyclization mechanism for benditerpe&#8208;2,6,15&#8208;triene. An unusual DNxxxD motif was found to be essential for cyclization activity.







Abstract
The eunicellane diterpenoids are a unique family of natural products seen in marine organisms, plants, and bacteria. We used a series of biochemical, bioinformatics, and theoretical experiments to investigate the mechanism of the first diterpene synthase known to form the eunicellane skeleton. Deuterium labeling studies and quantum chemical calculations support that Bnd4, from Streptomyces sp. (CL12&#8208;4), forms the 6,10&#8208;bicyclic skeleton through a 1,10&#8208;cyclization, 1,3&#8208;hydride shift, and 1,14&#8208;cyclization cascade. Bnd4 also demonstrated sesquiterpene cyclase activity and the ability to prenylate small molecules. Bnd4 possesses a unique D94NxxxD motif and mutation experiments confirmed an absolute requirement for D94 as well as E169.

     alt="Mechanistic Insights into the Formation of the 6,10-Bicyclic Eunicellane Skeleton by the Bacterial Diterpene Synthase Bnd4"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enzymatic and mechanistic characterization of Bnd4, a bacterial diterpene synthase and the first terpene synthase known to form the 6,10-bicyclic eunicellane skeleton. Isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations support the cyclization mechanism for benditerpe-2,6,15-triene. An unusual DNxxxD motif was found to be essential for cyclization activity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eunicellane diterpenoids are a unique family of natural products seen in marine organisms, plants, and bacteria. We used a series of biochemical, bioinformatics, and theoretical experiments to investigate the mechanism of the first diterpene synthase known to form the eunicellane skeleton. Deuterium labeling studies and quantum chemical calculations support that Bnd4, from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. (CL12-4), forms the 6,10-bicyclic skeleton through a 1,10-cyclization, 1,3-hydride shift, and 1,14-cyclization cascade. Bnd4 also demonstrated sesquiterpene cyclase activity and the ability to prenylate small molecules. Bnd4 possesses a unique D&lt;sup&gt;94&lt;/sup&gt;NxxxD motif and mutation experiments confirmed an absolute requirement for D94 as well as E169.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Heteromeric Carboxylic Acid Based Single&#8208;Crystalline Crosslinked Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework was synthesized through heteromeric monomers co&#8208;crystallization followed by thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking. The crosslinked porous crystals featured large pores to host a hydrazone switch for solid&#8208;state photo&#8208;patterning.







Abstract
The development of large pore single&#8208;crystalline covalently linked organic frameworks is critical in revealing the detailed structure&#8208;property relationship with substrates. One emergent approach is to photo&#8208;crosslink hydrogen&#8208;bonded molecular crystals. Introducing complementary hydrogen&#8208;bonded carboxylic acid building blocks is promising to construct large pore networks, but these molecules often form interpenetrated networks or non&#8208;porous solids. Herein, we introduced heteromeric carboxylic acid dimers to construct a non&#8208;interpenetrated molecular crystal. Crosslinking this crystal precursor with dithiols afforded a large pore single&#8208;crystalline hydrogen&#8208;bonded crosslinked organic framework HCOF&#8208;101. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed HCOF&#8208;101 as an interlayer connected hexagonal network, which possesses flexible linkages and large porous channels to host a hydrazone photoswitch. Multicycle Z/E&#8208;isomerization of the hydrazone took place reversibly within HCOF&#8208;101, showcasing the potential use of HCOF&#8208;101 for optical information storage.

         <title>Tuneable time delay in the burst release from oxidation sensitive polymersomes made by PISA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The confinement in and the selective release from vesicular structures is an elementary part of biological transport processes and highly attractive for drug delivery systems. Reactive polymersomes represent a versatile artificial cargo carrier system, which can facilitate an immediate release in response to a specific stimulus. The herein presented oxidation&#8208;sensitive polymersomes feature a time delayed release mechanism in an oxidative environment, which can be precisely adjusted by either tuning the membrane thickness or partial pre&#8208;oxidation. These polymeric vesicles are conveniently prepared by polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) allowing the straightforward and effective  in situ  encapsulation of cargo molecules, as exemplarily shown for fluorescence dyes and functional enzymes. Detailed kinetic studies revealed a critical degree of oxidation causing the destabilization of the membrane, while no release of the cargo is observed beforehand. The encapsulation of glucose oxidase transforms these polymersomes directly into glucose&#8208;sensitive vesicles, as small molecules including sugars can passively penetrate their membrane. Considering the ease of preparation, the presented polymersomes represent a versatile platform for the confinement and a burst release of cargo molecules after a precisely adjustable time span in the presence of specific triggers, such as hydrogen peroxide or glucose.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Fixed Hydroboration of Terminal and Internal Alkenes using BX3/iPr2NEt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented and general hydroboration of alkenes with BX3(X = Br, Cl) as the boration reagent in the presence of  iPr2NEt is reported. The addition of  iPr2NEt not only suppresses alkene polymerization and haloboration side reactions but also provides an "H" source for hydroboration. More importantly, the site&#8208;fixed installation of a boryl group at the original position of the internal double&#8208;bond is readily achieved as compared with conventional transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration processes. Further application to the synthesis of 1, n&#8208;diborylalkanes (n=3&#8208;10) is also demonstrated. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal a major reaction pathway that involves radical species and operates through frustrated&#8208;Lewis&#8208;pair&#8208;type single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, the intrinsic chemical inertness of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes direct and site&#8208;selective C(sp  3  )&#8722;H bond activation difficult, especially under redox neutral condition. Here, we demonstrate that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond of THF  via  forming QDs/THF conjugates. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant alkoxyalkyl radical directly engages in radical cross&#8208;coupling with &#945;&#8208;amino radical from amino C&#8211;H bonds or radical addition with alkene or phenylacetylene, respectively. In contrast to stoichiometric oxidant or hydrogen atom transfer reagents required in previous studies, the scalable benchtop approach can execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8211;H bond functionalization of THF only by a QD photocatalyst under redox&#8208;neutral condition, thus providing a broad of value added chemicals starting from bulk THFs reagent. The high step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economy, high efficiency and broad substrate scope make the photocatalysis with QDs and visible light promising in both academic and industrial setting.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven nanomotors have attracted much attention due to their potential applications. The movement of conventional nanomotors typically occurs in the solution phase, which limits their application fields. Utilizing visible light to drive nanomotors at the solid&#8211;liquid interface represents a grand challenge due to the large friction force between the nanomotor and the solid surface. Based on the attractive plasmon resonance of Au nanocrystals, for the first time, plasmon&#8208;enhanced Au nanocrystal&#8208;based nanomotors moving at the silicon&#8211;aqueous solution interface have been developed. Such nanomotors move with a clear trace engraved on the Si surface, representing an excellent and exceptional self&#8208;traced nanomotor system. In addition, the nanomotor trace on the Si surface also provides a unique and promising approach to the fabrication of nanoscale Si patterns, which is central to many applications, including microelectronics, sensing, information storage, and optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Iodide&#8208;Induced    Fragmentation   of Polymerized Hydrophilic Carbon Nitride for High Performance Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e  &#8208;  ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H  2  O  2  production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2e  &#8208;  ORR greatly restrict the H  2  O  2  production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the  terminating polymerization (TP&#8208;PCN) effect of iodide ions  . The obtained TP&#8208;PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi&#8208;homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H  2  O  2  generation rate (3265.4 &#181;M h  &#8208;1  ), far surpassing PCN and other PCN&#8208;based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP&#8208;PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin&#8208;orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O  2  , which optimizes O  2  activation and reduces the energy barrier of H  2  O  2  formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O  2  activation in ORR for H  2  O  2  production.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) as a class of two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e  -  ORR) photocatalyst has attracted much attention for H  2  O  2  production. However, the low activity and inferior selectivity of 2e  -  ORR greatly restrict the H  2  O  2  production efficiency. Herein, we develop a new strategy to synthesize hydrophilic, fragmented PCN photocatalyst by the  terminating polymerization (TP-PCN) effect of iodide ions  . The obtained TP-PCN with abundant edge active sites (AEASs), which can form quasi-homogeneous photocatalytic system, exhibits superior H  2  O  2  generation rate (3265.4 &#181;M h  -1  ), far surpassing PCN and other PCN-based photocatalysts. DFT calculations further indicate that TP-PCN is more favorable for electron transiting from &#946; spin-orbital to the &#960;* orbitals of O  2  , which optimizes O  2  activation and reduces the energy barrier of H  2  O  2  formation. This work provides a new concept for designing functional photocatalysts and understanding the mechanism of O  2  activation in ORR for H  2  O  2  production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning and Directing Energy Transfer in the Whole Visible Spectrum through Linker Installation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While limited choice of emissive organic linkers with systematic emission tunability presents a great challenge to investigate energy transfer (ET) over the whole visible light range with designable directions, luminescent metal&#8208;organic frameworks (LMOFs) may serve as an ideal platform for such study due to their readily tunable structure and composition. Herein, five Zr  6  cluster&#8208;based LMOFs, HIAM&#8208;400X (X = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are prepared using 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acids as organic linkers. Their emission energies range from ~470 to 645 nm. The accessible unsaturated metal sites confer HIAM&#8208;400X as a pristine scaffold for postsynthetic modification via linker installation. Six 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole and its derivative&#8208;based dicarboxylic acids (L) with their emission energies covering the entire visible spectrum were successfully installed into HIAM&#8208;400X matrix to form thirty HIAM&#8208;400X&#8208;L LMOFs, in which the energy transfer can be facilely tuned by controlling its direction, either from the inserted linkers to pristine MOFs or from the pristine MOFs to inserted linkers, and over the whole range of visible light. The combination of the pristine MOFs and the second linkers via linker installation creates a powerful two&#8208;dimensional space in tuning the emission via energy transfer in LMOFs. This work sheds light on a new strategy in designing target&#8208;specific materials for light&#8208;harvesting, energy transfer and related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Neutralization Assay using Single Molecule Arrays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID&#8208;19) manifests with high clinical variability and warrants sensitive and specific assays to analyze immune responses in infected and vaccinated individuals. Using Single Molecule Arrays (Simoa), we developed an assay to assess antibody neutralization with high sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities based on antibody&#8208;mediated blockage of the ACE2&#8208;spike interaction. The assay does not require live viruses or cells and can be performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory within two hours. We used this assay to assess neutralization and antibody levels in patients who died of COVID&#8208;19 and patients hospitalized for a short period of time, and show&#160;that neutralization and antibody levels increase over time. We also adapted the assay for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 variants and measured neutralization capacity in pre&#8208;pandemic healthy, COVID&#8208;19 infected, and vaccinated individuals. This assay is highly adaptable for clinical applications, such as vaccine development and epidemiological studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic, Intermolecular C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution of heme proteins has opened access to new&#8208;to&#8208;nature enzymatic activity that can be harnessed to tackle synthetic challenges. Among these, reactions resulting from active site iron&#8208;nitrenoid intermediates present a powerful strategy to forge C&#8211;N bonds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Here we report a biocatalytic, intermolecular benzylic C&#8211;H amidation reaction operating at mild and scalable conditions. With hydroxamate esters as nitrene precursors, feedstock aromatic compounds can be converted to chiral amides with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee) and high yields (up to 87%). Kinetic and computational analysis of the enzymatic reaction reveals rate&#8208;determining nitrenoid formation followed by stepwise hydrogen atom transfer&#8208;mediated C&#8211;H functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Sub&#8208;nanometer Thick Wafer&#8208;size NiO Films with Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adding ferromagnetism into semiconductors attracts much attentions due to its potential usage of magnetic spins in novel devices, such as spin field&#8208;effect transistors. However, it remains challenging to stabilize their ferromagnetism above room temperature. Here we introduce an atomic chemical&#8208;solution strategy to grow wafer&#8208;size NiO thin films with controllable thickness down to sub&#8208;nanometer scale of 0.92 nm for the first time. Surface lattice defects break the magnetic symmetry of NiO and produce surface ferromagnetic behaviors. Our sub&#8208;nanometric NiO thin film exhibits the highest reported room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic behavior with a saturation magnetization of 157 emu/cc and coercivity of 418 Oe. Attributed to wafer size, the easily&#8208;transferred ferromagnetic NiO thin film is further verified in a magnetoresistance device. Our work provides a sub&#8208;nanometric platform to produce wafer&#8208;size ferromagnetic NiO thin films as atomic layer magnetic units in future transparent magnetoelectric devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;frequency responsive electrochemical capacitor (EC), as an ideal lightweight filtering capacitor, can directly convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC)  . However, current electrodes are stuck in limited electrode area and tortuous ion transport. Herein, strictly vertical graphene arrays (SVGAs) prepared by electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition have been successfully designed as the main electrode to ensure ions rapidly adsorb/desorb in richly available graphene surface. SVGAs exhibit an outstanding specific areal capacitance of 1.72 mF&#8231;cm  &#8722;2  at &#934;  120  = 80.6&#176; even after 500,000 cycles, which is far better than that of most carbon&#8208;related materials. Impressively, the output voltage could also be improved to 2.5 V when using organic electrolyte. An ultra&#8208;high energy density of 0.33 &#956;Wh&#8231;cm  &#8722;2  can also be handily achieved. Moreover, ECs&#8208;SVGAs can well smooth arbitrary AC waveforms into DC signals, exhibiting excellent filtering performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cochlearol B via Intramolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the first total synthesis of cochlearol B, a meroterpenoid natural product featuring a 4/5/6/6/6&#8208;fused pentacyclic structure. Key steps, oxidative cyclization and subsequent intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, which constructed the pentacyclic structure in highly stereoselective manner, allowed efficient access to cochlearol B with the longest linear sequence of 16 steps, and in 9% overall yield. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis clearly confirmed the stereochemistry of cochlearol B.</dc:description>

Key steps, oxidative cyclization and subsequent intramolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition, which constructed the pentacyclic structure in highly stereoselective manner, allowed efficient access to cochlearol B with the longest linear sequence of 16 steps, and in 9% overall yield. Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis clearly confirmed the stereochemistry of cochlearol B.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalytic Carbochlorocarbonylation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons via C&#8722;COCl Bond Cleavage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a catalytic system comprised of Pd and Xantphos, acid chlorides can be added across strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to form two new C&#8722;C bonds via formal C&#8722;COCl cleavage. This reaction allows for a dicarbofunctionalisation in which an acid chloride group is retained in the product. DFT studies are used to rationalise a plausible pathway, while product derivatisation highlights the synthetic utility of the method.







Abstract
Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8722;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8722;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or a tethered alkyne to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride in situ. The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.

         <title>Rational Design of Sustainable Liquid Microcapsules for Spontaneous Fragrance Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a PEG&#8208;g&#8208;PVAc amphiphilic graft copolymer together with hydrophobic fragrances in aqueous medium leads to the spontaneous formation of colloidally stable suspensions of liquid coacervate droplets. Arrows indicate the local turbulences sustaining the spontaneous mixing of the components. The bottom panel shows the confocal Raman microspectroscopy mapping of a multicompartment coacervate droplet with carvone as fragrance.







Abstract
The high volatility, water&#8208;immiscibility, and light/oxygen&#8208;sensitivity of most aroma compounds represent a challenge to their incorporation in liquid consumer products. Current encapsulation methods entail the use of petroleum&#8208;based materials, initiators, and crosslinkers as well as mixing, heating, and purification steps. Hence, more efficient and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to encapsulation must be sought. Herein, we propose a simple method by making use of a pre&#8208;formed amphiphilic polymer and employing the Hansen Solubility Parameters approach to determine which fragrances could be encapsulated by spontaneous coacervation in water. The coacervates do not precipitate as solids but they remain suspended as colloidally stable liquid microcapsules, as demonstrated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effective encapsulation of fragrance is proven through confocal Raman spectroscopy, while the structure of the capsules is investigated by means of cryo FIB/SEM, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering.

         <title>Synthesis of Mixed&#8208;Valent Lanthanide Sulfide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4; and EuS, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4 were prepared. The phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.







Abstract
In targeting reduced valent lanthanide chalcogenides, we report the first nanoparticle synthesis of the mixed&#8208;valent ferromagnets Eu3S4 and EuSm2S4. Using divalent lanthanide halides with bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide and oleylamine, we prepared nanoparticles of EuS, Eu3S4, EuSm2S4, SmS1.9, and Sm3S4. All nanoparticle phases were identified using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy was used to confirm morphology and nanoparticle size, and magnetic susceptibility measurements for determining the ordering temperatures and valence. The UV/Vis, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies for each phase were compared. Surprisingly, the phase is influenced by the halide and the reaction temperature, where EuCl2 formed EuS while EuI2 formed Eu3S4, highlighting the role of kinetics in phase stabilization. Interestingly, at lower temperatures EuI2 initially forms EuS, and converts over time to Eu3S4.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O into CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets were integrated into a hierarchically porous defective MOF UiO&#8208;66. The unsaturated Mo atoms in MoS2 sheets rationally regulate contact interfaces with Zr6O4(OH)4 nodes to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites. The Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites at the interfaces allows photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O into CH3COOH and O2.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2 reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a challenge. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2 nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2. The active interfaces are favorable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2 composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2 and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH3COOH reached 39.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and 94&#8201;%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2 for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo aided the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.

         <title>Discovery and Characterisation of Highly Cooperative FAK&#8208;Degrading PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PROTAC with an unusually short linker potently degrades focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SPR and X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a highly cooperative FAK&#8208;PROTAC&#8208;VCB ternary complex, and FAK degradation showed enhanced effects on 3D cell growth compared to FAK inhibitors. In mice, GSK215 induced rapid and sustained degradation of FAK with a profound PK/PD disconnect.







Abstract
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK&#8208;GSK215&#8208;VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in&#8208;vitro pharmacology compared to VS&#8208;4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long&#8208;lasting effect on FAK levels (&#8776;96&#8197;h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK&#8208;degradation biology in&#8197;vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cross&#8208;coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with alkylamine and aldehyde feedstocks has been achieved. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained with generally good yields and optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible with excellent stereocontrol. This method provides a novel disconnection strategy for the synthesis of a diverse range of &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes that utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.

         <title>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem for synergistic chemical and gene regulations on cancer cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Incorporating multiple molecular interactions within a system to realize the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells is prospected to be of great potential in cancer therapy. Herein, we report a supramolecular self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosystem, which reprogrammed the cellular antioxidant system via synergistic chemical and gene regulations. In the nanosystem, amphipathic telluroether was coordinated with Mn(II) to self&#8208;assemble into micelle, on which a siNrf2 integrated DNA network was assembled. The great electron&#8208;donating capability of telluroether was revealed to greatly promote Mn(II)&#8208;based Fenton&#8208;like reaction to generate subversive &#183;OH in cancer cells. In response to adenosine triphosphoric acid, the siNrf2 was specially released in cytoplasm for down&#8208;regulating expression of detoxification enzymes, which enhanced chemocatalysis&#8208;mediated oxidative stress in cancer cells, thus significantly suppressing tumor progression.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic C3&#8208;Indole Methylation&#8212;A Useful Tool for the Natural&#8208;Product&#8208;Inspired Stereoselective Synthesis of Pyrroloindoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the promiscuous C3&#8208;indole methyl transferase PsmD enabled the enantioselective synthesis of various pyrroloindolines. By additionally applying the halo methyl transferase CtHMT not only the expensive SAM cofactor could be recycled, but also the enzymatic preparative scale transformation was achieved.







Abstract
Enantioselective synthesis of bioactive compounds bearing a pyrroloindole framework is often laborious. In contrast, there are several S&#8208;adenosyl methionine (SAM)&#8208;dependent methyl transferases known for stereo&#8208; and regioselective methylation at the C3 position of various indoles, directly leading to the formation of the desired pyrroloindole moiety. Herein, the SAM&#8208;dependent methyl transferase PsmD from Streptomyces griseofuscus, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of physostigmine, is characterized in detail. The biochemical properties of PsmD and its substrate scope were demonstrated. Preparative scale enzymatic methylation including SAM regeneration was achieved for three selected substrates after a design&#8208;of&#8208;experiment optimization.

         <title>Sustainable Pd(OAc)2/Hydroquinone Cocatalyst System for Cis&#8208;Selective Dibenzoyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;Cyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient and scalable cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocol that employs catalytic hydroquinone with tBuOOH as a benign terminal oxidant. A bromide additive was crucial to obtaining good yields and excellent cis selectivity. The study culminates in the implementation of the optimized reaction on large scale.







Abstract
The 1,4&#8208;diacyloxylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexadiene (CHD) affords valuable stereochemically defined scaffolds for natural product and pharmaceutical synthesis. Existing cis&#8208;selective diacyloxylation protocols require superstoichiometric quantities of benzoquinone (BQ) or MnO2, which limit process sustainability and large&#8208;scale application. In this report, reaction development and mechanistic studies are described that overcome these limitations by pairing catalytic BQ with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide as the stoichiometric oxidant. Catalytic quantities of bromide enable a switch from trans to cis diastereoselectivity. A catalyst with a 1:2 Pd:Br ratio supports high cis selectivity while retaining good rate and product yield. Further studies enable replacement of BQ with hydroquinone (HQ) as a source of cocatalyst, avoiding the handling of volatile and toxic BQ in large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>A Copper(I) Complex with Two Unpaired Electrons, Synthesised by Oxidation of a Copper(II) Complex with Two Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation&#8208;induced reduction: The oxidation of mononuclear CuII complexes with novel unsymmetric redox&#8208;active urea azine or thio&#8208;urea azine ligands leads to metal reduction and formation of complexes with intriguing electronic structures. The stability in several redox states is the basis for their first application in catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation.







Abstract
Two homoleptic copper(II) complexes [Cu(L1)2] and [Cu(L2)2] with anionic redox&#8208;active ligands were synthesised, one with urea azine (L1) and the other with thio&#8208;urea azine (L2) ligands. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox&#8208;induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)2]+ and [Cu(L2)2]+ with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)2]+ is best described as a CuI complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)2]+ is a CuI complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)2]2+, best described as a CuI complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile ligand&#8208;metal electron transfer make these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.

&lt;p&gt;Oxidation-induced reduction: The oxidation of mononuclear Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with novel unsymmetric redox-active urea azine or thio-urea azine ligands leads to metal reduction and formation of complexes with intriguing electronic structures. The stability in several redox states is the basis for their first application in catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidation.

         <title>Highly Selective Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to Ethylene over Atomically Isolated Nickel&#8208;Nitrogen Site/Copper Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective CO  2  electroreduction reaction (CO  2  RR) into desired value&#8208;added multicarbon products such as C  2  H  4  is of great importance but largely limited by the multi&#8208;electron transfer process and sluggish C&#8208;C coupling step at one single active site. Herein, an effective tandem catalysis strategy is developed to improve the selectivity of the CO  2  RR towards C  2  H  4  by multiple distinct catalytic sites in local vicinity. An earth&#8208;abundant elements&#8211;based tandem electrocatalyst PTF(Ni)/Cu is constructed by uniformly dispersing Cu nanoparticles (NPs) on the porphyrinic triazine framework anchored with atomically isolated nickel&#8208;nitrogen sites (PTF(Ni)) for the enhanced CO  2  RR to produce C  2  H  4  . The Faradaic efficiency of C  2  H  4  reaches 57.3% at &#8208;1.1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is about 6 times higher than the non&#8208;tandem catalyst PTF/Cu, which produces CH  4  as the major carbon product. The operando infrared spectroscopy and theoretic density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the local high concentration of CO generated by PTF(Ni) sites can facilitate the C&#8208;C coupling to form C  2  H  4  on the nearby Cu NP sites. The work offers an effective avenue to design electrocatalysts for the highly selective CO  2  RR to produce multicarbon products via a tandem route.</dc:description>

         <title>Li2MTeO6 (M=Ti, Sn): Mid&#8208;Infrared Nonlinear Optical Crystal with Strong Second Harmonic Generation Response and Wide Transparency Range</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New tellurate LTT and LST crystals were obtained by a TSSG method with a broad transparent region of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m for MIR NLO applications. Both LTT and LST belong to the space group Pnn2, with an almost identical structure. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder SHG response. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder SHG based on the crystal structures.







Abstract
Oxide crystals have been widely used in nonlinear optics (NLO) in the ultraviolet&#8211;visible and near&#8208;infrared regions. Most traditional oxide crystals are restricted to the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their narrow transmission window. Hence, attempting to extend infrared cutoff wavelength of oxides has attracted much attention. Herein, we report two new tellurates Li2TiTeO6 (LTT) and Li2SnTeO6 (LST) with broad transparent regions of 0.38&#8211;6.72 and 0.38&#8211;6.86&#8197;&#956;m, respectively, as excellent candidates for mid&#8208;infrared NLO applications. Both LTT and LST crystallize in the orthorhombic space group Pnn2. The LTT crystal exhibits intense powder second&#8208;order generation efficiency (26&#215;KDP) under the fundamental wavelength of 1064&#8197;nm. First&#8208;principles calculations and dipole moments were used to illustrate the results of the powder second&#8208;harmonic generations based on the crystal structures. Our results provide a novel oxide NLO crystal with a strong SHG and wide transparency range. They also pave a way for the design of new oxide mid&#8208;IR NLO crystals.

         <title>PtSe2/Pt Heterointerface with Reduced Coordination for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small Pt particles are generated in situ on the surface of PtSe2 nanosheet with Se vacancies for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
PtSe2 is a typical noble metal dichalcogenide (NMD) that holds promising possibility for next&#8208;generation electronics and photonics. However, when applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), it exhibits sluggish kinetics due to the insufficient capability of absorbing active species. Here, we construct PtSe2/Pt heterointerface to boost the reaction dynamics of PtSe2, enabled by an in situ electrochemical method. It is found that Se vacancies are induced around the heterointerface, reducing the coordination environment. Correspondingly, the exposed Pt atoms at the very vicinity of Se vacancies are activated, with enhanced overlap with H 1s orbital. The adsorption of H. intermediate is thus strengthened, achieving near thermoneutral free energy change. Consequently, the as&#8208;prepared PtSe2/Pt exhibits extraordinary HER activity even superior to Pt/C, with an overpotential of 42&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 53&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. This work raises attention on NMDs toward HER and provides insights for the rational construction of novel heterointerfaces.

         <title>Designing Anion&#8208;Type Water&#8208;Free Zn2+ Solvation Structure for Robust Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free Zn2+ solvation structure electrolyte for developing a Zn metal anode. The chloride salt with bulky cations unlocks the Zn2+&#8208;water interactions, and a new solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722; is formed without bound water. Owing to the limited hydrogen evolution reaction and the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and anion, the electrolyte shows an average Zn plating/stripping CE of &#8776;99.9&#8201;% and uniform Zn deposition.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn batteries are potential for large&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage due to their low cost and high security. However, Zn metal anode suffers from the dendritic growth and interfacial hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), resulting in the deterioration of electrode/battery performance. Here we propose that both dendrites and HER are related to the water participated Zn2+ solvation structure&#8208;Zn(H2O)62+ and thus can be resolved by transforming Zn(H2O)62+ to an anion&#8208;type water&#8208;free solvation structure&#8208;ZnCl42&#8722;, which is achieved in traditional ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte after adding chloride salt with a bulky cation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride). The elimination of cation&#8208;water interaction suppresses HER, while the electrostatic repulsion between Zn tips and the anion solvation structure inhibits dendrite formation. As a result, the electrolyte shows uniform Zn deposition with an average Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.9&#8201;%, enabling a capacity retention of 78.8&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles in anode&#8208;free Zn batteries with pre&#8208;zincificated polyaniline as the cathode. This work provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to prevent HER and realize long&#8208;lifespan metal anode.

As a result, the electrolyte shows uniform Zn deposition with an average Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.9&#8201;%, enabling a capacity retention of 78.8&#8201;% after 300&#8197;cycles in anode-free Zn batteries with pre-zincificated polyaniline as the cathode. This work provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to prevent HER and realize long-lifespan metal anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Detection of Cu+ Ions in Live Cells via Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a new fluorescent probe that upon binding to copper(I) (but not any other physiologically relevant metal ions), displays an intensity switch&#8208;on as well as a significant change in its fluorescence lifetime. The later has allowed us to visualize copper(I) in live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy.







Abstract
Copper is an essential trace element in living organisms with its levels and localisation being carefully managed by the cellular machinery. However, if misregulated, deficiency or excess of copper ions can lead to several diseases. Therefore, it is important to have reliable methods to detect, monitor and visualise this metal in cells. Herein we report a new optical probe based on BODIPY, which shows a switch&#8208;on in its fluorescence intensity upon binding to copper(I), but not in the presence of high concentration of other physiologically relevant metal ions. More interestingly, binding to copper(I) leads to significant changes in the fluorescence lifetime of the new probe, which can be used to visualize copper(I) pools in lysosomes of live cells via fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Topochemical Ene&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed monomer having reactive groups, azide and alkene, adopts suitable crystal packing for a novel topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction (TEAC). Spontaneously, the monomer undergoes polymerization to yield triazoline&#8208;linked polymer in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion. The triazoline&#8208;linked polymer is transformed into a value&#8208;added aziridine&#8208;linked polymer by simple heating.







Abstract
Topochemical reactions, high&#8208;yielding solid&#8208;state reactions arising from the proximal alignment of reacting partners in the crystal lattice, do not require solvents, catalysts, and additives, are of high demand in the context of green processes and environmental safety. However, the bottleneck is the limited number of reactions that can be done in the crystal medium. We present the topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition (TEAC) reaction, wherein alkene and azide groups undergo lattice&#8208;controlled cycloaddition reaction giving triazoline in crystals. A designed monomer that arranges in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner in its crystals pre&#8208;organizing the reacting groups of adjacent molecules in proximity undergoes spontaneous cycloaddition reaction in a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion, yielding the triazoline&#8208;linked polymer. A unique advantage of this reaction is that the triazoline can be converted to aziridine by simple heating, which we exploited for the otherwise challenging post&#8208;synthetic backbone modification of the polymer. This reaction may revolutionize the field of polymer science.

         <title>Asymmetric Cation&#8208;Olefin Monocyclization by Engineered Squalene&#8211;Hopene Cyclases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic capability of squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases to convert (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;substrates enantiospecifically to (S)&#8208; or (R)&#8208;configurated monocyclic terpenoids was put into action by a combination of enzyme evolution and substrate engineering for the synthesis of (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone with &gt;99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Squalene&#8211;hopene cyclases (SHCs) have great potential for the industrial synthesis of enantiopure cyclic terpenoids. A limitation of SHC catalysis has been the enzymes&#8217; strict (S)&#8208;enantioselectivity at the stereocenter formed after the first cyclization step. To gain enantio&#8208;complementary access to valuable monocyclic terpenoids, an SHC&#8208;wild&#8208;type library including 18 novel homologs was set up. A previously not described SHC (AciSHC) was found to synthesize small amounts of monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone from (E/Z)&#8208;geranylacetone. Using enzyme and process optimization, the conversion to the desired product was increased to 79&#8201;%. Notably, analyzed AciSHC variants could finely differentiate between the geometric geranylacetone isomers: While the (Z)&#8208;isomer yielded the desired monocyclic (R)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99&#8201;% ee), the (E)&#8208;isomer was converted to the (S,S)&#8208;bicyclic ether (&gt;95&#8201;% ee). Applying the knowledge gained from the observed stereodivergent and enantioselective transformations to an additional SHC&#8208;substrate pair, access to the complementary (S)&#8208;&#947;&#8208;dihydroionone (&gt;99.9&#8201;% ee) could be obtained.

Abstract
In this communication, we report muon spin rotation/resonance (&#956;SR) studies for understanding radical reactivity of 10&#8208;mesityl&#8208;1,8&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;9&#8208;phosphaanthracene. Transverse&#8208;field muon spin rotation (TF&#8208;&#956;SR) and muon avoided level&#8208;crossing resonance (&#956;LCR) measurements successfully visualized a paramagnetic species produced by regioselective addition of muonium (Mu) to the skeletal phosphorus atom. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the P&#8208;muoniation product suggested two possible isomers. Whereas the most stable isomer including the envelope&#8208;type phosphorus heterocycle shows considerably different hyperfine coupling constants (hfcs) from those of the TF&#8208;&#956;SR and &#956;LCR, the metastable structure accompanying the almost planar tricyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton could simulate the experimentally determined hfcs. The metastable planar &#960;&#8208;conjugated paramagnetic tricyclic&#8208;fused skeleton is promoted by the larger zero&#8208;point energy due to the light muon (&#956;+), one ninth of the proton mass.

         <title>Chemoselective and Highly Sensitive Quantification of Gut Microbiome and Human Metabolites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective probes based on stable isotope labeling allow for highly sensitive mass spectrometric quantification and detection of metabolites at attomole quantities in three human sample types.







Abstract
The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host's physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl&#8208;containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging. Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi&#8208;quantitative analysis at the femtomole level as well as qualitative analysis at attomole quantities that allows for detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples.

     alt="Chemoselective and Highly Sensitive Quantification of Gut Microbiome and Human Metabolites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemoselective probes based on stable isotope labeling allow for highly sensitive mass spectrometric quantification and detection of metabolites at attomole quantities in three human sample types.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbiome has a fundamental impact on the human host's physiology through the production of highly reactive compounds that can lead to disease development. One class of such compounds are carbonyl-containing metabolites, which are involved in diverse biochemical processes. Mass spectrometry is the method of choice for analysis of metabolites but carbonyls are analytically challenging. Herein, we have developed a new chemical biology tool using chemoselective modification to overcome analytical limitations. Two isotopic probes allow for the simultaneous and semi-quantitative analysis at the femtomole level as well as qualitative analysis at attomole quantities that allows for detection of more than 200 metabolites in human fecal, urine and plasma samples. This comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis enhances the scope of metabolomics-driven biomarker discovery. We anticipate that our chemical biology tool will be of general use in metabolomics analysis to obtain a better understanding of microbial interactions with the human host and disease development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Para&#8208;hydrogen hyperpolarization allows direct NMR detection of &#945;&#8208;amino acids in complex (bio)mixtures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The scope of non&#8208;hydrogenative para&#8208;hydrogen hyperpolarization (PHIP) techniques has been expanding over the last years, with the continuous addition of important classes of substrates. For example, pyruvate can now be hyperpolarized using the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) technique, offering a fast, efficient and low&#8208;cost PHIP alternative to Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for metabolic imaging studies. Still, important biomolecules such as amino acids have so far resisted PHIP, unless properly functionalized. Here, we report on an approach to non&#8208;hydrogenative PHIP for unmodified &#945;&#8208;amino acids that allows their detection and quantification in complex mixtures at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method was tested on human urine, in which natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids could be measured after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both  m  &#8208;BA and  p  &#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while  o  &#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling gene expression in mammalian cells using multiplexed conditional guide RNAs for Cas12a</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spatiotemporal control of the activity of CRISPR&#8208;associated (Cas) proteins is of considerable interest for basic research and therapeutics. Here, we show that conditional guide RNAs (gRNAs) for Cas12a can be transcribed in mammalian cells by RNA polymerase II, followed by activation via input&#8208;dependent processing of the 3&#8217; tail of the gRNA transcript. We demonstrate processing using an RNA strand

displacement mechanism, as well as microRNA&#8208;dependent processing, and cleavage by a guanine&#8208;responsive ribozyme. We further demonstrate that Cas12a along with several independently switchable gRNAs can be compactly integrated on a single transcript using stabilizing RNA triplexes, providing a route towards Cas12a&#8208;based gene regulation constructs with multi&#8208;input switching capabilities. The

principle is shown to work in HEK and mouse fibroblast cells using luminescence, fluorescence, and is also demonstrated for the conditional upregulation of an endogenous gene.</dc:description>

         <title>Consecutive and Selective Double Methylene Insertion of Lithium Carbenoids to Isothiocyanates: A Direct Assembly of Four&#8208;membered Sulfur&#8208;Containing Cycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A formal CH  2  &#8208;CH  2  homologation conducted with C1 carbenoids on a carbon electrophile for the obtainment of a four&#8208;membered cycle is reported. The logic proposes the consecutive delivery of two single nucleophilic CH  2  units to an isothiocyanate &#8211; as competent electrophilic partner &#8211; resulting in the assembling of a rare imino&#8208;thietane cluster. The single synthetic operation procedure documents genuine chemocontrol, as indicated by the tolerance to various reactive elements decorating the starting materials. Significantly, the double homologation protocol is accomplished directly on a carbon electrophile, thus not requiring the installation of heteroatom&#8208;centered manifolds (  e.g.  boron).</dc:description>

         <title>A Systematic Study of the Effects of Complex Structure on Aryl Iodide Oxidative Addition at Bipyridyl&#8208;Ligated Gold(I) Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined theoretical and experimental approach has been used to study the unusual mechanism of oxidative addition of aryl iodides to [bipyAu(C  2  H  4  )]  +  complexes. The modular nature of this system has allowed a systematic assessment of the effects of complex structure. Computational comparisons between cationic gold and the isolobal (neutral) Pd(0) and Pt(0) complexes revealed similar mechanistic features, but with oxidative addition being significantly favored for the group 10 metals. Further differences between Au and Pd were seen in experimental studies: studying reaction rates as a function of electronic and steric properties showed that ligands bearing more electron&#8208;poor functionality increase the rate of oxidative addition; in a complementary way, electron&#8208;rich aryl iodides give faster rates. This divergence in mechanism compared to Pd suggests that Ar&#8208;X oxidative addition with Au can underpin a broad range of new or complementary transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Triggered reversible disassembly of an engineered protein nanocage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein nanocages play crucial roles in sub&#8208;cellular compartmentalization and spatial control in all domains of life and have been used as biomolecular tools for applications in biocatalysis, drug delivery, and bionanotechnology. The ability to control their assembly state under physiological conditions would further expand their practical utility. To gain such control, we introduced a peptide capable of triggering conformational change at a key structural position in the largest known encapsulin nanocompartment. We report the structure of the resulting engineered nanocage and demonstrate its ability to disassemble and reassemble on demand under physiological conditions. We demonstrate its capacity for in vivo encapsulation of proteins of choice while also demonstrating in vitro cargo loading capabilities. Our results represent a functionally robust addition to the nanocage toolbox and a novel approach for controlling protein nanocage disassembly and reassembly under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereodivergent Synthesis of Spirocycles through Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Vinyloxiranes with Nucleophilic Dipoles</title>

         <dc:description>The development of efficient and straightforward methods for obtaining all optically active isomers of structurally rigid spirocycles from readily available starting materials is of great value in drug discovery and chiral ligand development. However, the stereodivergent synthesis of spirocycles bearing multiple stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge owing to steric hindrance and ring strain. Herein, we report an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis of rigid spirocycles through dual&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed [3+2] annulation of oxy &#960;&#8208;allyl metallic dipoles with less commonly employed nucleophilic dipoles (imino esters). A series of spiro compounds bearing a pyrroline and an olefin were easily synthesized in an enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent manner (up to 19:1 dr, &gt;99% ee), which showed great promise as a new type of N&#8208;olefin ligand. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic studies including kinetic isotope effects (KIE), competitive experiment, and visual kinetic analysis were also carried out to understand the process of this bimetallic catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A General Principle for DUV NLO Materials: &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Confinement Enlarges Band Gap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current nonlinear optical materials face a conventional limitation in the trade&#8208;off between the band gap and birefringence, especially in the deep UV spectral region. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose a general principle, &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement, to partially decouple the interunit &#960;&#8208;conjugated interactions by the separation of non&#8208;&#960;&#8208;conjugated units. The goal is to further enlarge the band gap to a value larger than that of the singular &#960;&#8208;conjugated counterpart and to maintain a suitable density of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units to gain a large optical anisotropy. We reveal that &#960;&#8208;conjugated confinement is a shared structural feature for all DUV NLO materials known to date, and thus, it provides a novel and essential design criterion for future design synthesis. Guided by this principle, the carbonophosphates are predicted to be a new promising DUV candidate system. Sr3Y[PO4][CO3]3 (1) and Na3X[PO4][CO3] (X = Ba, Sr, Ca, Mg, 2&#8211;5) exhibit not only greatly enhanced birefringence that is 3&#8211;24 times larger than that of singular phosphates but also enhanced band gaps that are 0.2&#8211;1.7 eV wider than those of singular carbonates.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense Packing of Acetylene in a Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of porous materials have been realized for the challenging C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation with high selectivities; however, most of them suffer from high regeneration energy, poor stability or high cost that largely dampens their industrial implementation. A desired adsorbent should have an optimal balance between excellent separation performance, high stability, and low cost, but such a material is elusive. We herein report a stable, low&#8208;cost and easily scaled&#8208;up aluminum metal&#8211;organic framework (CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H) for highly efficient C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation. The suitable pore confinement in CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H can not only provide multipoint binding interactions with C  2  H  2  but also enable the dense packing of C  2  H  2  molecules inside the pores. This material thus exhibits one of the highest C  2  H  2  storage density of 392 g L  &#8208;1  reported so far and highly selective adsorption of C  2  H  2  over CO  2  at ambient conditions, achieved through a relatively low C  2  H  2  adsorption enthalpy (27 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ). Breakthrough experiments confirm its excellent separation performance for C  2  H  2  /CO  2  mixtures, affording both large C  2  H  2  uptake of 3.3 mmol g  &#8208;1  and high separation factor of 3.4 that both surpass most benchmark materials. In combination with ultrahigh stability, low cost and easy scalability, CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H represents an exceptional material that shows the benchmark balance between separation performance, stability and cost for C  2  H  2  /CO  2  separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Protein Dynamics to Sense Rapid Endoplasmic&#8208;Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), R&#8208;CatchER and G&#8208;CatchER2, with ultrafast kinetics and large fluorescence dynamic ranges are introduced. R&#8208;CatchER was applied to sense multi&#8208;scale calcium dynamics in endoplasmic reticulum. A design principle of GECIs is proposed that features a tuning of rapid dynamics and electrostatic potentials of fluorescent proteins.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;scale calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, exhibiting wide&#8208;ranging temporal kinetics, constitutes a ubiquitous mode of signal transduction. We report a novel endoplasmic&#8208;reticulum&#8201;(ER)&#8208;targeted Ca2+ indicator, R&#8208;CatchER, which showed superior kinetics in&#8197;vitro (koff&#8805;2&#215;103&#8197;s&#8722;1, kon&#8805;7&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) and in multiple cell types. R&#8208;CatchER captured spatiotemporal ER Ca2+ dynamics in neurons and hotspots at dendritic branchpoints, enabled the first report of ER Ca2+ oscillations mediated by calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs), and revealed ER Ca2+&#8208;based functional cooperativity of CaSR. We elucidate the mechanism of R&#8208;CatchER and propose a principle to rationally design genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators with a single Ca2+&#8208;binding site and fast kinetics by tuning rapid fluorescent&#8208;protein dynamics and the electrostatic potential around the chromophore. The design principle is supported by the development of G&#8208;CatchER2, an upgrade of our previous (G&#8208;)CatchER with improved dynamic range. Our work may facilitate protein design, visualizing Ca2+ dynamics, and drug discovery.

         <title>Ball&#8208;Milling&#8208;Enabled Reactivity of Manganese Metal**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese&#8208;mediated reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates by ball milling is reported. The process has been optimised and its mechanism explored by CV measurements, radical trapping, and EPR spectroscopy. Control experiments identify the action of ball milling rather than mortar and pestle is necessary to realise the effective activation of manganese, which can then be used in either solution or a ball mill for subsequent reactions.







Abstract
Efforts to generate organomanganese reagents under ball&#8208;milling conditions have led to the serendipitous discovery that manganese metal can mediate the reductive dimerization of arylidene malonates. The newly uncovered process has been optimized and its mechanism explored using CV measurements, radical trapping experiments, EPR spectroscopy, and solution control reactions. This unique reactivity can also be translated to solution whereupon pre&#8208;milling of the manganese is required.

         <title>A Titanium Nitride Nanozyme for pH&#8208;Responsive and Irradiation&#8208;Enhanced Cascade&#8208;Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doping significantly improves the peroxidase (POD) activity of titanium&#8208;based nanozymes. Titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) showed enhanced POD activity under NIR laser irradiation due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and temperature effects. Combined with glucose oxidase in liposomes, a TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;based nanoplatform (TLGp) showed an excellent antitumor activity under NIR&#8208;mediated mild thermal conditions through its cascade&#8208;catalytic activity.







Abstract
Nanozyme&#8208;based catalytic tumor therapy is an emerging therapeutic method with high reactivity in response to tumor microenvironments (TMEs). To overcome the current limitations of deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes, we studied the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on non&#8208;metallic&#8208;atom doping and irradiation. Nitrogen doping significantly enhanced the peroxidase activity of Ti&#8208;based nanozymes, which was shown experimentally and theoretically. Based on the excellent NIR&#8208;adsorption&#8208;induced surface plasmon resonance and photothermal effect, the enzymatic activity of TiN nanoparticles (NPs) was further improved under NIR laser irradiation. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and irradiation&#8208;mediated cascade nanocatalyst (TLGp) is presented by using TiN&#8208;NP&#8208;encapsulated liposomes linked with pH&#8208;responsive PEG&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive GOx&#8208;mediated H2O2 self&#8208;supply, nitrogen&#8208;doping, and irradiation&#8208;enhanced enzymatic activity of TiN NPs and mild&#8208;photothermal therapy enables an effective tumor inhibition by TLGp with minimal side effects in&#8197;vivo.

&lt;p&gt;N-doping significantly improves the peroxidase (POD) activity of titanium-based nanozymes. Titanium nitride nanoparticles (TiN NPs) showed enhanced POD activity under NIR laser irradiation due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and temperature effects. Combined with glucose oxidase in liposomes, a TiN-NP-based nanoplatform (TLGp) showed an excellent antitumor activity under NIR-mediated mild thermal conditions through its cascade-catalytic activity.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Wide&#8208;Range Color Tuning of Narrowband Emission in Multi&#8208;resonance Organoboron Delayed Fluorescence Materials through Rational Imine/Amine Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and versatile design strategy enabled wide&#8208;range color tuning of narrowband emissions in organoboron luminogenic molecules. The introduction of imine and amine moieties into a boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton (see structures) caused hypsochromic and bathochromic emission band shifts, respectively, thereby leading to deep&#8208;blue to yellow narrowband thermally activated delayed fluorescence with excellent color purity.







Abstract
Establishing a simple and versatile design strategy to finely modulate emission colors while retaining high luminescence efficiency and color purity remains an appealing yet challenging task for the development of multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials. Herein, we demonstrate that the strategic introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing imine and electron&#8208;donating amine moieties into a versatile boron&#8208;embedded 1,3&#8208;bis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)benzene skeleton enables systematic hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts of narrowband emissions, respectively. By this method, effective electroluminescence color tuning was accomplished over a wide visible range from deep&#8208;blue to yellow (461&#8211;571&#8197;nm), using the same MR molecular system, without compromising very narrow spectral features. Deep&#8208;blue to yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with maximum external quantum efficiencies as high as 19.0&#8211;29.2&#8201;% and superb color purity could be produced with this family of color&#8208;tunable MR&#8208;TADF emitters.

         <title>Construction of A High&#8208;flux Protein Transport Channel Inspired by the Nuclear Pore Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), herein we have established a biomimetic high&#8208;flux protein delivery system via the selective introduction of pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest system into one side of an artificial concave (hour&#8208;glass) shaped nanochannels. With a transport flux of 660 lysozymes per minute, the system provides efficient high&#8208;flux protein transport at a rate which is significantly higher than that of an unmodified nanochannel and conventional bilateral symmetrical modified nanochannels. In view of these promising results, the use of artificial nanochannels to improve protein transport not only provides a new potential chemical model for biological research and better understanding of protein transport behavior in the living systems, but also provides a high&#8208;flux protein transporter device, which may have applications in the design of protein drug release systems, protein separation systems and microfluidics in the near future.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Tumor&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Microparticles Provide On&#8208;Demand Photosensitizer Synthesis and Hypoxia Relief for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positioning essential elements of photodynamic therapy (PDT) to mitochondria can conquer the rigorously spatiotemporal limitation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) transfer and make considerable differences in PDT. However, precise accumulation of&#160; photosensitizer (PS) and oxygen within mitochondria is still challenging. Here, Hexyl 5&#8208;aminolevulinate hydrochloride (HAL) and 3&#8208;bromopyruvic acid (3BP) are simultaneously encapsulated into microparticles collected from X&#8208;ray irradiated tumor cells (X&#8208;MP). After systemic administration, the developed HAL/3BP@X&#8208;MP can specifically target and recognize tumor cells, where HAL induces the efficient accumulation of PpIX in mitochondria  via  the intrinsic haem biosynthetic pathway; meanwhile, 3BP remarkably increases the oxygen supply by inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. The accurate co&#8208;localization and prompt encounter of PpIX and oxygen produce sufficient ROS to directly disrupt mitochondria, resulting in significantly improved PDT outcomes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous sodium&#8208;ion batteries (ASIBs) are aspiring candidates for low environmental impact energy storage, especially when using organic electrodes. In this respect, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) is a promising anode active material, but it suffers from extensive dissolution in conventional aqueous electrolytes. As a remedy, we here present a novel aqueous electrolyte, which inhibits the PTCDA dissolution and enables their use as all&#8208;organic ASIB anodes with high capacity retention and Coulombic efficiencies. Furthermore, the electrolyte is based on two, hence &#8220;hybrid&#8221;, inexpensive and non&#8208;fluorinated Na/Mg&#8208;salts, it displays favourable physico&#8208;chemical properties and an electrochemical stability window &gt;3 V without resorting to the extreme salt concentrations of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes. Altogether, this paves the way for ASIBs with both relatively high energy densities, inexpensive total cell chemistries, long&#8208;term sustainability, and improved safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a new class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with minimal phototoxicity, &#956;M affinities and high turn&#8208;on ratios. Tailored for 4D, long&#8208;term and multiple&#8208;color recording of Zn2+/insulin co&#8208;secretion in &#946;&#8208;cells and islets, the new probes promise to unveil the spatial&#8208;temporal regulation of islet endocrinology.







Abstract
Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn2+ probes with Kd values ranging from 190&#8197;nM to 74&#8197;&#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn2+ co&#8208;released with insulin during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording of isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn2+ probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt;100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets. The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn2+ and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.

         <title>A Simple Gas&#8211;Solid Treatment for Surface Modification of Li&#8208;Rich Oxides Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple gas&#8211;solid treatment of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with ferrous oxalate is proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancies and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion.







Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides with high capacity are expected to be the next generation of cathode materials. However, the irreversible and sluggish anionic redox reaction leads to the O2 loss in the surface as well as the capacity and voltage fading. In the present study, a simple gas&#8211;solid treatment with ferrous oxalate has been proposed to uniformly coat a thin spinel phase layer with oxygen vacancy and simultaneously realize Fe&#8208;ion substitution in the surface. The integration of oxygen vacancy and spinel phase suppresses irreversible O2 release, prevents electrolyte corrosion, and promotes Li&#8208;ion diffusion. In addition, the surface doping of Fe&#8208;ion can further stabilize the structure. Accordingly, the treated Feox&#8208;2&#8201;% cathode exhibits superior capacity retention of 86.4&#8201;% and 85.5&#8201;% at 1&#8197;C and 2&#8197;C to that (75.3&#8201;% and 75.0&#8201;%) of the pristine sample after 300&#8197;cycles, respectively. Then, the voltage fading is significantly suppressed to 0.0011&#8197;V per cycle at 2&#8197;C especially. The encouraging results may play a significant role in paving the practical application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides cathode.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Carboxylation Reaction of 1,1&#8208;Diarylethylenes via Hydrorhodation&#8208;Rhodium Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H carboxylation of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives has been achieved by using a bulky rhodium catalyst under a CO2 atmosphere. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that tandem hydrorhodation and rhodium migrations, which include unique aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration, are operative in the reaction conditions.







Abstract
A meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H carboxylation reaction of 1,1&#8208;diarylethylene derivatives with CO2 by using a rhodium catalyst with NaOiPr as a stoichiometric reductant has been achieved. Together with hydrogenation of the ethylene moiety, a carboxyl group was introduced to the meta&#8208;position of the aryl ring with high selectivity over the ortho&#8208;positions. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that this carboxylation reaction proceeds via hydrorhodation on the ethylene moiety, followed by 1,4&#8208;rhodium migration and successive 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration on the aryl ring. The use of a bulky phosphine ligand seems to be the key to this unusual aryl&#8208;to&#8208;aryl 1,2&#8208;rhodium shift.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Markovnikov Hydroxycarbonylation and Hydroalkoxycarbonylation of Vinyl Arenes: Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylpropanoic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water for the synthesis of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids has been developed. Several non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, and ketoprofen were synthesized in high yields and ees in gram scale.







Abstract
Asymmetric hydroxycarbonylation is one of the most fundamental yet challenging methods for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. Herein, we reported the development of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed highly enantioselective Markovnikov hydroxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with CO and water. A monodentate phosphoramidite ligand L6 plays vital role in the reaction. The reaction tolerates a range of functional groups, and provides a facile and atom&#8208;economical approach to an array of 2&#8208;arylpropanoic acids including several commonly used non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. The catalytic system has also enabled an asymmetric Markovnikov hydroalkoxycarbonylation of vinyl arenes with alcohols to afford 2&#8208;arylpropanates. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the hydropalladation is irreversible and is the regio&#8208; and enantiodetermining step, while hydrolysis/alcoholysis is probably the rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Luminescent Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Multicolor Particle Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of fluorescence labeling techniques has attracted widespread interest in various fields, including biomedical science as it can facilitate high&#8208;resolution imaging and the spatiotemporal understanding of various biological processes. We herein report a supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy using luminescent metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) constructed from metal ions, phenolic ligands, and common and commercially available dye molecules. The rapid labeling process (&lt;5 min) produces ultrathin coatings (~10 nm) on diverse particles (e.g., organic, inorganic, and biological entities) with customized luminescence (e.g., red, blue, multichromatic, and white light) simply through the selection of fluorophores. The fluorescent coatings are stable at pH from 1 to 8 and in complex biological media owing to the dominant &#960; interactions between the dyes and MPNs. These coatings exhibit negligible cytotoxicity and their strong fluorescence is retained even when internalized into intracellular compartments. This supramolecular fluorescence labeling strategy is expected to provide a versatile approach for fluorescence labeling with potential in diverse fields across the physical and life sciences, including materials science and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Aromaticity Relief as an Approach to Stabilize Free Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new strategy to stabilize free radicals electronically is described by conjugating formally&#8208;antiaromatic substituents to the free radical. With an antiaromatic substituent, the radical acts as an electron sink to allow configuration mixing of a low&#8208;energy zwitterionic state that provides antiaromaticity relief to the substituent. A combination of X&#8208;ray crystallography, VT&#8208;EPR and VT&#8208;UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, as well as computational analysis, was used to investigate this phenomenon. We find that this strategy of antiaromaticity relief is successful at stabilizing radicals, but only if the antiaromatic substituent is constrained to be planar by synthetically imposed conformational restraints that enable state mixing. This work leads to the counterintuitive finding that increasing the antiaromaticity of the radical substituent leads to greater radical stability, providing proof of concept for a new stereoelectronic approach for stabilizing free radicals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Pickering emulsions, foams, bubbles and marbles are dispersions of two immiscible liquids or of a liquid and a gas that are stabilized by colloidal particles with amphiphilic properties (i.e. partially hydrophilic/hydrophobic or oleophilic/oleophobic). These systems can be used for engineering of L&#8208;L&#8208;S and G&#8208;L&#8208;S microreactors for multiphase reactions, combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. They constitute original platforms for reengineering already established multiphase reactors towards a higher degree of sustainability.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Control of Sacrificial Bond Transformation in the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Molecular Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically dispersed metal&#8211;nitrogen sites show great prospect for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), whereas the unsatisfactory adsorption&#8208;desorption behaviors of oxygenated intermediates on the metal centers impede improvement of the ORR performance. We propose a new conceptual strategy of introducing sacrificial bonds to remold the local coordination of Fe&#8722;N  x  sites, via controlling the dynamic transformation of the Fe&#8722;S bonds in the Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalyst. Spectroscopic and theoretical results reveal that the selective cleavage of the sacrificial Fe&#8722;S bonds induces the incorporation of the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxidized sulfur on the Fe centers. The newly functionalized moieties endow the catalyst with superior ORR activity and remarkable stability, owing to the reduced electron localization around the Fe centers facilitating the desorption of ORR intermediates. These findings provide a unique perspective for precisely controlling the coordination structure of single&#8208;atom materials to optimize their activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected Reactions of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Fatty Acids Provide&#160;Insight&#160;into the Mechanisms of CYP152 Peroxygenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CYP152 peroxygenases catalyze decarboxylation and hydroxylation of fatty acids using H2O2&#160;  as cofactor. To understand the molecular basis for the chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity of these unique P450 enzymes, herein, we analyze the activities of three representative CYP152 peroxygenases (OleTJE, P450SP&#945;  and P450BS&#946;) towards  cis&#8208; and  trans&#8208;dodecenoic acids as substrate probes. The unexpected 6S&#8208;hydroxylation of the  trans&#8208;isomer and 4R&#8208;hydroxylation of the  cis&#8208;isomer by OleTJE, and molecular docking results suggest that the unprecedented selectivity is likely due to OleTJE's preference of C2&#8208;C3  cis&#8208;configuration. More surprisingly, in addition to the common epoxide products, undecanal is the unexpected major product of P450SP&#945;  and P450BS&#946;  regardless the  cis/trans&#8208;configuration of substrates. The combined isotopically&#8208;labeled H218O2  tracing experiments, MD simulations and QM/MM calculations unravel an unusual mechanism for Compound I&#8208;mediated aldehyde formation, in which the active site water derived from H2O2  activation is involved in the generation of a four&#8208;membered ring lactone intermediate. These findings provide new insights into the unusual mechanisms of CYP152 peroxygenases.</dc:description>

         <title>Corroles: The Hitherto Elusive Parent Macrocycle and its Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The science and technology of corroles, macrocycles that owe their name to the cobalt&#8208;chelating prosthetic group of Vitamin B12 and share numerous features with the iron&#8208;chelating porphyrin present in heme proteins/enzymes, constantly crosses new boundaries ever since stable derivatives became easily accessible. Particularly important is the increasing utilization of corroles and the corresponding metal complexes for the benefit of mankind, in terms of new drug candidates for treating various diseases and as catalysts for sustainable energy relevant processes. One still unmet challenge is to gain access to the plain macrocycle, as to allow for a full elucidation of the most fundamental properties of corroles. We now report the success in obtaining the substituents&#8208;free corrole, by several surprising and conceptually different pathways. Selected features of the corresponding metal complexes are illuminated, for pointing towards unique phenomena that are anticipated to largely expand the horizon regarding their utilization for contemporary catalysis.</dc:description>

The first total syntheses of complex bergamotane sesquiterpenes massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide&#8197;C were achieved with key steps involving an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement, a furan oxidative cyclization, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation and sigmatropic elimination. Our synthesis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A.







Abstract
Massarinolin&#8197;A and purpurolides are bioactive bergamotane sesquiterpenes condensed with a variety of synthetically challenging ring systems: a bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, an oxaspiro[3.4]octane, and a dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (oxaspirolactone). Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of massarinolin&#8197;A, purpurolides&#8197;B, D, E, and 2,3&#8208;deoxypurpurolide C. Our synthesis and computational analysis also led to a structural revision of massarinolin&#8197;A. The divergent approach features an enantioselective organocatalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to install the first stereogenic center in high ee, a scalable flow photochemical Wolff rearrangement to build the key bicyclo[3.1.1]heptane, a furan oxidative cyclization to form the oxaspirolactone, a late&#8208;stage allylic C&#8722;H oxidation, and a Myers&#8217; NBSH&#8208;promoted sigmatropic elimination to install the exo methylene group of massarinolin&#8197;A.

         <title>Observability of paramagnetic NMR signals at over 10&#8201;000 ppm chemical shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution paramagnetic NMR resonances of a ferrous complex with an intermediate spin ground state with chemical shifts beyond ten thousand ppm were detected, the observability of which are attributed to a large rhombic zero&#8208;field splitting resulting in an effective suppression of the dipolar relaxation mechanism.







Abstract
We report an experimental observation of 31P&#8197;NMR resonances shifted by over 10&#8201;000&#8197;ppm (meaning percent range, and a new record for solutions), and similar 1H chemical shifts, in an intermediate&#8208;spin square planar ferrous complex [tBu(PNP)Fe&#8208;H], where PNP is a carbazole&#8208;based pincer ligand. Using a combination of electronic structure theory, nuclear magnetic resonance, magnetometry, and terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance, the influence of magnetic anisotropy and zero&#8208;field splitting on the paramagnetic shift and relaxation enhancement is investigated. Detailed spin dynamics simulations indicate that, even with relatively slow electron spin relaxation (T1 &#8776;10&#8722;11&#8197;s), it remains possible to observe NMR signals of directly metal&#8208;bonded atoms because pronounced rhombicity in the electron zero&#8208;field splitting reduces nuclear paramagnetic relaxation enhancement.

         <title>Azide&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Oxygen Interaction: A Crystal Engineering Tool for Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental evidence for the azide&#8208;oxygen noncovalent interaction in dictating the conformation of molecules having these functional groups in vicinity is provided. 36 Crystal structures of designed compounds were analyzed. Additionally, a CSD search revealed the frequent occurrence of this interaction in reported crystal structures. This interaction might find use in designing supramolecular architectures and in crystal engineering.







Abstract
We have designed, synthesized, and crystallized 36 compounds, each containing an azide group and an oxygen atom separated by three bonds. Crystal structure analysis revealed that each of these molecules adopts a conformation in which the azide and oxygen groups orient syn to each other with a short O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#946; contact. Geometry&#8208;optimized structures [using M06&#8208;2X/6&#8211;311G(d,p) level of theory] also showed the syn conformation in all 36 of these cases, suggesting that this is not merely a crystal packing effect. Quantum topological analysis using Bader's Atoms in Molecules (AIM) theory revealed bond paths and bond critical points (BCP) in these structures suggesting its nature and energetics to be similar to weak hydrogen bonding. The NCI&#8208;RDG plot clearly revealed the attractive interaction consisting of electrostatic or dispersive components in all the 36 systems. NBO analysis suggested a weak orbital&#8208;relaxation (charge&#8208;transfer) contribution of energy for a few (sp2)O&#8208;donor systems. Natural population analysis (NPA) and molecular electrostatic potential mapping (MESP) of these crystal structures further revealed the existence of favorable azide&#8208;oxygen interaction. A CSD search indicated the frequent and consistent occurrence of this interaction and its role dictating the syn conformation of azide and oxygen in molecules where these groups are separated by 2&#8211;4 bonds.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Arylbenzylation of Alkenylarenes: Kinetic Studies Reveal Autocatalysis by ZnX2**
</title>

         <dc:description>
We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed arylbenzylation reaction of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents to furnish 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures, the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. Kinetic studies and competition experiments reveal that the reaction is autocatalyzed by ZnX2 by activating benzyl halides, potentially by a Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction with the halide, which increases the catalytic rate by a factor of three.







Abstract
We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective arylbenzylation of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents. The reaction furnishes differently substituted 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures that are reminiscent of the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. The reaction is also compatible for the coupling of internal alkenes, secondary benzyl halides and variously substituted arylzinc reagents. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds with a rate&#8208;limiting single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process and is autocatalyzed by in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated ZnX2. The reaction rate is amplified by a factor of three through autocatalysis upon addition of ZnX2.

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;Index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With density functional theory, the phenomena that drive the shape selectivity of NiO particles crystallized by molten salt synthesis were studied. Trapezohedral NiO particles are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to the interaction of locally ordered alkali&#8208;chloride structures with the growing high&#8208;index oxide facets, thus acting as capping agents. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO formation is driven by the dissociative adsorption of water.







Abstract
Given the strong influence of surface structure on the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, understanding the mechanisms that control crystal morphology is an important component of designing catalytic materials with targeted shape and functionality. Herein, we employ density functional theory to examine the impact of growth media on NiO crystal faceting in line with experimental findings, showing that molten&#8208;salt synthesis in alkali chlorides (KCl, LiCl, and NaCl) imposes shape selectivity on NiO particles. We find that the production of NiO octahedra is attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H2O, whereas the formation of trapezohedral particles is associated with the control of the growth kinetics exerted by ordered salt structures on high&#8208;index facets. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that growth inhibition of metal&#8208;oxide facets occurs by a localized ordering of molten salts at the crystal&#8211;solvent interface. These findings provide new molecular&#8208;level insight on kinetics and thermodynamics of molten&#8208;salt synthesis as a predictive route to shape&#8208;engineer metal&#8208;oxide crystals.

Trapezohedral NiO particles are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to the interaction of locally ordered alkali-chloride structures with the growing high-index oxide facets, thus acting as capping agents. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO formation is driven by the dissociative adsorption of water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the strong influence of surface structure on the reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, understanding the mechanisms that control crystal morphology is an important component of designing catalytic materials with targeted shape and functionality. Herein, we employ density functional theory to examine the impact of growth media on NiO crystal faceting in line with experimental findings, showing that molten-salt synthesis in alkali chlorides (KCl, LiCl, and NaCl) imposes shape selectivity on NiO particles. We find that the production of NiO octahedra is attributed to the dissociative adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, whereas the formation of trapezohedral particles is associated with the control of the growth kinetics exerted by ordered salt structures on high-index facets. To our knowledge, this is the first observation that growth inhibition of metal-oxide facets occurs by a localized ordering of molten salts at the crystal&#8211;solvent interface. These findings provide new molecular-level insight on kinetics and thermodynamics of molten-salt synthesis as a predictive route to shape-engineer metal-oxide crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Voltage Dependent Sidedness of the Reprotonation of the Retinal Schiff Base Determines the Unique Inward Pumping of Xenorhodopsin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique behaviour of inward proton pumping xenorhodopsins (XeR) makes these microbial rhodopsins an alternative optogenetic tool to the passively transporting light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. channelrhodopsin&#8208;1 and channelrhodopsin&#8208;2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. Here, we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).







Abstract
The new class of microbial rhodopsins, called xenorhodopsins (XeRs),[1] extends the versatility of this family by inward H+ pumps.[2&#8211;4] These pumps are an alternative optogenetic tool to the light&#8208;gated ion channels (e.g. ChR1,2), because the activation of electrically excitable cells by XeRs is independent from the surrounding physiological conditions. In this work we functionally and spectroscopically characterized XeR from Nanosalina (NsXeR).[1] The photodynamic behavior of NsXeR was investigated on the ps to s time scale elucidating the formation of the J and K and a previously unknown long&#8208;lived intermediate. The pH dependent kinetics reveal that alkalization of the surrounding medium accelerates the photocycle and the pump turnover. In patch&#8208;clamp experiments the blue&#8208;light illumination of NsXeR in the M state shows a potential&#8208;dependent vectoriality of the photocurrent transients, suggesting a variable accessibility of reprotonation of the retinal Schiff base. Insights on the kinetically independent switching mechanism could furthermore be obtained by mutational studies on the putative intracellular H+ acceptor D220.

         <title>Generation of &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals by H. Transfer and their Use in Cycloisomerizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular derivatives of pinacol (Bpin), are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors, generating &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals from H2 in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst. These radicals undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations onto appropriate double bonds, eventually furnishing densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin.







Abstract
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals can be stabilized by delocalization of their spin density into the vacant p orbital of a boron substituent. &#945;&#8208;Vinyl boronates, in particular pinacol (Bpin) derivatives, are excellent hydrogen atom acceptors. Under H2, in the presence of a cobaloxime catalyst, they generate &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals; these species can undergo 5&#8208;exo radical cyclizations if appropriate double bond acceptors are present, leading to densely functionalized heterocycles with tertiary substituents on Bpin. The reaction shows good functional group tolerance with wide scope, and the resulting boronate products can be converted into other useful functionalities.

         <title>The Significance of Properly Reporting Turnover Frequency in Electrocatalysis Research</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Turnover frequency (TOF) serves as an accurate descriptor of the intrinsic activity of a catalyst. However, if it is reported at all, it has not been accurately determined in most of the recent studies on electrocatalytic reactions involving both fuel generation and fuel consumption. This Viewpoint stresses the significance of realistic TOF data in the development of new electrocatalysts.







Abstract
For decades, turnover frequency (TOF) has served as an accurate descriptor of the intrinsic activity of a catalyst, including those in electrocatalytic reactions involving both fuel generation and fuel consumption. Unfortunately, in most of the recent reports in this area, TOF is often not properly reported or not reported at all, in contrast to the overpotentials at a benchmarking current density. The current density is significant in determining the apparent activity, but it is affected by catalyst&#8208;centric parasitic reactions, electrolyte&#8208;centric competing reactions, and capacitance. Luckily, a properly calculated TOF can precisely give the intrinsic activity free from these phenomena in electrocatalysis. In this Viewpoint we ask: 1)&#8197;What makes the commonly used activity markers unsuitable for intrinsic activity determination? 2)&#8197;How can TOF reflect the intrinsic activity? 3)&#8197;Why is TOF still underused in electrocatalysis? 4)&#8197;What methods are used in TOF determination? and 5)&#8197;What is essential in the more accurate calculation of TOF? Finally, the significance of normalizing TOF by Faradaic efficiency (FE) is stressed and we give our views on the development of universal analytical tools to determine the exact number of active sites and real surface area for all kinds of materials.

         <title>Single&#8208;phase formation of Rh2O3 nanoparticles on h&#8208;BN support for highly controlled methane partial oxidation to syngas</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;phase formation of active metal oxides on supports has been vigorously pursued in many catalytic applications to suppress undesired reactions and to determine direct structure&#8211;property relationships. However, this is difficult to achieve in nanoscale range because the effect of non&#8208;uniform metal&#8211;support interfaces becomes dominant in the overall catalyst growth, leading to nucleation of various metastable oxides. Herein, we develop a supported single&#8208;phase corundum&#8722;Rh2O3(I) nanocatalyst by utilizing controlled interaction between metal oxide and h&#8208;BN support. Atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and first&#8208;principle calculation reveal that the single&#8208;phase formation occurs via uniform and preferential attachment of Rh2O3(I) (110) seed plane on well&#8208;defined h&#8208;BN surface after decomposition of rhodium precursor. By utilizing the Rh/h&#8208;BN catalyst in methane partial oxidation, syngas is successfully produced solely following the direct route with keeping the H2/CO ratio of 2, which makes it ideal for most downstream chemical processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Persistent and Stable Porous Radical Polymers by Electronical Isolation Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated organic radical polymers with stable radical features are difficult to design because the &#960; conjugation in the polymer backbones makes the radicals readily delocalize and tend to undergo covalent bonding processes. In this work, we report an electronical isolation strategy to design stable porous radical polymers by homocoupling reaction from a meta&#8208;position active monomer. The meta linkage ensures less conjugation in the polymer skeletons, localizes the resonant radicals, and prevent them from recombination. The resulting porous radical polymer exhibits exceptional radical characters with ultralow bandgap of 0.68 eV, strong yet extended UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR absorption up to 1800 nm, and high spin density. The above features make the polymer very promising in the photothermal conversion with record&#8208;high photothermal temperature increment of ~240 &#186;C and striking solar&#8208;driven water evaporation efficiency of 96.8%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of electronical isolation of radicals for producing outstanding photothermal materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Parent B2N2&#8208;Perylenes with Different BN Orientations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of parent B2N2&#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations have been synthesized based on the BN&#8208;naphthalene building block. The effects of BN with different orientations on structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties are systematically investigated. This work provides an efficient synthetic strategy for BN&#8208;PAHs and a deep insight into the structure&#8211;property relationship of BN&#8208;PAHs.







Abstract
Introducing BN units into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons expands the chemical space of conjugated materials with novel properties. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific BN positions and orientations. Here, three new parent B2N2&#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations are synthesized with BN&#8208;naphthalene as the building block, providing systematic insight into the effects of BN incorporation with different orientations on the structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties. The intermolecular dipole&#8211;dipole interaction shortens the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance. The crystal structure, (anti)aromaticity, and photophysical properties vary with the change of BN orientation. The revealed BN doping effects may provide a guideline for the synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific stacking structures, and the synthetic strategy employed here can be extended toward the synthesis of larger BN&#8208;embedded PAHs with adjustable BN patterns.

         <title>Synthesis of Multicompositional Onion&#8208;like Nanoparticles via RAFT Emulsion Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles comprising multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core is described. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers and the number of layers can be tailored as desired, making complex particle design possible.







Abstract
Synthesis of multicompositional polymeric nanoparticles of diameters 100&#8211;150&#8197;nm comprising well&#8208;defined multiblock copolymers reaching from the particle surface to the particle core was conducted using surfactant&#8208;free aqueous macroRAFT emulsion polymerization. The imposed constraints on chain mobility as well as chemical incompatibility between the blocks result in microphase separation, leading to formation of an onion&#8208;like multilayered particle morphology with individual layer thicknesses of approximately 20&#8197;nm. The approach provides considerable versatility in particle morphology design as the composition of individual layers as well as the number of layers can be tailored as desired, offering more complex particle design compared to approaches relying on self&#8208;assembly of preformed diblock copolymers within particles. Microphase separation can occur in these systems under conditions where the corresponding bulk system would not theoretically result in microphase separation.

         <title>Rational Surface&#8208;Defect Control via Designed Passivation for High&#8208;Efficiency Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is used to intentionally passivate the VI in the CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite thin films. The synergistic effect of Lewis base&#8211;acid interaction and H&#8208;bond strengthens the adsorption of HA molecules on the surface of perovskite. The fabricated PSCs with HA passivation significantly reduced the number of uncoordinated Pb2+ and achieved a record 20.8&#8201;% efficiency.







Abstract
Iodine vacancies (VI) and undercoordinated Pb2+ on the surface of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films are mainly responsible for nonradiative charge recombination. An environmentally benign material, histamine (HA), is used to passivate the VI in perovskite films. A theoretical study shows that HA bonds to the VI on the surface of the perovskite film via a Lewis base&#8211;acid interaction; an additional hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) strengthens such interaction owing to the favorable molecular configuration of HA. Undercoordinated Pb2+ and Pb clusters are passivated, leading to significantly reduced surface trap density and prolonged charge lifetime within the perovskite films. HA passivation also induces an upward shift of the energy band edge of the perovskite layer, facilitating interfacial hole transfer. The combination of the above raises the solar cell efficiency from 19.5 to 20.8&#8201;% under 100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 illumination, the highest efficiency so far for inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

         <title>Modulating Tri&#8208;mode Emission for Single&#8208;component White Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving single&#8208;component white organic afterglow remains a great challenge owing to the difficulties in simultaneously supporting long&#8208;lived emissions from varied excited states of a molecule for complementary afterglow. Here, an extraordinary tri&#8208;mode emission from the radiative decays of singlet (S  1  ), triplet (T  1  ) and stabilized triplet (T  1  *  ) excited states was proposed to afford white afterglow through modulating the singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;  E  ST  ) and exciton trapping depth (  E  TD  ). Low&#8208;lying T  1  *  for yellow afterglow was constructed by H&#8208;aggregation engineering with large  E  TD  and trace isomer doping, while high&#8208;lying T  1  and S  1  for blue afterglow with thermally activated emission feature was realized by reducing &#916;  E  ST  through donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design. Therefore, the single&#8208;component white afterglow with high efficiency of 14.1% and lifetime of 0.61 s was achieved by rationally regulating the afterglow intensity ratios of complementary emissions from S  1  , T  1  and T  1  *  .</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a new strategy for carbon&#8211;carbon bond scission and intramolecular ring expansion fluorination of unactivated cyclopropanes, which was accomplished with a new hypervalent fluoroiodane(III) reagent  1  developed in our laboratory. This novel method delivers medicinally relevant 4&#8208;fully substituted fluoropiperidines in moderate to high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity. Reagent  1  , which has an  N  &#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework, was readily synthesized via three steps in 76% overall yield and was characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Owing to the presence of a secondary I&#183;&#183;&#183;O bonding interaction between the &#955;  3  &#8208;iodane atom and the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of the  N  &#8208;acetylbenziodazole framework,  1  has excellent stability and can be stored at ambient temperature for 6 months without any detectable decomposition. Density functional theory calculations and experimental studies showed that the reaction proceeds via a carbocation intermediate that readily combines with a fluoride ion to generate the product.</dc:description>

The difficulties associated with the preparation of these targets prompted the development of various chemical strategies. Nevertheless, the production of these targets remains very challenging or elusive. Recently, we introduced a strategy for one&#8208;pot disulfide bonds formation, tackling most of the previous limitations. Nevertheless, the effect of the order of oxidation remains an underexplored issue. Here we report on the synthetic flexibility and the full rainbow of oxidation orders of three disulfide bonds in targets that lack the knot motif. In contrast, our study reveals an essential order of disulfide bond formation in the EETI&#8208;II knotted miniprotein. This synthetic strategy was straightforwardly applied for the synthesis of novel analogues of the plectasin antimicrobial peptide with enhanced activities against methicillin&#8208;resistant&amp;nbsp;&lt;italic&gt;Staphylococcus&lt;/italic&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;italic&gt;aureus (MRSA)&lt;/italic&gt;, a notorious human pathogen.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <title>Sn2PO4I: An Excellent Birefringent Material with Giant Optical Anisotropy in Non &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phosphate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring non &#960;&#8208;conjugated phosphate birefringent crystal with a large birefringence has been a great challenge. Herein, based on the unique two&#8208;dimensional layered structure in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), two new compounds, Sn2PO4I and Sn2BO3I, were designed and synthesized successfully, maintaining the layer structural feature and enhancing the optical anisotropy of crystals. Especially, the birefringence of Sn2PO4I is larger than or equal to 0.664 @546 nm, which is largest among the reported borates and phosphates, even surpassing commercial birefringent crystals YVO4 and TiO2. This work indicates that a breakthrough in birefringence of inorganic compound was achieved. Also, it provides a guiding idea for exploring large birefringence materials in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical and Enzymatic Synthesis of Sialylated Glycoforms of Human Erythropoietin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) is the main therapeutic glycoprotein for the treatment of anemia in cancer and kidney patients. The&#160;  in vivo  &#160;activity of EPO is carbohydrate&#8208;dependent with the number of sialic acid residues regulating its circulatory half&#8208;life. EPO carries three&#160;  N  &#8208;glycans and thus obtaining pure glycoforms provides a major challenge. We have developed a robust and reproducible chemoenzymatic approach to glycoforms of EPO with and without sialic acids. EPO was assembled by sequential native chemical ligation (NCL) of two peptide and three glycopeptide segments. The glycopeptides were obtained by pseudoproline&#8208;assisted Lansbury&#8208;aspartylation. Enzymatic introduction of the sialic acids was readily accomplished at the level of&#160;the glycopeptide segments&#160;but even more efficiently on the refolded glycoprotein. Biological recognition of the synthetic EPOs was shown by formation of 1:1 complexes with recombinant EPO receptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Molten Salt Electrochemical Modulation of Iron&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Nitrogen for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur hosts with rationally designed chemistry to confine and convert lithium polysulfides are of prime importance for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. A molten salt electrochemical modulation of iron&#8208;carbon&#8208;nitrogen is herein demonstrated as formation of hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon with grafted Fe3C nanoparticles (Fe3C@C@Fe3C), which is rationalized as an excellent sulfur host for lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Fe3C over nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon contributes to enhanced adsorption and catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides. The sulfur&#8208;loaded Fe3C@C@Fe3C electrodes hence show a high capacity, good cyclic stability, and enhanced rate performance. This work highlights the unique chemistry of metal carbides on facilitating adsorption&#8208;conversion process of lithium polysulfides, and also extends the scope of molten salt electrolysis to elaboration of energy materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Coral&#8208;Like FeP@NC Anode with Increasing Cycle Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion and Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Induced by Particle&#8208;Refinement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrodes with higher Na  +  storage capability and cycling stability are vital to improve the energy density and rate capability of sodium ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, we present a coral&#8208;like FeP composite with FeP nanoparticles anchored and dispersed on a nitrogen&#8208;doped three&#8208;dimensional carbon framework (   FeP@NC  ).  Due to the highly continuous N&#8208;doped carbon framework and a spring&#8208;buffering graphitized carbon layer around the FeP nanoparticle, the sodium  ion battery with FeP@NC composite can exhibit an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at 10 A g  &#8208;1  with a capacity retention of 82.0% in 10000 cycles. More importantly, an interesting particle refinement achieving capacity increasing mechanism during cycling has been well confirmed. Particularly, the  FeP nanoparticles  go through a refining&#8208;recombination process during the first cycle and present a global refining trend after dozens of cycles, which  results in a gradually  increase  in graphitization degree and interface magnetization, and further provides more extra active sites for Na  +  storage and contributes to a rising capacity  with cycling  . The capacity ascending phenomenon can also extend to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). This paper  holds a new feasibility insight  mechanism of the enhanced capacity during cycling and also offers a feasible solution to design high performance anode material for SIBs/LIBs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An O  2  &#8208;assisted, four&#8208;component reaction has been developed to synthesize a wide range of  syn  &#8208;1,3&#8208;amino alcohols in one step. The reaction proceeds by oxygenation of vinyl magnesium bromide (  component&#8208;I  ) with O  2  (  component&#8208;II  ) to give a magnesium enolate of acetaldehyde, which undergoes addition to a  chiral  N  &#8208;  tert  &#8208;butanesulfinyl imine (  component&#8208;III  ) followed by a sequential addition with excess vinyl magnesium bromide (  component&#8208;IV  ).

         <dc:description>NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) are among the most active catalysts developed to date for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, though their long&#8208;term OER stability remains unsatisfactory. Herein, we reveal that the stability degradation of NiFe&#8208;LDH catalysts during alkaline OER results from a decreased number of active sites and undesirable phase segregation to form NiOOH and FeOOH, with metal dissolution underpinning both of these deactivation mechanisms. Further, we demonstrate that the introduction of cation&#8208;vacancies in the basal plane of NiFe LDH is an effective approach for achieving both high catalyst activity and stability during OER. The strengthened binding energy between the metals and oxygen in the LDH sheets, together with reduced lattice distortions, both realized by the rational introduction of cation vacancies, drastically mitigate metal dissolution from NiFe&#8208;LDH under high oxidation potentials, resulting in the improved long&#8208;term OER stability. In addition, the cation vacancies (especially M  3+  vacancies) accelerate the evolution of surface  &#947;  &#8208;(NiFe)OOH phases, thereby boosting the OER activity. The present study highlights that tailoring atomic cation&#8208;vacancies is an important strategy for the development of active and stable NiFe&#8208;LDH OER electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>New Route to Battery Grade NaPF6 for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries: Expanding the Accessible Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sodium&#8208;ion batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion systems. However, the rapid growth of sodium&#8208;ion battery technology requires a sustainable and scalable synthetic route to high&#8208;grade sodium hexafluorophosphate. This work demonstrates a new multi&#8208;gram scale synthesis of NaPF  6  in which the reaction of ammonium hexafluorophosphate with sodium metal in THF solvent generates the electrolyte salt with the absence of the impurities that are common in commercial material. The high purity of the electrolyte (absence of insoluble NaF) allows for concentrations up to 3 M to be obtained accurately in binary carbonate battery solvent. Electrochemical characterization shows that the degradation dynamics of sodium metal&#8211;electrolyte interface are different for more concentrated (&gt;2 M) electrolytes, suggesting that the higher concentration regime (above the conventional 1 M concentration) may be beneficial to battery performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Sialyl N&#8208;Glycans and Analysis of Their Recognition by Neuraminidase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical synthesis of four fully sialylated tetraantennary  N  &#8208;glycans has been achieved for the first time by using the diacetyl strategy, in which NHAc is tentatively protected as NAc2  to improve the reactivity by preventing intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Another key was the glycosylations to the branched mannose in ether, which promoted the desired glycosylation by stabilizing the oxocarbenium ion intermediate. Furthermore, high &#945;&#8208;selectivity of these glycosylations was realized by utilizing remote participation. Two asymmetrically deuterium&#8208;labeled sialyl  N  &#8208;glycans was also synthesized by the same strategy. The synthesized  N  &#8208;glycans were used to probe the molecular basis of H1N1 neuraminidase recognition. The asymmetrically deuterated  N&#8208;  glycan revealed the difference in recognition of sialic acid on each branch. Meanwhile, the tetraantennary  N  &#8208;glycan was used to evaluate the effect of multivalency and steric hinderance by forming branching structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Biochemistry&#8208;Guided Prediction of the Absolute Configuration of Fungal Reduced Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We performed a focused analysis of functionally related polyketide synthases (PKSs) which produce linear polyketides (PKs) such as prophialotide and other polyhydroxy PKs. The relative and absolute configurations were determined by degradation studies. Based on the results, we propose a stereochemical rule during the chain&#8208;elongation process of the reduced PKs.







Abstract
Highly reducing polyketide synthases (HR&#8208;PKSs) produce structurally diverse polyketides (PKs). The PK diversity is constructed by a variety of factors, including the &#946;&#8208;keto processing, chain length, methylation pattern, and relative and absolute configurations of the substituents. We examined the stereochemical course of the PK processing for the synthesis of polyhydroxy PKs such as phialotides, phomenoic acid, and ACR&#8208;toxin. Heterologous expression of a HR&#8208;PKS gene, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase gene, and a truncated non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase gene resulted in the formation of a linear PK with multiple stereogenic centers. The absolute configurations of the stereogenic centers were determined by chemical degradation followed by comparison of the degradation products with synthetic standards. A stereochemical rule was proposed to explain the absolute configurations of other reduced PKs and highlights an error in the absolute configurations of a reported structure. The present work demonstrates that focused functional analysis of functionally related HR&#8208;PKSs leads to a better understanding of the stereochemical course.

         <title>Effect of Surfactants on the Molecular Structure of the Buried Oil/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The increased ordering of oil molecules' aliphatic chains and the enhanced alignment of water molecules at the oil/water interface was revealed upon increasing adsorption of anionic surfactant using sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy. The surfactant coverage inducing the highest&#8208;ordered oil molecule configuration at the interface matches a significant reduction of interfacial tension and high emulsion stability.







Abstract
The oil/water interface, for instance in emulsions, is often stabilized by surfactants. Hence, the co&#8208;existence of oil, water, and surfactant molecules at the buried oil/water interface determines macroscopic properties such as surface tension or emulsion stability. Utilizing an inherently surface sensitive spectroscopic method, sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, we show that adsorption of an anionic surfactant to the buried oil/water interface increases the magnitude of the interfacial electric field. Meanwhile, the degree of ordering of the interfacial oil molecules increases with the surfactant concentration owing to the intercalation of aliphatic chains of interfacial oil and surfactant molecules. At sufficiently high surfactant concentrations, the interfacial charge reaches a maximum value and the interfacial oil molecules arrange in a fully ordered conformation, a state which coincides with the significant decrease in interfacial tension and increased emulsion stability.

         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations have been limited to the aziridination of C=C double bonds. In this study, we developed a novel Cu&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed oxaziridination of C=O double bonds and achieved a tandem asymmetric oxaziridination/rearrangement reaction of cyclic diketones, affording a series of bicyclic lactams bearing a quaternary carbon center.







Abstract
Although copper&#8208;nitrene has been extensively studied as a versatile active species in various transformations, asymmetric reactions involving copper&#8208;nitrene have been limited to the aziridination of olefins. Herein, we report the novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric oxaziridination reaction of cyclic diketones with alkyl azides and the subsequent rearrangement of the resulting highly active intermediate, which produces a synthetically challenging chiral bicyclic lactam containing a quaternary carbon center. This procedure not only enriches the copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reactions, but also provides an alternative strategy to address the inherent challenges of catalytic asymmetric Schmidt reactions. This unique reaction could inspire the investigation of novel copper&#8208;nitrene&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transformations and their reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Small Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of a bioconjugate is reported. The formation of ring&#8208;like structures was independent of different silica particle types and the amount of peptide conjugated to the material. This novel approach paves the way for further production of functional materials for separation, catalysis, and medical applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly processes guide disordered molecules or particles into long&#8208;range organized structures due to specific supramolecular interactions among the building entities. Herein, we report a unique evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) strategy for four different silica nanoparticle systems obtained through peptide functionalization of the particle surface. First, covalent peptide&#8208;silica coupling was investigated in detail, starting with the grafting of a single amino acid (L&#8208;serine) and expanded to specific small peptides (up to four amino acids) and transferred to different particle types (MCM&#8208;48&#8208;type MSNs, solid nanoparticles, and newly developed virus&#8208;like nanoparticles). These materials were investigated regarding their ability to undergo EISA, which was shown to be independent of particle type and amount of peptide anchored to their surface. This EISA&#8208;based approach provides new possibilities for the design of future advanced drug delivery systems, engineered hierarchical sorbents, and nanocatalyst assemblies.

         <title>Structure&#8211;Activity Relationships in Nonenzymatic Template&#8208;Directed RNA Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combine X&#8208;ray crystallography and kinetic measurements of modified nucleic acid constructs to determine the requirements for efficient template copying. The 3E conformation of the furanose rings is preferred in the formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Our findings may explain why RNA is a privileged substrate amongst other plausible candidates.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a 3E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8211;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.

         <title>Platinum Modulates Redox Properties and 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Adsorption Kinetics of Ni(OH)2 for Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt is proven to be an effective accelerator to Ni(OH)2 for catalyzing HMF oxidation reaction. Pt optimizes the surface electronic structure of Ni(OH)2 and accelerates the formation of the active Ni(OH)O species. Besides, it optimizes the adsorption mode of HMF and reduces the adsorption energy.







Abstract
Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is a promising electrocatalyst for the 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and the dehydronated intermediates Ni(OH)O species are proved to be active sites for HMFOR. In this study, Ni(OH)2 is modified by platinum to adjust the electronic structure and the current density of HMFOR improves 8.2 times at the Pt/Ni(OH)2 electrode compared with that on Ni(OH)2 electrode. Operando methods reveal that the introduction of Pt optimized the redox property of Ni(OH)2 and accelerate the formation of Ni(OH)O during the catalytic process. Theoretical studies demonstrate that the enhanced Ni(OH)O formation kinetics originates from the reduced dehydrogenation energy of Ni(OH)2. The product analysis and transition state simulation prove that the Pt also reduces adsorption energy of HMF with optimized adsorption behavior as Pt can act as the adsorption site of HMF. Overall, this work here provides a strategy to design an efficient and universal nickel&#8208;based catalyst for HMF electro&#8208;oxidation, which can also be extended to other Ni&#8208;based catalysts such as Ni(HCO3)2 and NiO.

         <title>Luminescent Behavior Elucidation of a Disilane&#8208;Bridged D&#8211;A&#8211;D Triad Composed of Phenothiazine and Thienopyrazine</title>

Abstract
A &#963;&#8211;&#960; extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8722;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8722;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together. A built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is thus formed, which triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved.







Abstract
A built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO3&#8722; ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO3RR). A model electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO2 (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO2 to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed . This built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO3&#8722; ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also raises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower the energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH3 product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO2&#8722; production of &lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&#8722;1 is achieved, which are all the best among studies reported at 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 of nitrate concentration to date.

&lt;p&gt;An electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (110) layers together. A built-in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is thus formed, which triggers interfacial accumulation of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions around the electrocatalyst. A NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production of &amp;lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass-specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A built-in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra-low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR). A model electrocatalyst is created by stacking CuCl (111) and rutile TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (110) layers together, in which a built-in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed . This built-in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also raises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower the energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; product selectivity of 98.6&#8201;%, a low NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; production of &amp;lt;0.6&#8201;%, and mass-specific ammonia production rate of 64.4&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved, which are all the best among studies reported at 100&#8197;mg&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of nitrate concentration to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Porphyrinic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets as Multidimensional Photocatalysts for Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D porphyrinic nanosheets were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts to mediate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization of different monomers under a broad range of light wavelengths. This system exhibits oxygen tolerance and temporal control resulting in the preparation of well&#8208;defined polymers. Nanosheets were utilized to catalyze stereolithographic 3D printing, providing reinforced mechanical properties and effective antimicrobial activity.







Abstract
Ultrathin porphyrinic 2D MOFs, ZnTCPP nanosheets (TCPP: 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetra&#8208;4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) were employed as heterogeneous photocatalysts to activate PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization under various wavelengths ranging from violet to orange light. High polymerization rates, oxygen tolerance, and precise temporal control were achieved. The polymers showed narrow molecular weight distributions and good chain&#8208;end fidelity. The 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets were applied as photocatalysts in stereolithographic 3D printing in an open&#8208;air environment under blue light to yield well&#8208;defined 3D printed objects. Apart from providing an efficient catalytic system, 2D ZnTCPP nanosheets reinforced the mechanical properties of the 3D printed materials. The presence of ZnTCPP embedded in the materials conferred effective antimicrobial activity under visible light by production of singlet oxygen, affording 98&#8201;% and 93&#8201;% anti&#8208;bacterial efficiency against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, respectively.

         <title>Compressive Strain Modulation of Single Iron Sites on Helical Carbon Support Boosts Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites could boost the catalytic activity for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.







Abstract
Designing and modulating the local structure of metal sites is the key to gain the unique selectivity and high activity of single metal site catalysts. Herein, we report strain engineering of curved single atomic iron&#8208;nitrogen sites to boost electrocatalytic activity. First, a helical carbon structure with abundant high&#8208;curvature surface is realized by carbonization of helical polypyrrole that is templated from self&#8208;assembled chiral surfactants. The high&#8208;curvature surface introduces compressive strain on the supported Fe&#8722;N4 sites. Consequently, the curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites with 1.5&#8201;% compressed Fe&#8722;N bonds exhibit downshifted d&#8208;band center than the planar sites. Such a change can weaken the bonding strength between the oxygenated intermediates and metal sites, resulting a much smaller energy barrier for oxygen reduction. Catalytic tests further demonstrate that a kinetic current density of 7.922&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE is obtained in alkaline media for curved Fe&#8722;N4 sites, which is 31 times higher than that for planar ones. Our findings shed light on modulating the local three&#8208;dimensional structure of single metal sites and boosting the catalytic activity via strain engineering.

         <title>Insights into the Ionic Conduction Mechanism of Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolytes through Multispectral Characterization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations is used to obtain new insights into the ionic conduction mechanism, the nature of the solvent molecules, and the interactions among different components in quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolytes (QPE) composed of Li salts, polymer matrix, and solvent, are beneficial for improving the security and energy density of batteries. However, the ionic conduction mechanism, existential form of solvent molecules, and interactions between different components of QPE remain unclear. Here we develop a multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations to unravel aforesaid mysteries. The results indicate that the existential state of solvent in QPE is quite different from that in liquid electrolyte. The Li cations in gel polymer electrolyte are fully solvated by partial solvent molecules to form a local high concentration of Li+, while the other solvent molecules are fastened by polymer matrix in QPE. As a result, the solvation structure and conduction mechanism of Li+ are similar to those in high&#8208;concentrated liquid electrolyte. This work provides a new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of QPE and will promote its application for safe and high&#8208;energy batteries.

         <title>Halogen Bonded Chiral Emitters: Generation of Chiral Fractal Architecture with Amplified Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond mediated supramolecular assembly with chiral fractal structure is demonstrated in axially chiral pyridine&#8208;based molecules and 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene. The assembly shows asymmetry amplification both in ground state and excited state, and the enhancement of the chirality can be assigned to the hierarchical chirality transfer from molecule to chiral fractal structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled chiroptical materials have attracted considerable attention due to their great applications in wide fields. During the chiral self&#8208;assembly, it remains unknown how achiral molecules can affect the assembly process and their final chiroptical performance. Herein, we report an achiral molecule directed chiral self&#8208;assembly via halogen bonds, exhibiting not only an unprecedented chiral fractal architecture but also significantly amplified circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Two axially chiral emitters with halogen bond sites co&#8208;assemble with an achiral 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (F4DIB) and well&#8208;ordered chiral fractal structures with asymmetry amplification are obtained. The enhancement of the dissymmetry factors of the assemblies was up to 0.051 and 0.011, which was approximately 100 folds than those of the corresponding molecules. It was found that both the design of the chiral emitter and the highly directional halogen bond played an important role in hierarchically chirality transfer from chiral emitters to the micrometer scale chiral fractal morphology and amplified dissymmetry factors. We hope that this strategy can give a further insight into the fabrication of structurally unique featured highly efficient chiroptical materials.

         <title>Interpenetration Symmetry Control Within Ultramicroporous Robust Boron Cluster Hybrid MOFs for Benchmark Purification of Acetylene from Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented symmetrically interpenetrated boron cluster pillared MOF was prepared to address the industrially important but challenging C2H2/CO2 separation with large C2H2 capacity (76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh C2H2/CO2 selectivity (56.6), modestly high adsorption heat (54.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1), and high practical C2H2 (&gt;99.5&#8201;% purity) productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) owing to the precise control of interpenetration symmetry.







Abstract
The separation of C2H2/CO2 is an important process in industry but challenged by the trade&#8208;off of capacity and selectivity owning to their similar physical properties and identical kinetic molecular size. We report the first example of symmetrically interpenetrated dodecaborate pillared MOF, ZNU&#8208;1, for benchmark selective separation of C2H2 from CO2 with a high C2H2 capacity of 76.3&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and record C2H2/CO2 selectivity of 56.6 (298&#8197;K, 1&#8197;bar) among all the robust porous materials without open metal sites. Single crystal structure analysis and modeling indicated that the interpenetration shifting from asymmetric to symmetric mode provided optimal pore chemistry with ideal synergistic &#8220;2+2&#8221; dihydrogen bonding sites for tight C2H2 trapping. The exceptional separation performance was further evidenced by simulated and experimental breakthroughs with excellent recyclability and high productivity (2.4&#8197;mol&#8201;kg&#8722;1) of 99.5&#8201;% purity C2H2 during stepped desorption process.

         <title>After 200 Years: The Structure of Bleach and Characterization of Hypohalite Ions by Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structures of sodium hypochlorite and hypobromite hydrates provide the first direct insight into the geometry and hydrogen bonding properties of hypohalites, anions of great importance in general and inorganic chemistry. The crystal structure of sodium hypochlorite, the active component of bleach, fills a long&#8208;standing gap in structural chemistry, dating back to the discovery of chlorine bleaching by Berthollet, and the first development of liquid bleach in Javel, 18th&#160;century France. Details of this research are reported by Tomislav Fri&#353;&#269;i&#263; et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202108843).

         <title>Local Ordering of Molten Salts at NiO Crystal Interfaces Promotes High&#8208;index Faceting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;index NiO faceting during molten salt synthesis is investigated with density functional theory by J.&#8197;D. Rimer, M. Maestri, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202105018). Trapezohedral NiO particles observed in experiments are shown to form in LiCl and KCl due to locally&#8208;ordered alkali chloride structures which act as capping agents during crystal growth. In the absence of salt, octahedral NiO particles are produced because of their stable hydroxylated surfaces.

Combining alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal tetrahedra units with an excellent diamond&#8208;like structure (DLS) template, the first alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal DLS infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) material Li4MgGe2S7 was rationally designed and fabricated. This work enriches the diversity of DLS compounds, and opens an avenue for the design and exploration of new infrared NLO materials with excellent NLO properties, as outlined by Shilie Pan, Junjie Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202107613).

         <title>Radical Bridged Ln4 Metallocene Complexes with Strong Magnetic Coupling and Large Coercive Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing magnetic coupling in 4f&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule magnets is an ongoing challenge. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202110813), Akseli Mansikkam&#228;ki, Muralee Murugesu and co&#8208;workers have incorporated highly delocalized tetrazinyl radicals to bridge 4f metallocenes, forming tetranuclear complexes. A thorough examination of the magnetic properties and computational studies support a radical&#8208;induced &#8220;giant&#8208;spin&#8221; model with strong exchange interactions, zero&#8208;field SMM behaviour and a giant coercive field of 3&#8197;T.

         <dc:description>
Topochemical reactions are lattice&#8208;controlled reactions that occur in crystals or other confined media. However, only a handful of topochemical reactions are known so far. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202109344), K.&#8197;M. Sureshan and R. Khazeber report a new topochemical reaction: topochemical ene&#8211;azide cycloaddition reaction, in which a proximally placed azide and an alkene undergo a cycloaddition reaction to form triazoline in a regiospecific, stereospecific, and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal fashion.

         <title>Desolvation of peptide bond by O to S substitution impacts protein stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino acid side chains are key to fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment polarity in proteins composed of polar amide bonds. Here, we report that substituting an oxygen atom of the backbone amide bond with sulfur atom desolvates the thioamide bond, thereby increasing its lipophilicity. The impact of such local desolvation by O to S substitution in proteins was tested by synthesizing thioamidated variants of Pin1 WW domain. We observe that a thioamide acts in synergy with nonpolar amino acid side chains to reduce the microenvironment polarity and increase protein stability by more than 14 &#176;C. Through favorable van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions, this single atom substitution significantly stabilizes proteins without altering the amino acid sequence and structure of the native protein.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Dissociation of Carbon&#8208;Oxygen bonds in CO2 and CO on the Surface of LaCoSiHx Intermetallic Compound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In catalysis science, the electronic structure of the active site determines the structure&#8208;activity relationship of the catalyst to a large extent. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure has become a main route for the rational design of metal&#8208;based catalyst materials. In this work, we prepared a LaCoSiH  x  material that has more electronegativity and a lower workfunction than traditional supported Co&#8208;based catalysts. Using CO  2  methanation as a model catalytic reaction, the facile dissociation of CO  2  and CO (a key reaction intermediate) on the surface of the LaCoSiH  x  catalyst is observed by various experimental methods (e.g., in situ Raman and FTIR) at room temperature. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further show that LaCoSiH  x  has a much stronger capacity for carbon&#8208;oxygen bond activation than does the Co surface. The intrinsic mechanism is attributed to the marked electron transferring from catalysts into the antibonding orbital of CO  2  and CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards dendrite free potassium metal batteries: A rational design of multifunctional 3D polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;borax layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>K metal is optimal anode for K ion batteries because of its high capacity and low operating potential, but it suffers from fast capacity fading and safety issue due to unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and continuous K dendrite growth. Herein, to obtain promising potassium metal batteries, a 3D PVA&#8208;Borax layer is rational designed which enables a dendrite free K plating/stripping process. Such protective layer possesses good wettability, high K ionic diffusivity and good structural stability, which enables a &#8220;uniform and underneath plating&#8221; behavior, therefore exhibiting a stable electrochemical performance. As a result, Cu current collector with PVA&#8208;Borax (PVA&#8208;Borax@Cu) exhibits a stable cycling lifetime for 700 h at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  and 500 h at 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 10% depth of discharge (DOD) without dendrite formation. Even at a high utilization of 25% DOD and 50% DOD, the PVA&#8208;Borax@Cu shows a stable cycle for 180 h and 100 h, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical NO Reduction into NH3 by MoS2 Nanosheet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical reduction of NO not only offers an attractive alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for ambient NH  3  production but mitigates the human&#8208;caused unbalance of nitrogen cycle. Herein, we report that MoS  2  nanosheet on graphite felt (MoS  2  /GF) acts as an efficient and robust 3D electrocatalyst for NO&#8208;to&#8208;NH  3  conversion. In acidic electrolyte, such MoS  2  /GF attains a maximal Faradaic efficiency of 75.9% and a large NH  3  yield of up to 91 &#181;mol cm  &#8722;2  h  &#8722;1  . Using MoS  2  nanosheet&#8208;loaded carbon paper as the cathode, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device of Zn&#8211;NO battery was assembled to deliver a discharge power density of 1.04 mW cm  &#8722;2  and an NH  3  yield of 452 &#181;g h  &#8722;1  mg  cat.  &#8722;1  . Theoretical calculations reveal that the positively charged Mo&#8208;edge sites facilitate NO adsorption/activation via an &#8220;acceptance&#8208;donation&#8221; mechanism and unfavor the binding of protons and the coupling of N&#8208;N bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilizing Redox&#8208;Active Tricycloquinazoline into a 2D Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heteroaromatic&#8208;conjugated aromatic molecules have inspired numerous interests in rechargeable batteries like Li&#8208;ion batteries, but were limited by low conductivity and easy dissolution in electrolytes. Herein, we immobilize a nitrogen&#8208;rich aromatic molecule tricycloquinazoline (TQ) and CuO  4  unit into a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) to unlock their potential for Li  +  storage. TQ was identified redox activity with Li  +  for the first time. With a synergistic effect of TQ and CuO  4  unit, the 2D conductive MOF, named Cu&#8208;HHTQ (HHTQ = 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytricycloquinazoline), can facilitate the Li  +  /e  &#8208;  transport and ensure a resilient electrode, resulting in a high capacity of 657.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 600 mA g  &#8208;1  with extraordinary high&#8208;rate capability and impressive cyclability. Our findings highlight an efficient strategy of constructing electrode materials for energy storage with combining multiple redox&#8208;active moieties into conductive MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>An Overlooked Natural Hydrogen Evolution Pathway: Ni2+ Boosting H2O Reduction by Fe(OH)2 Oxidation during Low&#8208;temperature Serpentinization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural hydrogen (H 2  ) has gained considerable attentions as a renewable energy resource to mitigate the globally increasing environmental concerns. Low&#8208;temperature serpentinization (&lt; 200 &#176;  C) as a typical water&#8208;rock reaction is a major source of the natural H 2  . However, the reaction mechanism and the controlling step to product H 2  remained unclear, which hinders the further utilization of natural H 2  . Herein, we demonstrated that the H 2  production rate could be determined by the Fe(OH) 2  oxidation during low&#8208;temperature serpentinization. Moreover, the co&#8208;existence of Ni 2+  could largely enhance the H 2  production kinetics. With the addition of only 1 % Ni 2+  , the H 2  production rate was remarkably enhanced by about two orders of magnitude at 90 &#176;  C. D 2  O isotopic experiment and theoretical calculations revealed that the enhanced H 2  production kinetics could be attributed to the catalytic role of Ni 2+  to promote the reduction of H 2  O.</dc:description>

         <title>Stable super&#8208;resolution imaging of lipid droplet dynamics through a buffer strategy with a hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenic probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although super&#8208;resolution imaging offers an opportunity to visualize cellular structures and organelles at the nanoscale level, cellular heterogeneity and unpredictability still pose a significant challenge in the dynamic imaging of live cells. It is thus vital to develop better performing and more photostable probes for long&#8208;term super&#8208;resolution imaging. Herein, we report a probe  LD&#8208;FG  for imaging lipid droplet (LD) dynamics using structured illumination microscopy (SIM).  LD&#8208;FG  allows wash&#8208;free imaging of LDs, owing to hydrogen&#8208;bond sensitive fluorogenicity. The replenishment of photobleached  LD&#8208;FG  by intact ones outside LDs further ensure the long&#8208;time stability of the fluorescence imaging. With this buffering fluorogenic probe, fast and unpredictable dynamic processes of LDs can be visualized. Two LD coalescence modes (as well as heterogeneity in different regions of the cells and even in between different cells) were discovered for the first time. Notably, the dynamic imaging also allowed us to propose a new model of LD maturation during adipocyte differentiation,  i.e.  , a fast LD coalescence followed by a slow ripening step. The excellent performance of  LD&#8208;FG  makes the buffer strategy an effective method for designing fluorescent probes for cell dynamic imaging.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This study explores synthesis of new carbazole&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatics with interesting geometry and useful properties using Scholl reactions. As found from the Scholl reactions of substrates having two carbazole units linked at different positions through  o  &#8208;phenylene, oxidative coupling of carbazole units occured in a regioselective manner with new carbon&#8208;carbon bonds preferably formed at C&#8208;3 and C&#8208;4 in N&#8208;alkyl carbazole. A new N&#8208;containing aromatic bowl was characterized with single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, and new p&#8208;type organic semiconductors exhibited field effect mobility of up to 0.070 cm  2  /Vs in solution&#8208;processed thin film transistors.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Total Synthesis of Agarozizanol B via a Strained Photocascade Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prezizane&#8208;type sesquiterpene agarozizanol B was synthesized employing a photochemical cascade reaction as the key step. Starting from a readily available 1&#8208;indanone with a tethered olefin, a strained tetracyclic skeleton was assembled which contained all carbon atoms of the sesquiterpene with the correct relative configuration. The conversion into the tricyclic prezizane skeleton was accomplished by a strategic cyclopropane bond cleavage. Prior to the cyclopropane ring opening an adaption of the oxidation state was required, which could be combined with a reductive resolution step. After removal of two functional groups, the natural product was obtained both in racemic form or &#8211; if resolved &#8211; as the (+)&#8208;enantiomer which was shown to be identical to the natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Constructing a Carbon&#8208;Particle&#8208;Modified Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Enhancing the Efficiency of CO2 Electroreduction into Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the catalytic performance of MOFs in CO2RR, a strategy to introduce suitable precursor to in situ generate carbon nanoparticles was adopted. Introduced carbon nanoparticles serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in the framework, and sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy gives impetus to construct more effective catalysts for electroreduction of CO2.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 by metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has been widely investigated, but insufficient conductivity limits application. Herein, a porous 3D In&#8208;MOF {(Me2NH2)[In(BCP)]&#8901;2&#8201;DMF}n (V11) with good stability was constructed with two types of channels (1.6 and 1.2&#8197;nm diameter). V11 exhibits moderate catalytic activity in CO2 electroreduction with 76.0&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency for formate (FEHCOO&#8208;). Methylene blue molecules of suitable size and pyrolysis temperature were introduced and transformed into carbon particles (CPs) after calcination. The performance of the obtained CPs@V11 is significantly improved both in FEHCOO&#8208; (from 76.0&#8201;% to 90.1&#8201;%) and current density (2.2 times). Control experiments show that introduced CPs serve as accelerant to promote the charges and mass transfer in framework, and benefit to sufficiently expose active sites. This strategy can also work on other In&#8208;MOFs, demonstrating the universality of this method for electroreduction of CO2.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Nickel&#8208;Based Electrodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both theoretical simulations and in&#8197;situ experiments demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode and improves the seawater oxidation stability.







Abstract
Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and in situ experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion. The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ca. 5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.
