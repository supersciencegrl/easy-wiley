         <title>Electrolyte Engineering to Construct Robust Interphase with High Ionic Conductivity for Wide Temperature Range Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unstable interphase formed in conventional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes significantly hinders the widespread application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high&#8208;capacity nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811) over a wide temperature range. To balance ion transport kinetics and interfacial stability over wide temperature range, herein a bifunctional electrolyte (EAFP) tailoring the electrode/electrolyte interphase with 1,3&#8208;propanesultone as an additive was developed. The resulting cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase with an inorganic inner layer and an organic outer layer possesses high mechanical stability and flexibility, alleviating stress accumulation and maintaining the structural integrity of the NCM811 cathode. Meanwhile, the inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase inhibits electrolyte side reactions and facilitates fast Li+ transport. As a result, the Li||Li cells exhibit stable performance in extensive temperatures with low overpotentials, especially achieving a long lifespan of 1000 h at 30 &#176;C. Furthermore, the optimized EAFP is also suitable for LiFePO4 and LiCO2 cathodes (1000 cycles, retention: 67%). The Li||NCM811 and graphite||NCM811 pouch cells with lean electrolyte (g/Ah grade) operate stably, verifying the broad electrode compatibility of EAFP. Notably, the Li||NCM811 cells can operate in wide climate range from &#8208;40 &#176;C to 60 &#176;C. This work establishes new guidelines for the regulation of interphase by electrolytes in all&#8208;weather LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Polyphenol Oxidase Activity on Guaiacyl and Syringyl Lignin Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin&#8208;derived guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds into methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols through oxidative ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation reactions catalyzed by novel fungal polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) is presented. The formation of o&#8208;diphenols rather than reactive quinones can be steered by the addition of a reductant. These PPOs offer new methods to reduce the heterogeneity of G and S lignin&#8208;derived product mixtures.







Abstract
The natural heterogeneity of guaiacyl (G) and syringyl (S) compounds resulting from lignin processing hampers their direct use as plant&#8208;based chemicals and materials. Herein, we explore six short polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from lignocellulose&#8208;degrading ascomycetes for their capacity to react with G&#8208;type and S&#8208;type phenolic compounds. All six PPOs catalyze the ortho&#8208;hydroxylation of G&#8208;type compounds (guaiacol, vanillic acid, and ferulic acid), forming the corresponding methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Remarkably, a subset of these PPOs is also active towards S&#8208;compounds (syringol, syringic acid, and sinapic acid) resulting in identical methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols. Assays with 18O2 demonstrate that these PPOs in particular catalyze ortho&#8208;hydroxylation and ortho&#8208;demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds and generate methanol as a co&#8208;product. Oxidative (ortho&#8722;) demethoxylation of S&#8208;compounds is a novel reaction for PPOs, which we propose occurs by a distinct reaction mechanism as compared to aryl&#8208;O&#8208;demethylases. We further show that addition of a reducing agent can steer the PPO reaction to form methoxy&#8208;ortho&#8208;diphenols from both G&#8208; and S&#8208;type substrates rather than reactive quinones that lead to unfavorable polymerization. Application of PPOs opens for new routes to reduce the heterogeneity and methoxylation degree of mixtures of G and S lignin&#8208;derived compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Synthesis of Glycine from Methanol and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report a novel photocatalytic system for the synthesis of glycine directly from methanol and nitrate. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles show a high glycine photosynthesis rate under mild conditions. The success of this work provides a sustainable pathway for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste.







Abstract
Photocatalytic utilization of methanol and nitrate as carbon and nitrogen sources for the direct synthesis of amino acids could provide a sustainable way for the valorization of green &#8220;liquid sunlight&#8221; and nitrate waste. In this study, we develop an efficient photochemical method to synthesize glycine directly from methanol and nitrate, which cascades the C&#8722;C coupling to form glycol, nitrate reduction to NH3, and finally C&#8722;N coupling to generate glycine. Interestingly, the involved photocatalytic tandem reactions show a synergistic effect, in which the presence of nitrate is the dominant factor to enable the overall reaction and reach high synthetic efficiency. Ba2+&#8722;TiO2 nanoparticles are confirmed as a feasible and efficient catalyst system for the photosynthesis of glycine with a remarkable glycine photosynthesis rate of 870&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under optimal conditions. This work establishes a novel catalytic system for amino acid synthesis from methanol and nitrate under mild conditions. These results also allow us to further suppose the formation pathways of amino acids on the primitive earth, as an extension to proposals based on the Miller&#8208;Urey experiments.

Exchanging a sulfur atom against a methine group in a series of azaacene based diradicals furnishes non&#8208;Kekul&#233;, meta&#8208;quinodimethane based diradicals with singlet ground states and small singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Zwitterionic contributions are ruled out experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically, and the diradicals display huge two&#8208;photon cross sections in the infrared spectral region.







Abstract
Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; quinoidal azaacences m&#8208;A (1&#8201;a,b) were synthesized and compared to their para&#8208; and ortho&#8208;quinodimethane analogues. m&#8208;A display high diradical characters (1&#8201;b: y0 = 0.88) due to their meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) topology. Electron paramagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and supraquantum interference device measurements in combination with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations revealed singlet ground states for m&#8208;A with singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST (0.13&#8211;0.25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and thermally populated triplet states. These non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structures are over all void of zwitterionic character and possess record high two&#8208;photon absorption cross sections over a broad spectral range in the near&#8208;infrared.

         <title>Intracellular Gold Nanocluster/Organic Semiconductor Heterostructure for Enhancing Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small heterostructures (AuNCs@OFTF) with amphiphilicity were developed. They can be rapidly internalized in cyanobacteria and provide a programmable electronic interface, where the strong energetic coupling accelerates electron transfer in living cyanobacteria. Exogenous photogenerated electrons from AuNCs@OFTF enable a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent and enhance biomass production of cyanobacteria.







Abstract
Photosynthetic microorganisms, which rely on light&#8208;driven electron transfer, store solar energy in self&#8208;energy carriers and convert it into bioenergy. Although these microorganisms can operate light&#8208;induced charge separation with nearly 100&#8201;% quantum efficiency, their practical applications are inherently limited by the photosynthetic energy conversion efficiency. Artificial semiconductors can induce an electronic response to photoexcitation, providing additional excited electrons for natural photosynthesis to improve solar conversion efficiency. However, challenges remain in importing exogenous electrons across cell membranes. In this work, we have developed an engineered gold nanocluster/organic semiconductor heterostructure (AuNCs@OFTF) to couple the intracellular electron transport chain of living cyanobacteria. AuNCs@OFTF exhibits a prolonged excited state lifetime and effective charge separation. The internalized AuNCs@OFTF permits its photogenerated electrons to participate in the downstream of photosystem II and construct an oriented electronic highway, which enables a five&#8208;fold increase in photocurrent in living cyanobacteria. Moreover, the binding events of AuNCs@OFTF established an abiotic&#8208;biotic electronic interface at the thylakoid membrane to enhance electron flux and finally furnished nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Thus, AuNCs@OFTF can be exploited to spatiotemporally manipulate and enhance the solar conversion of living cyanobacteria in cells, providing an extended nanotechnology for re&#8208;engineering photosynthetic pathways.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Formal (3+2) Cycloadditions of Bicyclobutanes with Imines: Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc Lewis acid catalyzes asymmetric (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines to afford aza&#8208;BCHs bearing &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers in high yields and er values. Expeirmental studies and DFT calculations provide mechanistic insight.







Abstract
The cycloaddition reaction involving bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) offers a versatile and efficient synthetic platform for producing C(sp3)&#8208;rich rigid bridged ring scaffolds, which act as phenyl bioisosteres. However, there is a scarcity of catalytic asymmetric cycloadditions of BCBs to fulfill the need for enantioenriched saturated bicycles in drug design and development. In this study, an efficient synthesis of valuable azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (aza&#8208;BCHs) by an enantioselective zinc&#8208;catalyzed (3+2) cycloadditions of BCBs with imines is reported. The reaction proceeds effectively with a novel type of BCB that incorporates a 2&#8208;acyl imidazole group and a diverse array of alkynyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted imines. The target aza&#8208;BCHs, which consist of &#945;&#8208;chiral amine fragments and two quaternary carbon centers, are efficiently synthesized with up to 94&#8201;%&#8197;and 96.5:3.5 er under mild conditions. Experimental and computational studies reveal that the reaction follows a concerted nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening mechanism of BCBs with imines. This mechanism is distinct from previous studies on Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed cycloadditions of BCBs.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles via Hydroborative Cleavage of C&#8722;N Bonds&#8212;Scope, Mechanism, and Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of aromatic heterocycles via hydroborative cleavage of C&#8722;N bonds is reported. Structurally diverse products, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more were readily obtained. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed an interesting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon, including &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles was studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.







Abstract
Skeletal editing of the core structure of heterocycles offers new opportunities for chemical construction and is a promising yet challenging research topic that has recently gained increasing interest. However, several limitations of the reported systems remain to be addressed. For example, the reagents employed are generally in high&#8208;energy, such as chlorocarbene precursors, nitrene species, and metal carbenes, which are also associated with low atomic efficiencies. Thus, the development of simple systems for the skeletal editing of heterocycles is still desired. Herein, a straightforward and facile BH3&#8208;mediated skeletal editing of readily available indoles, benzimidazoles, and several other aromatic heterocycles is reported. Structurally diverse products were readily obtained, including tetrahydrobenzo azaborinines, diazaboroles, O&#8208;anilinophenylethyl alcohols, benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines, and more. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed a BH3&#8208;induced C&#8722;N bond cleavage reaction pathway. An exciting and counterintuitive indole hydroboration phenomenon of &#8722;BH2 shift from C3&#8208;position to C2&#8208;position was disclosed. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the synthesized diazaboroles were studied, and an interestingly and pronounced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior was disclosed.

         <title>Peptide Degrader&#8208;Based Targeting of METTL3/14 Improves Immunotherapy Response in Cutaneous Melanoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study unveils METTL3&#8217;s oncogenic role in melanoma. RM3, a designed peptide inhibitor disrupting METTL3/14 complex, induces proteasomal degradation via STUB1. RM3 reduces melanoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, RM3 elicits significantly enhanced tumor response in vivo, with a favorable safety profile.







Abstract
METTL3 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment, although its oncogenic functions in melanoma development and potential for therapeutic targeting drug have not been fully explored. In this study, we define the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma development and progression. Building on this insight, we examine our recently designed peptide inhibitor RM3, which targets the binding interface of METTL3/14 complex for disruption and subsequent ubiquitin&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation via the E3 ligase STUB1. RM3 treatment reduces proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induces apoptosis in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis identified changes in immuno&#8208;related genes following RM3&#8208;mediated suppression of METTL3/14 N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase activity, suggesting a potential for interaction with immunotherapy. A combination treatment of RM3 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in significantly higher beneficial tumor response in vivo, with a good safety profile. Collectively, these findings not only delineate the oncogenic role of METTL3 in melanoma but also showcase RM3, acting as a peptide degrader, as a novel and promising strategy for melanoma treatment.

         <title>Isothiourea&#8208;Catalysed Acylative Kinetic Resolution of Tertiary Pyrazolone Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly selective acylative kinetic resolution of racemic pyrazolone tertiary alcohols catalysed by chiral isothioureas is described (s=&gt;100 in &gt;25 examples). This method was applied to highly functionalised pharmaceutically derived compounds, demonstrated at a decagram scale, and at ppm catalyst loading with DFT analysis indicating an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction key to enantiorecognition.







Abstract
The development of methods for the selective acylative kinetic resolution (KR) of tertiary alcohols is a recognised synthetic challenge with relatively few successful substrate classes reported to date. In this manuscript, a highly enantioselective isothiourea&#8208;catalysed acylative KR of tertiary pyrazolone alcohols is reported. The scope and limitations of this methodology have been developed, with high selectivity observed across a broad range of substrate derivatives incorporating varying substitution at N(2)&#8208;, C(4)&#8208; and C(5)&#8208;, as well as bicyclic constraints within the pyrazolone scaffold (30 examples, selectivity factors (s) typically &gt;100) at generally low catalyst loadings (1&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The application of this KR method to tertiary alcohols derived directly from a natural product (geraniol), alongside pharmaceutically relevant drug compounds (indomethacin, gemfibrozil and probenecid), with high efficiency (s &gt;100) is also described. The KR process is readily amenable to scale up using bench grade solvents and reagents, with effective resolution on a 50&#8197;g (0.22&#8197;mol) scale demonstrated. The key structural motif leading to excellent selectivity in this KR process has been probed through computation, with an NC=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;isothiouronium interaction from substrate to acylated catalyst observed within the favoured transition state. Similarly, the effect of C(5)&#8208;aryl substitution that leads to reduced experimental selectivity is probed, with a competitive &#960;&#8211;isothiouronium interaction identified as leading to reduced selectivity.

         <title>Simultaneously Strengthening and Toughening All&#8208;Natural Structural Materials via 3D Nanofiber Network Interfacial Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial interlocking structure is designed by introducing protonated chitosan (CS) at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose (BC). This interfacial structure provides enough physical contact sites for hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. The obtained structural material shows better environmental friendliness and mechanical and thermal properties than engineering plastics.







Abstract
Constructing structural materials from sustainable raw materials is considered an efficient way to reduce the potential threat posed by plastics. Nevertheless, challenges remain regarding combining excellent mechanical and thermal properties, especially the balance of strength and toughness. Here, we report a 3D nanofiber network interfacial design strategy to strengthen and toughen all&#8208;natural structural materials simultaneously. The introduced protonated chitosan at the interface between the surface oxidized 3D nanonetwork of bacterial cellulose forms the interfacial interlocking structure of nanonetworks, achieving a robust physical connection and providing enough physical contact sites for chemical crosslinking. The obtained sustainable structural material successfully integrates excellent mechanical and thermal properties on the nanoscale of cellulose nanofibers, such as light weight, high strength, and superior thermal expansion coefficient. The relationship between structural design and comprehensive mechanical property improvement is analyzed in detail, providing a universal perspective to design sustainable high&#8208;performance structural materials from nanoscale building blocks.

         <title>P&#8208;doped RuSe2 on Porous N&#8208;Doped Carbon Matrix as Catalysts for Accelerated Sulfur Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2 (P&#8208;RuSe2) with&#160;the enhanced conductivity and the modulation of the d&#8208;band center is engineered via a rational screening strategy, which augments its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs and hence exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance in terms of high capacity, superior rate capability and stable cycle life.







Abstract
Monocomponent catalysts exhibit the limited catalytic conversion of polysulfides due to their intrinsic electronic structure, but their catalytic activity can be improved by introducing heteroatoms to regulate its electronic structure. However, the rational selection principles of doping elements remain unclear. Here, we are guided by theoretical calculations to select the suitable doping elements based on the balanced relationship between the adsorption strength of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and catalytic activity of lithium sulfide. We apply the screening method to develop a new catalyst of phosphorus doped RuSe2, manifesting the further enhanced conductivity compared with original RuSe2, facilitating charge transfer and further modulating the d&#8208;band center of RuSe2, thereby augmenting its effectiveness in interacting with LiPSs. Consequently, the assembled cell exhibits an areal capacity of 7.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2, even under high sulfur loading of 8.0&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a lean electrolyte condition (5.0&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1). This rational screening strategy offers a robust solution for the design of advanced catalysts in the field of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries and potentially other domains as well.

         <title>Configurational Isomerization&#8208;Induced Orientation Switching: Non&#8208;Fused Ring Dipodal Phosphonic Acids as Hole&#8208;Extraction Layers for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids, characterized by non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchors, are developed and used as hole&#8208;extraction layers in organic solar cells. Such simple and tailorable backbones offer a novel platform to study structural effect on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on ITO, which leads to an impressive performance of 19.66&#8201;% owing to optimized interfacial contact and active layer morphology.







Abstract
Phosphonic acid (PA) self&#8208;assembled molecules have recently emerged as efficient hole&#8208;extraction layers (HELs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the structural effects of PAs on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors on indium tin oxide (ITO) and thus photovoltaic performance remain obscure. Herein, we present a novel class of PAs, namely &#8220;non&#8208;fused ring dipodal phosphonic acids&#8221; (NFR&#8208;DPAs), featuring simple and malleable non&#8208;fused ring backbones and dipodal phosphonic acid anchoring groups. The efficacy of configurational isomerism in modulating the photoelectronic properties and switching molecular orientation of PAs atop electrodes results in distinct substrate surface energy and electronic characteristics. The NFR&#8208;DPA with linear (C2h symmetry) and brominated backbone exhibits favorable face&#8208;on orientation and enhanced work function modification capability compared to its angular (C2v symmetry) and non&#8208;brominated counterparts. This makes it versatile HELs in mitigating interfacial resistance for energy barrier&#8208;free hole collection, and affording optimal active layer morphology, which results in an impressive efficiency of 19.11&#8201;% with a low voltage loss of 0.52&#8197;V for binary OSC devices and an excellent efficiency of 19.66&#8201;% for ternary OSC devices. This study presents a new dimension to design PA&#8208;based HELs for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

A putative &#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenase from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, was functionally characterized and explored as biocatalyst for C&#8722;H oxidation. AneA exhibits broad substrate promiscuity and is capable of both hydroxylation and desaturation depending on its substrate structure. The utility of the biocatalytic reaction was demonstrated in several oxidative desymmetrizations and in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex sesquiterpenoids.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8722;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;A putative &#945;-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, was functionally characterized and explored as biocatalyst for C&#8722;H oxidation. AneA exhibits broad substrate promiscuity and is capable of both hydroxylation and desaturation depending on its substrate structure. The utility of the biocatalytic reaction was demonstrated in several oxidative desymmetrizations and in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of complex sesquiterpenoids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (&#945;KGDs) have recently emerged as useful biocatalysts for C&#8722;H oxidation and functionalization. In this work, we characterized a new &#945;KGD from aculene biosynthesis, AneA, which displays broad promiscuity toward a number of substrates with different ring systems. Unexpectedly, AneA was found to be capable of both desaturation and hydroxylation and require an amino ester motif on its substrate for productive catalysis. Insights gathered from the functional characterization and substrate-activity profiling of AneA enabled the development of a chemoenzymatic strategy toward several complex sesquiterpenoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Dissipative Assembly with Switchable Biological Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A switchable non&#8208;equilibrium dissipative assembly promoting fibroblast adhesion/proliferation and efficient drug delivery was developed using chemical fuel. Nanofibers acted as chiral hydrogel scaffolds for cell adhesion and drug reservoirs. This system transitions between nanofiber and nanospherical forms, enabling targeted drug delivery and recovery, highlighting its scientific significance.







Abstract
Natural dissipative assembly (DSA) often exhibit energy&#8208;driven shifts in natural functions. However, creating man&#8208;made DSA that can mimic such biological activities transformation remains relatively rare. Herein, we introduce a cytomembrane&#8208;like dissipative assembly system based on chiral supramolecules. This system employs benzoyl cysteine in an out of equilibrium manner, enabling the shifts in biofunctions while minimizing material use. Specifically, aroyl&#8208;cystine derivatives primarily assemble into stable M&#8208;helix nanofibers under equilibrium conditions. These nanofibers enhance fibroblast adhesion and proliferation through stereospecific interactions with chiral cellular membranes. Upon the addition of chemical fuels, these functional nanofibers temporarily transform into non&#8208;equilibrium nanospheres, facilitating efficient drug delivery. Subsequently, these nanospheres revert to their original nanofiber state, effectively recycling the drug. The programmable function&#8208;shifting ability of this DSA establishes it as a novel, fuel&#8208;driven drug delivery vehicle. And the bioactive DSA not only addresses a gap in synthetic DSAs within biological applications but also sets the stage for innovative designs of &#8242;living&#8242; materials.

         <title>Gas Tunnel Engineering of Prolyl Hydroxylase Reprograms Hypoxia Signaling in Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gas tunnel of PHD2, an iron&#8208;based O2 sensing enzyme, is engineered using a computation&#8208;guided rational design approach. The engineered mutants exhibit an increased rate of gas transport to the active site, along with increased catalytic activity in vitro. These mutants also display enhanced intracellular activity demonstrating the ability to reprogram hypoxia signaling by activating PHD2.







Abstract
Cells have evolved intricate mechanisms for recognizing and responding to changes in oxygen (O2) concentrations. Here, we have reprogrammed cellular hypoxia (low O2) signaling via gas tunnel engineering of prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), a non&#8208;heme iron dependent O2 sensor. Using computational modeling and protein engineering techniques, we identify a gas tunnel and critical residues therein that limit the flow of O2 to PHD2&#8217;s catalytic core. We show that systematic modification of these residues can open the constriction topology of PHD2&#8217;s gas tunnel. Using kinetic stopped&#8208;flow measurements with NO as a surrogate diatomic gas, we demonstrate up to 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in its association rate to the iron center of tunnel&#8208;engineered mutants. Our most effectively designed mutant displays 9&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM=830&#177;40&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) in hydroxylating a peptide mimic of hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF&#8208;1&#945;, as compared to WT PHD2 (kcat/KM=90&#177;9&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Furthermore, transfection of plasmids that express designed PHD2 mutants in HEK&#8208;293T mammalian cells reveal significant reduction of HIF&#8208;1&#945; and downstream hypoxia response transcripts under hypoxic conditions of 1&#8201;% O2. Overall, these studies highlight activation of PHD2 as a new pathway to reprogram hypoxia responses and HIF signaling in cells.

         <title>Azobenzene&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Alkaline Water: One Atom Makes a Significant Improvement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoactive azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) shows an excellent photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than its corresponding imine&#8208;linked 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), although only one atom is different in the two 2D COFs (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;). COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits much narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity, which is benefited from its azo linkages.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been demonstrated as promising photocatalysts for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, the construction of COFs with new active sites, high photoactivity, and wide&#8208;range light absorption for efficient H2O2 production remains challenging. Herein, we present the synthesis of a novel azobenzene&#8208;bridged 2D COF (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo) with excellent performance on photocatalytic H2O2 production under alkaline conditions. Notably, although COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo differs by only one atom (&#8722;N=N&#8722; vs. &#8722;C=N&#8722;) from its corresponding imine&#8208;linked counterpart (COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA), COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo exhibits a significantly narrower band gap, enhanced charge transport, and prompted photoactivity. Remarkably, when employed as a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst, COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;Azo achieves a high photocatalytic H2O2 production rate up to 1498&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at pH = 11, which is 7.9&#8197;times higher than that of COF&#8208;TPT&#8208;TPA. Further density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the &#8722;N=N&#8722; linkages are the active sites for photocatalysis. This work provides new prospects for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Scalable Production of Thin and Durable Practical Li Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se anode with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties was achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The Li/Mo/Li2Se demonstrates ultrahigh&#8208;rate performance and ultralong&#8208;lifespan cycling sustainability. The Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability with a superior energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 even under the harsh cycling conditions.







Abstract
Utilization of thin Li metal is the ultimate pathway to achieving practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries (LMBs), but its practical implementation has been significantly impeded by formidable challenges of poor thinning processability, severe interphase instability and notorious dendritic Li growth. Here we report a practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li2Se with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties, achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The in situ generated Li2Se and Mo not only enhance the mechanical strength enabling the scalable fabrication of thin Li metal, but also promote homogeneous Li electrodeposition.

&lt;p&gt;A practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se anode with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties was achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilization of thin Li metal is the ultimate pathway to achieving practical high-energy-density Li metal batteries (LMBs), but its practical implementation has been significantly impeded by formidable challenges of poor thinning processability, severe interphase instability and notorious dendritic Li growth. Here we report a practical thin (10&#8211;40&#8197;&#956;m) Li/Mo/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se with concurrently modulated interphase and mechanical properties, achieved via a scalable mechanical rolling process. The in situ generated Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se and Mo not only enhance the mechanical strength enabling the scalable fabrication of thin Li metal, but also promote homogeneous Li electrodeposition. Significantly, the Li/Mo/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se demonstrates ultrahigh-rate performance (15&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultralong-lifespan cycling sustainability (2700&#8197;cycles) with exceptional anti-pulverization capability. The Li|LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cells show substantially prolonged cyclability over 1200&#8197;cycles with an ultralow decay rate of ~0.01&#8201;% per cycle. Moreover, the Li|LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cells deliver enhanced cycling stability even under the extremely harsh conditions of low negative-to-positive-capacity (N/P) ratio of ~1.2 and lean electrolyte of ~0.95&#8197;g&#8201;Ah&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, showing an exceptional energy density of 329.2&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Multifunctional Modification of the Buried Interface in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulating the buried interface is crucial for perovskite crystallization and charge transport. An innovative approach, using hydroxylamine salts for interface modification precisely anchors perovskite ions, promoting controlled crystal growth. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and long&#8208;term stability of Sn&#8722;Pb perovskite solar cells, critical for future development of all&#8208;perovskite tandems.







Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead perovskite solar cells can reach band gaps as low as 1.2&#8197;eV, offering high theoretical efficiency and serving as base materials for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, instability and high defect densities at the interfaces, particularly the buried surface, have limited performance improvements. In this work, we present the modification of the bottom perovskite interface with multifunctional hydroxylamine salts. These salts can effectively coordinate the different perovskite components, having critical influences in regulating the crystallization process and passivating defects of varying nature. The surface modification reduced traps at the interface and prevented the formation of excessive lead iodide, enhancing the quality of the films. The modified devices presented fill factors reaching 81&#8201;% and efficiencies of up to 23.8&#8201;%. The unencapsulated modified devices maintained over 95&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8197;h of shelf storage.

         <title>Fused Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Porphyrin Conjugates with Tailorable Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes</title>

The synthesis of three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates is presented. By connecting the aromatic systems of the macrocycles via 5&#8208;membered rings under standard Scholl conditions, the formation of highly soluble and stable &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins is achieved. The described planarization led to significant alterations regarding the photophysical and optoelectronic characteristics of the molecules.







Abstract
A new clear&#8208;cut strategy for fusing N&#8208;heterocyclic and carbon&#8208;pure systems is introduced en route to a versatile platform of multi&#8208;purpose tetrapyrrolic chromophores. In particular, three novel C&#8722;C bond&#8208;fused porphyrin&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) conjugates were synthesized under oxidative cyclodehydrogenation conditions, starting from tailor&#8208;made nickel porphyrin precursors. The fusion of the individual aromatic systems via 5&#8208;membered rings led to highly soluble &#960;&#8208;extended porphyrins in excellent yields. The resulting porphyrin&#8208;HBC conjugates exhibit absorption cross&#8208;sections that are of interdisciplinary interest in the ever&#8208;growing field of organic photovoltaics and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes. Quantum chemical calculations show that the newly formed 5&#8208;membered rings induce biradicaloid character in the porphyrin core, which has a strong impact on excited state lifetimes. This is confirmed by a thorough optoelectronic and time&#8208;resolved characterization in order to understand these unique features better. Broadened absorption characteristics go hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with short&#8208;lived excited states with up to six orders of magnitude faster decay rates.

         <title>S&#8722;S Bond Strategy at Sulfide Heterointerface: Reversing Charge Transfer and Constructing Hydrogen Spillover for Boosted Hydrogen Evolution</title>

RuSx/NbS2 heterostructure was synthesized by the introducing of amorphous RuSx onto crystalline NbS2 surface. It shows a Pt&#8208;like HER activity with a low overpotential as 38&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which is mainly benefit from hydrogen spillover caused by reversing charge transfer that induced by S&#8722;S bonds at RuSx/NbS2 heterointerface.







Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalyst in sulfides for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) still poses challenges due to the lack of understanding the role of sulfide heterointerface. Here, we report a sulfide heterostructure RuSx/NbS2, which is composed of 3R&#8208;type NbS2 loaded by amorphous RuSx nanoparticles with S&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface. As HER electrocatalyst, the RuSx/NbS2 shows remarkable low overpotential of 38&#8197;mV to drive a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acid, and also low Tafel slope of 51.05&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The intrinsic activity of RuSx/NbS2 is much higher than that of Ru/NbS2 reference as well as the commercial Pt/C. Both experiments and theoretical calculations unveil a reversed charge transfer at the interface from NbS2 to RuSx that driven by the formation of S&#8722;S bonds, resulting in electron&#8208;rich Ru configuration for strong hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, electronic redistribution induced by the sulfide heterostructure facilitates hydrogen spillover (HSo) effect in this system, leading to accelerated hydrogen desorption at the basal plane of NbS2. This study provides an effective S&#8722;S bond strategy in sulfide heterostructure to synergistically modulate the charge transfer and adsorption thermodynamics, which is very valuable for the development of efficient electrocatalysts in practical applications.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Promoted Interatomic Hot Carriers Regulation Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LSPR effect can efficiently promote interatomic transfer of plasmon hot carriers and the extra hot electrons transferred on Cu atoms from Au atoms effectively enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, thereby accelerating the ENRR. This study provides an important reference for understanding the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of alloy heterogeneous nanostructure.







Abstract
Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmon&#8208;mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field.

&lt;p&gt;The LSPR effect can efficiently promote interatomic transfer of plasmon hot carriers and the extra hot electrons transferred on Cu atoms from Au atoms effectively enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, thereby accelerating the ENRR. This study provides an important reference for understanding the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of alloy heterogeneous nanostructure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing hot carriers for efficient plasmon-mediated chemical reactions (PMCRs) to convert solar energy into secondary energy is one of the most feasible solutions to the global environmental and energy crisis. Finding a plasmonic heterogeneous nanostructure with a more efficient and reasonable hot carrier transport path without affecting the intrinsic plasmonic properties is still a major challenge that urgently needs to be solved in this field. Herein, the mechanism by which plasmon-promoted interatomic hot electron redistribution on the surface of Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu alloy nanoparticles promotes the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is successfully clarified. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect can boost the transfer of plasmon hot electrons from Au atoms to Cu atoms, trigger the interatomic electron regulation of Au&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu alloy nanoparticles, enhance the desorption of ammonia molecules, and increase the ammonia yield by approximately 93.9&#8201;%. This work provides an important reference for rationally designing and utilizing the LSPR effect to efficiently regulate the distribution and mechanism of plasmon hot carriers on the surface of heterogeneous alloy nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Dispersed Pd@ZIF&#8208;8&#8201;for Photo&#8208;Assisted Cross&#8208;Couplings and CO2 to Methanol: Activity and Selectivity Insights</title>

A commercially available ZIF&#8208;8 metal&#8211;organic framework (ZIF&#8208;8) was used to deposit palladium, demonstrating excellent performance in photocatalysis and thermal CO2 hydrogenation to methanol reactions under various pre&#8208;treatment conditions.







Abstract
Our study unveils a pioneering methodology that effectively distributes Pd species within a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8). We demonstrate that Pd can be encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 as atomically dispersed Pd species that function as an excited&#8208;state transition metal catalyst for promoting carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8722;C) cross&#8208;couplings at room temperature using visible light as the driving force. Furthermore, the same material can be reduced at 250&#8201;&#176;C, forming Pd metal nanoparticles encapsulated in ZIF&#8208;8. This catalyst shows high rates and selectivity for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol under industrially relevant conditions (250&#8201;&#176;C, 50&#8197;bar): 7.46&#8197;molmethanol&#8201;molmetal&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and &gt;99&#8201;%. Our results demonstrate the correlations of the catalyst structure with the performances at experimental and theoretical levels.

         <title>The Fate of the Formic Acid Proton on the Anatase TiO2(101) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High vacuum FTIR experiments at temperatures as low as 13&#8197;K, together with divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical and path integral molecular dynamics simulations, indicate that a short and strong hydrogen bond is formed during the adsorption of HCOOH on the anatase (101) TiO2 surface. Such unusual H&#8208;bond has previously escaped direct spectral detection because of a huge red shift of its vibrational frequency.







Abstract
As a prototype adsorption reaction of gas Br&#248;nsted acid on oxides, we study the adsorption of formic acid on anatase. We perform infrared spectroscopy measurements of adsorbed HCOOH and HCOOD on TiO2 nanopowders, from 13&#8197;K up to room temperature in an ultra&#8208;high vacuum chamber. We assign the IR signals via computed spectra from nuclear quantum dynamics simulations using our divide&#8208;and&#8208;conquer semiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics method. The acid proton forms an extraordinarily short and strong hydrogen bond with the surface oxygen. The strength of this hydrogen bond, that compares to H bonds in ice at high pressures, is at the root of a substantial redshift with respect to the typical free OH stretching frequency, which eludes its straightforward detection.

         <title>Rationalizing Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction over IrO2: Essential Role of Hydronium Cation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydronium cation (H3O+) was found to be critical to regulating the observed behaviors of IrO2 during acidic oxygen evolution reaction. The H3O+ cation induced an internal electric field at the interface, enabling selective bond&#8208;tuning to the reaction intermediates. As a result, 0.5&#8197;monolayer of *OH species was stabilized under OER operational condition, and the overall conversion was revealed to be hindered by *OH&#8594;*O.







Abstract
The development of active, stable, and more affordable electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great importance for the practical application of electrolyzers and the advancement of renewable energy conversion technologies. Currently, IrO2 is the only catalyst with high stability and activity, but a high cost. Further optimization of the catalyst is limited by the lack of understanding of catalytic behaviors at the acid&#8208;IrO2 interface. Here, in strong interaction with the experiment, we develop an explicit model based on grand&#8208;canonical density function theory (GC&#8208;DFT) calculations to describe acidic OER over IrO2. Compared to the explicit models reported previously, hydronium cations (H3O+) are introduced at the electrochemical interface in the current model. As a result, a variation in stable IrO2 surface configuration under the OER operating condition from previously proposed complete *O&#8208;coverage to a mixture coverage of *OH and *O is revealed, which is well supported by in situ Raman measurements. In addition, the accuracy of predicted overpotential is increased in comparison with the experimentally measured. More importantly, an alteration of the potential limiting step from previously identified *O&#8594;*OOH to *OH&#8594;*O is observed, which opens new opportunities to advance the IrO2&#8208;based catalysts for acidic OER.

         <title>Enantioconvergent and Site&#8208;Selective Etherification of Carbohydrate Polyols through Chiral Copper Radical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing a chiral radical copper catalytic system, the challenging enantioconvergent and site&#8208;selective etherification of carbohydrate polyols is achieved. Besides being broadly applicable over a considerable range of sugars, multiple dimensions of stereocontrol can be tackled simultaneously. Remarkably, when anomeric unprotected reducing sugars were employed, dynamic kinetic resolution is further activated to achieve &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation.







Abstract
Going beyond currently reported two electron transformations that formed the core backdrop of asymmetric catalytic site&#8208;selective carbohydrate polyol functionalizations, we herein report a seminal demonstration of an enantioconvergent copper catalyzed site&#8208;selective etherification of minimally protected saccharides through a single&#8208;electron radical pathway. Further, this strategy paves a rare strategy, through which a carboxamide scaffold that is present in some glycomimetics of pharmacological relevance, can be selectively introduced. In light of the burgeoning interest in chiral radical catalysis, and the virtual absence of such stereocontrol broadly in carbohydrate synthesis, our strategy showcased the unknown capability of chiral radical copper catalysis as a contemporary tool to address the formidable site&#8208;selectivity challenge on a remarkable palette of naturally occurring saccharides. When reducing sugars were employed, a further dynamic kinetic resolution type glycosylation can be activated by the catalytic system to selectively generate the challenging &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosides.

         <title>Enhanced Charge&#8208;Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Photoelectrochemical Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Conversion on Antimony Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocathodes</title>

This work integrates a CuSn alloy&#8208;modified CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode for efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. The photocathode possesses an excellent onset potential of 0.62&#8197;VRHE, achieves the highest ammonia Faraday efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% with a yields up to 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE. The excellent charge carrier kinetics and moderate NO2&#8722; adsorption provide an effective strategy for achieving stable and efficient photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis.







Abstract
The photoelectrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia (PEC NO3RR) has emerged as a promising pathway for facilitating the natural nitrogen cycle. The PEC NO3RR can lower the reduction potential needed for ammonia synthesis through photogenerated voltage, showcasing the significant potential for merging abundant solar energy with sustainable nitrogen fixation. However, it is influenced by the selective photocathodes with poor carrier kinetics, low catalytic selectivity, and ammonia yields. There are few reports on suitable photoelectrodes owning efficient charge transport on PEC NO3RR at low overpotentials. Herein, we rationally constructed the CuSn alloy co&#8208;catalysts on the antimony sulfides with a highly selective PEC ammonia and an ultra&#8208;low onset potential (0.62&#8197;VRHE). CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 photoelectrodes achieved an ammonia faradic efficiency of 97.82&#8201;% at a low applied potential of 0.4&#8197;VRHE, and an ammonia yield of 16.96&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;VRHE under one sun illumination. Dynamics experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that CuSn/TiO2/Sb2S3 has an enhanced charge separation and transfer efficiency, facilitating photogenerated electrons to participate in PEC NO3RR quickly. Meanwhile, moderate NO2* adsorption on this photocathode optimizes the catalytic activity and increases the NH4+ yield. This work opens an avenue for designing sulfide&#8208;based photocathodes for the efficient route of solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion.

         <title>Navigating Ball Mill Specifications for Theory&#8208;to&#8208;Practice Reproducibility in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly reported parameters such as time, rpm, and ball mass are often insufficient to replicate mechanochemical syntheses accurately. By demonstrating that reaction outcomes are tied to the cumulative total energy, we can enhance the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across various laboratory mills, including planetary and mixer mills. To aid in this, we offer a free online calculator to compute and report all necessary parameters.







Abstract
The rising prospects of mechanochemically assisted syntheses hold promise for both academia and industry, yet they face challenges in understanding and, therefore, anticipating respective reaction kinetics. Particularly, dependencies based on variations in milling equipment remain little understood and globally overlooked. This study aims to address this issue by identifying critical parameters through kinematic models, facilitating the reproducibility of mechanochemical reactions across the most prominent mills in laboratory settings, namely planetary and mixer mills. Through a series of selected experiments replicating major classes of organic, organometallic, transition metal&#8208;catalyzed, and inorganic reactions from literature, we rationalize the independence of kinematic parameters on reaction kinetics when the accumulated energy criterion is met. As a step forward and to facilitate the practicability of our findings, we provide a freely accessible online tool[&#8224;] that allows the calculation of respective energy parameters for different planetary and mixer mills. Our work advances the current understanding of mechanochemistry and lays the foundation for future rational exploration in this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>Mitigating the Kinetic Hysteresis of Co&#8208;Free Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes via Gradient Penetration of Nonmagnetic Silicon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synergistic tuning of lattice magnetic fields and interfacial structure stability, this work provides a green, efficient, and universal strategy of Si gradient doping to overcome the kinetic hysteresis problems that have long&#8208;term hindered the development of Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials.







Abstract
Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8722;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of surface dense barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8722;xSi0.01O2, 0.6&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.

         <title>Engineering the Substrate Specificity of UDP&#8208;Glycosyltransferases for Synthesizing Triterpenoid Glycosides with a Linear Trisaccharide as Aided by Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction</title>

UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferase UGT91H enzymes for the regioselective 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids to generate triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide are described. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was successfully applied to expand the substrate scope of UGT91H enzymes, and an RTAS loop was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H enzymes.







Abstract
Triterpenoids have wide applications in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. The glycosylation of triterpenoids catalyzed by UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is a crucial method for producing valuable derivatives with enhanced functions. However, only a few UDP&#8208;glucosyltransferases have been reported to synthesize the rare triterpenoids with linear&#8208;chain trisaccharide at C3&#8722;OH. This study revealed that the UGT91H subfamily primarily contributed to the 2&#8220;&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylation of triterpenoids with high regioselectivity, then the substrate scope was further expanded by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). With ancestral enzyme UGT91H_A1 as a model, the sequence&#8208;structure&#8208;function relationship was explored. A RTAS loop (R212/T213/A214/S215) was identified to affect the substrate specificity of UGT91H_A1. Transferring this RTAS loop to the corresponding position of UGT91H enzymes successfully expanded their substrate spectra. The functional role of RTAS loop was further elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation and quantum mechanical computation. UGT91H_A1 was applied to the low&#8208;cost synthesis of terpenoid rhamnosides with a linear trisaccharide in combining with a self&#8208;sufficient UDP&#8208;rhamnose regeneration system. Finally, we developed a phylogeny&#8208;based platform to efficiently mining new UGT91Hs from plant genomic data. This study provided robust biocatalysts for synthesizing various triterpenoid glycosides with a linear trisaccharide and demonstrated ASR as an efficient tool in engineering the function of UDP&#8208;glycosyltransferases.

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acceptor Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component vinylene&#8208;linked D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs)&#8208;based metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) with reinforced intramolecular charge separation driving force was designed and prepared, achieving highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation efficiency and photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The Cu&#8208;CTUs active sites can effectively adsorb and activate CO2 to further enhance photocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Intramolecular charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry between building blocks are critical factors for enhancing the photocatalytic performance of metal&#8208;covalent organic framework (MCOF) based photocatalyst. However, robust achieving both simultaneously has yet to be challenging despite ongoing efforts. Here we develop a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated vinylene&#8208;linked multivariate donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor MCOF (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A, termed UJN&#8208;1) by integrating benzyl cyanides linker with multiple functional building blocks of electron&#8208;rich triphenylamine and electron&#8208;deficient copper&#8208;cyclic trinuclear units (Cu&#8208;CTUs) moieties, featuring with strong intramolecular charge separation driving force, extended conjugation degree of skeleton, and abundant active sites. The incorporation of Cu&#8208;CTUs acceptor with electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and concomitantly giant charge separation driving force can efficiently accelerate the photogenerated electrons transfer from triphenylamine to Cu&#8208;CTUs, revealing by experiments and theoretical calculations. Benefiting from the synergistically effect of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A configuration and vinylene linkage, the highly&#8208;efficient charge spatial separation is achieved. Consequently, UJN&#8208;1 exhibits an excellent CO formation rate of 114.8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 in 4&#8197;h without any co&#8208;catalysts or sacrificial reagents under visible light, outperforming those analogous MCOFs with imine&#8208;linked (UJN&#8208;2, 28.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1) and vinylene&#8208;linked COF without Cu&#8208;CTU active sites (UJN&#8208;3, 50.0&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1), emphasizing the role of charge separation driving force and linkage chemistry in designing novel COFs&#8208;based photocatalyst.

         <title>High Performance Memristors Based on Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks Obtained Using a Protonation Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protonation&#8208;modification strategy has been employed to modify imine&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type covalent organic frameworks (COFs), significantly improving the electron delocalization capabilities of the imine bonds and constructing advanced memory devices. The obtained novel COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT@PTSA thin film&#8208;based rewritable memristors exhibit high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105) and unprecedented endurance (more than 1300 number of cycles).







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are garnering substantial interest in resistive random&#8208;access memory, attributed to their superior crystallinity, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and modifiable molecular structures. However, the development of high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based memristors impeded by challenges such as low conjugation degree of imine bonds and poor electron delocalization ability. Herein, we report a protonation strategy to modify the imine bonds of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type COFs. This modification significantly enhances the electron delocalization capability of imine bonds, lowers the energy barriers for electron injection from electrodes, and stabilizes the conductive charge transfer state, thus markedly improving device performance. The protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;BPy and COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT thin films&#8208;based memristors show remarkable device performance with a high ON/OFF current ratio of 105, a low driving voltage, and outstanding endurance exceeding 600 and 1300&#8197;cycles, respectively, which is nearly twice the durability of analogous non&#8208;protonated COFs&#8208;based memristors. Notably, the protonated COF&#8208;BTT&#8208;TAPT&#8208;based memristor exhibit the highest number of cycles reported at present. This work not only unprecedentedly enhances the performance of COF&#8208;based memristors, but also provides a universal and promising approach for the molecular design and potential application of D&#8208;A type imine&#8208;linked COFs.

         <title>A Supramolecular Deep Eutectic Electrolyte Enhancing Interfacial Stability and Solution Phase Discharge in Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) based on LiTFSI, acetamide and boric acid, improving the oxidation voltage up to 4.5&#8197;V, and enhancing the solution phase discharge mechanism by forming Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds with Li+ and O2&#8722;. The introduction of boric acid also promotes the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, which induces Li+ uniform deposition. The Li&#8722;O2 battery with this DEE delivers ultrahigh discharge capacity, improved cycling performance and intrinsic safety.







Abstract
Li&#8722;O2 batteries (LOBs) have gained widespread recognition for their exceptional energy densities. However, a major challenge faced by LOBs is the lack of appropriate electrolytes that can effectively balance reactant transport, interfacial compatibility, and non&#8208;volatility. To address this issue, a novel supramolecular deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) has been developed, based on synergistic interaction between Li&#8208;bonds and H&#8208;bonds through a combination of lithium salt (LiTFSI), acetamide (Ace) and boric acid (BA). The incorporation of BA serves as an interface modification additive, acting as both Li&#8208;bonds acceptor and H&#8208;bonds donor/acceptor, thereby enhancing the redox stability of the electrolyte, facilitating a solution phase discharge process and improving compatibility with the Li anode. Our proposed DEE demonstrates a high oxidation voltage of 4.5&#8197;V, an ultrahigh discharge capacity of 15225&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance of 196&#8197;cycles in LOBs. Additionally, the intrinsic non&#8208;flammability and successful operation of a Li&#8722;O2 pouch cell indicate promising practical applications of this electrolyte. This research broadens the design possibilities for LOBs electrolytes and provides theoretical insights for future studies.

         <title>The Impact of Supersaturated Electrode on Heterogeneous Lithium Nucleation and Growth Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces new insights into the heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth dynamics that directly influence the performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). It reveals that high&#8208;performance electrodes for LMAs, characterized by a high active lithium adsorption capacity and fast surface diffusion kinetics, can be defined as &#8242;supersaturated electrodes.







Abstract
The concept of a lithiophilic electrode proves inadequate in describing carbon&#8208;based electrode materials due to their substantial mismatch in surface energy with lithium metal. However, their notable capacity for lithium chemisorption can increase active lithium concentration required for nucleation and growth, thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of lithium metal anodes (LMAs). In this study, we elucidate the effects of the supersaturated electrode which has high active lithium capacity around equilibrium lithium potential on LMAs through an in&#8208;depth electrochemical comparison using two distinct carbon electrode platforms with differing carbon structures but similar two&#8208;dimensional morphologies. In the supersaturated electrode, both the dynamics and thermodynamic states involved in lithium nucleation and growth mechanisms are significantly improved, particularly under continuous current supply conditions. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface layers (SEIs) are greatly influenced by the elevated surface lithium concentration environment, resulting in the formation of more conductive lithium&#8208;rich SEI layers. The improved dynamics and thermodynamics of surface lithium, coupled with the formation of enhanced SEI layers, contribute to higher power capabilities, enhanced Coulombic efficiencies, and improved cycling performances of LMAs. These results provide new insight into understanding the enhancements in heterogeneous lithium nucleation and growth kinetics on the supersaturated electrode.

         <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>

A versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to construct nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with accurately tailored biphasic interfaces. Using Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures as a model catalyst for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, this work establishes a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of the catalyst.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure&#8211;property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed&#8208;dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self&#8208;assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a series of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au&#8208;on&#8208;Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface&#8208;dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term and Continuous Plasmonic Oligonucleotide Monitoring Enabled by Regeneration Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with 5&#8208;minute temporal resolution by using regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach. A picomolar limit of detection (LoD) in both buffered and serum complexes is achieved, and reliable performance for over 100&#8197;measurements per day and stability over 9&#8197;days were demonstrated.







Abstract
The demand for continuous monitoring of biochemical markers for diagnostic purposes is increasing as it overcomes the limitations of traditional intermittent measurements. This study introduces a method for long&#8208;term, continuous plasmonic biosensing of oligonucleotides with high temporal resolution. Our method is based on a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach that ensures rapid reversibility in less than 1&#8197;minute, allowing the sensor to fully reset after each measurement. We investigated label&#8208;free and AuNP enhancements for different dynamic ranges and sensitivities, achieving a limit of detection down to pM levels. We developed a regeneration&#8208;based reversibility approach for continuous biosensing, optimizing buffer conditions using the Taguchi method to achieve rapid, consistent reversibility, ensuring reliable performance for long&#8208;term monitoring. We detected oligonucleotides in buffered and complex solutions, including undiluted and unfiltered human serum, for up to 100 sampling cycles in a day. Moreover, we showed the long&#8208;term stability of the sensor for monitoring capabilities in buffered solutions and human serum, with minimal signal value drift and excellent sensor reversibility for up to 9&#8197;days. Our method opens the door to new prospects in continuous biosensing by providing insights beyond intermittent measurements for numerous analytical and diagnostic applications.

         <title>A Strongly Coupled Metal/Hydroxide Heterostructure Cascades Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Reduction Reactions toward Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure was constructed. The heterostructure provides dual&#8208;sites for carbon dioxide reduction and nitrate reduction reactions, and thus facilitate efficient C&#8722;N coupling toward urea formation. The obtained Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers greatly enhanced urea yield rate and Faradaic efficiency compared with individual Ag and CuNi(OH)2.







Abstract
The direct coupling of nitrate ions and carbon dioxide for urea synthesis presents an appealing alternative to the Bosch&#8211;Meiser process in industry. The simultaneous activation of carbon dioxide and nitrate, however, as well as efficient C&#8722;N coupling on single active site, poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a novel metal/hydroxide heterostructure strategy based on synthesizing an Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite to cascade carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions for urea electrosynthesis. The strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure interface integrates two distinct sites for carbon dioxide and nitrate activation, and facilitates the coupling of *CO (on silver, where * denotes an active site) and *NH2 (on hydroxide) for urea formation. Moreover, the strongly coupled interface optimizes the water splitting process and facilitates the supply of active hydrogen atoms, thereby expediting the deoxyreduction processes essential for urea formation. Consequently, our Ag&#8722;CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers a high urea yield rate of 25.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and high urea Faradaic efficiency of 46.1&#8201;%, as well as excellent cycling stability. This work provides new insights into the design of dual&#8208;site catalysts for C&#8722;N coupling, considering their role on the interface.

         <title>Suspension Bead Loading (SBL): An Economical Protein Delivery Platform to Study URM1&#8217;s Behavior in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

We have developed a &#8220;Suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL) approach that serves as a general and economical delivery method to address fundamental biological questions. We applied SBL to investigate the cellular behavior of synthetic Ubiquitin related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1) under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Created with BioRender.com.







Abstract
Uniquely modified synthetic proteins are difficult to produce in large quantities, which could limit their use in various in vitro settings and in cellular studies. In this study, we developed a method named &#8220;suspension bead loading&#8221; (SBL), to deliver protein molecules into suspended living cells using glass beads, which significantly reduces the amount of protein required for effective delivery. We investigated the delivery efficiency of functionally different proteins and evaluated the cytotoxic effect of our method and the chemical and functional integrity of the delivered protein. We utilized SBL to address questions related to ubiquitin&#8208;related modifier&#8197;1 (URM1). Employing minimal protein quantities, SBL has enabled us to study its behavior within live cells under different redox conditions, including subcellular localization and conjugation patterns. We demonstrate that oxidative stress alters both the localization and conjugation pattern of URM1 in cells, highlighting its possible role in cellular response to such extreme conditions.

         <title>Deuteration and Tritiation of Pharmaceuticals by Non&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation in Heavy and Super&#8208;Heavy Water</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a hydrogen isotope exchange reaction using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. The catalytic system relies on a commercially available pyridine ligand that enables aromatic C&#8722;H activation. Labelling of 39 pharmaceuticals was achieved by utilizing D2O as the deuterium source and solvent, without requiring fluorinated cosolvents. Expansion to T/H exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source was demonstrated.







Abstract
Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis. Aromatic C&#8722;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D2O, as the only solvent 39&#8197;pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non&#8208;directed homogeneous Pd&#8208;catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T2O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.

Expansion to T/H exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as isotopic source was demonstrated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deuterated and tritiated analogs of drugs are valuable compounds for pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this work, we present a novel hydrogen isotope exchange reaction of drugs using non-directed homogeneous Pd-catalysis. Aromatic C&#8722;H activation is achieved by a commercially available pyridine ligand. Using the most convenient and cheapest deuterium source, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, as the only solvent 39&#8197;pharmaceuticals were labelled with clean reaction profiles and high deuterium uptakes. Additionally, we describe the first application of non-directed homogeneous Pd-catalysis for H/T exchange on three different pharmaceuticals by using T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as isotopic source, demonstrating the applicability to the synthesis of radiotracers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Anion Effect on Steerable Production of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of THF/NaCl aq, which is attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. The anion promotes electron transfer through proximity effects and also induces a decrease in the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension, thereby increasing the HMF yield.







Abstract
Homogeneous metal salt catalysts play a pivotal role in industrial production of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Herein, we first proposed the anion effect on steerable production of HMF using metal salts with different anions as catalyst in a biphasic system of tetrahydrofuran (THF)/NaCl aqueous solution (NaCl aq). Notably, the anions affected the catalytic activity of the metal salts, leading to an order of magnitude difference in the HMF yields, i.e., AlBr3 (74.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;AlCl3 (60.8&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al2(SO4)3 (35.2&#8197;mol&#8201;%)&gt;Al(NO3)3 (14.9&#8197;mol&#8201;%). The anion effect on steerable production of HMF could be attributed to the proximity effect and electron tension. Anions form close&#8208;range interactions with glucose molecules by proximity effect to promote electron transfer, facilitating the isomerization of glucose to fructose. Besides, anions induce a reduction of the electron cloud density of glucose carbon atoms, generating electron tension that rapidly transforms glucose from the ground state to the transition state, thereby increasing the HMF yield. Based on the revelation of anions effect and evaluation of techno&#8208;economic process, we expect to provides theoretical guidance for high&#8208;throughput screening of metal salt catalysts in industrial biorefinery.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Sodium Ion Batteries Enabled by Switching Sodiophobic Graphite into Sodiophilic and High&#8208;Capacity Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodiophobic graphite can be converted to sodiophilic graphite intercalation compounds through solvated&#8208;sodium&#8208;ion co&#8208;intercalation mechanisms, thus facilitating dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal plating/stripping with enhanced Coulombic efficiencies. This finding propels the achievement of cost&#8208;effective and high capacity anodes for advanced sodium ion batteries with energy densities of above 250&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.







Abstract
Owing to the crustal abundance of sodium element, sodium ion batteries (SIBs) are considered a promising complementary to lithium&#8208;ion battery for stationary energy storage applications. The cointercalation chemistry enables the use of cost&#8208;effective graphite as anodes, whereas the low capacity (&lt;130&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) and high redox potential (&gt;0.6&#8197;V vs. Na/Na+) of graphite significantly limit the energy density of SIBs. Herein, we induce the high&#8208;capacity Na metal into sodiophilic ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t&#8208;GICs) via co&#8208;intercalation and deposition reactions, thereby achieving Na/t&#8208;GIC anodes with high capacities and low working voltage (0.18&#8197;V). The new anodes exhibit high coulombic efficiencies of above 99.7&#8201;% over 550&#8197;cycles and a high&#8208;rate capacity of 588.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 6&#8197;C (10&#8197;min per charge). When it is paired with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes, the SIBs demonstrate a high energy density of 259&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1both electrodes surpassing that of commercial LiFePO4//graphite batteries. The outstanding anode performance is attributed to the tailored sodiophilicity of graphite through manipulating the ether solvents and the in situ generated space among t&#8208;GIC flakes to stably accommodate Na metal. Our findings for stable Na plating/striping on sodiophilic graphite materials provide an effective approach for developing advanced SIBs.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotics against Drug&#8208;Resistant Pathogens Discovered via Host&#8208;Dependent Heterologous Expression of a Cloned Biosynthetic Gene Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ambocidins are calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a unique peptide core that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Heterologous expression of their biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in multiple hosts resulted in production of new metabolites. However, only one heterologous host was capable of supporting production of the ambocidins. The ambocidins bind lipid II at a site distinct from the target of vancomycin.







Abstract
Historically, small molecules biosynthesised by bacteria have been an excellent source for antibacterial drugs. Today, however, the rediscovery of known compounds is a significant hurdle to developing new antimicrobials. Here we use a genome mining and synthetic biology approach to discover the ambocidins: calcium&#8208;dependent lipodepsipeptides that are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. By cloning a silent biosynthetic gene cluster (the amb cluster) from Streptomyces ambofaciens ATCC 2387 and integrating this into the chromosome of Streptomyces avermitilis we induce expression of ambocidin A and B: two new N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine&#8208;containing cyclic lipodepsipeptides active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Using a panel of Streptomyces host strains, we show that the choice of heterologous host is critical for producing the biologically active compounds, and that inappropriate host choice leads to aberrant production inactive derivatives. We show that N&#1013;&#8208;hydroxyarginine is the product of a heme&#8208;dependent oxygenase and that it enhances biological activity. Ambocidin A inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding to Lipid II at a different site than vancomycin. Furthermore, unlike daptomycin, ambocidin A retains potent antimicrobial activity in the presence of lung surfactant, giving it the potential to treat bacterial pneumonia. Our work expands the family of calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotics with a new member exhibiting a distinct mechanism of action.

         <title>A High Capacity p&#8208;Type Organic Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a high&#8208;voltage p&#8208;type organic cathode material of DHTAT for application in aqueous zinc batteries, exhibiting a high capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. After 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the DHTAT electrode retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, indicating promising cycling stability. Additionally, DHTAT also exhibits good low&#8208;temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low&#8208;temperature batteries.







Abstract
P&#8208;type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported p&#8208;type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation&#8208;reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high&#8208;capacity p&#8208;type organic material, 5,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;5,6,11,12&#8208;tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT mainly involves the adsorption/desorption of ClO4&#8722; on the &#8722;NH&#8722; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8722;NH&#8722; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 with a stable voltage of 1.12&#8197;V.

&lt;p&gt;This work reports a high-voltage p-type organic cathode material of DHTAT for application in aqueous zinc batteries, exhibiting a high capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. After 5000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the DHTAT electrode retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, indicating promising cycling stability. Additionally, DHTAT also exhibits good low-temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low-temperature batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P-type organic cathode materials typically exhibit high redox potentials and fast redox kinetics, presenting broad application prospects in aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs). However, most of the reported p-type organic cathode materials exhibit limited capacity (&amp;lt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is attributable to the low mass content ratio of oxidation-reduction active functional groups in these materials. Herein, we report a high-capacity p-type organic material, 5,12-dihydro-5,6,11,12-tetraazatetracene (DHTAT), for aqueous zinc batteries. Both experiments and calculation indicate the charge storage of DHTAT mainly involves the adsorption/desorption of ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on the &#8722;NH&#8722; group. Benefitting from the high mass content ratio of the &#8722;NH&#8722; group in DHATA molecule, the DHATA electrode demonstrates a remarkable capacity of 224&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a stable voltage of 1.12&#8197;V. Notably, after 5000&#8197;cycles at a high current density of 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, DHTAT retains 73&#8201;% of its initial capacity, showing a promising cycling stability. In addition, DHTAT also has good low-temperature performance and can stably cycle at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C for 4000&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, making it a competitive candidates cathode material for low-temperature batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Living Hybrid Exciton Materials: Enhanced Fluorescence and Chiroptical Properties in Living Supramolecular Polymers with Strong Frenkel/Charge&#8208;Transfer Exciton Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrically L/D&#8208;glutamate&#8208;derived PDIs having linear alkyl chains exhibit living supramolecular polymerization in thermodynamically stable chiral molecular orientation, which shows the coupling of Frenkel and charge transfer exciton states, resulting in significantly enhanced fluorescence quantum yield, CD and CPL properties. Meanwhile, PDIs with branched chains only show common H&#8208;aggregates. Thus, molecular control on living hybrid exciton nanomaterials is achieved.







Abstract
A family of chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) was newly developed as excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. They are asymmetrically derivatized with a double&#8208;alkyl&#8208;chained L&#8208; or D&#8208;glutamate unit and a linear or branched alkyl chain. When water is added to the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of glutamate&#8208;PDI&#8208;linear&#8208;alkyl chain compounds, kinetically formed H&#8208;aggregates are formed in globular nanoparticles (NPs). These NPs undergo spontaneous transformation into thermodynamically stable nanotubes via helical nanostructures, which showed structured broad spectra originating from the strong coupling of delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge transfer excitations (CTE). Significant enhancement of circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence quantum yield, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) are observed during the transformation of NPs to the FE/CTE&#8208;coupled helical and tubular structures. This transformation process is significantly accelerated by applying physical stimuli, i.e., ultrasonication or adding helical aggregates as seed crystals, a feature unique to living supramolecular polymerization. Meanwhile, the branched chain&#8208;containing PDIs only form H&#8208;aggregates and did not show FE/CTE hybrid exciton states with living supramolecular polymerization properties. This study unveils that suitably designed chiral PDI derivatives show FE/CTE coupling accompanied by high fluorescence quantum yields, enhanced chiroptical properties, and supramolecular living polymerization characteristics.

         <title>Redox Activity and Potentials of Bidentate N&#8208;Ligands Commonly Applied in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report establishes the redox activity of biOx (bi&#8208;oxazoline), biIm (bi&#8208;imidazoline), and pyIm (pyridine&#8208;imidazoline) ligands in stabilizing nickel radical complexes. Direct comparison of the redox potentials of bidentate N&#8208;ligands provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.







Abstract
Bidentate N&#8208;ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi&#8208;oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species. This finding contrasts with the prior assumption that bi&#8208;oxazoline lacks redox activity due to strong mesomeric donation. Moreover, we conducted systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses of bidentate pyridyl, oxazoline, and imidazoline nitrogen ligands, along with their corresponding nickel complexes. Complexation with nickel shifts the reduction potentials to a more positive region and narrows the differences in redox potentials among the ligands. Additionally, various ligands led to different degrees of bromide dissociation from singly reduced (L)Ni(Ar)(Br) complexes, reflecting varying reactivity in the subsequent activation of alkyl halides, a crucial step in cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. These insights highlight the significant electronic effects of ligands on the stability of metalloradical species and their redox potentials, which interplay with coordination geometry. Quantifying the electron&#8208;donating, &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands, as well as their effect on catalyst speciation, provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.

         <title>Electrochemical Homo&#8208; and Crossannulation of Alkynes and Nitriles for the Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Synthesis of 3,6&#8208;Diarylpyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular Homo&#8208;couplings, but especially Cross&#8208;couplings are challenging! We reported an electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles using triarylamine as a redox mediator to form substituted pyridines. Our process demonstrates unprecedented control of chemoselectivity, allowing both homo&#8208; and heterocouplings of alkynes and nitriles. A mechanistic rationale is proposed, supported by CV, EPR, NMR, and computational studies.







Abstract
We disclose a mediated electrochemical [2+2+2] annulation of alkynes with nitriles, forming substituted pyridines in a single step from low&#8208;cost, readily available starting materials. The combination of electrochemistry and a triarylamine redox mediator obviates the requirements of transition metals and additional oxidants. Besides the formation of diarylpyridine moieties via the homocoupling of two identical alkynes, the heterocoupling of two different alkynes depending on their electronic nature is possible, highlighting the unprecedented control of chemoselectivity in this catalytic [2+2+2] process. Mechanistic investigations like cyclic voltammetry and crossover experiments combined with DFT calculations indicate the initial oxidation of an alkyne as the key step leading to the formation of a vinyl radical cation intermediate. The utilization of continuous flow technology proved instrumental for an efficient process scale&#8208;up. The utility of the products is exemplified by the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended molecules, being relevant for material or drug synthesis.

         <title>Molecular Design of Hole Transport Materials to Immobilize Ion Motion for Photostable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the capability of hole molecules to strengthen the interface bonding and interactions between molecules and interfaces is crucial to maximally passivate defects, affording robust interface, inhibition of ion migration, and photostable perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the newly developed mDPA&#8208;SFX enables cells with a PCE of 24.8&#8201;%, and an excellent T80 lifetime of 2,238&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking.







Abstract
Poor operational stability is a crucial factor limiting the further application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic semiconductor layers can be a powerful means for reinforcing interfaces and inhibiting ion migration. Herein, two hole&#8208;transporting molecules, pDPA&#8208;SFX and mDPA&#8208;SFX, are synthesized with tuned substituent connection sites. The meta&#8208;substituted mDPA&#8208;SFX results in a larger dipole moment, more ordered packing, and better charge mobility than pDPA&#8208;SFX, accompanying with strong interface bonding on perovskite surfaces and suppressed ion motion as well. Importantly, mDPA&#8208;SFX&#8208;based PSCs exhibit an efficiency that has significantly increased from 22.5&#8201;% to 24.8&#8201;% and a module&#8208;based efficiency of 19.26&#8201;% with an active area of 12.95&#8197;cm2. The corresponding cell retain 94.8&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) after 1,000&#8197;h (T95=1,000&#8197;h). The MPPT T80 lifetime is as long as 2,238&#8197;h. This work illustrates that a small degree of structural variation in organic compounds leaves considerable room for developing new HTMs for light stable PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates that the capability of hole molecules to strengthen the interface bonding and interactions between molecules and interfaces is crucial to maximally passivate defects, affording robust interface, inhibition of ion migration, and photostable perovskite solar cells. Consequently, the newly developed mDPA-SFX enables cells with a PCE of 24.8&#8201;%, and an excellent &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime of 2,238&#8197;h at maximum power point tracking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor operational stability is a crucial factor limiting the further application of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Organic semiconductor layers can be a powerful means for reinforcing interfaces and inhibiting ion migration. Herein, two hole-transporting molecules, pDPA-SFX and mDPA-SFX, are synthesized with tuned substituent connection sites. The &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-substituted mDPA-SFX results in a larger dipole moment, more ordered packing, and better charge mobility than pDPA-SFX, accompanying with strong interface bonding on perovskite surfaces and suppressed ion motion as well. Importantly, mDPA-SFX-based PSCs exhibit an efficiency that has significantly increased from 22.5&#8201;% to 24.8&#8201;% and a module-based efficiency of 19.26&#8201;% with an active area of 12.95&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The corresponding cell retain 94.8&#8201;% of its initial efficiency at maximum power point tracking (MPPT) after 1,000&#8197;h (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;=1,000&#8197;h). The MPPT &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime is as long as 2,238&#8197;h. This work illustrates that a small degree of structural variation in organic compounds leaves considerable room for developing new HTMs for light stable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental Observation of a Terminal Borylene&#8208;Dinitrogen Adduct via Cleavage of a 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Diboratriazoline</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of a doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene with organic azides yields stable CAAC&#8208;iminoborane adducts. Experimental and computational data confirm the involvement of a relatively long&#8208;lived terminal borylene&#8208;dinitrogen adduct (i.e. diazoborane), [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)] as a key intermediate in the reaction.







Abstract
While azides do not react with simple alkenes except under harsh conditions, a diboron alkene analogue, the doubly cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicyanodiborene 1, reacts spontaneously with organic azides (7&#8211;10&#8197;equiv.) at room temperature to yield two equivalents of stable CAAC&#8208;imino(cyano)boranes (2&#8208;R). NMR&#8208;spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction mixtures shows the initial formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of 2&#8208;R and a relatively long&#8208;lived intermediate (Int), which in the presence of excess azide is converted into a second equivalent of 2&#8208;R. In the absence of excess azide, however, Int decomposes to 3, the product of an intramolecular C&#8722;H activation by a putative dicoordinate borylene intermediate &#8220;(CAAC)B(CN)&#8221;. Mechanistic insights from trapping experiments, NMR&#8208;spectroscopic and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry data, as well as DFT computations reveal that Int is the terminal borylene end&#8208;on&#8208;dinitrogen adduct [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The formation of the iminoboranes 2&#8208;R from diborene 1 and RN3 proceeds via an azide&#8208;diborene Huisgen&#8208;type [3+2] cycloaddition reaction, followed by a retro&#8208;[3+2] cycloaddition, yielding 2&#8208;R and [(CAAC)B(CN)(&#951;1&#8208;N2)]. The latter then undergoes either N2 extrusion and intramolecular C&#8722;H activation to generate 3, or a Staudinger&#8208;type reaction with a second equivalent of azide to generate a second equivalent of the iminoborane 2&#8208;R.

         <title>Ferroptosis Inducing Co(III) Polypyridine Sulfasalazine Complex for Therapeutically Enhanced Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting ferroptosis provides a novel avenue to overcome the limitations of apoptotic anticancer treatments. The Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex described here acts as a potent ferroptosis inducer for anticancer therapy. This complex selectively accumulates in mitochondria, generating reactive oxygen species, initiating lipid peroxidation, depleting glutathione, inhibiting glutathione peroxidase&#8197;4, and ultimately driving ferroptosis.







Abstract
Despite significant improvements in the treatment of cancerous tumors in the last decades, cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. To overcome the shortcomings of currently applied chemotherapeutic treatments, much research efforts have been devoted towards the development of ferroptosis inducing anticancer agents. Ferroptosis is a newly described form of regulated, non&#8208;apoptotic cell death that is associated with high potential inside the clinics. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of a Co(III) polypyridine sulfasalazine complex as a ferroptosis inducer is reported. Upon entering the cancerous cells, the metal complex primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, triggering the production of hydroxy radicals and lipid peroxides, ultimately causing cell death by ferroptosis. The compound demonstrated to eradicate various monolayer cancer cells as well as colon carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroids. To the best of our knowledge this study reports on the first example of a Co(III) complex that is capable of inducing ferroptosis.

An earth&#8208;abundant iron catalyst enabled efficient electrochemical recycling of post&#8208;consumer polystyrene with molecular hydrogen as the sole by&#8208;product, highlighting its potential for a circular carbon economy with a scalable green hydrogen evolution.







Abstract
Plastics are omnipresent in our everyday life, and accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste in our environment represents a major societal challenge. Hence, methods for plastic waste recycling are in high demand for a future circular economy. Specifically, the degradation of post&#8208;consumer polymers towards value&#8208;added small molecules constitutes a sustainable strategy for a carbon circular economy. Despite of recent advances, chemical polymer degradation continues to be largely limited to chemical redox agents or low energy efficiency in photochemical processes. We herein report a powerful iron&#8208;catalyzed degradation of high molecular weight polystyrenes through electrochemistry to efficiently deliver monomeric benzoyl products. The robustness of the ferraelectrocatalysis was mirrored by the degradation of various real&#8208;life post&#8208;consumer plastics, also on gram scale. The cathodic half reaction was largely represented by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The scalable electro&#8208;polymer degradation could be solely fueled by solar energy through a commercially available solar panel, indicating an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy.

         <title>Surface Tension Manipulation with Visible Light through Sensitized Disequilibration of Photoswitchable Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disequilibration by sensitization under confinement is used for the first time to modulate the surface tension of water with the aid of photoswitchable surfactants. Surfactants POS or NEG were encapsulated in a macrocyclic cage together with a photosensitizer so that irradiation with visible light (green or red) could induce isomerization and thus modify the surface tension based on the altered surface activity of the amphiphile.







Abstract
Azoarene isomerization lies at the heart of numerous applications, from catalysis or energy storage to photopharmacology. While efficient switching between their E and Z isomers predominantly relies on UV light, a recent study by Klajn and co&#8208;workers introduced visible light sensitization of E azoarenes and their subsequent isomerization as a tool coined disequilibration by sensitization under confinement (DESC) to obtain high yields of the Z isomer. This host&#8211;guest approach is, however, still constrained to minimally substituted azoarenes with limited applicability in advanced molecular systems. Herein, we expand DESC for the assembly of surfactants at the air&#8211;water interface. Leveraging our expertise with photoswitchable amphiphiles, we induce substantial alterations of the water surface tension through reversible arylazopyrazole isomerization. After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen. The straightforward implementation of photoswitch sensitization in a complex molecular network showcases how DESC enables the improvement of existing systems and the development of novel applications driven by visible light.

After studying the binding of charged surfactants to the host, we find that the surface activity differences upon visible light switching for both isomers are comparable to those obtained by UV light excitation. The method is demonstrated on a large concentration range and can be activated using green or red light, depending on the sensitizer chosen. The straightforward implementation of photoswitch sensitization in a complex molecular network showcases how DESC enables the improvement of existing systems and the development of novel applications driven by visible light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Horizontal Transport in Ti3C2Tx MXene for Highly Efficient Osmotic Energy Conversion from Saline&#8208;Alkali Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene with horizontal ionic transport channels (H&#8208;MXene) to withstand extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions, significantly outperforms that with vertical ionic transport channels (V&#8208;MXene) in ion selectivity and permeability, achieving a current density over three orders of magnitude higher without significant polarization, an osmotic power density of 9.47&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an exceptional energy conversion efficiency of 45.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
Osmotic energy from the ocean has been thoroughly studied, but that from saline&#8208;alkali lakes is constrained by the ion&#8208;exchange membranes due to the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, stemming from the unfavorable structure of nanoconfined channels, pH tolerance, and chemical stability of the membranes. Inspired by the rapid water transport in xylem conduit structures, we propose a horizontal transport MXene (H&#8208;MXene) with ionic sequential transport nanochannels, designed to endure extreme saline&#8208;alkali conditions while enhancing ion selectivity and permeability. The H&#8208;MXene demonstrates superior ion conductivity of 20.67&#8197;S&#8201;m&#8722;1 in 1&#8197;M NaCl solution and a diffusion current density of 308&#8197;A&#8201;m&#8722;2 at a 10&#8208;fold salinity gradient of NaCl solution, significantly outperforming the conventional vertical transport MXene (V&#8208;MXene). Both experimental and simulation studies have confirmed that H&#8208;MXene represents a novel approach to circumventing the permeability&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off. Moreover, it exhibits efficient ion transport capabilities, addressing the gap in saline&#8208;alkali osmotic power generation.

Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity features of Lihium&#8208;organic batteries is essential for their practical use but remains a big challenge, which is due to the instrinsic poor conductivity, limited redox kinetics and low utility of organic electrode mateials. This work presents a well&#8208;designed donor&#8208;acceptor Covalent Organic Framework (COFs) with extended conjugation, mesoscale porosity, and dual redox&#8208;active centers to promote fast charge transfer and multi&#8208;electron processes. As anticipated, the prepared cathode with benzo [1,2&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8242;:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;&#8242;] trithiophene (BTT) as p&#8208;type and pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone (PTO) as n&#8208;type material (BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF) delivers impressive specific capacity (218&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 275&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte) and outstanding rate capability (79&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in ether&#8208;based electrolyte and 124&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte). In addition, the potential of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF electrode for prototype batteries has been demonstrated by full cells of dual&#8208;ion (FDIBs), which attain comparable electrochemical performances to the half cells. Moreover, mechanism studies combining ex situ characterization and theoratical calculations reveal the efficient dual&#8208;ion storage process and facile charge transfer of BTT&#8208;PTO&#8208;COF. This work not only expands the diversity of redox&#8208;active COFs but also provide concept of structure design for high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity organic electrodes.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Hybrid PET/MRI Probe for Quantitative Perfusion Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that the integration of PET and MRI in molecular imaging has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We have developed a hybrid PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which is exceptionally stable, rapidly synthesized, efficiently radiolabeled, and allows simultaneous PET/MR imaging. The potential for in vivo application is demonstrated by quantitative characterization of tissue and renal clearance in mice.







Abstract
Perfusion dynamics play a vital role in delivering essential nutrients and oxygen to tissues while removing metabolic waste products. Imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET) use contrast agents to visualize perfusion and clearance patterns; however, each technique has specific limitations. Hybrid PET/MRI combines the quantitative power and sensitivity of PET with the high functional and anatomical detail of MRI and holds great promise for precision in molecular imaging. However, the development of dual PET/MRI probes has been hampered by challenging synthesis and radiolabeling. Here, we present a novel PET/MRI probe, [18F][Gd(FL1)], which exhibits excellent stability comparable to macrocyclic MRI contrast agents used in clinical practice. The unique molecular design of [18F][Gd(FL1)] allows selective and expeditious radiolabeling of the gadolinium chelate in the final synthetic step. Leveraging the strengths of MRI and PET signals, the probe enables quantitative in vivo mapping of perfusion and excretion dynamics through an innovative voxel&#8208;based analysis. The diagnostic capabilities of [18F][Gd(FL1)] were demonstrated in a pilot study on healthy mice, successfully detecting early cases of unilateral renal dysfunction, a condition that is typically challenging to diagnose. This study introduces a new approach for PET/MRI and emphasizes a streamlined probe design for practical synthesis and improved diagnostic accuracy.

         <title>Transforming Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with DTPA&#8208;Na: A Synergistic SEI and CEI Engineering Approach for Exceptional Cycling Stability and Self&#8208;Discharge Inhibition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed to enhance the stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Incorporation of DTPA&#8208;Na additive enables a synergistic formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This strategy effectively regulates the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry, promoting uniform zinc deposition, inhibiting detrimental side reactions, and preventing manganese dissolution, ultimately achieving high&#8208;performance ZIBs.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA&#8208;Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA&#8208;Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self&#8208;discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm2) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).

Incorporation of DTPA-Na additive enables a synergistic formation of robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This strategy effectively regulates the solvation structure and interfacial chemistry, promoting uniform zinc deposition, inhibiting detrimental side reactions, and preventing manganese dissolution, ultimately achieving high-performance ZIBs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) hold immense potential for large-scale energy storage, but their practical implementation faces significant challenges related to the zinc anode, including dendrite formation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. This study addresses these challenges by introducing diethylenetriamine pentaacetate sodium salt (DTPA-Na) as a novel electrolyte additive. DTPA-Na exhibits a unique dual functionality, enabling the formation of a robust, multi-layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the zinc anode and a stable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the MnOOH cathode. The engineered SEI effectively suppresses interfacial side reactions, facilitates uniform zinc deposition, and mitigates dendrite growth, while the CEI inhibits MnOOH dissolution and detrimental cathode side reactions. This synergistic SEI/CEI engineering approach significantly enhances ZIB performance, achieving remarkable cycling stability and self-discharge inhibition, as evidenced by the extended lifespan of Zn||Zn symmetrical cells (4400&#8197;hours at 0.5&#8197;mA/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the exceptional capacity retention of Zn||MnOOH full cells after prolonged rest (98.61&#8201;% after 720&#8197;hours).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Biocatalytic Conversion of Chemically Inert Hydrocarbons into Chiral Amino Acids through Internal Cofactor and H2O2 Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system was developed using O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent. This system is based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling. It is designed to facilitate the one&#8208;pot enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons to chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.







Abstract
Chemically inert hydrocarbons are the primary feedstocks used in the petrochemical industry and can be converted into more intricate and valuable chemicals. However, two major challenges impede this conversion process: selective activation of C&#8722;H bonds in hydrocarbons and systematic functionalization required to synthesize complex structures. To address these issues, we developed a multi&#8208;enzyme cascade conversion system based on internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling to achieve the one&#8208;pot deep conversion from heptane to chiral (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid under mild conditions. First, a hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8208;cycle&#8208;based NADH regeneration method and H2O2 in&#8197;situ generation and consumption strategy were applied to realize selective C&#8722;H bond oxyfunctionalization, converting heptane into 2&#8208;hydroxyheptanoic acid. Integrating subsequent reductive amination driven by the second hydrogen&#8208;borrowing cycle, (S)&#8208;2&#8208;aminoheptanoic acid was finally accumulated at 4.57&#8197;mM with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Hexane, octane, 2&#8208;methylheptane, and butylbenzene were also successfully converted into the corresponding chiral amino acids with eep&gt;99&#8201;%. Overall, the conversion system employed internal cofactor and H2O2 recycling, with O2 as the oxidant and ammonium as the amination reagent to fulfill the enzymatic conversion from chemically inert hydrocarbons into chiral amino acids under environmentally friendly conditions, which is a highly challenging transformation in traditional organic synthesis.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Catalyst Boosts Energy&#8208;Saving Electrochemical Sulfion Upgrading to Thiosulfate Coupled with Hydrogen Production</title>

Amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF, with the manipulated chemical environments and electron states surrounding &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; sites and the sulfophobic properties of &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; metal sites, shows excellent sulfion&#8208;oxidation reaction performance coupled with hydrogen evolution at the industrial&#8208;level current density for long&#8208;time stability. This demonstration of the electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem reaction process gives a new avenue for sulfions upgrading from wastewater and simultaneous efficient hydrogen production







Abstract
Electrochemical sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) offers a sustainable strategy for sulfion&#8208;rich wastewater treatment, which can couple with cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production. However, the corrosion and passivation of sulfur species render the inferior catalytic SOR performance, and the oxidation product, polysulfide, requires further acidification to recover cheap elementary sulfur. Here, we reported an amorphous high&#8208;entropy sulfide catalyst of CuCoNiMnCrSx nanosheets in situ growth on the nickel foam (CuCoNiMnCrSx/NF) for SOR, which achieved an ultra&#8208;low potential of 0.25&#8197;V to afford 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and stable electrolysis at as high as 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 100&#8197;h. These were endowed by the manipulated chemical environments surrounding Cu+ sites and the constructed &#8220;soft&#8208;acid&#8221; to &#8220;hard&#8208;acid&#8221; adsorption/desorption sites, enabling synergistically boosted adsorption/desorption process of sulfur species during SOR. Moreover, we developed an electrochemical&#8208;chemical tandem process to convert sulfions to value&#8208;added thiosulfate, providing a good choice for simultaneous wastewater utilization and hydrogen production.

         <title>Promoting CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbon Products via Sulfur&#8208;Enhanced Proton Feeding in Atomically Precise Thiolate&#8208;Protected Cu Clusters</title>

Two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species are prepared to explore the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S site on CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a FE of 91.0&#8201;% (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a notable preference for C2+ products with a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% and a JC2+ of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Thiolate&#8208;protected Cu clusters with well&#8208;defined structures and stable low&#8208;coordinated Cu+ species exhibit remarkable potential for the CO2RR and are ideal model catalysts for establishing structure&#8208;electrocatalytic property relationships at the atomic level. However, extant Cu clusters employed in the CO2RR predominantly yield 2e&#8722; products. Herein, two model Cu4(MMI)4 and Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 clusters (MMI=2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole) are prepared to investigate the synergistic effect of Cu+ and adjacent S sites on the CO2RR. Cu4(MMI)4 can reduce CO2 to deep&#8208;reduced products with a 91.0&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency (including 53.7&#8201;% for CH4) while maintaining remarkable stability. Conversely, Cu8(MMI)4(tBuS)4 shows a remarkable preference for C2+ products, achieving a maximum FE of 58.5&#8201;% with a C2+ current density of 152.1&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2. In situ XAS and ex situ XPS spectra reveal the preservation of Cu+ species in Cu clusters during CO2RR, extensively enhancing the adsorption capacity of *CO intermediate. Moreover, kinetic analysis and theoretical calculations confirm that S sites facilitate H2O dissociation into *H species, which directly participate in the protonation process on adjacent Cu sites for the protonation of *CO to *CHO. This study highlights the important role of Cu&#8722;S dual sites in Cu clusters and provides mechanistic insights into the CO2RR pathway at the atomic level.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Chalcone&#8208;Flavylium Photochromic Systems in Aqueous Media&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>
Recently, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers reported new chalcone photoswitches claimed to display advantageous optical and photochemical properties for potential biological applications, i.e., switching with blue, green and red light in aqueous solution. In this Correspondence, we argue that further experimental evidence is required to support the proposed design, data interpretation, and main conclusions.







Abstract
In a recent Communication in this journal, Bandyopadhyay and co&#8208;workers proposed a rational design of chalcone photoswitches that are claimed to convert into the respective flavylium cations upon irradiation with blue, green, and red light in aqueous media. Here we argue that the reported improvements on the optical/photochemical properties of the new chalcone photoswitches are not substantiated and that the proposed design and data interpretation rely on assumptions that have yet to be validated. We also identify a series of control experiments that can be performed to verify the hypotheses and better support the conclusions presented by the authors.

The Janus bifunctionality of Pd nanoparticles or atoms encapsulated in a Zn&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework is reported by Magnus Rueping, Pedro Casta&#241;o et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409490). As illustrated in the cover picture, on one side the catalyst is active and selective in photo&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;couplings, and on the other side selective and stable in the carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol.

         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular living polymers with strongly coupled, delocalized Frenkel excitations (FE) and charge&#8208;transfer excitations (CTE) were developed by Jianlei Han, Shigenori Fujikawa, and Nobuo Kimizuka in their Research Article (e202410431). Suitably designed, chiral perylene diimides (PDIs) show spontaneous transformation from kinetically formed nanoparticles into thermodynamically stable, luminescent helical and tubular nanostructures with enhanced chiroptical properties, fluorescence quantum yields, and living polymerization characteristics.

A novel hybrid PET/MRI probe integrating stable gadolinium chelate with radioactive fluorine&#8208;18 was designed for precision imaging of perfusion and excretion dynamics. In their Research Article (e202409520), Andr&#233; F. Martins, Miloslav Polasek et&#8197;al. demonstrate how merging quantitative PET signal with MRI contrast within a single molecule improves diagnostic capabilities. Employing sophisticated image analysis, this innovative probe can reveal hidden health issues, such as early stages of kidney dysfunction.

Acid environment was found to play a critical role in regulating the catalytic behavior of IrO2 during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As demonstrated by Jingguang G. Chen, Ping Liu et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202409526), the presence of hydronium cation (H3O+) introduces an internal electric field at the interface. It allows selective bond&#8208;tuning of the reaction intermediates and formation of partial surface hydroxylation under the operational conditions, which actively catalyzed the OER.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Curvature Formation in Synthetic Vesicles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bilayer&#8208;forming supramolecular amphiphile, reported by Elizebath et&#8197;al., helps elucidate mechanisms of curvature induction in synthetic membranes. Assembly in water led initially to aggregates but, over time, membrane budding and vesicle formation were observed due to asymmetric protonation of the water&#8208;exposed terminal tertiary amines. Insights could lead to the development of new hierarchical life&#8208;like materials and artificial cells.







Abstract
The mimicking of natural lipid bilayers with synthetic amphiphilic systems is of great interest to researchers, as insights could lead to better understanding of the complexities of cell membranes, as well as new materials and healthcare technologies. Recapitulating natural lipid asymmetry across bilayer membranes has important implications for curvature in cell, vesicle, and organelle morphologies, but has been challenging to achieve with synthetic lipid combinations or standard amphiphilic block copolymers. In a recent article, Elizebath et&#8197;al. report the synthesis of a new type of synthetic amphiphile able to induce asymmetry in an artificial bilayer membrane dynamically. The molecules were designed around an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated hydrophobic core with tertiary amine&#8208;terminated oxyalkylene side chains. Protonation of the tertiary amines on the bilayer exterior leads to curvature induction, bilayer fission, and vesicle formation as monitored by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy techniques and microscopy. The results were further validated with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The delicate balance between different molecular scale interactions in the supramolecular structures led to the dynamic transformation of the bilayer membranes. Insights described could be used to advance the assembly of hierarchical life&#8208;like materials.

         <title>Contrasting Historical and Physical Perspectives in Asymmetric Catalysis: &#916;&#916;G&#8800; versus Enantiomeric Excess</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the difference between enantiomeric excess (ee) and relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;) as modeling targets in asymmetric catalysis. Through data analysis and application of modern machine learning methods, we unveil the strengths and limitations of each approach. Our results offer critical insights into which target more accurately predicts enantioselectivity, providing a guide for future research in machine learning for catalysis.







Abstract
With the rise of machine learning (ML), the modeling of chemical systems has reached a new era and has the potential to revolutionize how we understand and predict chemical reactions. Here, we probe the historic dependence on utilizing enantiomeric excess (ee) as a target variable and discuss the benefits of using relative Gibbs free activation energies (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;), grounded firmly in transition&#8208;state theory, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists. This perspective is intended to discuss best practices that enhance modeling efforts especially for chemists with an experimental background in asymmetric catalysis that wish to explore modelling of their data. We outline the enhanced modeling performance using &#916;&#916;G&#8800;, escaping physical limitations, addressing temperature effects, managing non&#8208;linear error propagation, adjusting for data distributions and how to deal with unphysical predictions,in order to streamline modeling for the practical chemist and provide simple guidelines to strong statistical tools. For this endeavor, we gathered ten datasets from the literature covering very different reaction types. We evaluated the datasets using fingerprint&#8208;, descriptor&#8208;, and graph neural network&#8208;based models. Our results highlight the distinction in performance among varying model complexities with respect to the target representation, emphasizing practical benefits for chemists.

         <title>Carbon Dot Synthesis and Purification: Trends, Challenges and Recommendations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review analyzes the current trends and challenges in the synthesis and purification of carbon dots prepared through various methods and using a wide variety of precursors. Diverse purification techniques, including centrifugation, filtration, dialysis, column chromatography, and electrophoresis, are systematically and thoroughly described, along with pointing out the gaps in the synthesis, purification, and assessment of CD purity.







Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have rapidly emerged as a new family of carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials since their initial discovery two decades ago. Numerous appealing properties, such as precursor and synthesis process flexibility, tunable photoluminescence, and good biocompatibility, have enabled their widespread applications in sensing, catalysis, energy, and biomedical fields. As the field expands, notable efforts have recently focused on mechanistically elucidating the structural formation and optical behavior of CDs. However, the absence of &#8220;clean&#8221; CDs presents a major obstacle to achieving a solid understanding of these aspects. Often, the claimed CDs are, in fact, a mixture of small molecules, oligomers, nano&#8208;sized aggregates, or even microparticles. Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD&#8208;based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography. The insights provided here will guide the researchers towards obtaining high&#8208;quality CDs, employing proper combinations of available tools, and ultimately paving the way for more demanding applications.

Such coexistence of impurities markedly impacts the physicochemical properties of resulting CD-based mixtures, hampering the resolution of key mechanistic questions. Here, we aim to address this fundamental shortcoming of the field, going beyond the customary focus of the existing reviews that predominantly cover synthesis, optical performance, and application prospects. We begin with an overview of CD synthesis and then thoroughly examine the purification methods, including filtration, dialysis, electrophoresis, and chromatography. The insights provided here will guide the researchers towards obtaining high-quality CDs, employing proper combinations of available tools, and ultimately paving the way for more demanding applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanomole Scale Screening of Fluorescent RNA&#8208;Methyltransferase Probes Enables the Discovery of METTL1 Inhibitors</title>

A nanomole&#8208;scale modular synthesis approach enables the rapid development of fluorescent RNA MTase probes, facilitating high&#8208;throughput screenings for drug development. This innovative approach enables advancements in RNA MTase medicinal chemistry highlighted by the discovery of METTL1 inhibitors.







Abstract
RNA methylation is a metabolic process validated for its association with various diseases, and thus, RNA methyltransferases (MTases) have become increasingly important in drug discovery. Yet, most frequently utilized RNA MTase assays are limited in their throughput and hamper this rapidly evolving field of medicinal chemistry. In this study, we describe a modular nanomole scale building block system that allowed the identification of tailored fluorescent MTase probes to unlock a broad selection of MTase drug targets for fluorescence&#8208;based binding assays. Probe candidates were initially prepared on a 4 nanomole scale and could be tested directly from crude reaction mixtures to allow rapid probe identification and optimization. Using an alkyne&#8208;azide click late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy and in silico protein databank mining, we established a selection of fluorescent probes suitable for relevant drug targets from the METTL and NSUN families, as well as bacterial and viral MTases. Using this concept, a high&#8208;throughput screening on the unexplored drug target METTL1 discovered three hit compounds with micromolar potency providing a (1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;based starting point for METTL1 drug discovery.

         <title>An Atomic&#8208;Scale Explanation for The High Selectivity Towards Carbon Dioxide Reduction Observed On Liquid Metal Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hads travels with the motion of a liquid metal surface, allowing it to reach dopant sites (In or Sn) where it reacts with CO2 to make formate with a low barrier (0.25&#8197;eV). Hads is not mobile on a solid surface, explaining why only liquid metals catalyse the reaction.







Abstract
The low&#8208;temperature liquid metals Ga&#8208;In and Ga&#8208;Sn have previously showcased &gt;95&#8201;% selectivity towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate, occuring only when the alloys are melted, not solid. Here, density functional theory molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations reveal that CO2 does not directly adsorb to the Ga&#8208;alloy surface, but instead is reduced indirectly by reaction with an adsorbed hydrogen. The reaction barrier is vastly more favourable when this process occurs at In or Sn sites (average: 0.26&#8197;eV), than when it occurs on Ga (average: 0.47&#8197;eV). However, there is no difference in barrier between solid and liquid surfaces. Instead, we find that Hads is mobile only on the liquid surface, travelling due to the motion of the liquid beneath. This process drives Hads to In/Sn sites, allowing low&#8208;barrier CO2 reduction to occur only on the liquid. Therefore, the dynamic motion of liquid metal catalysts can underpin their unique reactivity. The result has far reaching implications for any protonation reaction conducted with a liquid metal catalyst.

         <title>Atomically Precise Ternary Cluster: Polyoxometalate Cluster Sandwiched by Gold Clusters Protected by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a ternary cluster consisting of a polyoxometalate cluster sandwiched by two gold clusters protected by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes was synthesized through ligand exchange, whose atomically precise structures were characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. These composite clusters demonstrate excellent catalytic capabilities for reducing H2O2 via the intercluster synergistic effects.







Abstract
Coinage metal (Au, Ag, Cu) cluster and polyoxometalate (POM) cluster represent two types of subnanometer &#8220;artificial atoms&#8221; with significant potential in catalysis, sensing, and nanomedicine. While composite clusters combining Ag/Cu clusters with POM have achieved considerable success, the assembly of gold clusters with POM is still lagging. Herein, we first designedly synthesized two cluster structural units: an Au3O cluster stabilized by diverse N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands and an amine&#8208;terminated POM linker. The subsequent reaction involved amine substitution in the POM linker for the central O atom in the Au3O cluster, resulting in the first ternary composite cluster&#8212;a POM cluster sandwiched by two Au clusters protected by NHCs. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and other characteristic methods characterized their atomically precise structures. Furthermore, altering the NHC ligands decreased the number of gold atoms in the sandwich structures, accompanying the different protonated degrees of amine ligand in the terminal end of the POM linker. These composite clusters showed excellent performances in catalytic H2O2 conversion through the synergistic effect between gold clusters and POM clusters. This work opens a new avenue to functional composite metal clusters and would promote their enhanced catalysis applications through intercluster synergistic interactions within composite systems.

         <title>Native Proteomics by Capillary Zone Electrophoresis&#8208;Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native proteomics enabled the measurement of protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome, via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis to an ultra&#8208;high mass range Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry&#8208;based native proteomics agreed well with native mass photometry regarding the mass distribution of detected proteins.







Abstract
Native proteomics measures endogenous proteoforms and protein complexes under a near physiological condition using native mass spectrometry (nMS) coupled with liquid&#8208;phase separations. Native proteomics should provide the most accurate bird's&#8208;eye view of proteome dynamics within cells, which is fundamental for understanding almost all biological processes. nMS has been widely employed to characterize well&#8208;purified protein complexes. However, there are only very few trials of utilizing nMS to measure proteoforms and protein complexes in a complex sample (i.e., a whole cell lysate). Here, we pioneer the native proteomics measurement of large proteoforms or protein complexes up to 400&#8197;kDa from a complex proteome via online coupling of native capillary zone electrophoresis (nCZE) to an ultra&#8208;high mass range (UHMR) Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The nCZE&#8208;MS technique enabled the measurement of a 115&#8208;kDa standard protein complex while consuming only about 0.1&#8197;ng of protein material. nCZE&#8208;MS analysis of an E.coli cell lysate detected 72&#8197;proteoforms or protein complexes in a mass range of 30&#8211;400&#8197;kDa in a single run while consuming only 50&#8208;ng protein material. The mass distribution of detected proteoforms or protein complexes agreed well with that from mass photometry measurement. This work represents a technical breakthrough in native proteomics for measuring complex proteomes.

The syntrophic coculture of Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri) with the electron transport specialist Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400) over carbon nitride produced a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst for the sunlight&#8208;driven methane synthesis from carbon dioxide.







Abstract
Semi&#8208;biological photosynthesis combines synthetic photosensitizers with microbial catalysts to produce sustainable fuels and chemicals from CO2. However, the inefficient transfer of photoexcited electrons to microbes leads to limited CO2 utilization, restricting the catalytic performance of such biohybrid assemblies. Here, we introduce a biological engineering solution to address the inherently sluggish electron uptake mechanism of a methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri), by coculturing it with an electron transport specialist, Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400 (KN400), an adapted strain rich with multiheme c&#8208;type cytochromes (c&#8208;Cyts) and electrically conductive protein filaments (e&#8208;PFs) made of polymerized c&#8208;Cyts with enhanced capacity for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Integration of this M. barkeri&#8208;KN400 co&#8208;culture with a synthetic photosensitizer, carbon nitride, demonstrates that c&#8208;Cyts and e&#8208;PFs, emanating from live KN400, transport photoexcited electrons efficiently from the carbon nitride to M. barkeri for methanogenesis with remarkable long&#8208;term stability and selectivity. The demonstrated cooperative interaction between two microbes via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) and the photosensitizer to assemble a semi&#8208;biological photocatalyst introduces an ecosystem engineering strategy in solar chemistry to drive sustainable chemical reactions.

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioconvergent Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Etherification of Phenols by Allylation to Access Chiral C(sp3)&#8722;O Allyl Aryl Ethers</title>

A nickel&#8208;catalyzed etherification of phenols with regioisomeric mixtures of racemic silylated and germylated allylic chlorides enables the enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent formation of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted chiral allylic aryl ethers as a single regioisomer (see Scheme). Key to success is the metalloid moiety governing the regioselectivity, and these highly functionalized allylic ethers can subsequently undergo chemoselective chemical modifications.







Abstract
An enantio&#8208; and regioconvergent allylation of phenols under nickel catalysis with an &#945;&#8208;/&#947;&#8208;regioisomeric mixture of racemic silylated/germylated allylic chlorides is reported. The silyl/germyl group governs the regioselectivity, and the transformation affords enantiomerically enriched unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl aryl ethers with excellent regiocontrol in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Notably, no nickel&#8208;mediated C&#8722;O bond activation is observed at room temperature. The synthetic value of these densely functionalized silicon&#8208;containing building blocks is demonstrated in a series of chemoselective transformations, including a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement for the construction of an &#945;&#8208;chiral silane.

         <title>Abiotic Foldamer Quaternary Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of hydrogen bond donors at precise locations at the periphery of a stable aromatic foldamer helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix tertiary fold led to its aggregation in chloroform to produce genuine discrete abiotic quaternary structures in which the tertiary folds are preserved. The quaternary structures were assigned to C3&#8208;symmetrical trimer corresponding to the initial design, and to an unexpected hydrated C2&#8208;symmetrical dimer.







Abstract
Abiotic aromatic foldamer sequences have been previously shown to fold in helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motifs in organic solvents. Using simple computational tools, a new helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix motif was designed that bears additional hydrogen bond donor OH groups to promote its aggregation into a genuine, trimeric, abiotic quaternary structure. This sequence was synthesized and its self&#8208;assembly in solution was investigated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The existence of two stable discrete aggregates was evidenced, one assigned to the initially designed trimer, the other to a dimer including multiple water molecules. The two species may be quantitatively interconverted upon changing the water content of the solution or the temperature. These results represent important steps in the design of protein&#8208;like abiotic architectures.

         <title>A DNA Polymerase Variant Senses the Epigenetic Marker 5&#8208;Methylcytosine by Increased Misincorporation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering of a Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase that distinguishes methylated from unmethylated DNA by increased misincorporation opposite 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) during DNA synthesis. By generating 5&#8197;mC&#8208;dependent mutation signatures in the PCR product, the enzyme is able to sense methylated sites and allows direct detection by reading elevated error rates at 5&#8197;mC positions after sequencing without prior conversion of the template DNA.







Abstract
Dysregulation of DNA methylation is associated with human disease, particularly cancer, and the assessment of aberrant methylation patterns holds great promise for clinical diagnostics. However, DNA polymerases do not effectively discriminate between processing 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5&#8197;mC) and unmethylated cytosine, resulting in the silencing of methylation information during amplification or sequencing. As a result, current detection methods require multi&#8208;step DNA conversion treatments or careful analysis of sequencing data to decipher individual 5&#8197;mC bases. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel DNA polymerase&#8208;mediated 5&#8197;mC detection approach. Here, we describe the engineering of a thermostable DNA polymerase variant derived from Thermus aquaticus with altered fidelity towards 5&#8197;mC. Using a screening&#8208;based evolutionary approach, we have identified a DNA polymerase that exhibits increased misincorporation towards 5&#8197;mC during DNA synthesis. This DNA polymerase generates mutation signatures at methylated CpG sites, allowing direct detection of 5&#8197;mC by reading an increased error rate after sequencing without prior treatment of the sample DNA.

         <title>Tricyanomethane or Dicyanoketenimine&#8212;Silylation makes the Difference</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first synthesis of a dicyanoketenimine, Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2, was achieved by introduction of a bulky Me3Si group, whereas the protonated species features the tricyanomethanide isomer HC(CN)3. Further silylation with [Me3Si&#8722;H&#8722;SiMe3][B(C6F5)4] led to the formation of an unusual persilylated dication [C(CN&#8722;SiMe3)3]2+ stabilized by a weakly coordinating anion.







Abstract
Pseudohalides such as tricyanomethanide, [C(CN)3]&#8722;, are well known in chemistry, biochemistry and industrial chemistry. The protonated species HC(CN)3, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a pKa value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)3 is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo&#8208; and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me3Si]+ as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)3]&#8722; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)3, namely [Me3Si][C(CN)3], and in presence of two additional [Me3Si]+ cations even the dicationic species [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+ as stable [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)3, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)3]&#8722;, silylation of the [C(CN)3]&#8722; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long&#8208;sought dicyanoketenimine [Me3Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)2]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me3Si&#8722;NC)3C]2+, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.

The protonated species HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a classic hydrogen pseudohalide Br&#248;nsted acid, is a very strong acid with a p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; value of &#8722;5. However, HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is difficult to handle as it tends to decompose rapidly or, more precisely, to oligo- and polymerize. Therefore, silylated pseudohalide compounds with the [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as the &#8220;big organometallic proton&#8221; have become interesting, exhibiting similar chemical properties but better kinetic protection. Here, the stepwise silylation of the pseudohalide anion [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is reported, forming the heavier homologue of HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, namely [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si][C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], and in presence of two additional [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations even the dicationic species [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as stable [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; salt. Surprisingly, in contrast to the protonated species HC(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, in which the proton is bound to the central carbon atom of [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, silylation of the [C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion occurs at one of the three terminal nitrogen atoms, thus forming the long-sought dicyanoketenimine [Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC&#8722;C(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. All further silylation steps take place exclusively on the terminal N atoms of the three CN groups and not on the central carbon atom, until the intriguing, highly symmetrical dication, [(Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&#8722;NC)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, is finally generated. The experimental data are supported by quantum chemical calculations in terms of thermodynamics and chemical bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Unusual (4+3) Annulation of para&#8208;Quinone Methides with Bicyclobutanes: Access to Oxabicyclo[4.1.1]Octanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1.]octanes is demonstrated via the Lewis acid catalyzed (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinone methides with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes. The reaction proceeds with the simultaneous activation of p&#8208;QMs and BCBs by Lewis acid. Mechanistically, the reaction entails the activation of the ester enolate of BCB by the Lewis acid. This method is notably straightforward in operation, proceeds efficiently under mild conditions, and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups, demonstrating a broad scope.







Abstract
Over the past few years, there has been a surge of interest in the chemistry of bicyclobutanes (BCBs). Although BCBs have been used to synthesize bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and bicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes, the synthesis of bicyclo[4.1.1]octanes has remained elusive. Herein, we report the first Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed unexpected (4+3) annulation of para&#8208;quinonemethides (p&#8208;QMs) with BCBs allowing the synthesis of oxabicyclo[4.1.1]octanes proceeding under mild conditions. With 5&#8197;mol&#8201;% of Bi(OTf)3, the reaction afforded the (4+3) annulated product in high regioselectivity and good functional group compatibility via a simultaneous Lewis acid activation of BCBs and p&#8208;QMs. The reaction is likely initiated by the 1,6&#8208;addition of Lewis acid activated BCBs to p&#8208;QMs followed by the C2&#8208;selective intramolecular addition of the phenol moiety to the generated cyclobutyl cation intermediate. Moreover, detailed mechanistic studies provided insight into the mechanism of the reaction.

         <title>Versatile Light&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Degradable Bottlebrush Polymers Using &#945;&#8208;Lipoic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>

Two&#8208;step approach to bottlebrush synthesis using &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA) enables control over side&#8208;chain chemistry and catalyst&#8208;free synthesis of degradable bottlebrush polymers.







Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers have a variety of useful properties including a high entanglement molecular weight, low Young's modulus, and rapid kinetics for self&#8208;assembly. However, the translation of bottlebrushes to real&#8208;world applications is limited by complex, multi&#8208;step synthetic pathways and polymerization reactions that rely on air&#8208;sensitive catalysts. Additionally, most bottlebrushes are non&#8208;degradable. Herein, we report an inexpensive, versatile, and simple approach to synthesize degradable bottlebrush polymers under mild reaction conditions. Our approach relies on the &#8220;grafting&#8208;through&#8221; polymerization of &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;functionalized macromonomers. These macromonomers can be polymerized under mild, catalyst&#8208;free conditions, and due to reversibility of the disulfide bond in LA, the resulting bottlebrush polymers can be depolymerized by cleaving disulfide backbone bonds. Bottlebrushes with various side&#8208;chain chemistries can be prepared through the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers, and the backbone length is governed by the macromonomer molecular weight and solvent polarity. We also demonstrate that LA&#8208;functionalized macromonomers can be copolymerized with acrylates to form degradable bottlebrush networks. This work demonstrates the preparation of degradable bottlebrush polymers with a variety of side&#8208;chain chemistries and provides insight into the light&#8208;mediated grafting&#8208;through polymerization of dithiolane&#8208;functionalized macromonomers.

         <title>Polaritonic Chemistry Enabled by Non&#8208;Local Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have designed a non&#8208;local metasurface to achieve vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between surface lattice resonance and the C=O stretching modes of both ethyl acetate and p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA). Within this VSC system, we observed a 2.7&#8208;fold increase in the solvolysis reaction of PNPA compared to the bare reaction. This finding highlights the robustness of metasurfaces in catalyzing chemical reactions via VSC.







Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling can modify chemical reaction pathways in unconventional ways. Thus far, Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities formed by pairs of facing mirrors have been mostly utilized to achieve vibrational strong coupling. In this study, we demonstrate the application of non&#8208;local metasurfaces that can sustain surface lattice resonances, enabling chemical reactions under vibrational strong coupling. We show that the solvolysis kinetics of para&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate can be accelerated by a factor of 2.7 by strong coupling to the carbonyl bond of the solvent and the solute with a surface lattice resonance. Our work introduces a new platform to investigate polaritonic chemical reactions. In contrast to Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, metasurfaces define open optical cavities with single surfaces, which removes alignment hurdles, facilitating polaritonic chemistry across large areas.

The application of high&#8208;resolution rotational spectroscopy coupled with comprehensive theoretical calculations provides a first observation and analysis of the c&#8208;C5H8&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster, unveiling the subtle interplay of forces that govern its formation.







Abstract
This study delves into driving forces behind the formation of a hetero ternary cluster consisting of volatile organic compounds from industrial or combustion sources, specifically cyclopentene, alongside greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and water vapor. While substantial progress has been made in understanding binary complexes, the structural intricacies of hetero ternary clusters remain largely uncharted. Our research characterized the cyclopentene&#8722;CO2&#8722;H2O hetero ternary cluster utilizing Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The observed isomer in the pulsed jet has CO2 and H2O aligning above the cyclopentene ring, with water undergoing an internal rotation approximately about its C2 symmetry axis. Theoretical analyses support these observations, identifying an O&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; hydrogen bond and a secondary C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O tetrel bond within this cluster. This study marks a critical step towards comprehending the molecular dynamics and interactions of VOCs, greenhouse gases, and water in the atmosphere, paving the way for further investigations into their roles in climate dynamics and air quality.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Construction of C&#8208; and Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silacyclopentanes via Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 48, November 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cascade hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with dihydrosilanes or primary silanes, which gives access to a variety of C&#8208;stereogenic and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in decent yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
Silacycles have exhibited significant potential for application in the fields of medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials science. Accordingly, the development of effective methods for synthesizing these compounds has attracted increasing attention. Here, we report an efficient Cu&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective hydrosilylation of arylmethylenecyclopropanes with hydrosilanes, that allows the rapid assembly of various enantioenriched carbon&#8208; and silicon&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities under mild conditions. Further stereospecific transformation of the Si&#8722;H bond on the chiral silicon center expands the diversity of these C&#8208; and Si&#8208;stereogenic silacyclopentanes.

         <title>A Carbazole&#8208;Centered Expanded Helicene Stabilized with Hexabenzocoronene (HBC) Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and stabilization of heteroatom&#8208;doped nanocarbon molecules, such as carbazole&#8208;containing (super)helicenes, present significant challenges due to the complexities involved in maintaining structural integrity and electronic functionality. In this study, we successfully synthesized a carbazole&#8208;centered expanded tris&#8208;hexabenzo[7]helicene (1) via a facile FeCl3&#8208;mediated Scholl coupling reaction. 1 exhibits both chemical and chiral stability and demonstrates fluorescence at 628 nm with a quantum yield of 0.40. Additionally, the enantiomers of 1 display pronounced chiroptical properties, including a distinct circular dichroism (CD) signal spanning from 300 to 600 nm. The absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) is determined to be 2.98 &#215; 10&#8722;3, while the circularly polarized luminescence brightness (BCPL) is measured as 32.50 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Perchlorate Activation Enabled by a Dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perchlorate, initially regarded as a weakly coordinating counterion rather than a reactive oxidizing reagent due to its kinetic stability, has garnered attention for its potential in microbial systems. Under anaerobic conditions, microbes utilize perchlorate as a terminal oxidant for methane oxidation, involving two distinct stages: extraction and release of oxidizing ability. This two&#8208;phase activation process necessitates the collaborative action of multiple enzymes, a phenomenon not extensively explored in artificial systems. To address this issue, a dinuclear Fe&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complex 1 was designed to enable the two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate. Initially, complex 1 extracts the oxidative potential of perchlorate, leading to the formation of Fe(III)&#8208;O&#8208;Fe(III) complex 2 as the oxidation product. Subsequently, the extracted oxidative potential can be released by photolyzing a mixture of complex 2 and 9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene. In contrast to the commonly observed selectivity, the homocoupling product 5 was identified as the major product in this C&#8208;H activation reaction. Further, a catalytic C&#8208;H activation reaction is initiated under anaerobic conditions to selectively form the C&#8208;C coupling product, achieving the complete two&#8208;phase activation of perchlorate using a single artificial catalyst. This work provides a new paradigm for constructing biomimetic anaerobic oxidation using kinetically inert high&#8208;valent oxygenated acid anions as oxidants.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Chirality Transfer in Self&#8208;Assembled Nanocomposites Powered by A Trace Amount of Chiral Dimeric Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembly has markedly advanced the development of chiral materials. While the Sergeant and Soldiers principle allows for chirality amplification, it necessitates precise shape&#8208;matching between chiral and achiral molecules, leading to a low chirality transfer efficiency&#8212;where one chiral molecule influences the chirality of a limited number of achiral molecules. Here, we show that this efficiency can be markedly enhanced by introducing chiral dimeric molecules. In this work, a single chiral molecule can control the chirality of up to 200 achiral molecules and even direct the assembly of inorganic nanoparticles into chiral nanocomposites through a sequential chirality transfer process. Moreover, this approach exhibits remarkable robustness, operating effectively without necessitating a precise match between chiral and achiral molecules. Consequently, using the same chiral molecules at an exceptionally low molar fraction (0.5 mol%) allows for the chiral&#8208;selective assembly of achiral molecules over a broad spectrum, regardless of their packing habits, thus facilitating the creation of otherwise inaccessible chiral materials with modulated chiroptical properties. Last but not least, even a trace amount of chiral molecules can enhance the elastic modulus of the self&#8208;assembled nanocomposites by a factor of eight.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The persistence of defects in polycrystalline membranes poses a substantial obstacle to reaching the theoretical molecular sieving separation and scaling up production. The low membrane selectivity in most reported literature is largely due to the unavoidable non&#8208;selective defects during synthesis, leading to a mismatch between the well&#8208;defined pore structure of polycrystalline molecular sieve materials. This paper presents a novel approach for minimizing non&#8208;selective defects in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes by a constricted crystal growth strategy in a confined environment. The in&#8208;situ ZIF formation using the densely packed seeding array between the substrate and the pre&#8208;grown top ZIF layer yields a confined membrane interlayer, which is highly uniform with a tightly packed crystalline structure. Unlike uncontrolled crystal growth, we purposely regulate the interlayer membrane growth in the direction parallel to the substrate. A notable 99% decrease in defects in the confined interlayer was achieved compared to the random&#8208;grown top layer, leading to a ~353% increment in H2/N2 selectivity over the non&#8208;confined reference MOF membrane. The performance of this new membrane sits in the optimal range above the Robeson upper bound. The membrane boasts a balanced high H2 permeability (&gt;5000 Barrer) and selectivity (&gt;50), significantly surpassing peer ZIF membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Glycerol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising candidate to couple with cathodic reaction, like hydrogen evolution reaction, to produce high&#8208;value product with less energy consumption. Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs), comprising square&#8208;planar metal&#8208;coordination motifs (e.g., MO4, M(NH)4, MS4), are notable for their programable active sites, intrinsic charge transport, and excellent stability, making them promising catalyst candidates for GOR. Here, we introduce a novel class of 2D c&#8208;MOFs electrocatalysts, M2[NiPcS8] (M=Co/Ni/Cu), which are synthesized via coordination of octathiolphthalocyaninato nickel (NiPc(SH)8) with various metal centers. Due to a fast kinetic and high activity of CoS4 sites for GOR, the electrocatalytic tests demonstrate that Co2[NiPcS8] supported on carbon paper displays a low GOR potential of 1.35 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm&#8208;2, significantly reducing the overall water&#8208;electrolysis&#8208;voltage reduction by 0.27 V from oxygen evolution reaction to GOR, thereby outperforming Ni2[NiPcS8] and Cu2[NiPcS8]. Additionally, we have determined that the GOR activity of CoX4 linkage sites varies with different heteroatoms, following an experimentally and theoretically confirmed activity order of CoS4&gt;CoO4&gt;Co(NH)4. The GOR performance of Co2[NiPcS8] not only demonstrate superior performance among non&#8208;noble metal complex, but also provides critical insights on designing high&#8208;performance MOF electrocatalysts upon optimizing the electronic environment of active sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Sulfoximine&#8208;Bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes: Functionalizable, Tuneable and Cysteine&#8208;Selective Chiral Warheads</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic covalent warheads with appropriate reactivity and selectivity are crucial to the investigation of protein function and the discovery of therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of sulfoximine bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) as novel thiol reactive chiral warheads, achieved in one&#8208;pot from methylsulfoximines. Unusually the warhead can then be derivatized, keeping the BCB intact, over 3 vectors: i) sulfoximine N&#8208;modification instills a broad range of strain&#8208;release reactivity; ii) sp2&#8208;cross&#8208;coupling reactions on aryl&#8208;BCB&#8208;sulfoximines allows direct diversification, and iii) functionalization of the BCB motif itself is achieved by metalation and trapping with electrophiles. The BCB sulfoximines are shown to react selectively with cysteine including in a protein model (CDK2) under biocompatible conditions. Preliminary data indicate suitability for chemoproteomic applications, and enantioselective cysteine&#8208;labelling. The reactivity of sulfoximine BCBs with electron withdrawing groups on nitrogen is comparable to acrylamides with low to moderate reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Iron(IV) Alkynylide Complexes and Their Reactivity to Form 1,3&#8208;diynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The isolation of thermally unstable and highly reactive organoiron(IV) complexes is a challenge for synthetic chemists. In particular, the number of examples where the C&#8208;based ligand is not part of the chelating ligand remains scarce. These compounds are of interest because they could pave the way to designing catalytic cycles of bond forming reactions proceeding via organoiron(IV) intermediates. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization, including single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, of a family of alkynylferrates(III) and Fe(IV) alkynylide complexes. The alkynylferrates(III) are formed by transmetalation of the Fe(III) precursor [(N3N&#8217;)FeIII] (N3N&#8217; is tris(N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldimethylsilyl&#8208;2&#8208;amidoethyl)amine)) with lithium alkynylides, and their further one&#8208;electron oxidation enables the synthesis of the corresponding Fe(IV) alkynylides. The electronic structure of this family of organometallic Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes has been thoroughly investigated by spectroscopic methods (EPR, NMR, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, X&#8208;Ray absorption (XAS) and emission (XES) spectroscopies) and theoretical calculations. While alkynylferrates(III) are sluggish to engage into C&#8211;C bond forming processes, the Fe(IV) alkynylides react to afford 1,3&#8208;diynes at room temperature. A bimolecular reductive elimination from a bimetallic iron(IV) intermediate to form the 1,3&#8208;diynes is proposed based on the mechanistic investigations performed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Three&#8208;Component &#945;&#8208;Allylic Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Esters by Synergistic Photoinduced Pd/Carbonyl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis has emerged as an intriguing strategy for unlocking new reactivity potential of simple substrates. However, the related transformations are still limited and the enantiocontrol remains challenging. Organocatalysis displays unique capability in substrate activation and stereocontrol. Combination of organocatalysis and photoinduced excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis may provide opportunities to develop new enantioselective reactions from simple substrates. By applying cooperative triple catalysis including excited&#8208;state Pd catalysis, ground&#8208;state Pd catalysis, and carbonyl catalysis, we have successfully realized enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylic alkylation of &#945;&#8208;amino esters with simple styrene and alkyl halide starting materials. The reaction allows rapid modular assembly of the three reaction partners into a variety of chiral quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino esters in good yields with 90&#8208;99% ee, without protecting group manipulations at the active NH2 group. The cooperation of the chiral pyridoxal catalyst and the chiral phosphine ligand accounts for the excellent chirality induction.</dc:description>

         <title>Aptamer and DNAzyme Based Colorimetric Biosensors for Pathogen&#160;Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The detection of pathogens is critical for preventing and controlling health hazards across clinical, environmental, and food safety sectors. Functional nucleic acids (FNAs), such as aptamers and DNAzymes, have emerged as versatile molecular tools for pathogen detection due to their high specificity and affinity. This review focuses on the in vitro selection of FNAs for pathogens, with emphasis on the selection of aptamers for specific biomarkers and intact pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Additionally, the selection of DNAzymes for bacterial detection is discussed. The integration of these FNAs into colorimetric biosensors has enabled the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective diagnostic platforms. Both non&#8208;catalytic and catalytic colorimetric biosensors are explored, including those based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), polydiacetylenes (PDAs), protein enzymes, G&#8208;quadruplexes, and nanozymes. These biosensors offer visible detection through color changes, making them ideal for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future perspectives for advancing FNA&#8208;based colorimetric biosensing technologies for pathogen detection.</dc:description>

The hollow carbon carrier design of the Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst can facilitate increased active site exposure and improved mass transfer, achieving industrial&#8208;level current density within the membrane electrode assembly. Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C achieved nearly 100&#8201;% CO selectivity across the wide current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Designing efficient catalysts for operating CO2 electroreduction in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) faces significant obstacles. Herein, we propose an asymmetrically coordinated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst featuring axial Br coordination at NiN4Br sites anchoring onto hollow Br/N co&#8208;doped carbon nanocages, achieved through a NaBr&#8208;assisted confined&#8208;pyrolysis strategy. The Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C catalyst exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO&gt;97&#8201;%) over the current density range of 50 to 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in the MEA device. Furthermore, Ni&#8208;NBr&#8208;C shows a stable cell voltage of 2.66&#177;0.2&#8197;V while delivering a large current density of 350&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 over an 85&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation, demonstrating its potential for industrial&#8208;scale applications. Advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the coordination and doping of Br not only enhance the intrinsic activity but also highlight that the unique pore structure improves mass transfer efficiency.

         <title>Localized Oxidative Catalytic Reactions Triggered by Cavitation Bubbles Confinement on Copper Oxide Microstructured Particles.</title>

         <dc:description>
Localised oxidative catalytic reactions triggered by cavitation bubbles confinement on copper oxide microstructured particles.We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates selective and localised acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, minimising the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes towards catalytic oxidative reactions.







Abstract
Efficient energy transfer management in catalytic processes is crucial for overcoming activation energy barriers while minimizing costs and CO2 emissions. We exploit here a concept of CuO particle design with multiple gas&#8208;stabilizing sites, engineered to function as cavitation nuclei and catalysts. This concept facilitates the selective and efficient acoustic energy transfer directly to the catalyst surface, avoiding the undesired dissipation of acoustic energy into the bulk solution while demonstrating superior cavitation properties at lower acoustic pressure amplitudes. Utilizing a chemical thermometric approach, we demonstrate that the local temperature on the surface of our CuO particles during cavitation bubble implosions can create an effective equivalent temperature of about 360&#8201;&#176;C. This temperature effect facilitates the efficient catalysis of oxidative reactions using an organic pollutant probe molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to assess the decomposition of H2O2 and of pollutant probe molecule on CuO (111). Our work represents a significant advance in sonocatalytic systems, promising efficient energy use in catalytic reactions.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired N, O Co&#8208;Coordinated Manganese Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom catalyst (Mn CD/C) with MnN2O2 atomic sites on the carbon dots exhibited excellent performance in electrocatalytic oxygen reduction to hydrogen peroxide, owing to the electronic regulation effect of coordination environment and adjacent oxygen functional groups.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a pivotal pathway for the distributed production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In nature, enzymes containing manganese (Mn) centers can convert reactive oxygen species into H2O2. However, Mn&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts for 2e&#8722; ORR are scarcely reported. Herein, we developed a nature&#8208;inspired single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst comprising N, O co&#8208;coordinated Mn sites, utilizing carbon dots as the modulation platform (Mn CD/C). As&#8208;synthesized Mn CD/C exhibited exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.786&#8197;V and a maximum H2O2 selectivity of 95.8&#8201;%. Impressively, Mn CD/C continuously produced 0.1&#8197;M H2O2 solution at 200&#8197;mA/cm2 for 50&#8197;h in the flow cell, with negligible loss in activity and H2O2 faradaic efficiency, demonstrating practical application potential. The enhanced activity was attributed to the incorporation of Mn atomic sites into the carbon dots. Theoretical calculations revealed that the N, O co&#8208;coordinated structure, combined with abundant oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups on the carbon dots, optimized the binding strength of intermediate *OOH at the Mn sites to the apex of the catalytic activity volcano. This work illustrates that carbon dots can serve as a versatile platform for modulating the microenvironment of single&#8208;atom catalysts and for the rational design of nature&#8208;inspired catalysts.

         <title>Customizing Bonding Affinity with Multi&#8208;Intermediates via Interfacial Electron Capture to Boost Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative dual&#8208;nitride (WN&#8208;Ni3N) metallic heterostructure, featuring perfect lattice matching and high conductivity, was synthesized to function as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst, fine&#8208;tuning bonding orbital filling with alkaline HER intermediates. The heterointerface charge redistribution accelerates OH&#8722; transfer and H2 release, boosting performance and durability to last 1300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 for water splitting.







Abstract
Developing efficient and earth&#8208;abundant alkaline HER electrocatalysts is pivotal for sustainable energy, but co&#8208;regulating its intricate multi&#8208;step process, encompassing water dissociation, OH&#8722; desorption, and hydrogen generation, is still a great challenge. Herein, we tackle these obstacles by fabricating a vertically integrated electrode featuring a nanosheet array with prominent dual&#8208;nitride metallic heterostructures characterized by impeccable lattice matching and excellent conductivity, functioning as a multi&#8208;purpose catalyst to fine&#8208;tune the bonding affinity with alkaline HER intermediates. Detailed structural characterization and theoretical calculation elucidate that charge redistribution at the heterointerface reduces the O p&#8208;W d and H s&#8208;W d interactions vs. single nitride, thereby enhancing OH&#8722; transfer and H2 release. As anticipated, the resulting WN&#8208;NiN/CFP catalyst demonstrates a gratifying low overpotential of 36.8&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA/cm2 for alkaline HER, while concurrently maintaining operational stability for 1300&#8197;h at 100&#8197;mA/cm2 for overall water splitting. This work presents an effective approach to meticulously optimize multiple site&#8208;intermediate interactions in alkaline HER, laying the foundation for efficient energy conversion.

         <title>A Knowledge&#8211;Data Dual&#8208;Driven Framework for Predicting the Molecular Properties of Rechargeable Battery Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI) framework, driven by both knowledge and data, predicts electrolyte molecular properties. The KPI collects data, uncovers structure&#8211;property relationships, accurately predicts melting, boiling, and flash points, and identifies promising molecules for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range battery applications. It serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and domain knowledge.







Abstract
Developing rechargeable batteries that operate within a wide temperature range and possess high safety has become necessary with increasing demands. Rapid and accurate assessment of the melting points (MPs), boiling points (BPs), and flash points (FPs) of electrolyte molecules is essential for expediting battery development. Herein, we introduce Knowledge&#8208;based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI), a knowledge&#8211;data dual&#8208;driven framework for molecular property prediction of electrolytes. Initially, the KPI collects molecular structures and properties, and then automatically organizes them into structured datasets. Subsequently, interpretable machine learning further explores the structure&#8211;property relationships of molecules from a microscopic perspective. Finally, by embedding the discovered knowledge into property prediction models, the KPI achieved very low mean absolute errors of 10.4, 4.6, and 4.8&#8197;K for MP, BP, and FP predictions, respectively. The KPI reached state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art results in 18 out of 20 datasets. Utilizing molecular neighbor search and high&#8208;throughput screening, 15 and 14 promising molecules, with and without Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number, respectively, were predicted for wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range and high&#8208;safety batteries. The KPI not only accurately predicts molecular properties and deepens the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships but also serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and domain knowledge.

&lt;p&gt;Developing rechargeable batteries that operate within a wide temperature range and possess high safety has become necessary with increasing demands. Rapid and accurate assessment of the melting points (MPs), boiling points (BPs), and flash points (FPs) of electrolyte molecules is essential for expediting battery development. Herein, we introduce Knowledge-based electrolyte Property prediction Integration (KPI), a knowledge&#8211;data dual-driven framework for molecular property prediction of electrolytes. Initially, the KPI collects molecular structures and properties, and then automatically organizes them into structured datasets. Subsequently, interpretable machine learning further explores the structure&#8211;property relationships of molecules from a microscopic perspective. Finally, by embedding the discovered knowledge into property prediction models, the KPI achieved very low mean absolute errors of 10.4, 4.6, and 4.8&#8197;K for MP, BP, and FP predictions, respectively. The KPI reached state-of-the-art results in 18 out of 20 datasets. Utilizing molecular neighbor search and high-throughput screening, 15 and 14 promising molecules, with and without Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number, respectively, were predicted for wide-temperature-range and high-safety batteries. The KPI not only accurately predicts molecular properties and deepens the understanding of structure&#8211;property relationships but also serves as an efficient framework for integrating artificial intelligence and domain knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Covalent Triazine Framework for Photocatalytic Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydrofunctionalizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydro&#8208;functionalization of alkenes is essential for synthesizing natural products, medicinally relevant compounds, and other important molecules. In this context, photocatalysis has emerged as a crucial tool for these reactions. However, existing methods rely on either expensive, or scarce metal photocatalysts, rendering this strategy less feasible for industrial applications. Herein, we disclose the first inexpensive porous heterogeneous material (oxidizing potential: +2.37&#8197;V vs SCE) designed to bridge the existing research gap. The careful selection of monomers to prepare the material enables us to achieve hydrocarboxylation, hydroamination, and hydroazidation across a wide range of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates.







Abstract
Porous materials&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalysts, performing selective organic transformations, are increasing the applicability of photocatalytic reactions due to their ability to merge traditional photocatalysis with structured pores densely decorated with catalytic moiety for efficient mass and charge transfer, as well as added recyclability. We herein disclose a porous crystalline covalent triazine framework (CTF)&#8208;based heterogeneous photocatalyst that exhibits excellent photoredox properties for different hydrofunctionalization reactions such as hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination and hydroazidations. The high oxidizing property of this CTF enables the activation of styrenes, followed by regioselective C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond formation at ambient conditions. A change in the physicochemical and optoelectronic properties of the CTF, upon protonation during catalysis, lies at the basis of its photocatalytic properties. This allows us to obtain hydrocarboxylations, hydroamination, and hydroazidations from a myriad of electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing aromatic and aliphatic substrates. This catalytic approach is further extended to late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active molecules. Finally, detailed characterizations of the CTF and further mechanistic investigations provide mechanistic insights into these reactions.

NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung/6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade leading to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles is presented. The nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates are intercepted with unactivated alkynes for the first time. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8722;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise regioselective 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization manner.







Abstract
The umpolung of aldimines using N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) is less explored compared to the established polarity reversal of aldehydes. Described herein is an NHC&#8208;catalyzed imine umpolung /6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization cascade, which leads to the atom&#8208; and pot&#8208;economic synthesis of biologically important dihydrochromeno indoles. For the first time, the nucleophilic aza&#8208;Breslow intermediates have been intercepted with unactivated alkynes. Preliminary mechanistic and DFT studies shed light on the role of the phenolic &#8722;OH moiety in promoting the addition of the aza&#8208;Breslow intermediate to the unactivated alkyne via an intramolecular proton transfer in a stepwise manner. DFT studies also support the regioselectivity preference for the 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization pathway, leading to the exclusive formation of the indole products. Moreover, a comparison of Gibbs free energies provides insight into a thermodynamically preferred 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization over a competing oxa&#8208;Michael pathway. Further, this strategy is applied to the formal synthesis of a Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor in a step&#8208;economical method.

         <title>Controlled Helical Organization in Supramolecular Polymers of Pseudo&#8208;Macrocyclic Tetrakisporphyrins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrakisporphyrins with amino acid side chains adopt pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic conformations maintained by antiparallel hydrogen bonding. The (S)&#8208; and (R)&#8208;configurations of the stereogenic centers direct the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations, respectively. The chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;conformations direct the left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed helical supramolecular pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers, respectively.







Abstract
Tetrakisporphyrin monomers with amino acid side chains at each end form intramolecular antiparallel hydrogen&#8208;bonds to adopt chirally twisted pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic structures that result in right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;conformations. The pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic tetrakisporphyrin monomers self&#8208;assembled to form supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers via head&#8208;to&#8208;head complementary dimerization of the bisporphyrin cleft units in an isodesmic manner. The formation of one&#8208;handed supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers was confirmed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The methyl and iso&#8208;propyl groups at the stereogenic center greatly enhanced the induced circular dichroism in the Soret bands of the supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymers. The induced CDs were reduced upon the introduction of large iso&#8208;butyl and tert&#8208;butyl groups. Atomic force microscopy revealed well&#8208;grown and long supramolecular helical pseudo&#8208;polycatenane polymer chains with chain lengths in the range of 361 to 13.6&#8197;nm. The right&#8208;handed helical chains were established by the self&#8208;assembly of the right&#8208;handed (P)&#8208;conformation of the pseudo&#8208;macrocyclic monomer.

         <title>Electronic Modulation and Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Driving Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst Ni&#8722;NSC with undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties implanting in N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics, significantly improving the adsorption, diffusion and reduce reaction energy barrier during sulfur redox reaction. The Li&#8722;S battery employing Ni&#8722;NSC demonstrated high reversible capacity, superior rate capability and outstanding cycling stability.







Abstract
Developing efficient and durable single&#8208;atom catalysts is vitally important for the sulfur redox reaction (SROR) in Li&#8722;S battery, while it remains enormous challenging. Herein, undercoordinated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties anchored on N,S&#8208;codoped porous carbon (Ni&#8722;NSC) is obtained to enhance the SROR. The experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge transfer in Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst originates from tuning effect of sulfur atoms mediated Ni&#8722;N3 moieties, which can both facilitate the chemical adsorption by formation of N&#8722;Ni&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Sn2&#8722;, and achieve a rapid redox conversion of polysulfides because of the enhanced electron transfer. As results, the Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery delivers a very high initial reversible capacity (1025&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C), as well as outstanding cycling&#8208;stability for 2400&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C and 3&#8197;C, respectively. Noteworthy, the areal capacity can reach 7.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0.05&#8197;C and a retention capacity of 4.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C for Ni&#8722;NSC based Li&#8722;S battery with sulfur loading of 5.88&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work provides profound insight for rational optimizing microscopic electronic density of active site to promoting SROR in metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Asymmetric Palladium Migration for Synthesis of Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Cage o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric Pd migration is described to achieve enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes. High efficiency with up to 98&#8201;% ee can be achieved in this Pd catalyzed alkenylation and iodo&#8208;migration tandem reaction, which can be applied in the further one&#8208;pot preparation of bifunctionalized chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives.







Abstract
Metal migration strategy can offer BH functionalization of o&#8208;carboranes at different positions from where initial bond activation occurs to achieve bifunctionalized o&#8208;carboranes in one reaction. We report in this article an enantioselective 3,4&#8208;bifunctionalization of o&#8208;carboranes via asymmetric Pd migration with a high efficiency and up to 98&#8201;% ee. This asymmetric catalysis has a broad substrates scope, leading to the preparation of a class of chiral&#8208;at&#8208;cage o&#8208;carborane derivatives. The enantiocontrol model is suggested on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) results, where the chiral Trost ligand plays a crucial role in this enantioselective Pd migration from exo&#8208;alkenyl sp2 C to the cage B(4) position of o&#8208;carborane.

         <title>Sequence&#8208;Defined Synthesis Enabled by Fast and Living Anionic Monoaddition of Vinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flash&#8208;flow living anionic monoaddition of alkyllithium initiators to vinyl monomers such as styrenes and methacrylates has been achieved in a selective manner. This method has been successfully applied to the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multiple vinyl monomers (six&#8208;component addition at maximum).







Abstract
The selective monoaddition of polymerizable vinyl monomers like styrenes and methacrylates in a living manner has been achieved for the flash&#8208;flow preparation of molecules in a defined sequence with high selectivity. We demonstrated the sequence&#8208;defined synthesis of multifunctional molecules using an initiator, functionalized styrenes, diarylethylenes, various methacrylates, and an electrophilic trapping reagent at the living terminus (six&#8208;component sequential connection at maximum) without any intermediate purification steps. The anionic living terminus of the vinyl monomers in the flow system described herein is active for polymerization, such that the styrene or methacrylate sequence can be expanded to afford highly dispersed oligomers without affecting other single units, which means that the unequivocal sequences were successfully inserted into the internal or terminal positions. The methodology described herein provides an adaptable method for the construction of new molecular spaces based on unimolecular sequence control and pinpoint functionalization.

         <title>From Ions to Crystals: A Comprehensive View of the Non&#8208;Classical Nucleation of Calcium Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium sulfate is a mineral of considerable relevance for various industrial and geochemical processes. In the present work, the formation of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum) crystals from aqueous solutions has been elucidated in detail through application of a complementary suite of advanced characterization techniques. The results show how crystalline order emerges from intrinsically disordered precursors and highlights the complexity of mineral nucleation.







Abstract
The early stages of mineralization continue to be in the focus of intensive research due to their inherent importance for natural and engineered environments. While numerous observations have been reported for single steps in the pathways of various crystallizing phases in previous studies, the complexity of the underlying processes and their elusive character have left central questions unanswered in most cases. In the present work, we provide a detailed view on the nucleation of calcium sulfate mineralization&#8212;an abundant mineral with broad use in construction industry&#8212;in aqueous systems at ambient conditions. As experimental basis, a co&#8208;titration procedure with potentiometric, turbidimetric and conductometric detection was developed, allowing solution speciation and the formation of crystallization precursors to be monitored quantitatively as the level of nominal (super)saturation gradually increases. The nature and spatiotemporal evolution of these precursors was further elucidated by time&#8208;resolved small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) experiments, complemented by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) as a direct imaging technique. The results reveal how ions associate into nanometric primary species, which subsequently aggregate and develop anisotropic order by intrinsic structural reorganization. Our observations challenge the common understanding of fundamental notions such as the nucleation barrier or the meaning of supersaturation, with broad implications for mineralization phenomena in general and the formation of calcium sulfate in geochemical settings and industrial applications in particular.

         <title>Natural Polyphenol&#8208;Reinforced Ion&#8208;Selective Separators for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries with High Sulfur Loading and Lean Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective separators are prepared by spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator. The high electronegativity and strong lithiophilicity of these phenolic compounds ensure superior ion&#8208;selectivity, effectively repelling soluble intermediate anions while facilitating rapid Li ion transport. Thus, the lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries display superior cycling stability and rate performance under challenging conditions.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;selective separators are promising to inhibit soluble intermediates shuttle in practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. However, designing and fabricating such high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective separators using cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly, and versatile methods remains a formidable challenge. Here we present ion&#8208;selective separators fabricated via the spontaneous deposition of green tea&#8208;derived polyphenols onto a polypropylene separator, aimed at enhancing the stability of Li&#8722;S batteries. The resulting natural polyphenol&#8208;reinforced ion&#8208;selective (NPRIS24) separators exhibit rapid Li ion transport and high soluble intermediates inhibition capability with an ultralow shuttle rate of 0.67&#8201;% for Li2S4, 0.19&#8201;% for Li2S6 and 0.10&#8201;% for Li2S8. This superior ion&#8208;selectivity arises from the high electronegativity and strong lithiophilic nature of the phenolic compounds. Consequently, we have achieved high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries that are steadily cyclable under the challenging conditions of an S loading of 5.7&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, an electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;S ratio of 5.1&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1, and a 50&#8197;&#956;m Li foil anode. Furthermore, the NPRIS24 separator enhances the performance of other Li metal batteries utilizing commercial LiFePO4 (5.3&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (9.9&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) cathodes. This work underscores the potential of utilizing natural polyphenols for the design of advanced ion&#8208;selective separators in energy storage systems.

         <title>Live&#8208;Cell Identification of Inhibitors of the Lipid Transfer Protein CERT Using Nanoluciferase Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (NanoBRET)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
There are many assays for monitoring enzymatic reactions. But how can the intracellular transport of lipids be analyzed efficiently? Here, an assay for the ceramide transfer protein CERT using nanoluciferase bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) is presented. A combinatorial synthesis of analogs of a known inhibitor was used for validation and identified inhibitors with superior potency.







Abstract
A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red&#8208;labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT&#8208;mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell&#8208;based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility of the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA&#8208;12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid&#8208;phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA&#8208;12 in a subsequent dose&#8208;response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BRET system is described, in which Nanoluciferase was fused to the lipid transfer protein CERT for efficient energy transfer to a Nile red-labeled ceramide, which is either directly bound to CERT or transported to the adjacent Golgi membrane. Bulk formation of sphingomyelin, a major plasma membrane component in mammals, is dependent on CERT-mediated transfer of its predecessor ceramide. CERT is considered a promising drug target but no direct cell-based methods exist to efficiently identify inhibitors. The utility of the method was demonstrated by a library of 140 derivatives of the CERT inhibitor HPA-12. These were obtained in a combinatorial synthesis using solid-phase transacylation. Screening of the library led to six compounds that were picked and confirmed to be superior to HPA-12 in a subsequent dose-response study and also in an orthogonal lipidomics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C(sp3)&#8722;F Bond Activation by Lewis Base&#8208;Boryl Radicals via Concerted Electron&#8208;Fluoride Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer (cEF&#8722;T) mechanism is revealed for C(sp3)&#8722;F activation by Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals (LBBRs) with the aid of DFT calculations. Orbital interaction analyses have been conducted for rational design of LBBRs that could selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes, which enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom from fluorocarbons and the generation of an alkyl radical, broadening the scope of XAT reactions.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;F bond activation through a radical pathway in the presence of multiple C&#8722;H bonds remains a formidable challenge, owing to the extraordinarily strong bond strength of the C&#8722;F bond. By the aid of density functional theory calculations, we disclose an innovative concerted electron&#8208;fluoride transfer mechanism, harnessing the unique reactivity of Lewis base&#8208;boryl radicals to selectively activate the resilient C&#8722;F bonds in fluoroalkanes. This enables the direct abstraction of a fluorine atom and subsequent generation of an alkyl radical, thus expanding the boundaries of halogen atom transfer reactions.

         <title>Application of Hard and Soft Acid&#8208;base Theory to Construct Heterometallic Materials with Metal&#8208;oxo Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterometallic materials are favored for their diverse structures and enhanced functionality compared to monometallic counterparts. However, their development is often impeded by complex metal coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview showcases the application of Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory as a powerful tool to streamline the design and synthesis of heterometallic clusters and cluster&#8208;based frameworks. Additionally, it briefly explores the synergistic effects that these clusters impart on the properties of heterometallic materials, offering valuable insights for researchers seeking to harness their full potential.







Abstract
Heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials offer the potential to incorporate multiple functionalities, leveraging the aggregation effects of clusters and translating this heterogeneity and complexity into unexpected properties that are more than just the sum of their components. However, the rational construction of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials remains challenging due to the complexity of metal cation coordination and structural unpredictability. This minireview provides insights into a general synthetic strategy based on Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) theory, summarizing its advantages in the designed synthesis of discrete heterometallic clusters (intracluster assembly) and infinite heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials (intercluster assembly). Furthermore, it emphasizes the potential to exploit the intrinsic properties of mixed components to achieve breakthroughs across a broad range of applications. The insights from this review are expected to drive the progress of heterometallic cluster&#8208;based materials in a controllable and predictable manner.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Boron&#8208;Stereogenic and Axially Chiral BODIPYs via Rhodium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H (Hetero) Arylation with Diazonaphthoquinones and Diazoindenines</title>

         <dc:description>
The rhodium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction between boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) and a variety of naphthodiazoquinones and diazoindenines via C&#8722;H (hetero)arylation pathways selectively leads to 2&#8208;(hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs in high yields and excellent stereoselectivities. The synthetic value of the procedures is showcased by BODIPY&#8208;derived functional molecule construction and scaffold diversification. Bioapplications of tailored BODIPYs indicate their promising properties in multidisciplinary research.







Abstract
The molecular engineering of boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) has garnered widespread attention due to their structural diversity enabling tailored physicochemical properties for optimal applications. However, catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse boron&#8208;stereogenic BODIPYs through intermolecular desymmetrization and BODIPYs with atroposelectivity remains elusive. Here, we showcase rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;specific C&#8722;H (hetero)arylations of prochiral BODIPYs and polysubstituted BODIPYs with diazonaphthoquinonesand diazoindenines, providing efficient pathways for the rapid assembly of versatile (hetero)arylated boron&#8208;stereogenic and axially chiral BODIPYs through long&#8208;range desymmetrization and axial rotational restriction modes. The synthetic application of the procedures has been emphasized by the efficient synthesis of BODIPY derivatives with various functions. Photophysical properties, bioimaging, and lipid droplet&#8208;specific targeting capability of tailored BODIPYs are also demonstrated, indicating their promising applications in biomedical research, medicinal chemistry, and material science.

         <title>A Double&#8208;walled Noncovalent Carbon Nanotube by Columnar Packing of Nanotube Fragments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB, which represents the shortest fragment of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes, has been synthesized. While the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotube structure.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of double&#8208;walled noncovalent carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through host&#8211;guest complexation of nanotube fragments and tube&#8208;forming crystal engineering. As the smallest fragment of double&#8208;walled CNTs, a host&#8211;guest complex of perfluorocycloparaphenylene (PFCPP) and carbon nanobelt (CNB) was synthesized by mixing them in solvents. The immediate complexation of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex with a remarkably high association constant (Ka) of 2&#215;105&#8197;L/mol was observed. Time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR and thermogravimetry measurements revealed that the stability of (6,6)CNB was significantly improved by encapsulation. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the robust belt&#8208;in&#8208;ring structure of this complex. As indicated by the short distance between PF[12]CPP and (6,6)CNB (2.8&#8197;&#197;), intermolecular orbital interactions exist between the belt and the ring, which were further supported by theoretical calculation and phosphorescence quenching experiments. While the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex adopts various crystal packing structures, chloroform was discovered to be a magic &#8220;glue&#8221; solvent inducing one&#8208;dimensional alignment of the PF[12]CPP&#11815;(6,6)CNB complex to build an unprecedented double&#8208;walled noncovalent CNT structure.

         <title>Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co&#8208;Substitution in Red&#8208;Emitting Phosphor Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ for Advanced Spectroscopic Applications Including Laser Displays with Ultra&#8208;High Luminescence Saturation Threshold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully introduced [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution into the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ lattice. The co&#8208;substitution was verified to enhance the lattice rigidity so as to notably raise the external quantum efficiency. Under blue laser excitation, the phosphor has an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2. Under high pressure, the phosphor has an optimal pressure sensitivity of 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa.







Abstract
In order to obtain novel and more efficient red light&#8208;emitting materials, a series of Sr2[Mg1&#8722;xLixAl5&#8722;xSixN7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN&#8208;xLS, 0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) red phosphors were devised and successfully synthesized via the high temperature solid state reaction and the effects of the co&#8208;substitution of [Mg&#8722;Al]5+ by [Li&#8722;Si]5+ on structural and luminescence properties is investigated in detail. A series of powder XRD data and Rietveld refinement indicate that [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution can successfully enter the Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu2+ (SMAN) lattice. With the entry of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ into the lattice, the substitution of Al3+ by Si4+ leads to the weakening of the nephelauxetic effect of the 5d level of Eu2+, which shifts the emission peak from 657&#8197;nm to 647&#8197;nm and reduces the excitation in the green region, i.e., lowers the absorption of green light. When the amount of [Li&#8722;Si]5+ co&#8208;substitution is x=0.1, the luminescence intensity and thermal stability of the sample are enhanced, in which the external quantum efficiency (EQE), reflecting the luminescence intensity, is elevated by 49.6&#8201;%. The increase in lattice rigidity gives rise to higher luminescence intensity, and the introduced trap levels for the compensation of luminescence enhances the thermal stability. Under blue laser excitation, the SMAN&#8208;0.1LS can achieve an ultra&#8208;high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm2, which is remarkably superior to other existing red phosphors, a breakthrough performance that has enormous potential for application in high&#8208;power laser display light sources. Cathodoluminescence (CL) characterization and measurements attest to the favorable CL properties of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS. By measuring the pressure&#8208;dependent luminescence of SMAN&#8208;0.1LS, the emission peak can be shifted from 650&#8197;nm to 702&#8197;nm with the increase of pressure, and the sensitivity d&#955;/dP is 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa, which is indicative of the potential application of this system as an optical pressure sensor.

     alt="Enhanced Quantum Efficiency via Co-Substitution in Red-Emitting Phosphor Sr2[MgAl5N7]&#8201;:&#8201;Eu2+ for Advanced Spectroscopic Applications Including Laser Displays with Ultra-High Luminescence Saturation Threshold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work successfully introduced [Li&#8722;Si]&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; co-substitution into the Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[MgAl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;:&#8201;0.01Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; lattice. The co-substitution was verified to enhance the lattice rigidity so as to notably raise the external quantum efficiency. Under blue laser excitation, the phosphor has an ultra-high luminescence saturation threshold of 52.22&#8197;W/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Under high pressure, the phosphor has an optimal pressure sensitivity of 5.07&#8197;nm/GPa.

         <title>Increasing the Donor Strength of Alkenylphosphines by Twisting the C=C Double Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platform of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin phosphines with a sulfonyl substituent in the backbone (sNHOP) is reported, in which the olefin moiety is twisted to break the &#960;&#8208;interaction. The resulting zwitterionic structure leads to an increased donor strength of the phosphines and thus in enhanced catalytic activities in gold(I) catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;rich phosphines play a crucial role in transition metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysis. While alkyl groups have traditionally been employed to increase the phosphine donor strength, recent studies have shown that zwitterionic functional groups such as phosphorus ylides can result in a further enhancement. Herein we report the concept of twisting a C=C double bond to introduce a zwitterionic substituent by the synthesis and application of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin phosphines with a sulfonyl substituent (sNHOP). This sulfonyl group enables the twisting of the olefin moiety due to steric and electronic stabilization of the carbanionic center. The resulting zwitterionic structure leads to a significant increase of the donor strength of the sNHOP ligands compared to conventional NHOP systems with a planar N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin moiety. The potential of this new ligand platform for catalysis is demonstrated by its application in the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroamination and cyclo&#8208;isomerization of alkynes. Here, the ligands outperform the original NHOP ligands suggesting favorable properties for future catalysis applications.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Pt Loaded on MOF&#8208;Derived Porous TiO2 with Maxim&#8208;Ized Pt Atom Utilization for Selective Hydrogenation of Halonitro&#8208;benzene</title>

         <dc:description>
The precise location control of single atoms relative to supports remains a great challenge in the fabrication of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Herein, through a simple &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; process, the preferential dispersion of single&#8208;atom Pt species outside TiO2 is realzied by decoupling the themolysis of a typical Ti&#8208;based MOF and thermal atomization of PtNPs. The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600, with 100&#8201;% Pt accessibility, exhibits excellent activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB) to p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN).







Abstract
The location control of single atoms relative to supports is challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts, leading to a large proportion of inaccessible single atoms buried under supports. Herein, a &#8220;sequential thermal transition&#8221; strategy is developed to afford single&#8208;atom Pt preferentially dispersed on the outer surface of TiO2. Specifically, a Ti&#8208;MOF confining Pt nanoparticles is converted to PtNPs and TiO2 composite coated by carbon (PtNPs&amp;TiO2@C&#8208;800) at 800&#8201;&#176;C in N2. Subsequent thermal&#8208;driven atomization of PtNPs at 600&#8201;&#176;C in air produce single&#8208;atom Pt decorated TiO2 (Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600). The resulting Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 exhibits superior p&#8208;chloroaniline (p&#8208;CAN) selectivity (99&#8201;%) to PtNPs/TiO2&#8208;400 (45&#8201;%) and much better activity than Pt1@TiO2&#8208;600 with randomly dispersed Pt1 both outside and inside TiO2 in the hydrogenation of p&#8208;chloronitrobenzene (p&#8208;CNB). Mechanism investigations reveal that Pt1/TiO2&#8208;600 achieves 100&#8201;% accessibility of Pt1 and preferably adsorbs the &#8211;NO2 group of p&#8208;CNB while weakly adsorbs &#8211;Cl group of p&#8208;CNB and p&#8208;CAN, promoting catalytic activity and selectivity.

         <title>The Trifluorooxygenate Anion [OF3]&#8722;: Spectroscopic Evidence for a Binary, Hypervalent Oxygen Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic evidence is presented for the binary, hypervalent [OF3]&#8722;, formed in the reaction of OF2 with laser ablated MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs) under matrix&#8208;isolation conditions. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations show that the bonding in [OF3]&#8722; is similar to that in [F3]&#8722;.







Abstract
Experimental evidence for hypervalent compounds of second&#8208;row elements is still scarce in literature. Here, we present the first report of the long&#8208;sought binary, hypervalent trifluorooxygenate anion [OF3]&#8722;. It was isolated in solid Ne matrices under cryogenic conditions after reacting oxygen difluoride with free fluoride ions from laser ablation of alkali metal fluorides MF (M=Li&#8722;Cs). VSEPR theory and calculations at the CCSD(T) level predict a C2v&#8208;symmetric T&#8208;shape structure with one short and two long O&#8722;F bond lengths in [OF3]&#8722;. This is confirmed experimentally by FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotopic labeling. Analysis of the natural local molecular orbitals shows the presence of one 2c&#8211;2e and one 3c&#8211;4e bond each. Natural resonance theory indicates the importance of the stability of [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; for the stability of [OF3]&#8722;. Although free [OF2]&#8901;&#8722; was not detected, the species MOF2 (M=Na&#8722;Cs) could be observed in the same experiments, which are best described as contact ion pairs of M+[OF2]&#8901;&#8722;.

         <title>Enabling Interfacial Lattice Matching by Selective Epitaxial Growth of CuS Crystals on Bi2WO6 Nanosheets for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction into Solar Fuels</title>

The strong coupling effect of p&#8208;n CS&#8208;BWO heterojunction induced the formation of a robust interface electric field, leading to the efficient charge separation for preferential CO2 photoreduction into CO.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an important technology for value&#8208;added solar fuel production, however, it is generally limited by interfacial charge transport. To address this limitation, a two&#8208;dimensional/two&#8208;dimensional (2D/2D) p&#8208;n heterojunction CuS&#8208;Bi2WO6 (CS&#8208;BWO) with highly connected and matched interfacial lattices was designed in this work via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal tandem synthesis strategy. The integration of CuS with BWO created a robust interface electric field and provided fast charge transfer channels due to the work function difference, as well as highly connected and matched interfacial lattices. The p&#8208;n heterojunction combination promoted the electron transfer from the Cu to Bi sites, leading to the coordination of Bi sites with high electronic density and low oxidation state. The Bi sites in the BWO nanosheets facilitated the adsorption and activation of CO2, and the generation of high&#8208;coverage key intermediate b&#8208;CO32&#8722;, while CuS (CS) acted as a broad light&#8208;harvesting material to provide abundant photoinduced electrons that were injected into the conduction band of BWO for CO2 photoreduction reaction. Remarkably, the p&#8208;n heterojunction CS&#8208;BWO exhibited average CO and CH4 yields of 33.9 and 16.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of CS, BWO, and physical mixture CS&#8208;BWO samples. This work provided an innovative design strategy for developing high&#8208;activity heterojunction photocatalyst for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added solar fuels.

         <title>The Electrode/Electrolyte Interface Study during the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Results from rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy suggest that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R), even in acidic electrolytes. Water molecules, rather than protons, serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. The actual reactant for CO2R is solvated CO2, also known as CO2(aq).







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 Reduction (CO2R) in acidic electrolytes has gained significant attention owing to higher carbon efficiency and stability than in alkaline counterparts. However, the proton source and the role of alkali cations for CO2R are still under debate. By using rotating ring disk electrode and surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, we find that a neutral/alkaline environment at the interface is necessary for CO2R even in acidic electrolytes. We also confirm that water molecules, rather than protons serve as the proton source for CO2R. Alkali cations in the outer Helmholtz plane activate H2O and promote the desorption of adsorbed carbon monoxide. Additionally, the solvated CO2, or CO2(aq), is the actual reactant for CO2R. This study provides a deeper understanding of the electrode/electrolyte interface during CO2R in acidic electrolytes and sheds light on further performance improvement of this system.

         <title>Nanoparticle Transport in Proximal Tubules with Rhabdomyolysis&#8208;Induced Necrosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) exhibited enhanced kidney accumulation in a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury mouse model. By distinguishing the injury stages of necrotic proximal tubules (PTs) through histopathological characteristics, we found that the enhanced kidney accumulation was due to selective retention of the AuNPs in the extracellular lumen of late&#8208;stage necrotic PTs as a result of lumen obstruction by cell debris.







Abstract
Renal&#8208;clearable engineered nanoparticles are being explored for their potential to deliver therapeutic agents for kidney disease treatment. A fundamental understanding of how these nanoparticles accumulate in diseased kidneys at the cellular level is essential to enhance their effectiveness and minimize side effects on adjacent healthy tissues. Herein, we report that the accumulation of glutathione&#8208;coated, near&#8208;infrared emitting gold nanoparticles (GS&#8208;AuNPs) correlates strongly with the necrotic stages of injured proximal tubular cells. Using a rhabdomyolysis&#8208;induced acute kidney injury (AKI) mouse model, we observed that GS&#8208;AuNPs were significantly accumulated in the extracellular lumen of proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) at advanced necrotic stage, where cellular debris and released intracellular contents impeded their clearance. In contrast, during early necrosis, GS&#8208;AuNPs were still cleared through the unobstructed lumen. Additionally, intracellular uptake of GS&#8208;AuNPs was significantly reduced across all necrotic stages. These findings underscore the need for new strategies to design nanoparticles that can effectively target and be taken up by the diseased tubular cells before extensive necrosis occurs; so that nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery for kidney disease treatment can be achieved with desired efficacy and precision.

         <title>Calcium Carbonate as an Ionic Molecular Lock for Ultrastrong Fluorescence of Single Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we modified organic molecules with calcium carbonate oligomers (CCO, (CaCO3)n) in individual molecular states, functionalizing organic molecules with inorganic ionic segments as molecular locks. Due to the rigidity of ionic compound and characteristic of ionic bond, it realized the ultrastrong fluorescence of organic molecules in single molecular state without the change of maximum emission wavelength both in solution and solid.







Abstract
Locking molecular conformation are widely applied in molecular engineering for improved performance. However, locking via organic functional groups often changes the original molecular properties. Following the rigidity and stability of ionic interaction in ionic compounds, we suggested the use of a molecular&#8208;scale ionic compound, calcium carbonate oligomer, as a robust molecular segment to functionalize organic molecules. The rigid structure of the ionic molecular segments locked the organic molecules, which could remarkably limit the intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions. This ensured a stable and ultrastrong fluorescence of the single organic molecule while preserving its original maximum emission wavelength. The locking strategy was general and extendable to multiple organic molecules. Additionally, the ultrastrong single&#8208;molecular fluorescence can be maintained in inorganic solids with even higher quantum yields and almost unchanged maximum emission wavelength. The highest quantum yield of the investigated molecules reached 99.9&#8201;%, superior to all reported organic&#8208;inorganic fluorescent composite under air conditions. This work demonstrates a general strategy to restrict intramolecular motion and intermolecular interactions by using ionic oligomers as molecular locks, providing an alternative method for realizing ultraemissive molecules. This further demonstrates a fascinating example of molecular engineering in the presence of inorganic ionic molecules.

         <title>A Piezocatalysis Strategy to Enable Efficient Redox in Solid&#8208;State Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel piezocatalysis mechanism in solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S batteries using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as the piezoelectric catalyst. The piezopotential generated by interfacial stress accumulation efficiently drives redox reactions, enhancing battery kinetics and capacity. This piezocatalytic strategy achieved a remarkable discharge capacity of 670.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Li&#8722;Se batteries and 1463&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 in Li&#8722;S batteries, providing a promising approach for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis is considered to be a favorable catalytic technology by utilizing external mechanical stimulation to promote the specific redox reactions. The application of piezocatalysis in batteries is promising but faces formidable challenges. Herein, the operation principles of piezocatalysis were successfully demonstrated by constructing solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S battery models with interfacial stress accumulation. Lead zirconate titanate with an ultra&#8208;high piezoelectric coefficient was applied as the piezoelectric catalyst. The uniformity of the dipole orientation in materials was essential for achieving piezocatalysis in batteries. The accumulated high&#8208;stress converts to piezopotential for catalyzing most reaction processes in batteries, while the rapid stress change prevents the internal charge reorganization, ensuring continuous efficient catalysis.

     alt="A Piezocatalysis Strategy to Enable Efficient Redox in Solid-State Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates a novel piezocatalysis mechanism in solid-state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S batteries using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) as the piezoelectric catalyst. The piezopotential generated by interfacial stress accumulation efficiently drives redox reactions, enhancing battery kinetics and capacity. This piezocatalytic strategy achieved a remarkable discharge capacity of 670.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Li&#8722;Se batteries and 1463&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in Li&#8722;S batteries, providing a promising approach for high-performance solid-state batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piezocatalysis is considered to be a favorable catalytic technology by utilizing external mechanical stimulation to promote the specific redox reactions. The application of piezocatalysis in batteries is promising but faces formidable challenges. Herein, the operation principles of piezocatalysis were successfully demonstrated by constructing solid-state Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S battery models with interfacial stress accumulation. Lead zirconate titanate with an ultra-high piezoelectric coefficient was applied as the piezoelectric catalyst. The uniformity of the dipole orientation in materials was essential for achieving piezocatalysis in batteries. The accumulated high-stress converts to piezopotential for catalyzing most reaction processes in batteries, while the rapid stress change prevents the internal charge reorganization, ensuring continuous efficient catalysis. The internal stress change alters the internal polarisation strength, driving excess screening charge to participate in the electrochemical reaction. Under piezocatalysis, solid-state Li&#8722;Se batteries exhibited a initial discharge capacity of 670.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (99.4&#8201;% of the theoretical value) at 0.1&#8197;C, and Li&#8722;S batteries showed a capacity of 1463&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C, which was still maintained up to 1084&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an elevated rate of 0.5&#8197;C. This piezocatalysis strategy provides a strong theoretical basis and design specification for enhancing Li&#8722;Se and Li&#8722;S battery reaction kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We have precisely prepared hierarchical structures using poly(di&#8208;n&#8208;hexylfluorene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(3&#8208;tetraethylene glycol thiophene) diblock copolymer and polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock copolymer. In seed growth process, by adjusting the structure of the copolymers and solvent polarity, A&#8722;B&#8208;A triblock, multiarm branched micelles, and raft micelles were successfully formed.







Abstract
The precise preparation of hierarchical micelles is a fundamental challenge in modern materials science and chemistry. Herein, poly(di&#8208;n&#8208;hexylfluorene)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(3&#8208;tetraethylene glycol thiophene) (poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n)) diblock copolymers and polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock copolymers were synthesized using a one&#8208;pot process via the sequential addition of corresponding monomers using a Ni(II) complex as a single catalyst for living/controlled polymerization. The crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic conjugated poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n) led to the formation of nanofibers with controlled lengths and narrow dispersity. The block copolymers exhibited white, yellow, and red emissions in different self&#8208;assembly states. By using uniform poly(1m&#8208;b&#8208;2n) nanofibers as seeds, introducing the polyfluorene&#8208;block&#8208;polythiophene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(phenyl isocyanide) triblock polymer as a unimer in the seed growth process, and adjusting the structure of the poly(phenyl isocyanide) block and the polarity of self&#8208;assembly solvent, A&#8722;B&#8722;A triblock micelles, multiarm branched micelles, and raft micelles were prepared.

         <title>Programmable C&#8722;N Bond Formation through Radical&#8208;Mediated Chemistry in Plasma&#8208;Microdroplet Fusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross coupling. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge produced in the wake of charged microdroplets is found to facilitate catalyst&#8208;free radical mediated hydrazine cross&#8208;coupling reactions without the use of external light source, heat, precious metal complex, or trapping agents. A plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion platform is utilized for introduction of hydrazine reagent that undergoes homolytic cleavage forming radical intermediate species. The non&#8208;thermal plasma discharge that causes the cleavage originates from a chemically etched silica capillary. The coupling of the radical intermediates gives various products. Plasma&#8208;microdroplet fusion occurs online in a programmable reaction platform allowing direct process optimization and product validation via mass spectrometry. The platform is applied herein with a variety of hydrazine substrates, enabling i) self&#8208;coupling to form secondary amines with identical N&#8208;substitutions, ii) cross&#8208;coupling to afford secondary amine with different N&#8208;substituents, iii) cross&#8208;coupling followed by in&#8197;situ dehydrogenation to give the corresponding aryl&#8208;aldimines with two unique N&#8208;substitutions, and iv) cascade heterocyclic carbazole derivatives formation. These unique reactions were made possible in the charged microdroplet environment through our ability to program conditions such as reagent concentration (i.&#8201;e., flow rate), microdroplet reactivity (i.&#8201;e., presence or absence of plasma), and reaction timescale (i.&#8201;e., operational mode of the source). The selected program is implemented in a co&#8208;axial spray format, which is found to be advantageous over the conventional one&#8208;pot single emitter electrospray&#8208;based microdroplet reactions.

         <title>Engineering Single Ni Sites on 3D Cage&#8208;like Cucurbit[n]uril Ligands for Efficient and Selective CO2 Photocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) is designed with a 3D Cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) cage&#8208;like ligand to accommodate atomically dispersed nickel centers for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO. It achieves a CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with 97.9&#8201;% selectivity under visible light irradiation. The homogeneous nature of this co&#8208;catalyst enables efficient charge transfer from photosensitizer to the Ni2+ active site, reducing nearby CO2 molecules enriched by the unique CB[7] cage.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 selective reduction with high conversion is a challenging task yet holds immense promise for both CO2 neutralization and green fuel production. Enhancing CO2 adsorption at the catalytic centre can trigger a highly efficient CO2 capture&#8208;to&#8208;conversion process. Herein, we introduce cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]), a new family of molecular ligands, as a key component in the creation of a 3D cage&#8208;like metal (nickel, Ni)&#8208;complex molecular co&#8208;catalyst (CB[7]&#8208;Ni) for photocatalysis. It exhibits an unprecedented CO yield rate of 72.1&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high selectivity of 97.9&#8201;% under visible light irradiation. To verify the origin of the carbon source in the products, a straightforward isotopic tracing method is designed based on tandem reactions. The catalytic process commences with photoelectron transfer from Ru(bpy)32+ to the Ni2+ site, resulting in the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni+. The locally enriched CO2 molecules in the cage ligand CB[7] undergo selective reduction by the Ni+ nearby to form CO product. This work exemplifies the inspiring potential of ligand structure engineering in advancing the development of efficient unanchored molecular co&#8208;catalysts.

         <title>Improving the Cellular Internalization of Zr(IV) Nanocages by Tuning Hydrophilicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating the ligand of a zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cage with a Ru(II) complex was found to not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Additionally, butyl modifications on the cyclopentadienyl anion rings of the Zr&#8722;O clusters fine&#8208;tuned the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the nanocages, thereby achieving outstanding live&#8208;cell imaging capabilities.







Abstract
Nanoscale molecular materials have emerged as a new class of compounds at the nanometer scale with well&#8208;defined chemical structures, remarkable uniformity and high reproducibility. Among these materials, zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional stability and applications in catalysis, recognition and separation and so on. However, their poor water solubility impedes their biomedical applications. In this study, decorating the ligand with Ru(II) complexes can not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Notably, butyl&#8208;modification of the cyclopentadiene rings can significantly enhance the cell uptake (100&#8197;folds) of nanocages via actin&#8208; and dynamin&#8208;mediated endocytosis. The unique advantages and easy modifiability of these nanocages make them highly promising candidates for diverse biological applications.

&lt;p&gt;Decorating the ligand of a zirconium-based metal-organic cage with a Ru(II) complex was found to not only improve the water solubility but also endow bright red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift (180&#8197;nm). Additionally, butyl modifications on the cyclopentadienyl anion rings of the Zr&#8722;O clusters fine-tuned the hydrophilicity and lipophilicity of the nanocages, thereby achieving outstanding live-cell imaging capabilities.

2D supramolecular polymorphism emerges in a cyanine system from a complex self&#8208;assembly landscape. Designed by Bartolome Soberats et&#8197;al. (e202415774), the cyanine dye with two rod&#8208;like side groups initially forms nanoparticle&#8208;like aggregates, that transform into 2D H&#8208;type and J&#8208;type aggregates through thermal transitions.

         <title>High Configuration Entropy Promises Electrochemical Stability of Chloride Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy, Long&#8208;Life All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a high&#8208;entropy strategy for high&#8208;voltage stable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. With a typical high&#8208;entropy chloride solid&#8208;state electrolyte Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6, we show that the high&#8208;entropy strategy not only enhances the ionic conductivity but also realizes unprecedented high&#8208;voltage stability for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with a long cycling life.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with high ionic conductivity, stability, and interface compatibility are indispensable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), yet there are scarce SSEs with sufficient ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, with a high&#8208;entropy SSE (HE&#8208;SSE, Li2.9In0.75Zr0.1Sc0.05Er0.05Y0.05Cl6), we show the high configuration entropy has a thermodynamically positive relationship with the high&#8208;voltage stability. As a result, the ASSBs with HE&#8208;SSE and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials exhibit superior high&#8208;voltage and long&#8208;cycle stability, achieving 250&#8197;cycles with 81.4&#8201;% capacity retention when charged to 4.8&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li), and even 5000&#8197;cycles if charged to 4.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li). Experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations confirm that the HE&#8208;SSE greatly suppresses the high&#8208;voltage degradation of SSE at the interface, promoting the high&#8208;voltage stability coordinately through high entropy and interface stability. The high entropy design offers a general strategy to simultaneously improve the high&#8208;voltage stability and ionic conductivity of SSEs, creating an avenue to building high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life ASSBs.

         <title>Enhanced UV Light Responsivity in &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskites Realized by Pressure&#8208;Induced Ultrafast Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study shows a remarkable transition in PL from STEs to FEs and significant enhancement in exciton mobility of 93.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, reaching levels comparable to those in 3D perovskites. Additionally, the evaluation of FE diffusion coefficients under different pressures revealed anisotropic exciton diffusion within the inorganic plane, with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. This value is the highest reported so far in these &#8208;oriented 2D perovskites, due to a decrease in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Characterized by its notably high FE diffusion coefficient, it exhibits an excellent UV light sensitivity at ~2.8&#8197;GPa, highlighting their potential applications in creating high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites exhibit superior optoelectronic properties, offering significant potential in photovoltaic, light&#8208;emitting, and photodetection applications. Nevertheless, their enlarged interlayer spacing restricts longitudinal carrier transport, thereby limiting its potential applications. While &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites provide a prospective solution with their compact interlayer spacing, their inherent structure, characterized by octahedra tilting, indirectly hinders carrier transport due to the generation of self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) caused by strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. Here, we adeptly regulate the photoluminescence (PL) from STEs to free excitons (FEs) emission within the 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented (API)PbBr4 single crystal through structure optimization under pressure treatment. Besides, we observed anisotropic FE transport with an anisotropy ratio of 4.97. The exciton mobility reaches a peak of 93.6&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 2.7&#8197;GPa, a value comparable to those of their three&#8208;dimensional (3D) counterparts, which is attributed to a reduction in electron&#8208;phonon coupling and exciton reduced mass. Additionally, this ultrafast exciton transport significantly enhances UV light responsivity, exhibiting an increase of approximately 5000 times at 2.7&#8197;GPa in comparison to ambient conditions. These findings highlight the prospective application of 2D &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented perovskites in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices through intrinsic structural modulation.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Discovery of Copper(I)&#8208;Iodide Cluster Scintillators for Efficient X&#8208;ray Luminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes a machine learning&#8208;guided approach with fused features to discover superior copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators, achieving a determination coefficient of 0.88. Copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, discovered through this method exhibits radioluminescence that is 56 times higher than PbWO4. It enables detection limits of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 in X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating significant potential for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.







Abstract
Developing efficient scintillators with environmentally friendly compositions, adaptable band gaps, and robust chemical stability is crucial for modern X&#8208;ray radiography. While copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster crystals show promise, the vast design space of inorganic cores and organic ligands poses challenges for conventional approaches. In this study, we present machine learning&#8208;guided discovery of copper(I)&#8208;iodide cluster scintillators for efficient X&#8208;ray luminescence imaging. Our findings reveal that combining base learning models with fused features enhances model generalization, achieving an impressive determination coefficient of 0.88. By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high&#8208;performance Cu(I)&#8208;I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide&#8208;(1&#8208;Butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium)2, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO4, and enables a detection limit for X&#8208;rays of 19.6&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1 and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging.

By leveraging this approach, we obtain a high-performance Cu(I)-I cluster scintillator, named copper iodide-(1-Butyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibit radioluminescence 56 times stronger than that of PbWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and enables a detection limit for X-rays of 19.6&#8197;nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of these scintillators by incorporating them as microfillers in the fabrication of flexible composite scintillators for X-ray imaging, achieving a static resolution of 20&#8197;lp&#8201;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and demonstrating promising performance for dynamic X-ray imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyrolytic Carbon: An Inexpensive, Robust, and Versatile Electrode for Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic organic electrochemistry is a highly useful redox method, enabling diverse transformations. This study explores pyrolytic carbon electrodes in powerful rAP processes and C&#8722;C as well as C&#8722;N bond&#8208;forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon offers a cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional amorphous carbon materials (glassy carbon, GC, or reticulated vitreous carbon, RVC), which are often expensive or unsuitable for large&#8208;scale flow reactions.







Abstract
Synthetic organic electrochemistry is recognized as one of the most sustainable forms of redox chemistry that can enable a wide variety of useful transformations. In this study, readily prepared pyrolytic carbon electrodes are explored in several powerful rAP transformations as well as C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond forming reactions. Pyrolytic carbon provides an alternative to classic amorphous carbon&#8208;based materials that are either expensive or ill&#8208;suited to large&#8208;scale flow reactions.

         <title>Organic Circularly Polarized Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence: Strategies, Applications and Challenges</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) is essential in chemistry and materials&#8208;related fields. This Review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP from the molecule to the supramolecular assembly scales, focusing on design strategies such as chirality transfer, assembly&#8208;induced chirality amplification, and chiral superstructure&#8208;mediated transmission. Remaining challenges and an insightful outlook are also presented.







Abstract
Organic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays crucial roles in chemistry and biology for the potential in chiral recognition, asymmetric catalysis, 3D displays, and biological probes. The long&#8208;lived luminescence, large Stokes shift, and unique chiroptical properties make organic circularly polarized room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CPP) a new research hotspot in recent years. Nevertheless, achieving high&#8208;performance organic CPP is still challenging due to the sensitivity and complexity of integrating triplet excitons and polarization within organic materials. This review summarizes the latest advances in organic CPP, ranging from design strategies and photophysical properties to underlying luminescence mechanisms and potential applications. Specifically, the design strategies for generating CPP are systemically categorized and discussed according to the interactions between chiral units and chromophores. The applications of organic CPP in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, sensing, chiral recognition, afterglow displays, and information encryption are also illustrated. In addition, we present the current challenges and perspectives on developing organic CPP. We expect this review to provide some instructive design principles to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic CPP materials, offering an in&#8208;depth understanding of the luminescence mechanism and paving the way toward diverse practical applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Quadruple&#8208;Functionalised Antibodies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of multiple payloads within the same scaffold is a growing tendency in last generation Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs). This paper reports the first strategy for the quadruple functionalization of therapeutic antibodies using four unique functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This is possible from multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies that result in highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody with retained affinity for the target.







Abstract
Antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) are a growing class of chemotherapeutic agents that have yielded striking clinical successes. However, the efficacy of ADCs often suffers from issues associated with tumor heterogeneity and resistance. To overcome these problems, a new generation of ADCs comprising a single monoclonal antibody with multiple different payloads attached, termed multi&#8208;payload ADCs, have been developed. Here we deploy multiple orthogonal site&#8208;specific protein modification strategies to generate highly homogeneous multi&#8208;functionalised antibody conjugates comprising up to four different functionalities installed at four unique sites on the antibody. This work, which includes the use of a site&#8208;specific cyclopropenone (CPO)&#8208;based reagent, represents the first example of a homogeneous multi&#8208;payload ADC with a payload count greater than two, and thereby facilitates the development of the next generation of ADCs.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Free Water Electrolysis for Hydrogen Generation with Low Cost</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis H2 production system over a class of Cu&#8208;based urea oxidation catalysts was developed. CuXO catalyst exhibits unique selectivity for clean N2 rather than toxic NO2&#8722;/NO3&#8722; and eliminates the risk of H2&#8208;O2 mixing. The industrial&#8208;scale membrane&#8208;free electrolyser based on this system successfully reduces H2 production cost to US$1.81&#8197;kg&#8722;1, lower than those of grey H2 while meeting 2030 technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50&#8197;kg&#8722;1) set by United States Department of Energy.







Abstract
Conventional water electrolysis relies on expensive membrane&#8208;electrode assemblies and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, which makes the cost of green hydrogen (H2) generation much higher than that of grey H2. Here, we develop an innovative and efficient membrane&#8208;free water electrolysis system to overcome these two obstacles simultaneously. This system utilizes the thermodynamically more favorable urea oxidation reaction (UOR) to generate clean N2 over a new class of Cu&#8208;based catalyst (CuXO) for replacing OER, fundamentally eliminating the explosion risk of H2 and O2 mixing while removing the need for membranes. Notably, this membrane&#8208;free electrolysis system exhibits the highest H2 Faradaic efficiency among reported membrane&#8208;free electrolysis work. In situ spectroscopic studies reveal that the new N2Hy intermediate&#8208;mediated UOR mechanism on the CuXO catalyst ensures its unique N2 selectivity and OER inertness. More importantly, an industrial&#8208;type membrane&#8208;free water electrolyser (MFE) based on this system successfully reduces electricity consumption to only 3.78&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3, significantly lower than the 5.17&#8197;kWh&#8201;Nm&#8722;3 of commercial alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE). Comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) suggests that the membrane&#8208;free design and reduced electricity input of the MFE plants reduce the green H2 production cost to US$1.81&#8197;kg&#8722;1, which is lower than those of grey H2 while meeting the technical target (US$2.00&#8211;2.50&#8197;kg&#8722;1) set by European Commission and United States Department of Energy.

         <title>Topology of Gemini&#8208;shaped Hexagonal Heterojunction for Efficient Stereoconvergent Transformation via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional heterostructure containing kinetic resolution and racemization catalyst was developed by alternate stacking of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;substitution, which has exhibited outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities for the efficient cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts.







Abstract
Despite recent advances in the combination of kinetic resolution and racemization for efficient stereoconvergent transformation, the poor stability and limited reaction activities of the products restrict their wide application in industrial production. To overcome these problems, Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons with para&#8208;heterojunctions for one&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers were designed via hydrogen&#8208;bonding adhesion by racemization catalyst 1 and kinetic resolution 2 in this work. The polymers from the assembly of Gemini&#8208;shaped hexagons exhibit rapid catalytic behaviour with efficient selectivity for the desired configuration in the synthesis of tertiary alcohols with contiguous stereocenters through dynamic kinetic resolution for the nanoscale heterojunctions of dissimilar catalysts. Among them, the developed 2D polymers gave outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities (&gt;99&#8201;% ee, 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) through the cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts.

     alt="Topology of Gemini-shaped Hexagonal Heterojunction for Efficient Stereoconvergent Transformation via Dynamic Kinetic Resolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional heterostructure containing kinetic resolution and racemization catalyst was developed by alternate stacking of Gemini-shaped hexagons with para-substitution, which has exhibited outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities for the efficient cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite recent advances in the combination of kinetic resolution and racemization for efficient stereoconvergent transformation, the poor stability and limited reaction activities of the products restrict their wide application in industrial production. To overcome these problems, Gemini-shaped hexagons with para-heterojunctions for one-dimensional and two-dimensional supramolecular polymers were designed via hydrogen-bonding adhesion by racemization catalyst &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and kinetic resolution &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in this work. The polymers from the assembly of Gemini-shaped hexagons exhibit rapid catalytic behaviour with efficient selectivity for the desired configuration in the synthesis of tertiary alcohols with contiguous stereocenters through dynamic kinetic resolution for the nanoscale heterojunctions of dissimilar catalysts. Among them, the developed 2D polymers gave outstanding enantioselectivities and diastereoselectivities (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee, 20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr) through the cooperation of adjacent dissimilar catalysts. The heterojunctions varying dimensions and distances of dissimilar catalysts provide new insight for increasing the enantioselectivity of chiral organocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystal Tin Halide Perovskite Films with High Structural Integrity for Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging Array Enabling Hidden Object Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provided a simple spin&#8208;coating technique for the preparation of quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films with high structural integrity and effective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response. Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables high structural integrity with more oriented crystal, reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited remarkable optoelectrical properties, including low dark current density of 1.9&#215;10&#8722;10&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, fast response time of 1.06&#8197;&#956;s, high responsivity value of 0.43&#8197;A&#8201;W&#8722;1, large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm), and an ultralow noise current of 1.68&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;A&#8201;Hz&#8722;1/2, which were among the best NIR perovskite photodetectors. Ultimately, the high&#8208;resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array was fabricated on the thin film transistor backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) image sensors based on solution&#8208;processed thin film are gaining prominence in various applications, including security detection, remote sensing, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring, owing to superior penetration capabilities of NIR light. However, the reported perovskite image sensors suffer from limited resolution and performance due to poor structural integrity, bioincompatibility, and constrained response wavelength range from lead&#8208;based perovskite materials employed. In this study, we present non&#8208;toxic quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (QSC) CH(NH2)2SnI3 (FASnI3) perovskite films, prepared via a simple spin&#8208;coating technique, that demonstrate high structural integrity and effective NIR response. Through a series of in&#8197;situ characterizations, we reveal that the orderly growth mode of QSC&#8208;FASnI3 perovskite films enables a more oriented crystal growth with reduced trap and grain boundaries. Consequently, self&#8208;powered NIR photodetector based on QSC&#8208;FASnI3 films exhibited large detectivity over 1013 Jones in the NIR range (780&#8211;890&#8197;nm). Ultimately, due to the high structural integrity, the high&#8208;resolution 64&#215;64 (4096) pixels NIR imaging array, exhibiting reduced photo and dark response non&#8208;uniformity value, was fabricated on the thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT) backplanes, enabling ultraweak NIR light (63&#8197;nW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) real&#8208;time imaging, fingerprint imaging, and hidden object recognition. This work pioneers the application of lead&#8208;free perovskite for high&#8208;resolution NIR imaging arrays.

         <title>Regulating Electric Double Layer via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Stable Solid/Electrolyte Interphase on Mg Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation structure in the electric double layer (close to the Mg metal interface) is effectively modulated by self&#8208;assembled monolayer through dipole&#8208;dipole interactions in the magnesium conventional electrolyte. A stable and dense solid electrolyte interphase is induced to solve the interfacial stability problem.







Abstract
Modulating the cationic solvation structure with high donor&#8208;number (DN) additive is an effective strategy to construct a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Mg anode, which necessitates meticulous consideration of electrolyte chemistry and substantial quantities of additives. Notably, the electric double layer (EDL) adjacent to anode is pivotal role in SEI formation yet remains understudied. In this study, we propose a novel self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) strategy by utilizing (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (TFTMS, only 2&#8197;vol&#8201;%, 1.4&#8197;mol&#8201;%, 0.135&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1), a low DN but strong Mg metal absorbability through electron&#8208;withdrawing groups(&#8722;CF3), to modulate the complex structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane. Through dipole&#8208;dipole interaction between the electronegative fluorine (&#8722;CF3 of TFTMS) and electropositive hydrogen (&#8722;CH3/&#8722;CH2 of solvents), TFTMS weakens solvent&#8208;Mg2+ coordination and thus enhances anion&#8208;Mg2+ interaction, inducing a stable and dense SEI with superior electronic insulation to realize horizontal Mg plating/stripping. Consequently, the designed electrolytes enable the symmetric cells to cycle stable for up to 1000&#8197;hours and reversible Mg plating/stripping under 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, they show favorable compatibility with various cathodes. More importantly, the SAM strategy has good generality in other electrolyte systems, demonstrating a simple and effective route to promote the practical application of rechargeable magnesium battery.

         <title>Targeted Genome Mining Facilitates the Discovery of a Promiscuous, Hyperthermostable Amidase from Thermovenabulum Gondwanense with Notable Nylon&#8208;Degrading Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastic waste accumulation poses a severe threat to human and ecosystem health. As current recycling methods are inadequate, biocatalytic degradation offers a more sustainable platform. Using genome mining, we discovered TvgC, a new 6&#8208;aminohexanoate oligomer endohydrolase (NylC). TvgC has no affiliations to nylon facilities, is the most thermostable and promiscuous, and has notable activity towards nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6.







Abstract
Plastics are ubiquitous in our ecosystems, and microplastic accumulation in the environment is an emerging global health concern. Since available recycling technologies are not economically competitive with primary plastic production, global use is expected to reach 1231 megatons by 2060, with 493 megatons leeching into the environment each year. To identify new nylon&#8208;recycling biotechnologies, targeted genome mining was used to identify thermostable enzymes capable of degrading polyamides. Here, we describe the characterization of a novel protein sourced from Thermovenabulum gondwanense: TvgC. TvgC is extremely stable, exhibiting a melting temperature of 93&#8201;&#176;C and no detectable losses in hydrolytic activity after one week at 60&#8201;&#176;C. While nylonases primarily process nylon&#8208;6, TvgC catalysed the degradation of both nylon&#8208;6 and nylon&#8208;6,6 films, which are considerably more difficult to degrade. Finally, conversion experiments demonstrate that TvgC achieves a 1.2&#8197;wt&#8201;% conversion of nylon&#8208;6 film, comparable to that of the most highly engineered nylonases. This novel hyperthermostable protein represents an excellent starting point for future engineering of increasingly efficient nylonases.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of chiral sulfinimines to keteniminium ions generated through electrophilic amide activation enables a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement to yield enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides in a single step. The transformation proceeds with high enantio&#8208; and chemoselectivity as well as functional group tolerance, and&#8212;in contrast to imide&#8208;based chiral auxiliary approaches&#8212;directly delivers stereochemically stable amide products.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto&#8208;enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;&#8208;ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine&#8208;mediated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement.

     alt="Asymmetric Synthesis of &#946;-Ketoamides by Sulfonium Rearrangement"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition of chiral sulfinimines to keteniminium ions generated through electrophilic amide activation enables a [3,3]-sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement to yield enantioenriched &#946;-ketoamides in a single step. The transformation proceeds with high enantio- and chemoselectivity as well as functional group tolerance, and&#8212;in contrast to imide-based chiral auxiliary approaches&#8212;directly delivers stereochemically stable amide products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of enantioenriched &#945;-substituted 1,3-dicarbonyls remains a contemporary challenge in synthesis due to their tendency to undergo racemization via keto-enol tautomerization. Herein, we report a method to access enantioenriched &#946;-ketoamides by a chiral sulfinimine-mediated [3,3]-sigmatropic sulfonium rearrangement. The transformation displays good chirality transfer, as well as excellent chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. Diastereoselective reduction of the ketone moiety, also achievable in one-pot fashion, affords enantioenriched &#946;-hydroxyamides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetic Control over Social and Narcissistic Self&#8208;Sorting from Multicomponent Mixtures in Seed&#8208;Initiated Supramolecular Polymerization by Fine&#8208;Tuning of Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slightly varying the steric demand in the immediate proximity to an intermolecular recognition moiety, tailored the efficacy of the resulting assembled state as a seed for initiating supramolecular polymerization of other structurally related compounds. Accordingly, narcissistic as well as social self&#8208;sorting from the same binary mixture of molecularly trapped species were achieved depending on the addition sequence of different seeds.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymers offer an intriguing possibility to transfer molecular properties from the nano&#8208; to the mesoscale. Towards this achievement, seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization has emerged as a powerful tool, as it prevents unlimited growth and enables size control of the assembly outcome. However, the potential application of the seeding method in the context of complex supramolecular systems is hitherto unclear. Herein we demonstrate that minute differences in molecular design in direct proximity to intermolecular recognition sites govern the molecular packing and in turn dictate the efficacy of seeded polymerization processes. We introduce a stepwise increase in steric demand in the central amino acid residue of a diamide system, which gradually increases the rotational displacement within the aggregated state. This fine&#8208;tuning of the molecular packing directly affects the propensity of the different aggregates to act as seeds for the other supramolecular synthons. In turn this allows us to selectively target specific trapped monomer states in binary mixtures for social or narcissistic seeded polymerization.

         <title>Establishing Non&#8208;Stoichiometric Ti4O7 Assisted Asymmetrical C&#8722;C Coupling for Highly Energy&#8208;Efficient Electroreduction of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 achieves excellent adaptability with loaded Cu nanoparticles (Cu NP) to form highly conductible and stable Cu/Ti4O7 interface, which enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8722;C coupling between between Cu and Ti sites and accelerates the charge transfer for highly energy&#8208;efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide







Abstract
Exploring an appropriate support material for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst is conducive for stably producing multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from electroreduction of carbon monoxide. However, the insufficient metal&#8208;support adaptability and low conductivity of the support would hinder the C&#8722;C coupling capacity and energy efficiency. Herein, non&#8208;stoichiometric Ti4O7 was incorporated into Cu electrocatalysts (Cu&#8722;Ti4O7), and served as a highly conductive and stable support for highly energy&#8208;efficient electrochemical conversion of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies originated from ordered lattice defects in Ti4O7 facilitate the water dissociation and the CO adsorption to accelerate the hydrogenation to *COH. The highly adaptable metal&#8208;support interface of Cu&#8722;Ti4O7 enables a direct asymmetrical C&#8722;C coupling between *CO on Cu and *COH on Ti4O7, which significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier for C2+ products formation. Additionally, the excellent electroconductivity of Ti4O7 benefits the reaction charge transfer through robust Cu/Ti4O7 interface for minimizing the energy loss. Thus, the optimized 20Cu&#8722;Ti4O7 catalyst exhibits an impressive selectivity of 96.4&#8201;% and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 45.1&#8201;% for multi&#8208;carbon products, along with a remarkable partial current density of 432.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Our study underscores a novel C&#8722;C coupling strategy between Cu and the support material, advancing the development of Cu&#8208;supported catalysts for highly efficient electroreduction of carbon monoxide.

         <title>Stereochemical Impacts on Acyclic Mechanochemical Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chiral acyclic mechanophore is used to study the role of stereochemistry on mechanochemical activation rate. The R,R/S,S benzopinacol enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster than the meso R,S diastereomer. DFT modeling suggests that the two hydroxyl groups syn to each other form an improving hydrogen&#8208;bond as the mechanophore is pulled. This bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl groups are forced to be anti to each other.







Abstract
The influence of stereochemistry on the mechanochemistry rate is studied using a new mechanophore based on a benzopinacol (BP) skeleton. Two sets of BP diastereomers, the meso R,S and the R,R/S,S were isolated, incorporated into the center of a poly(methyl acrylate), and their mechanical activation rate was measured in solution. Under mechanical stress, the central C&#8722;C bond in BP is cleaved, providing two independent benzophenone molecules with higher UV&#8208;absorption coefficient at 254&#8197;nm. Monitoring the reaction rate spectroscopically indicates that the chiral R,R/S,S enantiomers react ~1.4 fold faster compared to the meso R,S diastereomer. In&#8208;silico modeling indicates that a hydrogen bond between the syn hydroxyls in the R,R diastereomer becomes shorter with stress, reducing the maximal force required for C&#8722;C bond scission, while this bond is inexistent in the meso diastereomer, as the hydroxyl are anti to each other. Our results indicate that in polymer where free rotation around bonds is possible, non&#8208;covalent interactions between backbone substituents, which are affected by relative stereochemistry, can play a fundamental role in the mechanochemical stability of the polymer.

         <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of five catalysts with the same roughness coefficient, Cu2O(d)700, CuO(d)700, CuCl(d)700, Cu(NP1)700 and Cu(NP2)700, was prepared to investigate the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The microcosmic environment of the catalysts was unified by controlling the roughness coefficient, which in turn ensured that the relationship between the crystal facet and the selectivity of C2+ was investigated under the same mass transfer conditions. A positive correlation between the percentage of Cu(100) and the selectivity of C2+ is revealed.







Abstract
Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factor for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8722;C coupling. At &#8722;1.07&#8197;V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3&#8201;%, with a partial current density of &#8722;21.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency&#8208;band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8722;C coupling efficiency.

         <title>Light&#8208;Promoted Extraction of Precious Metals Using a Porphyrin&#8208;Integrated One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a porphyrin&#8208;integrated one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework was synthesized and applied to the recovery of precious metals, including gold, silver, and platinum. The adsorption and reduction of precious metal ions simultaneously proceeded to perform extremely high recovery efficiency, directly producing precious metal particles without further reduction or high&#8208;temperature treatment.







Abstract
Precious metals are valuable materials for the chemical industry, but they are scarce and pose a risk of supply disruption. Recycling precious metals from waste is a promising strategy, here we tactfully utilize light irradiation as an environmental&#8208;friendly and energy&#8208;saving adjunctive strategy to promote the reduction of precious metal ions, thereby improving the adsorption capacity and kinetics. A newly light&#8208;sensitive covalent organic framework (PP&#8208;COF) was synthesized to illustrate the effectiveness and feasibility of this light auxiliary strategy. The equilibrium adsorption capacities of PP&#8208;COF with light irradiation towards gold, platinum, and silver ions are 4729, 573, and 519&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which are 3.3, 1.9, and 1.2&#8197;times the adsorption capacities under dark condition. Significantly, a filtration column with PP&#8208;COF can recover more than 99.8&#8201;% of the gold ions in the simulated e&#8208;waste leachates with light irradiation, and 1&#8197;gram of PP&#8208;COF can recover gold from up to 0.15&#8197;tonne of e&#8208;waste leachates. Interestingly, the captured precious metals by PP&#8208;COF with light irradiation mainly exist in the micron&#8208;sized particles, which can be easily separated by extraction. We believe this work can contribute to precious metal recovery and circular economy for recycling resources.

         <title>Harnessing the Reactivity of Nitroarene Radical Anions to Create Quinoline N&#8208;Oxides by Electrochemical Reductive Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodic reduction of 2&#8208;cinnamyl&#8208;substituted nitroarenes under constant current electrolysis affords a broad array of substituted quinoline N&#8208;oxides through a mechanism involving a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom abstraction.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of 2&#8208;allyl&#8208;substituted nitroarenes using a simple, undivided electrochemical cell with non&#8208;precious electrodes to generate nitroarene radical anions was developed. The nitroarene radical anion intermediates participate in 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer reactions to construct quinoline N&#8208;oxides bearing aryl&#8208;, heteroaryl&#8208;, alkenyl&#8208;, benzyl&#8208;, sulfonyl&#8208;, or carboxyl groups.

         <title>Spontaneous Generation of Alkoxide Radical from Alcohols on Microdroplets Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets. An electric field (~10&#8722;1&#8197;V/&#197;) combined with partial solvation at the air&#8208;water interface promotes the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8722; and H3O+ ions. The RCH2O&#8722; ions can subsequently undergo ionization to form RCH2O&#8901; radicals, which then isomerize to the more stable R&#8901;CHOH species.







Abstract
Water microdroplets have been demonstrated to exhibit extraordinary chemical behaviors, including the abilities to accelerate chemical reactions by several orders of magnitude and to trigger reactions that cannot occur in bulk water. One of the most striking examples is the spontaneous generation of hydroxyl radical from hydroxide ions. Alcohols and alkoxide ions, being structurally similar to water and hydroxide ions, might exhibit similar behavior on microdroplets. Here, we report the spontaneous generation of alkoxide radicals from alcohols (RCH2OH) in aqueous microdroplets through quantum chemical calculations, quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, ab&#8197;initio MD simulations, and mass spectrometry. Our results show that an electric field (EF) on the order of 10&#8722;1&#8197;V/&#197; and partial solvation at the air&#8208;water interface jointly promote the dissociation of RCH2OH into RCH2O&#8722; and H3O+ ions. QM/MM MD simulations indicate that RCH2O&#8722; can be ionized to produce RCH2O&#8901; radicals on the microdroplet surface. Furthermore, partial solvation and the EF collaboratively catalyze the isomerization of the RCH2O&#8901; radical into a more stable tautomer, R&#8901;CHOH. This study highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying the widespread generation of radicals at the microdroplet surface and provides insights into the importance of fundamental alcohol chemistry in the atmosphere.

         <title>Multi&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocycle Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Amphoteric Organic Superstructures for Superior Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;N&#8208;heterocycle donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures provide high&#8208;density accessible n&#8208;type triazines and p&#8208;type piperazines, achieving high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;kinetics organic cathode via a two&#8208;step 18&#8197;e&#8722; anion&#8211;cation coordination reaction. Integrated high discharge voltage and structure stability give the Zn&#8208;organic battery record energy density and cycle life (412&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles).







Abstract
Multiple redox&#8208;active amphoteric organics with more n&#8208;p fused electron transfer is an ongoing pursuit for superior zinc&#8211;organic batteries (ZOBs). Here we report multi&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;site donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated amphoteric organic superstructures (AOSs) by integrating three&#8208;electron&#8208;accepting n&#8208;type triazine motifs and dual&#8208;electron&#8208;donating p&#8208;type piperazine units via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. AOSs expose flower&#8208;shaped N&#8208;heteromacrocyclic electron delocalization topologies to promise full accessibility of built&#8208;in n&#8208;p redox&#8208;active motifs with an ultralow activation energy, thus liberating superior capacity (465&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) for Zn||AOSs battery. More importantly, the extended multiple donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;fused conjugated AOSs feature satisfied discharge voltage and anti&#8208;dissolution in electrolytes, pushing both the energy density and cycle life of the ZOBs to a new level (412&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 70,000 cycles@10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). An anion&#8211;cation hybrid 18&#8197;e&#8722; charge storage mechanism is rationalized for heteromacrocyclic modules of AOSs cathode, entailing six tert&#8208;N motifs coupling with CF3SO3&#8722; ions at high potential and twelve imine sites coordinating with Zn2+ ions at low potential. These findings constitute a major advance of amphoteric multielectron organic materials and stand for a good starting point for advanced ZOBs.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring efficient formation mechanisms, as well as self&#8208;renewing solid electrolyte interfaces, is essential for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This paper proposes a novel and straightforward method for forming the interface, introducing an organic&#8211;inorganic composite solid&#8208;to&#8208;gel electrolyte layer with high mechanical performance. The self&#8208;renovating mechanism is also discussed, which may accelerate the practical application of self&#8208;renovating interface in the field of zinc&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIB) have emerged as a promising technology in the realm of electrochemical energy storage.

&lt;p&gt;Exploring efficient formation mechanisms, as well as self-renewing solid electrolyte interfaces, is essential for zinc-ion batteries. This paper proposes a novel and straightforward method for forming the interface, introducing an organic&#8211;inorganic composite solid-to-gel electrolyte layer with high mechanical performance. The self-renovating mechanism is also discussed, which may accelerate the practical application of self-renovating interface in the field of zinc-ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIB) have emerged as a promising technology in the realm of electrochemical energy storage. Despite its potential advantages in terms of safety, cost-effectiveness, and inherent safety, AZIB faces significant challenges.

         <title>High&#8208;Yielding Nanobelt Formation by Chirality&#8208;Assisted Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis is used to create chiral and enantiopure annulated nanobelts from their chiral precursors via a one&#8208;pot self&#8208;condensation process in 84&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;persistent conjugated nanobelts (CNBs) are fascinating synthetic targets. However, in most cases these are made in low overall yields by applying strategies of macrocyclization followed by (multiple) ring fusion reactions for nanobelt formation. Here, we describe the high yielding synthesis of enantiopure chiral nanobelts in 84&#8201;% yield by applying chirality&#8208;assisted synthesis (CAS). The chiral nanobelts were investigated by UV/Vis and CD spectroscopy. By DFT calculations the aromaticity of these structures is discussed.

         <title>Activation and C&#8722;C Coupling of Aryl Iodides via Bismuth Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic formation of C&#8211;C bonds from aryl halides is a highly attractive but unexplored area in the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis. We report a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to forge C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds via C&#8211;H functionalization. The bismuth complex features two different light&#8208;driven processes: an MLCT transition that promotes oxidative addition into Bi(I) and an LLCT&#8208;enabled homolytic cleavage of aryl&#8211;Bi(III) bonds.







Abstract
Within the emerging field of bismuth redox catalysis, the catalytic formation of C&#8722;C bonds using aryl halides would be highly desirable; yet such a process remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we present a chemoselective bismuth&#8208;photocatalyzed activation and subsequent coupling of (hetero)aryl iodides with pyrrole derivatives to access C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp2) linkages through C&#8722;H functionalization. This unique reactivity is the result of the bismuth complex featuring two redox state&#8208;dependent interactions with light, which 1) activates the Bi(I) complex for oxidative addition via MLCT, and 2) promotes the homolytic cleavage of aryl Bi(III) intermediates through a LLCT process.

         <title>Chemoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of &#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone Catalyzed by a Simple Organoaluminum Complex to Prepare Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Functional Polyester</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents the controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy) to produce functionalizable P(MVL)ROP at room temperature. P(MVL)ROP with a high molar mass behaves as a tough thermoplastic with good mechanical properties comparable to isotactic PP. Moreover, MeAl(BHT)2 can also efficiently catalyzed the bulk depolymerization of P(MVL)ROP to recover MVL.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Methylene&#8208;&#948;&#8208;valerolactone (MVL) as a bio&#8208;renewable bifunctional monomer has shown great promise to prepare closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyester with pendent functionalizable double bond. However, the chemoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of MVL still faces challenges including low polymerization temperature, expensive catalyst as well as high catalyst loading. In this contribution, we present the chemoselective and controlled ROP of MVL using a simple organoaluminum complex [MeAl(BHT)2] (BHT=2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenoxy), which can be easily prepared from commercially available trimethylaluminum and 2,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenol without purification. MeAl(BHT)2 exhibits much higher catalytic activity (TOF=668&#8201;h&#8722;1) than that of MeAl[Salen] (TOF=89&#8197;h&#8722;1), a commonly used organoaluminum catalyst. The high chemoselectivity and activity of MeAl(BHT)2 is proposed to originate from the cooperative activation of propagating chain&#8208;ends and monomers via the &#8220;coordination&#8208;insertion&#8221; mechanism. Remarkably, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight P(MVL)ROP can be prepared in bulk using MeAl(BHT)2, which is not accessible by the previous catalysts. This study may advance the development of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymers considering the easy preparation, low cost and good catalytic performance of MeAl(BHT)2.

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Insertion into Se&#8722;S Bonds by Synergistic Rh(II)/Guanidine Catalysis Involving Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Assistance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric carbene insertion into the Se&#8722;S bond of PhSeSCN under synergistic catalysis by a dirhodium salt and a chiral guanidine is reported. Various selenylthiocyanatopropanoates were prepared in good yields and enantioselectivity and exhibited excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory activity against IL&#8208;1&#946;. A new chalcogen&#8208;bond activation mode is disclosed.







Abstract
The efficient construction of chalcogen&#8208;atom&#8208;based chiral compounds remains a challenge, despite the importance of organoselenium and organosulfur compounds in life and materials science. Chalcogen atoms can form net attractive interactions called chalcogen bonds, but it is an undeveloped tool to assist asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we report an enantioselective insertion platform to install a stereogenic center bearing selenyl and thiocyano functional groups. Our method operates by synergistic catalysis by a chiral guanidine and an achiral dirhodium complex in a three&#8208;component or four&#8208;component reaction, through Se&#8722;S bond insertion into carbene species, competing successfully with the spontaneous racemic process and showing high regioselectivity. As elucidated by spectroscopic experiments and computational studies, a unique mechanism involving chalcogen as well as hydrogen bonding was established to account for the enantiocontrol. The high stereoselectivity holds for a broad array of selenylthiocyanatopropanoates, which showed excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory toward IL&#8208;1&#946; and low cytotoxicity.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Berkeleyone A and Preaustinoid A through Epoxypolyene Cyclization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of the highly oxidized berkeleyone A and preaustinoid A is reported. Key features include a bioinspired Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed epoxypolyene cyclization of epoxyallylsilane, which effectively constructs a 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic framework containing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core and stereoselectively controlling five chiral centers. Additionally, a tandem alpha&#8208;methenylation and neopentyl alcohol protection is accomplished using Eschenmoser's reagent.







Abstract
A bioinspired Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed epoxypolyene cyclization was developed to construct the tetracyclic framework containing a bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core and seven chiral centers. The usage of this approach for assembling these natural products of 6/6/6/6 tetracyclic skeleton with bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane core is demonstrated by the total synthesis of highly oxidized berkeleyone A and preaustinoid A.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Gene Expression System Using a Caging&#8208;Group&#8208;Free Photoactivatable Dye</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced gene expression system was developed using a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye with a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator, QacR. This system allowed transcriptional activation with mild visible light exposure, large dynamic range, and simultaneous detection of the state of the effector molecule in cell&#8208;free and cellular conditions.







Abstract
Optical regulation of transcription using chemical compounds is an effective strategy to manipulate gene expression spatiotemporally. Conventional caging approaches with photoremovable protecting groups may require intense UV&#8208;light exposure and release potentially toxic byproducts. To address these problems, here we developed a light&#8208;mediated transcriptional regulation system by combining a caging&#8208;group&#8208;free photoactivatable dye PaX560 and a multidrug&#8208;binding transcriptional regulator QacR. The cationic dye generated from PaX560 through traceless photoconversion bound QacR and reduced its repressor function, resulting in transcriptional activation. Importantly, this system allowed transcriptional activation with a large dynamic range under mild visible light exposure and simultaneous detection of the state of the photoactivated effector. This module was integrated into the T7 RNA polymerase expression system to demonstrate light&#8208;activated transcription in vitro and in living cells.

         <title>Characterization of Iminobismuthanes and Catalytic Reduction of Organic Azides via Bi(I)/Bi(III) Redox Cycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction between N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes and organic azides leads to isolation of elusive monomeric iminobismuthanes, which can be spectroscopically and crystallographically characterized. This novel reactivity led to the development of a protocol for the catalytic reduction of organic azides using pinacolborane (HBpin) under mild conditions.







Abstract
We report the stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity of organobismuth(I) complexes with organic azides. Treatment of N,C,N&#8208;pincer bismuthinidenes with organic azides (acyl, sulfonyl, and bulky aryl) results in monomeric iminobismuthanes which can be structurally characterized &#8212;including the formal Bi=N double bond&#8212; by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Building upon the stoichiometric reactivity of the monomeric iminobismuthanes, catalytic reduction of a broad range of organic azides is developed. DFT calculations of the catalytic reaction pathway support the redox nature of the overall process.

         <title>Bioinspired &#8220;Intermolecular Pocket&#8221; in Soft Molecular Crystal of Porous Organic Cage&#160;Exhibiting Reversible Guest Recognition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous Organic Cages (POCs) have gathered a lot of attention in sorts of fields. Previous studies often focused on the functionalization of their intrinsic porosity, while the utilization of the extrinsic porosity has been seldom reported. To date, the rational construction of functionalized extrinsic porosity in POCs is a serious challenge, which still relies on trial and error. Inspired by hydrophobic proteins, in the contribution, a POC (namely NKPOC&#8208;DS) is obtained with hydrophobic &#8220;intermolecular pocket&#8221; as extrinsic porosity constructed through the assembly of disulfide bonds with hydrophobic groups, facilitating strong supramolecular interactions as confirmed by Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Notably, NKPOC&#8208;DS exhibits a unique C2H6&#8208;selective "breathing behaviour" due to the presence of softness in its extrinsic porosity, which does not extend to other gases such as C2H4, CH4, CO2, N2, and H2. Such specific recognition of C2H6 thus provides NKPOC&#8208;DS with the ability to preferentially adsorb C2H6 from a C2H6/C2H4 mixture. The innovative approach of biomimicry in the design of functional POCs provides new insights into manipulating the packing of cages, paving the way for potential applications in guest recognition and adsorption separations.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Folding of Fluorinated Polyphenylene by Sulfur Fluorine Annulative Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report that fluorinated polyphenylene P50 undergoes folding&#8208;like sulfur fluorine annulative substitution (SFAS) to form a well&#8208;defined tubular helix H50. This is achieved with atomic precision in an exceptionally efficient manner, involving the simultaneous transformation of 98 C&#8211;F bonds with the yield per reaction site approaching 99.9%. The desired product H50 features a fully fused dibenzothiophene skeleton of 5.8 helical turns in total. It is truly monodisperse (&#272; = 1.0) in nature, allowing for thorough spectroscopic characterizations. Unambiguous single crystal X&#8208;ray structure, distinct chiroptical properties, and intriguing through&#8208;cavity threading complexation are described. These results, in addition to those of H50&#8217;s lower congeners, H34 and H18, illustrate the great potential of folding&#8208;like SFAS in shaping random&#8208;coiled polymer chains into higher&#8208;order functional structures.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two T&#8208;shaped 14&#8208;electron rhodium complexes 2a and 2b, "framed" and thus stabilized by PNP pincer ligands have been synthesized. The bis(t&#8208;butyl)phosphine derived PNPtBu&#8208;rhodium 2a was isolated from pentane as the more stable cyclometalated Rh(III) hydrido complex and found to be in equilibrium with the T&#8208;shaped 14e&#8208;Rh(I) complex 2aT which itself could be directly crystallized upon change of the solvent. The cyclometallation is suppressed using an adamantyl substituted PNPAd ligand to give the analogous T&#8208;shaped Rh(I) species 2b, stabilized through an agostic interaction with one of the adamantyl C&#8208;Hs. Depending on the solvent, complex 2a reacted with ethylene either by &#960;&#8208;coordination (4a) or C&#8208;H activation giving a hydrido&#8208;vinyl Rh(III) species 4b, both isomers being in equilibrium in solution. Complex 2b C&#8208;H was found to reversibly activate arenes to form the hydrido&#8208;aryl Rh(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Natural channel proteins allow the selective permeation of ions, water or other nutritious entities across bilayer membranes, facilitating various essential physiological functions in living systems. Inspired by nature, chemists endeavor to simulate the structural features and transport behaviors of channel proteins through biomimetic strategies. In this review, we start from introducing the inherent traits of channel proteins such as their crystal structures, functions and mechanisms. Subsequently, different kind of synthetic ion channels including their design principles, dynamic regulations and therapeutic applications were carefully reviewed. Finally, the potential challenges and opportunities in this research field were also carefully discussed. It is anticipated that this review could provide some inspiring ideas and future directions towards the construction of novel bionic ion channels with higher&#8208;level structures, properties, functions and practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Heptannulated Perylene Diimides: Formation and Reactivity of Electron&#8208;Deficient Tropylium Cations and Heptafulvenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated motifs opens pathways to previously unexplored classes of organic semiconductors and functional dyes. In this study, five&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered carbocycles were fused at the ortho and bay regions of electron&#8208;deficient perylenes, starting from a common dialdehyde precursor. Structural analysis of the resulting perylene tetraesters, dianhydrides, and diimides (PDIs) revealed three distinct ring&#8208;fusion patterns and defined stereochemistry. The fused PDI cycloheptatrienes demonstrated susceptibility to acid&#8208;catalyzed transarylation, involving tropylium cation intermediates, which can be used preparatively. Under superacidic conditions, the PDI tropylium cations were directly observed and shown to undergo hydride&#8208;transfer reductions. Additionally, a fused PDI bis(heptafulvene) was synthesized by dehydrogenating a suitably substituted PDI cycloheptatriene. The final system contains two quinomethane units, which can be protonated to yield a stable tropylium&#8208;like dication.</dc:description>

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Mobility Differential Amplifier: Enhancing Pressure&#8208;Induced Voltage Response in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Piezoionics is an emerging mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion paradigm that enables self&#8208;powered sensing systems for next&#8208;generation intelligent wearable electronics. However, there are currently no rational design approaches to enhance the stimulus response of piezoionic devices. Here, we present a strategy using crown ether as ion&#8208;selective mobility differential amplifiers for enhancing the pressured&#8208;induced voltage response in ionic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels. The crown ether grafted PVA (PVA&#8208;CE) hydrogel prototype achieves a 30&#8208;fold amplified piezoionic coefficient of 1490 nV Pa&#8722;1 within 0 &#8211; 1 kPa, compared to 49 nV Pa&#8722;1 of the unmodified PVA. The PVA&#8208;CE exhibits an ultra&#8208;low pressure detection limit of 0.2 Pa with a fast response time of 18.1 ms. Leveraging these properties, we further demonstrate a human somatosensory network analogous PVA&#8208;CE piezoionic skin using arrayed pressure sensing. These capabilities hold great promise for emerging healthcare applications such as synthetic biology, soft robotics, and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatial and Temporal Visualization of Polymorphic Transformations in Pharmaceutical Tablets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>X&#8208;ray Diffraction Computed Tomography (XRD&#8208;CT) represents a cutting&#8208;edge method for non&#8208;destructive material analysis, offering the unique capability of providing molecular&#8208;level information with spatial resolution. In this study, we have applied XRD&#8208;CT to investigate pharmaceutically relevant tablets that have been subjected to a range of compression pressures typical in tablet manufacturing. By employing XRD&#8208;CT to pharmaceutical tablets, we reveal material changes without tablet destruction, thereby avoiding potential phase transformations during sample preparation that could lead to errors in the interpretation of the processes that have occurred. Utilizing a pressure&#8208;sensitive marker, glycolide, we have tracked changes within tablet structures induced by compression, pinpointing locations where glycolide undergoes pressure&#8208;induced transformation. Additionally, we conducted a follow&#8208;up study with analysis one month later, observing an in&#8208;situ hydrolysis reaction of glycolide within the tablets. Through the complementary use of electron diffraction, we have elucidated the structure of the hydrolysis product, further enhancing our understanding of temporal changes in the tablets.</dc:description>

         <title>Long&#8208;Term&#160;Single&#8208;Molecule Tracking in Living Cells Using Weak&#8208;Affinity Protein Labeling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation times, and obstructing the study of long&#8208;term cellular processes within single living cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy&#8208;to&#8208;apply labeling approach for live&#8208;cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of individual live cells of up to 30 minutes. Using the xHTL/HaloTag7 labeling system, we measure the ligand&#8208;induced activation kinetics of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in single living cells. We generate spatial maps of receptor diffusion in cells, report non&#8208;uniform distributions of receptor activation, and the formation of spatially confined &#8216;hot spots&#8217; of EGFR activation. Furthermore, we measured the mobility of the ER&#8208;luminal protein calreticulin in living cells and found diffusion coefficients that correlated with the ER nano&#8208;structure. This approach represents a general strategy to monitor protein dynamics in a functional context and for extended observation times in single living cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Aeration&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction Mediated by Heterojunction Photocatalyst toward Efficient Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regulation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation by photo&#8208;assisted heterogeneous catalysis is under in&#8208;depth investigation with potential as a replaceable advanced oxidation process in water purification, yet it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a strategy to construct polyethylene glycol (PEG) well&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;defect   VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx S&#8208;scheme heterojunction to degrade organic pollutants without aeration, which dramatically provides abundant active sites, excellent photo&#8208;thermal property, and distinct charge transport pathway for PMS activation. The degradation rate of VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx in anaerobic conditions shows a higher efficient rate (4.58 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2) than in aerobic conditions (1.67 min&#8208;1 g&#8208;2). Experimental evidence reveals that VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx promotes more rapid redox conversion of photoexcited electrons induced by defects with PMS under anaerobic conditions compared to aerobic conditions. Additionally, in situ experiments and DFT provide mechanistic insights into the regulation pathway of PMS activation via synergistic defect&#8208;induced electron, revealing the competitive effect between O2 and PMS over VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx during the reaction process. The continuous flow reactor and flow cytometry results demonstrated that the VO&#8208;M&#8208;Co3O4@CNx/PMS/Vis system has remarkably enhanced stability and purification capability for removing organic pollutants. This work provides valuable insights into regulating the heterologous catalysis oxidation process without aeration through the photoexcitation synergistic PMS activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Global Profiling Lysine Reactivity and Ligandability with Oxidant&#8208;Triggered Bioconjugation Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the high abundance and diverse functions of lysine residues, both in the interior and on the surface of proteins, the development of new methods to characterize their reactivity and ligandability could significantly expand the pool of druggable targets. To date, only a limited number of aminophilic electrophiles have been assessed for interactions with the lysine proteome, resulting in a substantial fraction remaining inaccessible to current probes. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first oxidant&#8208;triggered bioconjugation platform for in&#8208;depth profiling of lysines. We quantified over 7000 covalently modifiable lysine residues, which significantly expands the coverage of ligandable lysines in the whole proteome. Chemical proteomics enabled the mapping of more than 100 endogenous kinases, thus providing a comprehensive landscape of ligandable catalytic lysines within the kinome. Moreover, we identified a suite of new ligandable lysines such as K60 of ENO1 and K31 of PPIA, offering insights for exploring new functional and targetable residues. These findings could provide valuable clues for the development of novel targeted covalent inhibitors (TCIs).</dc:description>

         <title>A Noncovalent &#960;&#8208;Stacked Dual&#8208;Pore Molecular Crystal for Ethanol/Water and Benzene/Methanol Azeotrope Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Separation of ethanol/water or benzene/methanol azeotrope mixtures presents significant challenges, not only due to the limitations of conventional distillation techniques but also because of the constraints in developing and utilizing of new generation adsorbents. Porous organic molecular frameworks constructed via noncovalent &#960;&#8208;interactions are emerging as novel adsorbents with vast potential in gas adsorption and molecular separation. Herein, we report a permanent two&#8208;dimensional porous structure, namely TDTBA&#8208;1, which consists of two different kinds of pores through &#960;&#8208;stacking of a single organic molecule with highly&#160;Td&#160;symmetry. Activated TDTBA&#8208;1 exhibits excellent hydrophobicity, thermal stability, recoverability and high selectivity for ethanol over water, and benzene over methanol. Therefore, activated TDTBA&#8208;1 can be used as an efficient stationary phase for the separation of ethanol/water and benzene/methanol azeotropes by high&#8208;resolution gas chromatography.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;hybridized Fused&#8208;ring Electron Acceptor with High Dielectric Constant and Isotropic Charge Transport for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel isotropic fullerene&#8208;hybridized fused&#8208;ring electron acceptor, designated C60&#8208;Y, has been synthesized via a mild [4+2] Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition reaction with fullerene C60 to enhance the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Comparative analysis shows that C60&#8208;Y significantly outperforms the control acceptor Me&#8208;Y, with a notable increase in the relative dielectric constant from 2.79 to 3.95. This improvement enhances exciton dissociation and reduces non&#8208;radiative energy losses. Additionally, the isotropic molecular packing of C60&#8208;Y, similar to fullerene, facilitates efficient interface formation with donor polymers and improves charge mobility. As a result, incorporating C60&#8208;Y as an electron acceptor increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of binary OSCs to 15.02%, surpassing the 13.31% achieved with Me&#8208;Y. Moreover, when integrated into a ternary blend system, an impressive PCE of 19.22% is achieved, top&#8208;performing among reported ternary OSCs utilizing fullerene derivatives as the third component. These results suggest that fullerene&#8208;hybridized acceptors like C60&#8208;Y hold great potential for advancing high&#8208;efficiency OSCs by enhancing exciton dissociation, reducing energy losses, and improving charge mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Prolonging Charge Carrier lifetime via Intraband Defect Levels in S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions for Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>S&#8208;scheme heterostructure photocatalysts, distinguished by unique charge&#8208;transfer pathways and exceptional catalytic redox capabilities, have found widespread applications in addressing challenging chemical processes, including the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with a high reaction barrier. Nevertheless, the influence of intraband defect levels within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions on charge separation, carrier lifetime, and surface catalytic reactions has, for the most part, been overlooked. Herein, we develop a tunable defect&#8208;level&#8208;assisted strategy to construct an electron reservoir, effectively prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers through the rapid capture and gradual release of photoelectrons within WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, as authenticated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations. The surface photoredox mechanism, unraveled by Gibbs free energy calculations, demonstrates that oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;induced defect states in WO3&#8208;x/In2S3 heterojunctions unlock the rate&#8208;determining H2O oxidation into free oxygen molecules by forming metastable oxygen intermediates, contributing to the facilitation of H2O photooxidation. This distinct role, combined with the extended carrier lifetime, results in boosted CO2 photoreduction with nearly 100% CO selectivity in the absence of any photosensitizer or scavenger. Our work sheds light on the role of controllable defect levels in governing charge transfer dynamics within S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, thereby inspiring the development of more advanced photocatalysts for artificial photosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Esterification of Phosphoric, Phosphonic and Phosphinic Acids with Organosilicates: Phosphorus Chemical Recycling of Sewage Waste</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Global concerns regarding the depletion and strategic importance of phosphorus resources have increased demand for the recovery and recycling. However, waste&#8208;derived phosphorus compounds, primarily as chemically inert phosphoric acid or its salts, present a challenge to their direct conversion into high&#8208;value chemicals. We aimed to develop an innovative technology that utilizes the large quantities of sewage waste, bypasses the use of white phosphorus, and enables esterification of phosphoric acid to produce widely applicable phosphate triesters. Tetraalkyl orthosilicates emerged as highly effective reagents for the direct triple esterification of 85% phosphoric acid, as well as the esterification of organophosphinic and phosphonic acids. Furthermore, we achieved esterification of recovered phosphoric acid with tetraalkyl orthosilicate, thus pioneering a recycling pathway from sewage waste to valuable phosphorus chemicals. Experimental and theoretical investigations revealed a novel mechanism, wherein tetraalkyl orthosilicates facilitate multimolecular aggregation to achieve alkyl transfer from tetraalkylorthosilicate to phosphoric acid via multiple proton shuttling.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Propylene/Propane Sieving Separation through Gate&#8208;Pressure Control within a Flexible Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of propylene (C3H6) and propane (C3H8) is of great significance in the chemical industry, which poses a challenge due to their almost identical kinetic diameters and similar physical properties. In this work, we synthesized an ultramicroporous flexible hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (named HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106) by using molecule 2,3,6,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;cyanophenyl)tetrathiafulvalene (TTF&#8208;4CN). The formation of the dimer causes the TTF&#8208;4CN molecular to bend and weaken &#960;&#8208;stacked interactions, coupled with the flexibility of C&#8801;N&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#8211;C hydrogen bonds, which leads to reversible conversion between open and closed frameworks through the mutual slip of adjacent layers/columns under activation and stimulation of gas molecules. Through gas adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpy, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a exhibited adaptive adsorption and stronger binding affinity for C3H6, and presented a recorded gas uptake ratio of C3H6/C3H8 (23.77) among presentative HOF materials at room temperature to date. Importantly, the flexible HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;106a shows an interesting phenomenon about the reversible gate pressure control under variable temperature, which realized the gas adsorption and separation performance enhancement for the binary C3H6/C3H8 mixtures. This strategy through designing HOFs with thermoregulatory gating effect is a powerful way to maximize the performance of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Eight&#8208;Membered O&#8208;Heterocycles through Cross&#8208;[4+4] Cycloaddition of Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral eight&#8208;membered rings embedded in tetraphenylene derivatives and hetero&#8208;analogues exhibit unique properties and allow diverse applications. A conceptually viable and straightforward approach to these frameworks is [4+4] cycloaddition, which still remains elusive. In this study, we describe the stereoselective cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloaddition of quinone methides (QMs), leading to the formation of oxa&#8208;analogues of tetraphenylene with exceptional chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The structures of these novel rigid eight&#8208;membered O&#8208;heterocycles were explored via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their stereochemical stability was elaborated through both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and thermal racemization experiments. The developed methodology exhibited broad substrate scope and the resulting cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadducts could be readily transformed into valuable chiral building blocks. Our findings expanded the inherently chiral library of medium&#8208;sized rings and also contributed to the advancement of asymmetric cross&#8208;[4+4] cycloadditions of quinone methides.</dc:description>

         <title>Declined Singlet&#160;but Constant Triplet&#160;Energy: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Triplet Blocking Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules have been widely investigated in organic light emitting diodes, etc. Small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap&#160;and high radiative constants&#160;are desired. The prevalent TADF molecules are via donor&#8208;acceptor molecular design, which&#160;is at the expense of reducing radiative constants. Herein, we demonstrated a new singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation approach to construct TADF with high radiative constant, based on triplet blocking effect, i.e., the extension of conjugation of a triplet constrainer (IB) leads to a gradually red&#8208;shifted singlet&#160;but a constant triplet&#160;energy, and therefore reduced singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap controlled from monomer (IB), monomer&#8208;linker (IB&#8208;BF2), to dimer of IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. The natural transition orbital analysis indicates that singlet&#160;state is delocalized while triplet&#160;state is localized as confirmed by time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Therefore, the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap is reduced from 0.60 eV, 0.46 eV to 0.25 eV, while keeping faster radiation rate (around 10^8/s) than that of conventional donor&#8208;acceptor molecules (10^6 ~ 10^7/s). As a result, the emission mechanisms are regulated from fluorescence for IB, phosphorescence/TADF dual emissions for IB&#8208;BF2 to TADF for IB&#8208;BF2&#8208;IB. This paper proposed a new approach of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap modulation, which is crucial for fundamental photophysics and material science.</dc:description>

         <title>Reconstructing the Coordination Environment of Fe/Co Dual&#8208;atom Sites towards Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Free Sulfate Groups in Glycosylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>General strategies for synthesizing sulfated oligosaccharides employ the protection of sulfate groups for glycosylation or post&#8208;sulfation after the synthesis of oligosaccharides. However, the chemical behavior of free sulfate groups in glycosylation reactions has not been thoroughly studied. We examined several glycosyl donors with free sulfate groups, but neither glycosyl imidates nor thioglycosides achieved products. Conversely, activating 6&#8208;sulfated GalNAc donors with either a 2&#8208;NTroc group or 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl group using an ortho&#8208;hexynylbenzoate group at the anomeric position yielded &#946;&#8208;glycosides in good yield. These results indicate that glycosylations with a free sulfate group can be performed and that the neighboring group participation of 2&#8208;NHTroc and 2&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl groups works even with an unprotected sulfate group at 6&#8208;position. Ab initio calculations supported the formation of acyloxionium&#8208;cation via 2&#8208;O&#8208;acyl participation. Additionally, glycosylation reactions under various counter cations of the sulfate group, such as Na+, Li+, K+, Ba2+ and pyridinium were examined. Results showed that sodium and lithium salt donors yielded the products in good yield. These results were also supported by ab initio calculations. Practical glycosylation reactions between disaccharide donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with free sulfate groups successfully yielded the sulfated tetrasaccharides. This study also discusses how a sodium salt acts as a protecting group during glycosylation.</dc:description>

We examined several glycosyl donors with free sulfate groups, but neither glycosyl imidates nor thioglycosides achieved products. Conversely, activating 6-sulfated GalNAc donors with either a 2-NTroc group or 2-O-acetyl group using an ortho-hexynylbenzoate group at the anomeric position yielded &#946;-glycosides in good yield. These results indicate that glycosylations with a free sulfate group can be performed and that the neighboring group participation of 2-NHTroc and 2-O-acetyl groups works even with an unprotected sulfate group at 6-position.

         <title>Quinoline Substituted Anthracene Isomers: A Case Study for Simultaneously Optimizing High Mobility and Strong Luminescence in Herringbone&#8208;packed Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of high mobility emissive organic semiconductors is significant for advancing optoelectronic devices with simplified architecture and enhanced performance. The herringbone&#8208;packed structure is regarded as the ideal arrangement for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission in organic semiconductors.  However, it remains a great challenge that the relationship between molecular structure and optoelectronic property is still elusive. Herein, four quinoline&#8208;substituted anthracene isomers were designed and synthesized by introducing quinoline groups to anthracene core. Their intermolecular interactions and packing mode in the herringbone&#8208;packed structures were regularly tuning by subtle changing the nitrogen position on quinoline group, resulting in the superior integration of optoelectronic properties. Through a comprehensive analysis of aggregation states and optoelectronic properties, we revealed that in herringbone&#8208;packed aggregates, a centroid distance of approximately 7&#8208;7.5 &#197; along CH&#8208;&#960; direction and 6&#8208;6.5 &#197; along &#960;&#8208;&#960; direction is beneficial for simultaneously achieving high mobility and strong emission. These properties are closely related to the molecular twist angles, which are influenced by intramolecular interactions. This structure&#8208;property relationship has been further validated in other herringbone&#8208;packed high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, demonstrating its broad applicability and universal potential. This work figures out the practical molecular design principle for high mobility emissive organic semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Radical Acylfluoroalkylation of Bicyclobutanes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclobutanes are prominent structural components in natural products and drug molecules. With the advent of strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven synthesis, ring&#8208;opening reactions of bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) provide an attractive pathway to construct these three&#8208;dimensional structures. However, the stereoselective difunctionalization of the central C&#8211;C &#963;&#8208;bonds remains challenging. Reported herein is a covalent&#8208;based organocatalytic strategy that exploits radical NHC catalysis to achieve diastereoselective acylfluoroalkylation of BCBs under mild conditions. The Breslow enolate acts as a single electron donor and provides an NHC&#8208;bound ketyl radical with appropriate steric hindrance, which effectively distinguishes between the two faces of transient cyclobutyl radicals. This operationally simple method tolerates various fluoroalkyl reagents and common functional groups, providing a straightforward access to polysubstituted cyclobutanes (75 examples, up to &gt;19:1 d.r.). The combined experimental and theoretical investigations of this organocatalytic system confirm the formation of the NHC&#8208;derived radical and provide an understanding of how stereoselective radical&#8208;radical coupling occurs.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmed Charge Transfer in Conjugated Polymers with Pendant Benzothiadiazole Acceptor for Simultaneous Photocatalytic H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While being important candidate for heterogeneous photocatalyst, conjugated polymer typically exhibits random charge transfers between the alternating donor and acceptor units, which severely limits its catalytic efficiency. Herein, inspired by natural photosystem, the concept of guiding the charge migration to specific reaction sites is employed to significantly boost photocatalytic performance of linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) with pendant functional groups via creating programmed charge&#8208;transfer channels from the backbone to its pendant moiety. The pendant benzothiadiazole, as revealed in both in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can act as electron "reservoir" that aggregates electrons at the active sites. Moreover, the presence of charge&#8208;transfer channels, evidenced by transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), accelerates the electron transfer, preventing the recombination of electrons and holes. As a result, in this elaborately&#8208;designed architecture, the photogenerated electron can move smoothly towards the reduction sites, facilitating the reduction of O2 into H2O2, while remaining holes are directed to oxidation centers, simultaneously oxidizing furfuryl alcohol to furoic acid. The optimized photocatalyst LCP&#8208;BT demonstrates a competitive catalytic performance with H2O2 productivity of 868.3 &#956;mol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 (9.8 times higher than conventional random charge&#8208;transfer polymer LCP&#8208;1) and furfuryl alcohol conversion over 95% after 6 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyltriylenes and their Heterobimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of triylenes of the heavy group 13 elements gallium, indium and thallium, carrying the pentaisopropylcyclopentadienyl ligand is reported. The compounds were characterized in solution and in the solid&#8208;state and their donor ligand properties in heterobimetallic complexes were investigated, whereby a series of tungsten carbonyl complexes was isolated. Furthermore, a new synthetic route towards a previously described lithium&#8208;aluminum heterobimetallic dimetallocene is reported, which also enabled the isolation of a heterobimetallic polydecker of lithium and gallium.</dc:description>

         <title>GlutaR: A&#160;High&#8208;Performance Fluorescent Protein&#8208;Based Sensor for Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Glutamine Dynamics In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in human blood and muscle, and is integral to a wide variety of functions in cancer cells. However, the inability to monitor the subcellular distribution of glutamine in real&#8208;time has obscured understanding of glutamine metabolism under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report the development of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor and demonstrate how this GlnBP&#8208;cpYFP fusion &#8220;GlutaR sensor&#8221; undergoes glutamine&#8208;induced conformational changes reflected in detectable fluorescence responses. Obtained after iterative screening of approximately 1,600 variants, GlutaR exhibits a ratiometric readout, fast response kinetics, and high responsivity, and we demonstrate its selectivity for monitoring glutamine fluctuations in multiple cell types. Additionally, using digitonin permeabilization of GlutaR HeLa cells, we generated a calibration curve and performed&#160;in situ&#160;titration to quantify free glutamine concentrations in subcellular compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondria). Subsequently, we applied GlutaR to investigate how chemical and genetic inhibition of GS and GLS differentially alter glutamine levels in subcellular compartments. Finally, we demonstrate GlutaR&#8217;s ability to monitor dynamic glutamine levels in muscle and liver tissues of diabetic mice&#160;in vivo.&#160;These findings collectively demonstrate GlutaR as a versatile tool for the spatiotemporal characterization of glutamine metabolism in living cells and tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>Spontaneously Blinkogenic Probe for Wash&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Localization&#8208;Based Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging relies on the fluorescence ON/OFF switching of fluorescent probes to break the diffraction limit. However, the unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes cause non&#8208;targeted ON/OFF switching, resulting in substantial fluorescence background that significantly reduces localization precision and accuracy. Here, we report a blinkogenic probe HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo that remains blinking OFF until it binds to HaloTag, thereby triggering its self&#8208;blinking activity and enabling its application in direct SMLM imaging in living cells without wash&#8208;out steps. We employed the ratio of the duty cycle before and after self&#8208;blinking activation, termed as the parameter "RDC" to characterize blinkogenicity. The covalent binding to HaloTag induces HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo to transition from a fluorescent OFF state to a fluorescence blinking state. This transition also leads to a change in the RDC value, which is calculated to be 12, ensuring super&#160;blinkogenicity to effectively suppress background signals in living cells. HM&#8208;DS655&#8208;Halo was successfully applied in dynamic SMLM imaging of diverse intracellular sub&#8208;structures with minimal background noise, including mitochondrial fission and contact, cell migration, and pseudopod growth.</dc:description>

         <title>Production of Branched Alkanes by Upcycling of Waste Polyethylene over Controlled Acid Sites of SO4/ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Branched alkanes, which enhance the octane number of gasoline, can be produced from waste polyethylene. However, achieving highly selective production of branched alkanes presents a significant challenge in the upcycling of waste polyethylene, and the maximum selectivity for branched alkanes reported up to date is about 70%. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot process to convert polyethylene into gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons (C4&#8208;C13) with yield of 73.3% over SO42&#8208;ZrO2&#8208;Al2O3 catalyst at 280 &#176;C. The proportion of branched alkanes reaches 90.1% within the C4&#8208;C13 fraction. Incorporation of sulfate group endows the catalyst with strong Lewis acid sites and weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ infrared spectroscopy, in situ small angle neutron scattering, and DFT calculations reveal that polyethylene activation occurs through the synergy between sulfate groups and strong Lewis acid sites (Zr sites). The weak and moderate Br&#248;nsted acid sites preferentially catalyze the isomerization and type A &#946;&#8208;scission processes, which favors the formation of branched alkanes, while suppressing competing reactions that produce straight&#8208;chain alkanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus via electronic effects of organic functional groups for enhanced hydrogen production activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electronic effects of organic functional groups play a fundamental role in determining the rate and/or direction of organic chemical reactions. The implementation of this concept in selective organic catalysis is achieved by tuning the electronic effects of organic functional groups to alter the corresponding reactivity. However, this approach has hardly been applied to modulate the band structure of inorganic materials. Here, we show that modulating the electronic band structure of two&#8208;dimensional black phosphorus (BP) is possible via the electronic effects of organic functional groups covalently modified on its surface. Organic functional group can either donate or withdraw charge density from BP surface, which will alter the bonding/anti&#8208;binding orbitals occupancy and thus shift the band&#8208;edge positions of functionalized BP downward/upward. Therefore, the valence&#8208;band maxima and the conduction&#8208;band minima of functionalized BP can be continuously tuned by changing the binding group with different Hammett parameters. Finally, unexpectedly high hydrogen evolution reaction rates under visible light are achieved using functionalized BP heterojunctions as photocatalysts. This work underscores the significant role of electronic effects in chemically controlling BP&#8217;s band structure, offering greater flexibility and affordability beyond physical method limits.</dc:description>

         <title>Activating Oxygen via the 3&#8208;Electron Pathway to Hydroxyl Radical by La&#8208;O4 Single&#8208;atom on WO3 for Water Purification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shifting photocatalytic oxygen activation towards 3&#8208;electron (e&#8208;) pathway to hydroxyl radicals, instead of the normal 1 e&#8208; to superoxide radicals, becomes increasingly important for pollution degradation since hydroxyl radicals possess a high oxidation potential (2.80 V). Here, we demonstrate a selective oxygen activation to hydroxyl radicals via 3 e&#8208; pathway using single atomically dispersed La based on WO3 fabricated with oxygen vacancies to weaken La&#8208;O coordination strength (denoted as LaO4&#8208;WOv). Unsaturated&#8208;state La overcomes the rate&#8208;limited step of 2 e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction towards to hydrogen peroxide via tuning binding free energy of key reaction intermediate *OOH, stepped by easy generation of hydroxyl radicals via 1 e&#8208;. This strategy alters the activation of oxygen process from 1 e&#8208; to 3 e&#8208;. Hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals over LaO4&#8208;WOv produces 3.8 and 3.3 mmol L&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, 35 and 8 times that of detected over WO3, respectively. Rapid and complete removal of tetracycline realizes over LaO4&#8208;WOv with 0.077 min&#8208;1 of rate constant, 38 times that of WO3. Degradation efficiencies keep greater than 98% following five repeats, revealing a practical&#8208;utilization&#8208;level robust stability. This work builds an unsaturated&#8208;state transition metal site for manipulating oxygen activation towards an effective water purification as a representative application.</dc:description>

         <title>Designable Electrochemiluminescence Patterning for Renewable and Enhanced Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical imaging enables an in&#8208;depth analysis of the interface heterogeneity and reaction kinetics of single entities. However, electrode passivation during electrochemical reactions decreases the active sites and harms the long&#8208;term stability. Here, we introduce a method using laser&#8208;induced photothermal effects to restore the electrochemical activity, which is particularly displayed as enhanced micrometric patterns in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy. By co&#8208;localization characterization and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the mechanism of active site regeneration is validated as the removal of the oxide film for restoring the local surface ECL reactivity under laser irradiation. The surface&#8208;confined and voltage&#8208;dependent features of ECL allows for easy pattern erasure and rewriting, and it shows good reversibility and anti&#8208;counterfeiting potential. This approach overcomes the passivation processes, evidently improves the image quality of single biological entities including Shewanella bacteria and cells, and makes the subtle contour structures more distinct. The renewable electrode interface also enhances the ECL signal of model bead&#8208;based bioassays. This approach not only showcases precise control in fabricating micron patterns but also holds promise for enhancing the sensitivity in electrochemical immunoassays and bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Using a New&#160;Pt(II) Source to Make Pt(II) Lantern&#8208;Shaped Cages, Including Low&#8208;Symmetry, Heteroleptic, and Multicavity Examples</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current synthetic methods towards Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages involve the use of dry solvent, inert atmosphere, lengthy reaction times, and highly variable yields if isolated. Starting materials such as [Pt(CH3CN)4](BF4)2 suffer from a poor shelf&#8208;life, reducing the synthetic accessibility of various Pt(II) architectures. A new Pt(II) source (with varied counterions), [Pt(3&#8208;ClPy)4](X)2 (3&#8208;ClPy = 3&#8208;chloropyridine, X = BF4&#8208;, OTf&#8208;, NO3&#8208;), is developed and characterised, showing greatly enhanced shelf&#8208;life characteristics under ambient atmospheric conditions. Using this starting material, the assembly of Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages was completed in as little as 1.5 hours with wet solvent and ambient atmosphere. The first examples of low&#8208;symmetry, heteroleptic and multicavity Pt(II) lantern&#8208;shaped cages are reported using this approach. Attempts towards an M6L8 octahedron using a tritopic ligand instead generate an interesting M2L4 cage with unbound pyridyl arms. Ligands and cages are characterised by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallography in some cases.</dc:description>

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Assemblies of Polyoxovanadate Clusters as Supramolecular Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular functional materials can be used to overcome some of the most challenging tasks in materials science, where the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions can be leveraged to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the material. The Lindqvist hexavanadate family of polyoxometalates are&#160; interesting candidates for supramolecular materials due to their redox and Lewis acid properties that enable their application in&#160;energy conversion or catalysis. Despite their promising potential, hexavanadate clusters are underrepresented in supramolecular materials, mainly due to the synthetic challenges related to their inherent reactivity. In this work, pillar[5]arene was successfully grafted onto a Lindqvist hexavanadate and the resulting structure was confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, presenting the first example of a crystal structure of a polyoxometalate covalently functionalized with a pillar[5]arene. By introducing a ditopic guest molecule that could interlink pillar[5]arene moieties, host&#8208;guest interactions were leveraged as the driving force for the formation of supramolecular assemblies incorporating hexavanadate clusters in a controlled manner. The enhanced catalytic performance of the resulting aggregates confirmed their potential application as functional catalytic materials. This novel approach for developing hexavanadate&#8208;based catalysts reported here showcases the potential of using host&#8208;guest interactions as a means to introduce catalytically active metal&#8208;oxo clusters into supramolecular frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Paired&#160;Electro&#8208;Synthesis of Remote Amino Alcohols with/in H2O</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amino alcohols, particularly remote amino alcohols and peptide alcohols, are valuable due to their functional diversity in biologically active compounds. However, traditional synthesis methods face significant challenges, making electrochemistry an attractive alternative. We have developed a mild and biocompatible sequential paired electrolysis strategy, leveraging copper&#8208;electrocatalysis to synthesize diverse remote amino alcohols, including unnatural peptide alcohols. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that water serves as both the hydroxyl source and the solvent, facilitating the generation of CuH with Cu(I) at the cathode, which in turn reduces the aldehyde intermediates formed during the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;red Emitting Copper(I) Indenediyltrisphosphine Complexes with Minimized Skeletal Vibrations and Configurational Disorder</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of emission spectra, which plays an important role in determining color purity, may not always receive sufficient attention in the design of emissive materials.&#160;Particularly for the red&#160;emitter, the traditional focus has been on emission maxima, yet broad FWHM values can significantly change the perceived color.&#160;For example, the red color (lem&#160;=&#160;616&#8211;677 nm) emitted from reported Cu(I) complexes is perceived as orange to yellow if FWHM is large. To reduce FWHM, we incorporated a strained and rigid metalaphosphadicyclopenta[a,f]pentalene motif into Cu(I) complexes using trisphosphine ligands featuring a 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,3&#8208;diyl backbone (ITP).&#160;Herein, we present the synthesis, structure, and emission properties of&#160;ITP&#8208;MX&#160;and&#160;the&#160;congeners, showcasing genuinely deep&#8208;red emission with narrow FWHM values of 56 nm. These materials exhibit color coordinates close to pure red on the CIE diagram, unlike reported broader&#8208;emitting counterparts. Measurement of the entropy of disorder of the emissive crystal by a recently reported statistical mechanical method revealed a quantitative correlation between FWHM and the increase in the number of microstates (the degree of freedom) of the crystals and suggested that mechanical stress can increase the entropy of the crystal, which results in emission broadening.</dc:description>

         <title>Reassessing the Photochemical Upcycling of Polystyrene Using Acridinium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Approaches aimed at deconstructing PS by photocatalytic means struggle to generate high&#8208;energy species capable of cleaving the C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C bonds of PS. We show herein that 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium perchlorate (MA) is capable of upcycling various grades of PS susbstrates into benzoic acid (BAc) up to 40%, with small proportions of acetophenone and formic acid, under visible light (456 nm) or through solar radiation. Time&#8208;resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy evidence that a reaction with oxygen is the primary photochemical step in oxygen&#8208;saturated solutions, accounting for 77% of the photons absorbed vs. 1% for the direct reaction with PS. These results suggest a mechanism in which MA&#8208;mediated photocycling of PS to BAc occurs through the abstraction of benzylic H atoms by reactive oxygen species generated by energy or electron transfer from the excited state of MA. Addition of triplet O2 to these radicals, followed by intra&#8208; or inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), generates C&#8208; or O&#8208;centered radicals then undergoing &#946;&#8208;scission or hydroperoxide fragmentation. The formation of intermediate oligomers functionalized by terminal carbonyl groups is demonstrated by both infrared analysis and mass spectrometry. These oligomers undergo further photoinduced conversion in the absence of MA, as evidenced by size exclusion chromatography analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Layer Delivers siRNAs to Overcome Radioresistance and Potentiate Cancer Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based cationic metal&#8208;organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X&#8208;rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9% and 91.4% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models, respectively.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy plays an important role in modern oncology, but its treatment efficacy is limited by the radioresistance of tumor cells. As a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, survivin plays a key role in developing radioresistance by mediating apoptosis evasion, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and modulating cell cycle dynamics. Efficient downregulation of survivin expression presents a promising strategy to enhance the antitumor effects of radiotherapy. Herein, we report the design of a hafnium-porphyrin-based cationic metal-organic layer (CMOL) with quaternary ammonium capping groups to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for enhanced radiotherapy. The CMOL@siRNA nanoplatform not only increased energy deposition from X-rays and reactive oxygen species generation via a unique radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy process, but also effectively delivered siRNAs to downregulate survivin expression and ameliorate radioresistance of cancer cells. Consequently, CMOL@siRNA in combination with low-dose X-ray irradiation demonstrated remarkable antitumor efficacy with 96.9% and 91.4% tumor growth inhibition in murine colorectal carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer models, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Bisulfite&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Molecule Real&#8208;Time Sequencing of Methyldeoxycytidine Based on a Novel hpTet3 Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In addition to the four canonical nucleosides dA, dG, dC and T, genomic DNA contains the additional base 5&#8208;methyldeoxycytidine (mdC). The presence of this methylated cytidine nucleoside in promoter regions or gene bodies significantly affects the transcriptional activity of the corresponding gene. Consequently, the methylation patterns of genes are crucial for either silencing or activating genes. Sequencing the positions of mdC in the genome is therefore of paramount importance for early cancer diagnostics as it helps determine incorrect gene expression. Currently, the bisulfite method is the gold standard for mdC&#8208;sequencing. However, this method has the drawback that the majority of the input DNA is degraded during the bisulfite treatment. Additionally, bisulfite sequencing is prone to errors. Here, we report a benign, bisulfite&#8208;free mdC sequencing method termed EMox&#8208;seq, which is based on third&#8208;generation single&#8208;molecule SMRT sequencing. The foundation of this technology is a new Tet3 enzyme that efficiently oxidizes mdCs to 5&#8208;carboxycytidine (cadC). In turn, cadC provides an excellent readout by SMRT sequencing using specially trained AI&#8208;based algorithms.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Near&#8208;Infrared Irradiation for Heating Mechanochemical Reactions in Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Doped Epoxy Milling Jars</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Albeit mechanochemistry is a novel promising technology that give access to reactivity under solvent&#8208;free conditions, heating such reactions is sometimes compulsory to obtain satisfactory results in terms of conversion, selectivity and/or yield. In this work, we developed a novel approach using a dye that absorbs NIR photons and release the energy as heat. Hence, de novo milling jars in epoxy resin doped with the dye were thus produced to obtain reactors that would produce heat upon irradiation at 850 nm. Temperature profiles were recorded, depending on the irradiance, dye charge in the resin, and milling frequency, showing an excellent control of the temperature. The usefulness of the heating jar was then demonstrated in mechanochemical reactions that are known to require heat to yield the desired product, namely Diels&#8208;Alder reactions with high activation energies and the newly developed rearrangement of a sydnone into corresponding 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazolin&#8208;2&#8208;one.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Modulation of Nanographenes Enabled by Defects, Size and Doping for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanographenes are among the fastest&#8208;growing materials used for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) thanks to their low cost, environmental friendliness, excellent electrical conductivity, and scalable synthesis. The perspective of replacing precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts with functionalized graphene is highly desirable for reducing costs in energy conversion and storage systems. Generally, the enhanced ORR activity of the nanographenes is typically deemed to originate from the heteroatom doping effect, size effect, defects effect, and/or their synergistic effect. All these factors can efficiently modify the charge distribution on the sp2&#8208;conjugated carbon framework, bringing about optimized intermediate adsorption and accelerated electron transfer steps during ORR. In this review, the fundamental chemical and physical properties of nanographenes are first discussed about ORR applications. Afterward, the role of doping, size, defects, and their combined influence in boosting nanographenes&#8217; ORR performance is introduced. Finally, significant challenges and essential perspectives of nanographenes as advanced ORR electrocatalysts are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence/Photoacoustic Dual Ratiometric Probes with Unique Recognition Site for Quantitatively Visualizing H2S2 in Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen persul&#64257;de (H2S2) plays a significant role in redox biology and signal transduction; therefore, quantitative visualization of H2S2 in the deep tissue of living organisms is essential for obtaining reliable information about relevant pathophysiological processes directly. However, currently reported H2S2 probes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their poor selectivity for many polysulfide species or their short wavelength, which hinders precise imaging in deep tissues. Herein, for the first time, we report a unique H2S2&#8208;mediated dithiole formation reaction. Based on this reaction, we construct the first NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;ratiometric probe (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;H2S2)&#160; for quantitatively visualizing H2S2 in vivo. This probe shows dual&#8208;ratiometric NIR&#8208;II fluorescence (I840/I1000, 107&#8208;fold) and photoacoustic (PA800/PA900, 6.5&#8208;fold) responses towards Na2S2 species with high specificity, excellent sensitivity (1.8&#160;nM), improved water solubility, and deep&#8208;tissue penetration. More importantly, using NIR&#8208;II dual&#8208;ratiometric FL/PA imaging, we successfully demonstrated that the probe could be used to accurately quantify the fluctuating H2S2 levels in the liver&#8208;injury mouse models induced by lipopolysaccharides or metformin drugs. Overall, this study not only presents a promising tool for H2S2&#8208;related pathological research, but also provides a unique recognition site that may be generalized for designing more useful H2S2 imaging agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Proton Conduction in Quasi&#8208;Solid Zinc&#8208;Manganese Batteries via Constructing Highly Connected Transfer Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elusive ion behaviors in aqueous electrolyte remain a challenge to break through the practicality of aqueous zinc&#8208;manganese batteries (AZMBs), a promising candidate for safe grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems. The proposed electrolyte strategies for this issue most ignore the prominent role of proton conduction, which greatly affects the operation stability of AZMBs. Here we report a water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with efficient proton transfer pathways based on the large&#8208;space interlayer of montmorillonite and strong&#8208;hydration Pr3+ additive in AZMBs. Proton conduction is deeply understood in this quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte. Pr3+ additive not only dominates the proton conduction kinetics, but also regulates the reversible manganese interfacial deposition. &#160;As a result, the Cu@Zn||&#945;&#8208;MnO2 cell could achieve a high specific capacity of 433 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.4 mA cm&#8211;2 and an excellent stability up to 800 cycles with a capacity retention of 92.2% at 0.8 mA cm&#8211;2 in such water&#8208;poor quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte for the first time. Ah&#8208;scale pouch cell with mass loading of 15.19 mg cm&#8211;2 sustains 100 cycles after initial activation, which is much better than its counterparts. Our work provides a new path for the development of zinc metal batteries with good sustainability and practicality.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Expansion toward Fused Diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes through Lewis Acid Catalyzed Highly Selective C&#8722;C/C&#8722;N Bond Cross&#8208;Exchange Reaction between Bicyclobutanes and Diaziridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has garnered considerable interest in drug discovery because of their ability to mimic benzene bioisosteres. Herein, we introduce a new approach that utilizes a Lewis acid (Sc(OTf)3)&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond cross&#8208;exchange reaction between the C&#8722;C bond of bicyclobutanes and the C&#8722;N bond of diaziridines to produce multifunctionalized and medicinally interesting azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane derivatives. The reaction proceeds well with different bicyclobutanes and a broad range of aryl&#8208; as well as alkenyl&#8208;, but also alkyl&#8208;substituted diaziridines (up to 98% yield). Conducting a scale&#8208;up experiment and exploring the synthetic transformations of the cycloadducts emphasized the practical application of the synthesis. Furthermore, a zinc&#8208;based chiral Lewis acid catalytic system was developed for the enantioselective version of this reaction (up to 96% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective and Homochiral Supramolecular Polymerization of Nanotadpole Aggremers of Poly(phenylacetylene) Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biological homochirality is a signature of life. Supramolecular polymerization is effective to achieve high hierarchical homochirality in nature, but has not been well&#8208;explored. Herein, we report regioselective and homochiral supramolecular polymerization of chiral nanotadpole aggregates made of either synthetic helical poly(phenylacetylene)s or chirality&#8208;amplified co&#8208;assembly of chiral and achiral poly(phenylacetylene)s. The twisted nanotadpole aggregates with high screw&#8208;sense preference polymerized as monomers (aggremers) into supramolecular chains in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail regioselective and stepwise manner. Supramolecular copolymerization of enantiomeric aggremers favored formation of homochiral hierarchical supramolecular structures as visualized by TEM. Chiral hexagonal columnar mesophase of aggremers was responsive for the stereoselectivity. The work opens a gate to controllably and effectively construct functional chiral supramolecular materials and deepens the understanding of hierarchical biological homochirality.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Origin of Capacity Increase in Rechargeable Magnesium Batteries with Manganese Oxide Cathodes and Copper Metal Current Collectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs), with Cu as positive electrode current collector (CC), typically display a gradual capacity increase with cycling. Whereas the origin of this was suggested in gradual active material electro&#8208;activation, the fact that this is prevalent in many positive electrode material systems remains unexplained. Herein, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through a series of multiscale joint operando X&#8208;ray characterizations, including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and imaging technology. We select a series of manganese oxides as benchmark positive electrodes and find that no magnesium ions are stored within the lattices of these materials, despite an apparent cell capacity increase with cycling. The origin of capacity increase is rooted in the gradual electrochemical corrosion of metallic Cu, release of Cu(I, II) species in electrolyte, and their subsequent redox activity, resulting in apparent electrode capacity gains. Furthermore, the shuttle and redox speciation of Cu ions trigger the irreversible depletion of both the Cu CC (or any other source) and the magnesium metal, ultimately leading to cell failure. Our work suggests the need to reconsider the appropriateness of using Cu as a positive electrode CC for RMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoporous Electrodes Enhance the Electrocatalytic Performance of [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The metalloenzyme [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase is of interest to future biotechnologies targeting the production of &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen (H2). We recently developed a simple two&#8208;step functionalized procedure to immobilize the [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase from Clostridium pasteurianum (&#8220;CpI&#8221;) on mesoporous indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to achieve elevated H2 production with high operational stability, with current densities of 8 mA cm&#8211;2. Here, we use a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) to understand how mesoporous ITO stabilizes and activates CpI for electroenzymatic H2 production. Examination of the topography and morphology of the mesoporous ITO surface revealed a hierarchical morphology containing cavities and well&#8208;defined nanoparticle agglomerates. Any potential effect of mesoporosity was investigated by comparing the stability and electroenzymatic activity of CpI on mesoporous &#8216;nanoITO&#8217; and planar ITO, where we determined that CpI has a higher turnover frequency and absorbs with greater stability (with respect to electroenzymatic activity over time) to nanoITO surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous Molecular Crystals Derived from Cofacial Porphyrin/Phthalocyanine Heterodimers.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin&#8208;based porous materials are of growing interest as heterogeneous catalysts especially for
reactions that are of importance to sustainability. Here we demonstrate that porous molecular crystals
can be prepared by the simple co&#8208;crystallisation of tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) with octa(2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenoxy)
phthalocyanine or some of its metal complexes [(dipPhO)8PcM; M = H2, Al&#8208;OH,
Ti=O, Mn&#8208;Cl, Fe&#8208;Cl, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga&#8208;Cl, Ag, In&#8208;Cl or Au&#8208;Cl]. This process is facilitated by the
efficient formation of the supramolecular heterodimer between TPP and (dipPhO)8PcM, which is
driven by the complementary shape and symmetry of the two macrocycles. The (dipPhO)8PcM
component directs the crystal structure of the heterodimers to form Phthalocyanine Nanoporous
Crystals (PNCs) of similar structure to those formed by (dipPhO)8PcM alone. The incorporation of
TPP appears to partially stabilise the PNCs towards the removal of included solvent and for cocrystals
containing (dipPhO)8PcCo stability can be enhanced further by the in&#8208;situ addition of 4,4&#8208;bipyridyl
to act as a &#8220;molecular wall tie&#8221;. These stabilised PNC/TPP cocrystals have a Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller
surface area (SABET) of 454 m2 g&#8208;1 and a micropore volume (Vmp) of 0.22 ml g&#8208;1. The reactivity of both
macrocycles within the PNC/TPP co&#8208;crystals are demonstrated by in&#8208;situ metal insertion.</dc:description>

         <title>Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Activated Dynamic Condensation Approach to Narrow&#8208;Band Gap Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl units intrinsically featuring less steric, nonpolarity, and unsaturated character, are well&#8208;known &#960;&#8208;bridge used in the synthesis of high&#8208;performance semiconducting materials. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) vinylene&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) represent a promising class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures, however, the range of available monomers for the reversible formation of carbon&#8208;carbon double bonds remains limited. In this study, a new class of 2D vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were synthesized using dimethyldiketopyrrolopyrrole&#160;(DM&#8208;DPP) as the key monomer. The strong electron deficiency of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) makes its methyl substituents readily activated upon the cocatalysis of L&#8208;proline and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine in aqueous solution to conduct dynamic condensation with tritopic aromatic aldehydes. The resulting COFs crystallized in an eclipsed AA stacking arrangement and featured abundant, regular nanochannels. Their robust vinyl DPP&#8208;linking mode enhanced donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor conjugation and promoted &#960;&#8208;stacked alignment along the vertical direction. Consequently, the synthesized COFs exhibited band gaps as narrow as 1.02 eV and demonstrated excellent light&#8208;harvesting capability across the visible to near&#8208;infrared I (NIR&#8208;I) regions. Furthermore, the COFs could be converted into free&#8208;standing thin pellets through simple pressure casting, and show excellent photothermal response and cycling stability under different light sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Stable Decomposition Products on Cathode Surfaces to Enable High Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfide solid electrolytes such as Li6PS5Cl hold high promise for solid state batteries due to their high ionic conductivity; however, their oxidation potential of ~2.5 V is not compatible with high voltage Ni&#8208;rich cathodes such as LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2 (x&#8805;0.8). Here, we devise an effective, conformal and thin coating on the cathode active material guided by density functional theory, which suppresses the oxidative decomposition of Li6PS5Cl as shown by experiment. The nanometric coating on nickel&#8208;rich NMC85 enabled capacity retention of 82% after 200 cycles (2.8&#8208;4.3 V vs Li+/Li) using Li6PS5Cl as the solid electrolyte. In comparison, cells with an uncoated CAM only displayed 56% capacity retention. The coated&#8208;NCM85 cells also demonstrate much better rate performance and higher capacity. The enhanced performance is due to the formation of a stable amorphous cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase accruing from the decomposition products of the LiPO2F2 precursor (as predicted by DFT), which protect the sulfide electrolyte from oxidation. The coating fabricated in this cost&#8208;effective process showed superior performance to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coatings such as LiNbO3. This work highlights the importance of rationally designing stable coating materials based on their potential decomposition products and confirms the suitability of a low&#8208;cost and conformal coating to enable sulfide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Escape from Flatland: Stereoselective Synthesis of Hexa&#8208;aryl Borazines and their sp&#178;&#8208;Based 3D Architectures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borazine and its derivatives can be considered critical doping units for engineering hybrid C(sp2)&#8208;based molecules with tailored optoelectronic properties. Herein, we report the first synthesis of&#160;hexaarylborazines that, bearing&#160;ortho&#8208;substituted aryl moieties, extend three&#8208;dimensionally.&#160;Using a one&#8208;pot protocol, we first form an electrophilic chloroborazole and then react it with an aryl lithium (ArLi). By selecting the appropriate&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent, we can guide the ArLi to add to the BN&#8208;core in a specific way, ultimately controlling the stereochemical outcome of the three&#8208;substitution reaction. Rationalization of the stereochemical model through computational analysis allowed us to show that&#160;when aryl lithium nucleophiles bearing rigid long&#8208;range&#160;ortho&#8208;substituents&#160;are used,&#160;i.e.,&#160;stiff substituents. The&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent shields its side of the electrophilic B3N3&#160;core, biasing the incoming ArLi to add&#160;anti&#160;at each addition step, forming the final tri&#8208;aryl borazine exclusively as&#160;cc&#8208;isomer.&#160;Leveraging this stereoselective approach, prototypical multichromophoric borazine derivatives were prepared, and we showcased how the stereochemical arrangement of these chromophores distinctly influences their redox behavior.&#160;This methodology paves the way for previously inaccessible borazines to serve as&#160;privileged precursors&#160;to transcend the conventional bidimensionality associated with graphenoid systems and pioneer the construction of new forms of three&#8208;dimensional C(sp2)&#8208;based architectures.</dc:description>
