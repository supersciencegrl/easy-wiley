      <title>On the Use of Differential Scanning Calorimetry for Thermal Hazard Assessment of New Chemistry: Avoiding Explosive Mistakes</title>
      <dc:description>
Analysis of the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for thermal hazard assessment in 2019 shows some alarming trends. Many reports are not reproducible, do not follow established best practices and the conclusions drawn are not supported by the data presented. This Viewpoint discusses these issues and offer simple guidance on how to avoid them.







Abstract
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is increasingly used as evidence to support a favourable safety profile of novel chemistry, or to highlight the need for caution. DSC enables preliminary assessment of the thermal hazards of a potentially energetic compound. However, unlike other standard characterisation methods, which have well defined formats for reporting data, the current reporting of DSC results for thermal hazard assessment has shown concerning trends. Around half of all results in 2019 did not include experimental details required to replicate the procedure. Furthermore, analysis for thermal hazard assessment is often only conducted in unsealed crucibles, which could lead to misleading results and dangerously incorrect conclusions. We highlight the specific issues with DSC analysis of hazardous compounds currently in the organic chemistry literature and provide simple &#8220;best practice&#8221; guidelines which will give chemists confidence in reported DSC results and the conclusions drawn from them.

      <title>An &#945;&#8208;Cyclopropanation of Carbonyl Derivatives by Oxidative Umpolung</title>
      <dc:description>
An impossible triangle? Iodine(III) promotes the &#945;&#8208;cyclopropanation of simple ketone derivatives. Mechanistic studies reveal that an unusual intermediate might be involved.







Abstract
The reactivity of iodine(III) reagents towards nucleophiles is often associated with umpolung and cationic mechanisms. Herein, we report a general process converting a range of ketone derivatives into &#945;&#8208;cyclopropanated ketones by oxidative umpolung. Mechanistic investigation and careful characterization of side products revealed that the reaction follows an unexpected pathway and suggests the intermediacy of non&#8208;classical carbocations.

      <title>Fullerenes as key components for low&#8208;dimensional (photo)electrocatalytic nanohybrid materials</title>
      <dc:description>An emerging class of heterostructures with unprecedented (photo)electrocatalytic behavior, involving the combination of fullerenes and low&#8208;dimensional (LD) nanohybrids, is currently expanding the field of energy materials. The unique physical and chemical properties of fullerenes have offered new opportunities to tailor both the electronic structures and the catalytic activities of the nanohybrid structures. Here, we comprehensively review the synthetic approaches to prepare fullerene&#8208;based hybrids with LD (0D, 1D, and 2D) materials in addition to their resulting structural and catalytic properties. Recent advances in the design of fullerene&#8208;based LD nanomaterials for (photo)electrocatalytic applications are emphasized. The fundamental relationship between the electronic structures and the catalytic functions of the heterostructures, including the role of the fullerenes, is addressed to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of these emerging materials at the molecular level.</dc:description>

Recent advances in the design of fullerene&#8208;based LD nanomaterials for (photo)electrocatalytic applications are emphasized. The fundamental relationship between the electronic structures and the catalytic functions of the heterostructures, including the role of the fullerenes, is addressed to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of these emerging materials at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Suppressing Strong Exciton&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Blue Perovskite Nanoplatelet Solids by Binary Systems</title>
      <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites have been proved to be promising candidates for light generation owing to their high radiative rates. However, strong exciton&#8208;phonon interactions caused by mechanical softening of the surface act as a bottleneck in improving their suitability for a wide range of lighting and display applications. Moreover, it is not easily available to tune the phonon interactions in bulk films. Here, we adopt bottom&#8208;up fabricated blue emissive perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) as model systems to elucidate and as well as tune the phonon interactions via engineering of binary NPL solids. By optimizing component domains, the phonon coupling strength can be reduced by a factor of 2 driven by the delocalization of 2D excitons in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientations. It shows the picosecond energy transfer originated from the F&#1255;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiently competes with the exciton&#8208;phonon interactions in the binary system. Explicit deciphering of the relationship between phonon interactions and energy transfer, and successful modulations of the phonon interactions in the binary system provide significant implications for developing high&#8208;performance excitonic optoelectronics.</dc:description>

      <title>Gas&#8208;Constructed Vesicles with Gas&#8208;Moldable Membrane Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>
Cooking with gas: CO2 gas and frustrated Lewis pair monomers can polymerize to form vesicles. Changing the gas used results in the formation of vesicles with distinct components, architectures, and morphologies. This introduces the use of gases to form nanomaterials and could be used to recycle industrial waste gases.







Abstract
Integrating gas as a main building block into nanomaterial construction is a challenging mission that remains elusive. Herein, we report a gas&#8208;constructed vesicular system formed by CO2 gas and frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs). Two molecular triads bearing three bulky borane and phosphine groups are designed as trivalent disc&#8208;like FLP monomers. CO2, as a gas cross&#8208;linker, can drive the two&#8208;dimensional polymerization of these two FLP monomers, leading to the generation of planar FLP networks that further transform into a thermodynamically favored membranous vesicle structure. Gas&#8208;guided vesicle formation is also applicable to other inert but FLP&#8208;activatable gases. Different gas linkages can form vesicles with distinct architectures, sizes, and morphologies. We envisage that this study would suggest a new concept that exploits gases to fabricate tunable nanomaterials.

      <title>Compaction of RNA duplexes in the cell</title>
      <dc:description>The structure and flexibility of RNA depend sensitively on the microenvironment. Using pulsed electron&#8208;electron double&#8209;resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy combined with advanced labeling techniques, we show that the structure of double&#8208;stranded RNA (dsRNA) changes upon internalization into  Xenopus l&#230;vis  oocytes.

      <title>Fluorescence Quenching Effects of Tetrazines and Their Diels&#8208;Alder Products: Mechanistic Insight Toward Fluorogenic Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Inverse electron demand Diels&#8211;Alder (iedDA) reactions between  s  &#8208;tetrazines and strained dienophiles have numerous applications in chemical biology and materials science. Tetrazines most often quench the emission of pendant fluorophores. This effect, however, is diminished upon iedDA, leading to the formation of emissive products with important applications in fluorescence labelling of biomolecules. Herein we investigate the effect of the dienophile on the fluorescence enhancement obtained upon reaction with a tetrazine&#8208;quenched fluorophore and study the possible mechanisms of fluorescence quenching by both the tetrazine and its reaction products through a combination of linear and ultrabroadband two&#8208;dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D ES) experiments. The dihydropyridazine product obtained from reaction of the tetrazine with a strained cyclooctene shows a residual fluorescence quenching effect, greater than that exerted by the pyridazine arising from reaction of the tetrazine with the analogous alkyne. Ultrabroadband 2D ES measurements reveal that resonance energy transfer is the mechanism responsible for the fluorescence quenching effect of tetrazines, whereas a mechanism involving more intimate electronic coupling, most likely photoinduced electron transfer, is responsible for the quenching effect of the dihydropyridazine. These studies uncover parameters that can be tuned to maximize fluorogenic efficiency in bioconjugation reactions and they reveal that strained alkenes, though optimal for fast kinetics, are not the best reaction partners for achieving maximum contrast ratio in fluorescence labeling.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding&#8208;Promoted Cascade Rearrangement Involving the Enlargement of Two Rings: Efficient Access to Polycyclic Quinoline Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>An efficient cascade reaction of tryptamine&#8208;derived isocyanides with C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines is described. The polycyclic pyrrolo[2,3&#8208;  c  ]quinoline derivatives, which benefited from rearrangement process driven by hydrogen bonding, could be directly assembled in moderate to good yields (40&#8208;87%) under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions.

Both experimental and DFT studies provided guidance on the in&#8208;depth insight into the reaction pathways and hydrogen bonding was identified to lower the free energy barrier in transition states. This work constitutes a rare example of tryptamine&#8208;derived isocyanide&#8208;based cascade reactions, and potentially could be a powerful synthetic strategy for accessing polycyclic analogues involved in natural products.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Polarized&#8208;light detection in solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region is indispensable for optoelectronic applications, whereas new 2D candidates targeted at solar&#8208;blind UV range remain extremely scarce. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics that combine polarization and semiconducting properties have taken a booming position within this portfolio. Here, using the 3D&#8208;to&#8208;2D dimensional reduction of CH3NH3PbCl3, we successfully designed a multilayered hybrid perovskite ferroelectric, (CH3CH2NH3)2(CH3NH3)2Pb3Cl10  , which shows notable spontaneous polarization and a high Curie temperature (390 K) comparable with that of BaTiO3  (393 K). Strikingly, the wide bandgap (~3.35 eV) and anisotropic absorbance stemming from its intrinsic 2D motif, greatly favor its polarization&#8208;sensitive activity in UV region. Consequently, the device displays excellent polarization&#8208;sensitive behaviours under 266 nm, along with a large dichroic ratio (~1.38) and high on/off current ratio (~2.3*103  ).

      <title>Dihydrogen Adduct (Co&#8208;H2) Complexes Displaying H&#8208;atom and Hydride Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>The prototypical reactivity profiles of transition metal dihydrogen complexes (M&#8208;H2) are well&#8208;characterized with respect to oxidative addition (to afford dihydrides, M(H)2) and as acids, heterolytically delivering H+ to a base and H&#8208; to the metal. In the course of this study we explored plausible alternative pathways for H2 activation, namely direct activation through H&#8208;atom or hydride transfer from the &#963;&#8208;H2 adducts. To this end, we describe herein the reactivity of an isostructural pair of a neutral S = &#189; and an anionic S = 0 Co&#8208;H2 adduct, both supported by a trisphosphine borane ligand (P3B). The thermally stable metalloradical, (P3B)Co(H2), serves as a competent precursor for hydrogen atom transfer to tBu3ArO&#183;. What is more, its anionic derivative, the dihydrogen complex [(P3B)Co(H&#173;2)]1&#8208;, is a competent precursor for hydride transfer to BEt3, establishing its remarkable hydricity. The latter finding is essentially without precedent among the vast number of M&#8208;H2 complexes known.</dc:description>

To this end, we describe herein the reactivity of an isostructural pair of a neutral S = &#189; and an anionic S = 0 Co&#8208;H2 adduct, both supported by a trisphosphine borane ligand (P3B). The thermally stable metalloradical, (P3B)Co(H2), serves as a competent precursor for hydrogen atom transfer to tBu3ArO&#183;. What is more, its anionic derivative, the dihydrogen complex [(P3B)Co(H&#173;2)]1&#8208;, is a competent precursor for hydride transfer to BEt3, establishing its remarkable hydricity. The latter finding is essentially without precedent among the vast number of M&#8208;H2 complexes known.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Protein allostery at atomic resolution</title>
      <dc:description>Protein allostery is a phenomenon involving the long range coupling between two distal sites in a protein. In order to elucidate allostery at atomic resoluion on the ligand&#8208;binding WW domain of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;enzyme Pin1 multistate structures were calculated from exact nuclear Overhauser effect (eNOE). In its free form the protein undergoes a micro&#8208;second exchange between two states, one of which is predisposed to interact with its parent catalytic domain. In presence of the positive allosteric ligand, the equilibrium between the two states is shifted towards domain&#8208;domain interaction, suggesting a population shift model. In contrast, the allostery&#8208;suppressing ligand decouples the side&#8208;chain arrangement at the inter&#8208;domain interface thereby reducing the inter&#8208;domain interaction. As such, this mechanism is an example of dynamic allostery. The presented distinct modes of action highlight the power of the dynamics&#8208;function interplay in the biological activity of proteins.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Genetically encoded RNA devices have emerged for various cellular applications in imaging and bio&#8208;sensing, but their functions as precise regulators in living systems are still limited.

      <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Photo&#8208;Switched MicroRNA Amplifier for Precise Photodynamic Therapy of Early&#8208;Stage Cancers</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli responsive photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a hot topic in precise medicine. However the low abundance of responsive trigger molecules in early&#8208;stage diseases limits its application. Here we designed an amplifier with multiple upconversion luminances to achieve near&#8208;infrared photo&#8208;switched cascade reaction triggered by specific microRNA and precise PDT of early&#8208;stage cancers. This amplifier was composed of photo&#8208;caged DNA nanocombs and an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) sensitized with IRDye&#174; 800CW. The nanocomb was prepared by assembling a &#8220;photozipper&#8221;&#8208;protected hairpin and two kinds of hybridizable hairpin probes on a DNA skeleton. Upon 808&#8208;nm light irradiation, the produced UV light cleaved off the &#8220;photozipper&#8221; to induce microRNA&#8208;responsive cascade hybridization reaction, which activated the photosensitizers linked to different hairpins to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) under the simultaneously emitted blue light for efficient PDT. The in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated the high amplification efficiency and promising application of the photo&#8208;switched amplifier in early&#8208;stage cancer treatment.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>A significant amount of attention has been given to the design and synthesis of cocrystals by both industry and academia because of its potential to change a molecule&#8217;s physicochemical properties. Yet, difficulties arise when searching for adequate combinations of molecules (or coformers) to form cocrystals, hampering the efficient exploration of the target&#8217;s solid&#8208;state landscape. This paper reports on the application of a data&#8208;driven cocrystal prediction method, based on two types of artificial neural network models and cocrystal data present in the Cambridge Structural Database. The models accept pairs of coformers and predict whether a cocrystal is likely to form.

      <title>Engineering Corona Structure on Gold Nanoclusters for Gastrointestinal Imaging by Red&#8208;shifted Emissions in the Second Near&#8208;infrared Window</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescence emissions in the second near infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have shown extraordinary advantages for bio&#8208;imaging. However, it&#8217;s a big challenge to exploit NIR&#8208;II emitters for gastrointestinal (GI) tract imaging due to fluorescence quenching in digestive microenvironment. Herein, we made an interesting finding that red&#8208;shifted emissions of Au nanoclusters (AuNCs) into NIR&#8208;II region with improved quantum yields (QY) could be achieved by engineering a corona structure of a ribonuclease&#8208;A (RNase&#8208;A) on particle surfaces. RNase&#8208;A encapsulated AuNCs (RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs) displayed emissions at 1050 nm with a 1.9% QY. Compare to rare earth and silver based NIR&#8208;II emitters, RNase&#8208;A@AuNCs had excellent biocompatibility, showed &gt;50&#8208;fold higher sensitivity in GI tract, and homogeneously migrated during gastrointestinal peristalsis to allow visualization of the detailed structures of GI tract.

      <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Nitrogen Fixation Catalyzed by Stable Radical&#8208;Containing MOFs: Improved Efficiency Induced by a Structural Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we present a new viologen&#8208;based radical&#8208;containing metal&#8208;organic framework (RMOF) Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7, which upon heating in air undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation to generate Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8. Both RMOFs exhibit excellent air and water stability as a result of favorable radical&#8208;radical interactions, and their long&#8208;lifetime radicals result in wide spectral absorption in the range 200&#8208;2500 nm. Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7 and Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8 show excellent activity toward solar&#8208;driven nitrogen fixation, with ammonia production rates of 128 and 220 &#181;mol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  , respectively. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that both RMOFs have similar nitrogen fixation pathways. The enhanced catalytic efficiency of Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;8 versus Gd&#8208;IHEP&#8208;7 is attributed to intermediates stabilized by enhanced hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

      <title>Activating Versatile&#160;Mechanoluminescence in Organic Host&#8208;Guest Crystals by Controlling Exciton Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials are attracting increasing interest due to its promising applications in various areas. However, to date, it remains a major challenge to develop a precise and universal route to achieving organic ML materials. Herein, we report the first example that ML can be easily realized in organic piezophotonic host&#8208;guest crystals, under the conditions that neither the host nor the guest is ML&#8208;active. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that, excitons of the host generated by piezoelectricity can be harvested effectively by the guest for light emission, due to the restraint of intersystem crossing process. Moreover, different host&#8208;guest crystals are constructed, wherein the emission colour, intensity, colour purity and emission duration of ML can be manipulated. This work deepens our understanding of organic ML generation in piezophotonic host&#8208;guest crystals and provides an inspiring principle to design more organic ML materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Revealing the Magnesium Storage Mechanism in Mesoporous Bismuth via Spectroscopy and Ab Initio Simulation</title>
      <dc:description>Bismuth is a promising alternative to magnesium metal anode.

An in&#8208;depth understanding of the mechanism of Mg storage in bismuth is crucial for the search of reliable approaches to boost electrochemical performance of MIBs. Here, we present mesoporous bismuth nanosheets as a model to study the charge storage mechanism of Mg/Bi system. Using a systematic spectroscopy investigation of combined synchrotron&#8208;based operando X&#8208;ray diffraction, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and Raman, for the first time, we demonstrate a reversible two&#8208;step alloying reaction mechanism of Bi&#8596;MgBi&#8596;Mg  3  Bi  2  . Ab initio simulation methods disclose formation of the MgBi intermediate, and confirm its high electronic conductivity. This intermediate serves as buffer for the significant volume expansion (204%) and acts to regulate Mg storage kinetics.

Recently, engineering MIP&#8208;based nanomedicines to improve cancer therapy has become a rapidly growing field and future research direction. Because of the unique properties and functions of MIPs, MIP&#8208;based nanoparticles (nanoMIPs) are not only alternative to current nanomaterials for cancer therapy, but also hold the potential to fill some gaps associated with biological ligand&#8208;based nanomedicines, such as immunogenicity, stability, applicability and economic rationality. In this mini&#8208;review, we survey recent advances in the design and fabrication of nanoMIPs for cancer therapy, and highlight their distinct features. In addition, using the features of MIPs to rationally design and construct cancer nanomedicines with desired performance, including extended circulation, active targeting, controlled drug release and anti&#8208;tumor efficacy are summarized and discussed. It is expected that this mini&#8208;review will inspire more advanced studies in MIP&#8208;based nanomedicines for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>High&#8208;Density and Thermally Stable Palladium Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Chemoselective Hydrogenations</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have shown superior activity and/or selectivity for many energy&#8208; and environment&#8208;related reactions, but their stability at high site density and under reducing atmosphere remains unresolved. Herein, we elucidate the intrinsic driving force of palladium single atom with high site density (up to 5 wt%) under reducing atmosphere, and its unique catalytic performance for hydrogenation reactions.  In&#8208;situ  experiments (including scanning transmission electron microscopy, near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction and quasi in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray adsorption) and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd atoms tend to migrate into the surface vacancy&#8208;enriched molybdenum carbide surface during the carburization process by transferring oxide crystals to carbide crystals, leading to the surface enrichment of atomic Pd instead of formation of particles. The Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst exhibits high activity and excellent selectivity for both liquid&#8208;phase hydrogenation of substituted nitroaromatics (&gt; 99%) and gas&#8208;phase hydrogenation of CO  2  to CO (&gt; 98%), which is far superior to their nanoparticles analogues. More importantly, the Pd  1  /&#945;&#8208;MoC catalyst could endure harsh reducing/reacting atmosphere up to 400  o  C without any observable aggregation of single atoms. This work provides an alternative pathway to pursue single&#8208;atom catalysts with preferable performance and stability at high level of site density even under harsh reducing conditions.</dc:description>

      <title>Drug&#8208;like properties in macrocycles above MW 1000: Backbone rigidity vs. side&#8208;chain lipophilicity</title>

      <title>Probe&#8208;Free Direct Identification of Type I and Type II Photosensitized Oxidation Using Field&#8208;Induced Droplet Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>While Type I and Type II photosensitizers are often carefully tailored to achieve their respective advantages in treating different cancers, the identifications of the Type I and II mechanisms  per se  , the key reaction intermediates, and the consequent oxidation products of the substrates have never been easy. Using our unique home&#8208;built field&#8208;induced droplet ionization mass spectrometry (FIDI&#8208;MS) methodology that selectively samples molecules at the air&#8208;water interface,here we show the facile determination of both Type I and II mechanisms of a poster&#8208;child photosensitizer, temoporfin, without the addition of any probes. Remarkably, the unstable doublet radical resulting from the hydrogen abstraction by the triplet temoporfin through the Type I mechanism is captured, manifesting the  in&#8208;situ  advantage of FIDI&#8208;MS. We anticipate that the methodology developed in this study can be widely utilized in the future designs of novel photosensitizers and the screening of their photosensitization mechanisms.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The ability to incorporate functional metal ions (M  n+  ) into metal&#8208;organic coordination complexes adds remarkable flexibility in the synthesis of multifunctional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with tailorable electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.

      <title>LaOCl&#8208;coupled polymeric carbon nitride for overall water splitting through a  one&#8208;photon excitation pathway</title>
      <dc:description>Sun&#8208;light driven water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases in a large scale is a promising method for solar energy conversion. However, it is still a challenge to explore photocatalytic materials for overall water splitting due to the limited choice of a single semiconductor with suitable band energy levels (matching with water redox splitting potentials) while with minimized band gap for light harvesting. Here, we report a one&#8208;photon excitation pathway by coupling polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with LaOCl semiconductor to achieve overall water splitting. This artificial photosynthesis composite catalyzes the decomposition of H2O into H2 and O2, with evolution rates of 22.3 and 10.7 &#956;mol h&#8208;1, respectively, outperforming most of the PCN&#8208;based materials. The high photocatalytic performance of PCN/LaOCl can be ascribed to the simultaneously accomplished reduction and oxidation of water on LaOCl and PCN domains, respectively, as well as the fast charge separation and migration induced by the interfacial electric field related to LaOCl modification. This study provides new insights on the development &#160;of composite photocatalysts for pure water splitting on the basis of polymer&#8208;based materials via charge modulation.</dc:description>

      <title>Posttranslational arginases provide a ribosomal route to non&#8208;proteinogenic ornithine residues in diverse peptide sequences</title>
      <dc:description>Ornithine is a component of many bioactive nonribosomal peptides but has been challenging to incorporate into ribosomal products. We recently identified OspR, a cyanobacterial arginase&#8208;like enzyme that installs ornithines in the antiviral ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified peptide (RiPP) landornamide A. Here we report that OspR belongs to a larger family of peptide arginases from diverse organisms and RiPP types. In  E.&#160;coli  expressions, seven selected enzymes converted arginine residues to ornithines with little preference for the leader type. A diverse range of peptide sequences was modified, including polyarginine repeats. Further exploring the synthetic potential of OspR, we generated analogues of ornithine&#8208;containing nonribosomal peptides using RiPP technology. Five pseudo&#8208;nonribosomal products with ornithines at correct positions were obtained. This included a brevicidine analogue containing ornithine and a d&#8208;amino acid that was installed by the peptide epimerase OspD, suggesting new opportunities for peptide bioengineering.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Propagation of homochirality plays a crucial role in the discussion on the origin of life. We here investigate the role of structurally related enantiopure additives in chiral symmetry breaking during reactive crystallizations. We demonstrate that a symmetry breaking process can be driven towards the same absolute configuration as the additive if this additive forms an enantiospecific solid solution with the racemate. We observe two antagonistic processes: enantiospecific growth inhibition directs symmetry breaking to the opposite enantiomer following &#8220;the rule of reversal&#8221; and enantiospecific solid solution formation that favors homochiral outcomes. During continuous grinding, contributions of solid solution formation override contributions of enantiospecific growth inhibition, directing the process towards the absolute configuration of the additive.

Here, a carbazole&#8208;derived scaffold was used to isolate salts with a mono&#8208;coordinated silicon(II) cation, [RSi]+ (R = bulky carbazolyl substituent), by halide abstraction from a base&#8208;free halosilylene, RSiI, with the Ag[Al(O t BuF)4]. Despite the bulk of the carbazolyl moiety, the silylenylium cation [RSi]+ retains high reactivity. It was shown to react with an amine to form three bonds at the silicon atom in one reaction which conforms with the notion of a &#8220;supersilylene&#8221;. The resulting silylium cation [RSi(H)NR&#8217;2]+ (in the formal oxidation state SiIV) obtained by oxidative addition of an NH bond at [RSi]+ is even more acidic than the silylenylium cation (SiII) due to the absence of a lone pair of electrons the silicon atom.</dc:description>

      <title>Hydroxamic Acids Immobilized on Resins (HAIRs): A Toolbox for the Synthesis of Dual&#8208;Targeting HDAC Inhibitors and HDAC Degraders (PROTACs)</title>
      <dc:description>Inhibition of more than one cancer&#8208;related pathway by multi&#8208;target agents is an emerging approach in modern anticancer drug discovery. Here, based on the well&#8208;established synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and alkylating agents, we present the discovery of a series of alkylating HDACi using a pharmacophore&#8208;linking strategy. For the parallel synthesis of the target compounds, we developed an efficient solid&#8208;phase supported protocol using hydroxamic acids immobilized on resins (HAIRs) as stable and versatile building blocks for the preparation of functionalized HDACi. The most promising compound, 3n, was significantly more active in apoptosis induction, activation of caspase 3/7, and formation of DNA damage (&#947;&#8208;H2AX) than the sum of the activities of either active principle alone. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our preloaded resins, the HAIR approach was successfully extended to the synthesis of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which efficiently degrades histone deacetylases.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of more than one cancer&#8208;related pathway by multi&#8208;target agents is an emerging approach in modern anticancer drug discovery. Here, based on the well&#8208;established synergy between histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and alkylating agents, we present the discovery of a series of alkylating HDACi using a pharmacophore&#8208;linking strategy. For the parallel synthesis of the target compounds, we developed an efficient solid&#8208;phase supported protocol using hydroxamic acids immobilized on resins (HAIRs) as stable and versatile building blocks for the preparation of functionalized HDACi. The most promising compound, 3n, was significantly more active in apoptosis induction, activation of caspase 3/7, and formation of DNA damage (&#947;&#8208;H2AX) than the sum of the activities of either active principle alone. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our preloaded resins, the HAIR approach was successfully extended to the synthesis of a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC), which efficiently degrades histone deacetylases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Intervening Tumor Progression by Coupling Bacteria Respiration with Tumor Metabolism</title>
      <dc:description>By virtue of the unique feature of  Shewanella oneidensis  MR&#8208;1 (  S. oneidensis  MR&#8208;1) that anaerobically catabolize lactate through transferring electrons to metal minerals for respiration, a lactate&#8208;fueled biohybrid (Bac@MnO  2  ) here is constructed by modifying manganese dioxide (MnO  2  ) nanoflowers on the  S. oneidensis  MR&#8208;1 surface. The biohybrid Bac@MnO  2  assigns decorated MnO  2  nanoflowers as electrons receptor and tumor metabolite of lactate as electrons donor to build complete bacteria respiration pathway in tumor sites, which results in continuously burning of intercellular lactate. Additionally, decorated MnO  2  nanoflowers can also catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) to generate oxygen (O  2  ), which could originally prevent lactate production by downregulating hypoxia inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) expression. As lactate plays a critical role in tumor development, the biohybrid Bac@MnO  2  could significantly intervene tumor progression by coupling bacteria respiration with tumor metabolism.</dc:description>

      <title>Concise biosynthesis of phenylfuropyridones from fungi</title>
      <dc:description>Phenylfuropyridone natural products from fungi exhibit a range of antibacterial and cytotoxicity activities, and can potentiate azole antifungals. Herein, we report the concise biosynthetic pathway of compounds in the citridone family through heterologous reconstitution of the  pfp  pathway. We demonstrate multiple members of this family can be accessed from a reactive  ortho&#8208;  quinone methide (QM) intermediate through electrocyclization, cycloisomerization or conjugated addition.&#160; Formation of the quaternary carbon in citridone B is catalyzed by an epoxide&#8208;forming P450, followed by carbon skeletal rearrangement. Our results showcase how nature harvests the reactivities of an enzymatically generated  o&#8208;  QM to biosynthesize complex natural products.</dc:description>
