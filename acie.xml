      <title>Mechanism of 3&#8208;Methylglutaconyl CoA Decarboxylase AibA/AibB: Pericyclic Reaction vs. Direct Decarboxylation</title>
      <dc:description>The enzyme 3&#8208;methylglutaconyl coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase (called AibA/AibB), catalyzes the decarboxylation of 3&#8208;methylglutaconyl CoA to generate 3,3&#8208;dimethylacrylyl&#8208;CoA, which is an important step in the biosynthesis of isovaleryl&#8208;coenzyme A in  Myxococcus xanthus  when the regular pathway is blocked. A novel mechanism has previously been proposed for this enzyme, involving a pericyclic transition state, which would make AibA/AibB unique among decarboxylases. Herein, we use density functional calculations to examine the energetic feasibility of this mechanism. It is shown that the intramolecular pericyclic reaction is associated with a very high energy barrier that is very similar to the barrier of the same reaction in the absence of enzyme. Instead, the calculations show that direct decarboxylation mechanism has feasible energy barriers that are in line with the experimental observations.</dc:description>

      <title>Host Differential Sensitization toward Color/Lifetime&#8208;Tuned Lanthanide Coordination Polymers for Optical Multiplexing</title>
      <dc:description>Optical multiplexing based on luminescent materials with tunable color/lifetime holds potential applications in information storage and security. However, the available tunable luminescent materials reported so far still suffer from several drawbacks of low efficiency or poor stability, thus restraining their further applications. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to develop the efficient and stable lanthanide coordination polymers (LCPs) with tunable luminescence as a new option for optical multiplexing. Their multicolor emission from green to red and naked&#8208;eye&#8208;sensitive green emission with tunable lifetime (from ~ 300 to ~ 600 &#956;s) can be controlled by host differential sensitization and energy transfer between lanthanide ions. The quantum efficiencies of developed samples range from ~ 20% to ~ 46% and the luminescence intensity/lifetime appear quite stable in polar solvents up to ten weeks. Furthermore, with the aids of inkjet printing and concepts of luminescence lifetime imaging and time&#8208;gated imaging, we also illustrate their inspiring and promising applications of information storage and security in spatial and temporal domains. These results will open up an avenue to the efficient and stable LCPs with tunable luminescence toward optical multiplexing applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production Trilogy</title>
      <dc:description>H  2  production via water electrolysis is of great significance in clean energy pruduction, which, however, suffers from the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the anode product, O  2  , which is of rather low value, may lead to the dangerous explosion hazard and the generation of membrane&#8208;degradable reactive oxygen species. Herein, to address aforementioned issues of electrocatalytic H  2  production, the most recent advances are summarized in three stages based on the benefit increments and varied electron donation routes, which are: (1) electron donations by traditional OER: developing efficient catalysts for water oxidation to promote H  2  production; (2) electron donations by sacrificing agent oxidation: using sacrificial agents to assist H  2  production; (3) electron donations by electro&#8208;synthesis reaction: achieving electro&#8208;synthesis&#160;in parallel with cathodic H  2  production. We will mainly focus on various anodic reactions and corresponding electro&#8208;catalysts in different operating media, as well as the system establishments in this review. The present challenges and related prospects will also be discussed, hopefully to benefit the further progresses of electrocatalytic H  2  production in the future.</dc:description>

      <title>Frustrated Lewis Pairs Comprising Nitrogen Lewis Acids for Si&#8208;H Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic nitrogen Lewis acids are a recent addition to the field of organic chemistry.

In this article, a triazinium&#8208;based Lewis acid was combined with  t  Bu  3  P to generate a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) capable of cleaving, for the first time, Si&#8208;H bonds in silanes.

      <title>Bonding Energetics of Palladium&#8208;amido/aryloxide Complexes in DMSO: Implications for Pd&#8208;mediated Aniline Activation</title>
      <dc:description>Thermodynamic knowledge of the metal&#8210;ligand (M&#8210;L) &#963;&#8208;bond strength is crucial to understanding metal&#8208;mediated transformations, but it is rarely presented in literature. Here, we developed a general methodology for determining the Pd&#8210;X (X = OR and NHAr) bond heterolysis energies (&#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X)) in DMSO taking [(tmeda)PdArX] (tmeda = N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) as the model complexes. The first &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) scales here derived span a range of 2.6&#8210;9.0 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;O)s and of 14.5&#8210;19.5 kcal/mol for &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;N)s, respectively, implying a facile heterolytic detachment of the Pd&#8210;ligands. Structure&#8208;reactivity analyses of a modeling Pd&#8208;mediated X&#8210;H bond activation reveal that the M&#8210;X bond metathesis is basically dominated by the differences of the X&#8210;H and Pd&#8210;X bond strengths, with the former being more influential. Combinatorial application of the &#916;Ghet(Pd&#8210;X) and pKa(X&#8210;H) parameters enables rational regulations of the reaction thermodynamics and chemo&#8208;selectivity, and hence provides a feasible energetic criterion for diagnosing the probability of aniline activation with Pd&#8210;X complexes.</dc:description>

      <title>Interfacing living and synthetic cells as an emerging frontier in synthetic biology</title>
      <dc:description>The construction of artificial cells from inanimate molecular building blocks is one of the grand challenges of our time. In addition to being used as simplified cell models to decipher the rules of life, artificial cells have the potential to be designed as micromachines deployed in a host of clinical and industrial applications. The attractions of engineering artificial cells from scratch, as opposed to re&#8208;engineering living biological cells, are varied. However, it is clear that artificial cells cannot currently match the power and behavioural sophistication of their biological counterparts. Given this, many in the synthetic biology community have started to ask: is it possible to interface biological and artificial cells together to create hybrid living/synthetic systems that leverage the advantages of both? This article will discuss the motivation behind this cellular bionics approach, in which the boundaries between living and non&#8208;living matter are blurred by bridging top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. It details the state of play of this nascent field and introduces three generalised hybridisation modes that have emerged.</dc:description>

      <title>Fe&#8208;Co Alloyed Nanoparticles Catalysed Efficient Hydrogenation of Cinnamaldehyde to Cinnamyl Alcohol in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Selective hydrogenation of C=O against the conjugated C=C in cinnamaldehyde (CAL) is indispensable to produce cinnamyl alcohol (COL), nonetheless, challenged by the low selectivity and the need to use organic solvents. Herein, for the first time, we report the use of Fe&#8208;Co alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on N&#8208;doped carbon support as a selective hydrogenation catalyst to efficiently convert CAL to COL. The resultant catalyst with the optimized Fe/Co ratio of 0.5 can achieve an exceptional COL selectivity of 91.7% at a CAL conversion of 95.1% in pure water medium under mild reaction conditions, ranking it the best performed catalyst reported to date. The experimental results confirm that the COL selectivity and CAL conversion efficiency are respectively promoted by the presence of Co and Fe, while the synergism of the alloyed Fe&#8208;Co is the key to concurrently achieve high COL selectivity and CAL conversion efficiency  .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>With the increasing popularity and burgeoning progress of space technology, the development of ultralow temperature flexible functional materials is a great challenge for human beings. Herein, we reported a highly emissive organic crystal combining with ultralow temperature elasticity and self&#8208;waveguide (when a crystal is excited, it emits light from itself and travels through the crystal to the other end) based on a simple single&#8208;benzene emitter. This crystal displayed excellent elastic bending ability in liquid nitrogen (LN). The preliminary experiments on attempting optical waveguide of the bent crystal demonstrated that the light generated by the crystal itself could be confined and propagated within the crystal body between 170&#186;C and &#8211;196&#186;C.

      <title>Broadband Dynamics of Ubiquitin by Anionic and Cationic Nanoparticle&#8208;Assisted NMR Spin Relaxation</title>
      <dc:description>The quantitative and comprehensive description of the internal dynamics of proteins is critical for understanding their function. Nanoparticle&#8208;assisted  15  N NMR spin relaxation is a new method that uses a simple read&#8208;out allowing the observation of ps &#8208; &#956;s dynamics of proteins when transiently interacting with the surface of nanoparticles. The method is applied here to the widely studied protein human ubiquitin in the presence of anionic and cationic silica nanoparticles (SNP) of different size. The resulting backbone dynamics profiles are highly reproducible and strikingly similar to each other, indicating that, with the exception of the disordered tail, specific protein&#8208;SNP interactions are unimportant. The dynamics profiles closely match the sub&#8208;ns dynamics S  2  values observed by model&#8208;free analysis of standard  15  N relaxation of ubiquitin in free solution. These results indicate that the bulk of ubiquitin backbone dynamics in solution is confined to sub&#8208;ns timescales and, hence, it is dynamically considerably more restrained than some previous NMR studies have suggested.</dc:description>

      <title>Biomimetic approach for highly selective artificial water channels based on tubular Pillar[5]Arene dimers</title>
      <dc:description>Nature provides answers for efficient transport of water by using Aquaporins AQPs as the translocation relays. Artificial Water Channels biomimicking natural AQPs, can be used for both selective and fast transport of water. Here, we use complementary synthetic methods, X&#8208;ray structural data, transport assays to quantify the transport performances of peralkyl&#8208;carboxylate&#8208;pillar[5]arenes dimers in bilayer membranes. They are able to transport ~107 water molecules/channel/second, within one order of magnitude of AQPs&#8217; rates, rejecting Na+ and K+ cations. The dimers have an tubular structure, superposing larger pillar[5]arene pores of 5 &#197; diameter with narrowest twisted carboxy&#8208;phenyl pores of 2.8 &#197; diameter. This exceptional channel biomimetic platform, with variable pore dimensions within the same structure, offers size restriction reminiscent to natural proteins. It allows water molecules to selectively transit and prevent bigger hydrated cations to pass through the 2.8 &#197; pore. Molecular simulations probe that dimeric or multimeric honeycomb aggregates are stable in the membrane and form water pathways through the bilayer.

      <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Relay Enabling Modular Synthesis of Fused Pyridines from Alkyne&#8208;Tethered Oximes and Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>We have rationally designed a new class of alkyne&#8208;tethered oximes, and applied them into an unprecedented iron&#8208;catalyzed radical relay protocol for the rapid assembly of a wide array of structurally new and interesting fused pyridines. This method showcases broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance, and can be applied for a few biologically active molecules. In addition, the fused pyridines can be diversely functionalized through various simple transformations, such as cyclization, C&#8208;H alkylation, and click reaction. DFT calculation studies indicate that the reactions involve cascade 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig radical addition, and cyclization processes. Moreover, preliminary biological investigations suggest that some of the fused pyridines exhibit good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity by restoring the imbalance of inflammatory homeostasis of macrophages in a lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced model.</dc:description>

DFT calculation studies indicate that the reactions involve cascade 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer, 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig radical addition, and cyclization processes. Moreover, preliminary biological investigations suggest that some of the fused pyridines exhibit good anti&#8208;inflammatory activity by restoring the imbalance of inflammatory homeostasis of macrophages in a lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Intrinsic Apyrase&#8208;Like Activity of Cerium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Dephosphorylation of Adenosine Tri&#8208; and Diphosphate</title>
      <dc:description>Apyrase represents an important family of extracellular enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds (HEPBs) in ATP and ADP, thereby modulating many physiological processes and driving life activities. Here, we report an unexpected discovery that cerium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ce&#8208;MOFs) of UiO&#8208;66(Ce) possess intrinsic apyrase&#8208;like activity for the intervention of ATP/ADP&#8208;related physiological processes. The abundant Ce(III)/Ce(IV) couple sites of Ce&#8208;MOFs endow them with the ability to selectively catalyse the hydrolysis of HEPBs of ATP and ADP under physiological condition. Compared to natural enzymes, they could resist to extreme pH and temperature, and present a broad range of working conditions. Based on this finding, a significant inhibitory effect on ADP&#8208;induced platelet aggregation was observed upon exposing the platelet&#8208;rich plasma (PRP) to the biomimetic UiO&#8208;66(Ce) films, prefiguring their wide application potentials in medicine and biotechnology.</dc:description>

Depending of co&#8208;crystallizing species, the rings form various crystalline phases in which the torus units are connected in extended chain&#8208; and network structures. One phase in which the ring units are arranged in layers and form one&#8208;dimensional channels displays high permanent porosity (Surface area: 241 m  2  /g), and thus demonstrate a functional property for potential use in e.g. adsorption or heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Reaction Mechanisms of Layered Lithium&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Layered lithium&#8208;rich materials are promising cathode materials for the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Understanding the principles of the performance degradation mechanisms is a prerequisite for progress in this area. In this Minireview, recent research on the material structure and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials is discussed.







Abstract
Layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials have attracted extensive interest owing to their high theoretical specific capacity (320&#8211;350&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, poor cycling stability and sluggish reaction kinetics inhibit their practical applications. After many years of quiescence, interest in layered lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials is expected to revive in answer to our increasing dependence on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we review recent research progress and in&#8208;depth descriptions of the structure characterization and reaction mechanisms of layered lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based cathode materials. In particular, we comprehensively summarize the proposed reaction mechanisms of both the cationic redox reaction of transition&#8208;metal ions and the anionic redox reaction of oxygen species. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges facing the future development of lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Considerations for a More Accurate Evaluation Method for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
For the comparison of photocatalysts for water splitting, more comprehensive and accurate evaluation indicators are needed. Suggestions are made in this Viewpoint, aiming to stimulate discussion in the research community and hopefully lead to a widely accepted and authoritative evaluation system to assess photocatalyst performance.







Abstract
Over the past decades, various photocatalysts have been developed and great progress has been achieved in the field of solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic water splitting. However, the lack of an accurate and comprehensive evaluation method greatly hinders the meaningful comparison between different systems and becomes a serious impediment for the development of photocatalysts. Although many researchers are aware of this, there has been little work in this area. In this Viewpoint, we first analyze the insufficiencies of the existing evaluation methods and then make preliminary suggestions, aiming to stimulate discussion in the research community and hopefully lead to a widely accepted and authoritative evaluation system to assess photocatalyst performance.

      <title>A Green and Wide&#8208;Scope Approach for Chiroptical Sensing of Cryptochiral Molecules through Biomimetic Recognition in Water</title>
      <dc:description>Optical chirality sensing has attracted a lot of interest due to its potential in high&#8208;throughput screening in chirality analysis. It requires a molecular sensor to convert the chirality of analytes into optical signals. Although many molecular sensors have been reported, the ones with a wide substrate scope remain to be developed. Herein, we report that the amide naphthotube&#8208;based chirality sensors have an unprecedented wide scope for chiroptical sensing of cryptochiral molecules. The substrates include but are not limited to common organic products in asymmetric catalysis, chiral molecules with inert groups or remote functional groups from their chiral centers, natural products and their derivatives, and chiral drugs. The effective chirality sensing is based on biomimetic recognition in water and on effective chirality transfer through guest&#8208;induced formation of a chiral conformation of the sensors. Furthermore, the sensors can be used in real&#8208;time monitoring on reaction kinetics in water and in determining absolute configuration and ee values of the products in asymmetric catalysis. The sensor assays are environmentally&#8208;friendly because the solvent is water and the sensors can be easily recovered in a high yield.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>It is an enormous challenge to achieve the highly efficient organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with long lifetime. Here we demonstrated that by bridging the carbazole and halogenated phenyl ring with methylene linker, a type of RTP phosphors CzBX (X = Cl, Br) shows high phosphorescence efficiency (  &#1060;  Ph  ), up to 38% for CzBBr with a lifetime of 220 ms, which is much higher than that of compounds CzPX (X = Cl, Br) with C&#8208;N bond as a linker (  &#1060;  Ph  &lt; 1%). Single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that, in the crystal phase, the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;Br interaction accelerates the intersystem crossing process, while tetrahedron&#8208;like structure induced by  sp  3  methylene linker restrains the nonradiative decay channel, leading to the high phosphorescence efficiency in CzBBr.

Although artificial breathing materials exhibiting volume expansion and contraction upon alternate exposure to different gases have been well explored, those being able to realize the gas exchange remain elusive.

      <title>Conjugated Nanohoops Incorporating Donor&#8208;, Acceptor&#8208;, Hetero&#8208; or Polycyclic Aromatics</title>
      <dc:description>In the last 12 years several synthetic strategies have been developed that provide access to [  n  ]cycloparaphenylenes ([  n  ]CPPs) and related conjugated nanohoops. A number of potential applications have emerged, including optoelectronic devices and their use as templates for carbon nanomaterials and in supramolecular chemistry. To tune the structural or optoelectronic properties of carbon nanohoops beyond the size&#8208;dependent effect known for [  n  ]CPPs , a variety of aromatic rings other than benzene have been introduced. In this review, we provide an overview over the syntheses, properties and applications of conjugated nanohoops beyond [  n  ]CPPs with intrinsic donor/acceptor structure or such that contain acceptor&#8208;, donor&#8208;, heteroaromatic or polycyclic aromatic units within the hoop as well as conjugated nanobelts.</dc:description>

To tune the structural or optoelectronic properties of carbon nanohoops beyond the size&#8208;dependent effect known for [  n  ]CPPs , a variety of aromatic rings other than benzene have been introduced. In this review, we provide an overview over the syntheses, properties and applications of conjugated nanohoops beyond [  n  ]CPPs with intrinsic donor/acceptor structure or such that contain acceptor&#8208;, donor&#8208;, heteroaromatic or polycyclic aromatic units within the hoop as well as conjugated nanobelts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Isotope Effects in Plasmonic Photosynthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The photoexcitation of plasmonic nanoparticles has been shown to drive multi&#8208;step, multi&#8208;carrier transformations like the conversion of CO2  to hydrocarbons. But for such plasmon&#8208;driven chemistry to be precisely understood and modeled, the critical photo&#8208;initiation step in the reaction cascade must be identified. We meet this goal by measuring H/D and  12C/13C kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) in plasmonic photosynthesis. In particular, we find that the substitution of H2O with D2O slows hydrocarbon production by a factor of 5&#8211;8. This primary H/D KIE leads to the inference that hole&#8208;driven scission of the O&#8211;H bond in H2O is a critical, limiting step in plasmonic photosynthesis. This study advances mechanistic understanding of light&#8208;driven chemical reactions on plasmonic nanoparticles.</dc:description>

      <title>Tailoring Crystal Facets of Metal&#8211;Organic Layers to Enhance Photocatalytic Activity for CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>It is common that different crystal facets in metal and metal oxide nanocrystals display different catalytic performances, whereas such phenomena have been rarely documented in   metal&#8211;organic frameworks  (MOFs). Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that a nickel metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL)  exposing rich  (100) crystal facets  (  Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;100  ) shows a much higher photocatalytic CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO activity than the one exposing rich (  010  ) crystal facets (  Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010  ) and its  bulky counterpart (bulky Ni&#8208;MOF  ),  with a catalytic activity up to 2.5 and 4.6 times  more active than Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010 and bulky Ni&#8208;MOF, respectively. Theoretical studies reveal that the two coordination&#8208;unsaturated Ni(II) ions  with a close distance of 3.50  &#197; on the surface of Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;100  enables synergistic catalysis  , leading to more favorable energetics in CO  2  reduction than that of Ni&#8208;MOL&#8208;010.</dc:description>

      <title>A Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded yet Hydrophobic Porous Molecular Crystal for Molecular&#8208;Sieving&#8208;like Separation of Butane and Isobutane</title>
      <dc:description>Porous molecular crystals sustained by hydrogen bonds and/or weaker connections are an intriguing type of adsorbents, but they hardly demonstrate efficient adsorptive separation becuase of poor structural robustness and tailorability. Here, we report a porous molecular crystal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic dinuclear Ag(I) complex, which exhibits exceptional hydrophobicity with a water contact angle of 134  o  , high chemical stability in water at pH 2&#8210;13. The seemingly rigid adsorbent shows pore&#8208;opening or nonporous&#8208;to&#8208;porous type butane adsorption isotherm and complete exclusion of isobutane, indicating potential molecular sieving. Quantitative column breakthrough experiments show slight co&#8208;adsorption of isobutane with an experimental butane/isobutane selectivity of 23, and isobutane can be purified more efficiently than for butane.  In&#8208;situ  powder/single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational simulations reveal that a trivial guest&#8208;induced structural transformation play&#160;critical roles.</dc:description>

The resulted superstructure exhibits a porous 3&#8208;D interconnected network with well&#8208;arranging 2&#8208;D carbon nanosheets on it, in which ultrafine cobalt phosphide nanoparticles are tightly immobilized. A single piece of this superstructure can be directly used as self&#8208;supported electrodes for electrocatalysis without any binders. Taking advantages of this &#8220;one&#8208;piece&#8221; porous superstructure with excellent transport properties of mass and electrons, and catalytically active cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with ultrasmall size (3&#8208;4 nm), it exhibits excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities for OER, HER, and ORR, achieving great performances in water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Promotion of Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Chalcogenate on the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pre&#8208;electrocatalysts, and will in situ transform into metal oxyhydroxides under OER condition. However, the role of chalcogen is not fully elucidated after oxidation and severe leaching. Here we present the vital promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on the OER activity. Taking NiSe  2  as an example, in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the oxidation of Se&#8208;Se to selenites (SeO  3  2&#8208;  ) then to selenates (SeO  4  2&#8208;  ). Combining the severe Se leaching and the strong signal of selenates, it is assumed that the selenates are rich on the surface and play significant roles. As expected, adding selenites to the electrolyte of Ni(OH)  2  dramatically enhance the OER activity. And sulfates also exhibit the similar effect, suggesting the promotion of surface&#8208;adsorbed chalcogenates on OER is universal. Our findings offer unique insight into the transformation mechanism of materials during electrolysis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Single&#160;atom catalysts (SACs) with the maximized metal atom efficiency have sparked great attention. However, it is challenging to obtain SACs with high metal loading, high catalytic activity,&#160;and good stability.&#160;Herein,&#160;we demonstrate a new strategy to develop a highly active and stable Ag single atom in&#160;carbon nitride (Ag&#8208;N2C2/CN) catalyst&#160;with a&#160;unique coordination. The Ag atomic dispersion and Ag&#8208;N2C2 configuration&#160;have been identified by aberration&#8208;correction high&#8208;angle&#8208;annular&#8208;dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy&#160;(AC&#8208;HAADF&#8208;STEM)&#160;and extended X&#8208;ray absorption. Experiments&#160;and DFT&#160;calculations further verify that Ag&#8208;N2C2 can reduce the H2 evolution barrier, expand the light absorption&#160;range, and improve the charge transfer of CN. As a result, the Ag&#8208;N2C2/CN catalyst exhibits&#160;much better H2 evolution&#160;activity than&#160;the N&#8208;coordinated Ag single atom in&#160;CN&#160;(Ag&#8208;N4/CN),&#160;and is even superior to the Pt nanoparticle&#8208;loaded&#160;CN (PtNP/CN). This work provides a new idea&#160;for the design and synthesis of SACs with novel configurations and excellent catalytic activity and durability.</dc:description>

      <title>Incorporating Transition Metal Phosphides into Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been proven to be an excellent platform in photocatalysis. However, to suppress the  electron&#8208;hole  recombination, the Pt cocatalyst is usually inevitable, especially in photocatalytic H  2  production, which greatly limits the practical application. Herein, for the first time, the monodisperse, small&#8208;size and noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free transitional metal phosphides (TMPs, e.g., Ni  2  P, Ni  12  P  5  ), are incorporated into a representative MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , for photocatalytic H  2  production. Compared with the parent MOF and their physical mixture, both TMPs@MOF  composites  display significantly improved H  2  production rates. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies reveal that TMPs, behaving similar ability to Pt, greatly accelerate the linker&#8208;to&#8208;cluster charge transfer and promote charge separation, as well as reduce the activation energy of H  2  production. Significantly, results indicate that Pt is thermodynamically favorable yet Ni  2  P is kinetically preferred for H  2  production, accounting for the higher activity of Ni  2  P@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  than Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2  .</dc:description>

      <title>Multispecific Platinum(IV) Complex Deters Breast Cancer via Interposing Inflammation and Immunosuppression as an Inhibitor of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1</title>
      <dc:description>Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common malignancies in women and often accompanied by inflammatory processes. Cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) plays a vital role in the progression of BC, correlating with the expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Overexpression of PD&#8208;L1 contributes to the immune escape of cancer cells, and its blockade would stimulate anticancer immunity. Two multispecific platinum(IV) complexes DNP and NP were prepared using non&#8208;steroidal antiinflammatory drug naproxen (NPX) as axial ligand(s) to inhibit the BC cells. DNP exhibited high cytotoxicity and antiinflammatory properties superior over NP, cisplatin and NPX; moreover, it displayed potent antitumor activity and almost no general toxicity in mice bearing triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Mechanistic studies revealed that DNP could downregulate the expression of COX&#8208;2 and PD&#8208;L1  in vitro  and  vivo  , inhibit the secretion of prostaglandin, reduce the expression of BC&#8208;associated protein BRD4 and phosphorylation of extracellular signal&#8208;regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2), and block the oncogene c&#8208;Myc in BC cells. These findings demonstrate that DNP is capable of intervening in inflammatory, immune, and metastatic processes of BC, thus presenting a new mechanism of action for anticancer platinum(IV) complexes. The multispecificity offers a special superiority for DNP to treat TNBC by combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy in one molecule.</dc:description>

      <title>A Concise Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;Deoxoapodine</title>
      <dc:description>We established a highly convergent 10&#8208;step route for total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;deoxoapodine, which is a hexacyclic aspidosperma alkaloid. The quaternary carbon center at C5 on the characteristic tetrahydrofuran ring was constructed  via  a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective bromocycloetherification in a 5&#8208;  endo  fashion and subsequent allylation by using Keck&#8217;s protocol. The aspidosperma skeleton was constructed featuring the formation of 9&#8208;membered lactam by catalytic C&#8211;H palladation/alkylation cascade at the indole 2&#8208;position and the iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative transannular reaction at the late&#8208;stage of synthesis.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We established a highly convergent 10&#8208;step route for total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;deoxoapodine, which is a hexacyclic aspidosperma alkaloid. The quaternary carbon center at C5 on the characteristic tetrahydrofuran ring was constructed  via  a chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective bromocycloetherification in a 5&#8208;  endo  fashion and subsequent allylation by using Keck&#8217;s protocol. The aspidosperma skeleton was constructed featuring the formation of 9&#8208;membered lactam by catalytic C&#8211;H palladation/alkylation cascade at the indole 2&#8208;position and the iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidative transannular reaction at the late&#8208;stage of synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Highly Specific, Single&#8208;step Cancer Cell Isolation with Multi&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Mediated Proximity Ligation on Live Cell Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>A single&#8208;step method for isolation of specific cells based on multiple surface markers will have unique advantages because of its scalability, efficacy, and mildness. Herein, we developed multi&#8208;aptamer&#8208;mediated proximity ligation method on live cell membranes that leverages a multi&#8208;receptor co&#8208;recognition design for enhanced specificity, as well as a robust in&#8208;situ signal amplification design for improved sensitivity of cell isolation.

      <title>Discovering the elusive global minimum in a ternary chiral cluster: rotational spectra of propylene oxide trimer</title>

      <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroarylation and Hydroalkenylation of Alkenyl Carboxylic Acids</title>
      <dc:description>A nickel&#8208;catalyzed regiodivergent hydroarylation and hydroalkenylation of unactivated alkenyl carboxylic acids is reported, whereby the ligand environment around the metal center dictates the regiochemical outcome. Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization products are obtained under mild ligand&#8208;free conditions, with up to 99% yield and &gt;20:1 selectivity. Alternatively, anti&#8208;Markovnikov products can be accessed with a novel 4,4&#8208;disubstituted Pyrox ligand in excellent yield and &gt;20:1 selectivity. Both electronic and steric effects on the ligand contribute to the high yield and selectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest a change in the turnover&#8208;limiting and selectivity&#8208;determining step induced by the optimal ligand. DFT calculations reveal that in the anti&#8208;Markovnikov pathway, repulsion between the ligand and the alkyl group is minimized (by virtue of it being 1&#176; versus 2&#176;) in the rate&#8208; and regioselectivity&#8208;determining transmetalation transition state.</dc:description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities in the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Interlocked Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>Several strategies have been successfully utilized so far in order to obtain a wide range of interlocked molecules. However, some interlocked compounds are still not obtained directly and/or efficiently from non&#8208;interlocked components because the requisites for self&#8208;assembly cannot be always enforced. To circumvent such a synthetic problem, the strategy that consists in synthesizing an isolable and storable interlocked building block in a step that precedes its modifications is an appealing chemical route to more sophisticated interlocked molecules. Synthetic opportunities and challenges are closely linked to the fact that the mechanical bond might tremendously affect the reactivity of a function of the encircled axle, while the interlocked architecture need to be preserved during the synthesis. Hence, the mechanical bond plays a fundamental role in the strategy employed. This review focuses on the challenging post&#8208;synthetic modifications of interlocked molecules, sometimes through the cleavage of the axle&#8217;s main chain, and always with the conservation of the mechanical bond.</dc:description>

      <title>Multiplexed detection of analytes on single test strips with antibody&#8208;gated indicator releasing mesoporous nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Rapid testing methods for the use directly at a point&#8208;of&#8208;need are expected to unfold their true potential especially when offering adequate capabilities for the simultaneous measurement of multiple analytes of interest. Considering the unique modularity, high sensitivity and selectivity of antibody&#8208;gated indicator delivery (gAID) systems, a multiplexed assay for three small&#8208;molecule explosives (TATP, TNT, PETN) was thus developed, allowing to detect the analytes simultaneously with a single test strip at lower ppb concentrations in liquid phase in &lt;5 min, using a fluorescence reader or a smartphone for readout. While the TNT and PETN systems were newly developed here, all the three systems also tolerated harsher matrices than buffered aqueous model solutions. Besides a single&#8208;track strip, the outstanding modularity of the hybrid biosensor materials, in combination with strip patterning technologies, allowed us to obtain a multichannel strip in a straightforward manner, offering comparable analytical performance while allowing to be tailored even more to the user&#8217;s need.</dc:description>

Considering the unique modularity, high sensitivity and selectivity of antibody&#8208;gated indicator delivery (gAID) systems, a multiplexed assay for three small&#8208;molecule explosives (TATP, TNT, PETN) was thus developed, allowing to detect the analytes simultaneously with a single test strip at lower ppb concentrations in liquid phase in &amp;lt;5 min, using a fluorescence reader or a smartphone for readout. While the TNT and PETN systems were newly developed here, all the three systems also tolerated harsher matrices than buffered aqueous model solutions. Besides a single&#8208;track strip, the outstanding modularity of the hybrid biosensor materials, in combination with strip patterning technologies, allowed us to obtain a multichannel strip in a straightforward manner, offering comparable analytical performance while allowing to be tailored even more to the user&#8217;s need.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Membrane Chemistry Tunes the Structure of a Peptide Transporter</title>
      <dc:description>
Membrane transporters need to cycle through different conformations in order to perform function. Using state of the art smFRET tools, H. Hofmann, C. L&#246;w et&#8197;al. reveal in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202008226) that the dynamics and conformational variety of a peptide transporter is sensitively regulated by the lipid environment. Analyses in different lipid compositions highlight the influence of the lipid head&#8208;group while artificial detergents trap the transporter in a single conformation.

      <title>Co&#8208;assembly between Fmoc Diphenylalanine and Diphenylalanine within a 3D Fibrous Viscous Network Confers Atypical Curvature and Branching</title>
      <dc:description>Supramolecular polymer co&#8208;assembly is a useful approach to modulate peptide nanostructures. However, the co&#8208;assembly scenario where one of the peptide building blocks simultaneously forms a hydrogel is yet to be studied. Herein, we investigated the co&#8208;assembly formation of a minimalistic dipeptide, diphenylalanine (FF), and Fmoc&#8208;diphenylalanine (FmocFF) within the 3D fibrous matrix of FmocFF hydrogel. The overlapping peptide sequence between the two building blocks leads to their co&#8208;assembly within the gel state modulating the nature of the FF crystals. Consequently, we observe the formation of branched microcrystalline aggregates with an atypical curvature, in contrast to the FF assemblies obtained from aqueous solution. Using optical microscopy, we demonstrate the sigmoidal kinetic growth profile of these aggregates. Microfluidics and ToF&#8208;SIMS experiments reveal the presence of co&#8208;assembled structures of FF and FmocFF in the crystalline aggregates. Molecular dynamics simulation was further used to decipher the mechanism of co&#8208;assembly formation. This study introduces a simple methodology to investigate the kinetics of amyloidogenic structure formation in the hydrogel state and their  in vitro  modulation using the supramolecular co&#8208;assembly paradigm.</dc:description>

      <title>Cell Death Mediated by Pyroptosis Pathway with the Help of Nanotechnology: New Prospects for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Pyroptosis, a unique form of programmed cell death (PCD) characterized by DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, cellular swelling with big bubbles and cell content leakage, has been proven to have close relationships with human diseases, such as inflammatory diseases and malignant tumors. Since a new gasdermin&#8208;D (GSDMD) protein was identified in 2015, various strategies have been developed to induce pyroptosis for cancer therapy, including ions, small molecular drugs and nanomaterials. Although there are a number of reviews about the pyroptosis mechanism, the summary covering the recent progresses of nanomedicines utilized in pyroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy has not been presented. Therefore, it is urgent to fill this gap and light up future directions for using such a powerful tool to fight against cancer. In this Minireview, the recent progresses of cancer treatment based on pyroptosis induced by nanoparticles will be described in detail, the design highlights and the therapeutic advantages are emphasized, and finally future perspectives on this emerging area are proposed.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Conducting Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Copper Sulfides CuxC6S6(X = 4 or 5.5): Ligand&#8208;based Oxidation Induced Chemical and Electronic Structure Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>Over the past few years, conductive coordination polymers (CPs) have received emerging attention as subjects in fundamental research or as prospective candidates for a wide range of applications because of their inherent structural and functional diversity and modularity. Several successful approaches have been used to construct CPs with high conductivity. However, obtaining CPs with high conductivity is considered a stepping stone in regards to the full design of a material, the next and more crucial step is to have the capability of controlling the electronic structure to fine&#8208;tune the properties of the materials for new, unique applications. Herein, taking advantage of the non&#8208;innocent nature of benzenehexathiol (BHT) ligand and the rich coordination capability of cooper(I) ions, two novel electrically conductive CPs (Cu  x  C  6  S  6  , x = 4 or 5.5) derived from the same organic linker and metal node (copper(I)) have been synthesized and studied. These two Cu  x  C  6  S  6  s materials display not only high electrical conductivity but also feature tunable structural topology and electronic structure. The high conductivity of this material originates from the presence of necessary charge transport pathways that facilitate conductivity within the material but more interestingly, offers control of the Fermi level through modulation of the oxidation level of the non&#8208;innocent redox&#8208;active ligand. As a result, both Cu  4  C  6  S  6  and Cu  5.5  C  6  S  6  act as degenerate semiconductors with desirable band structures that make Cu  5.5  C  6  S  6  a potential candidate as a p&#8208;type thermoelectric material with a ZT value of 0.12 at 390 K, a record&#8208;breaking performance for p&#8208;type CPs. These results demonstrate the flexibility of BHT for the construction of highly conductive CPs originated from the identical starting components with tunable stoichiometric composition and electrical performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Biopolymer&#8208;based Carriers for DNA Vaccine Design</title>
      <dc:description>Over the last 30 years, genetically engineered DNA has been tested as novel vaccination strategy against various diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, several parasites and cancers. However, the clinical breakthrough of the technique is confined by the low transfection efficacy and immunogenicity of the employed vaccines. Therefore, carrier materials were designed to prevent the rapid degradation and systemic clearance of DNA in the body. In this context, biopolymers are a particularly promising DNA vaccine carrier platform, due to their beneficial biochemical and physical characteristics, including biocompatibility, stability and low toxicity. This article reviews the applications, fabrication and modification of biopolymers as carrier medium for genetic vaccines.</dc:description>
