         <title>A Topologically Engineered  Gold Island for Programmed In Vivo Stem Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>E  ven a well&#8208;designed system can only control stem cell adhesion, release, and differentiation, while other cell manipulations such as in situ labeling and retention in target tissues, are difficult to achieve in the same system. Herein, native ligand cluster&#8208;mimicking islands, composed of topologically engineered ligand, anchoring point AuNP, nuclease mimetics Ce  IV  complexes and magnetic core Fe  3  O  4  , are designed to facilitate comprehensive cell manipulations in a programmable manner. Three islands with different amounts of AuNPs are constructed, which means tunable interligand spacing within a cluster. These nanostructures are chemically coupled to a substrate using DNA tethers. Under tissue&#8208;penetrative magnetic field, this integrated system promotes stem cell adhesion, proliferation, mechanosensing, differentiation, detachment, in situ effective magnetic labeling and retention both  in vitro  and  in vivo  , offering fascinating opportunities for biomimetic matrix in regenerative medicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown and robust MOF membranes for polyol upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework membranes are frequently used in gas separations, but rare in pervaporation for liquid chemical upgrading, especially for separating water from polyols, due to lack of highly compact and robust micro&#8208;architecture. Here, we report hetero&#8208;lattice intergrown membranes in which&#160;amino&#8208;MIL&#8208;101 (Cr) particles embedded into the micro&#8208;gaps of MIL&#8208;53 (Al) rod arrays after secondary growth. By means of high&#8208;resolution TEM and two&#8208;dimensional topologic simulation, the connection between these two distinct MOF lattices at molecular&#8208;level and their crystallographic geometry harmony is identified, which leads to a close&#8208;knit structure at crystal boundaries of membranes. Typically, the membrane shows a separation factor as high as 13,000 for 90/10 ethanediol/water solution in pervaporation, yields polymer&#8208;grade ethanediol, and saves ca. 32% of energy consumption vs. vacuum distillation. It has a highly robust micro&#8208;architecture, with great tolerance to high pressure, durability against ultrasonic therapy and long&#8208;term separation stability over 600 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomative Cyclopropanation of Naphthols via Cyclopropene Ring&#8208;Opening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization of 2&#8208;naphthols represents a simple method for the construction of complex 3D structures from simple planar starting materials. We describe a cyclopropanation of 2&#8208;naphthols that proceeds via cyclopropene ring&#8208;opening using rhodium and acid catalysis under mild conditions. The vinyl cyclopropane molecules were formed with high chemoselectivity and scalability, which could be further functionalized at different sites. Both computational and experimental evidence were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Transform electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from electricity input to electricity output</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating biomass upgrading and hydrogen production in an electrocatalytic system is attractive both environmentally and sustainably. Conventional electrolyzer systems coupling anodic bio&#8208;substrate electrooxidation with hydrogen evolution reaction usually require electricity input. In this work, we develop a fuel cell electrocatalytic system achieve the biomass upgrading and hydrogen production as well as electricity generation. Different with conventional furfural electrooxidation, the employed low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation enables the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group to be released as gaseous hydrogen at the anode under a low potential of ~0 VRHE (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The integrated fuel cell system could generate electricity of ~2 kWh for per cubic meter of hydrogen produced. This work may provide a transformative technology that turns the electrocatalytic biomass upgrading and hydrogen production from electricity input to electricity output.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Zinc Electrodeposition Enabled by a Self&#8208;Healable and Desolvation Shield for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial interfaces can alleviate the side reactions and the formation of the metallic (e.g.  , Li, Na, and Zn) dendrites. However, the traditional ones always break down during the repeated plating/stripping and fail to regulate the electrodeposition behaviors of the electrodes. Herein, a self&#8208;healable ion regulator (SIR) is designed as a desolvation shield to protect the Zn electrodes and guide the Zn electrodeposition. Benefiting from the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, SIR shows a superb capability to  in&#8208;situ  repair the plating/stripping&#8208;induced creaks. Besides, the results of theoretical calculations and electrochemical characterizations show that the coating reduces water molecules in the solvated sheath of hydrated Zn2+  and restrains the random Zn2+  diffusion on the Zn surface. Even with a coating layer of only 360 nm, the SIR&#8208;modified Zn electrode exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability for &gt; 3500 h at 2 mAh cm&#8722;2  and &gt; 950 h at an ultrahigh areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning exciton coupling of merocyanine nucleoside dimers by RNA, DNA and GNA double helix conformations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exciton coupling between two or more chromophores in a specific environment is a key mechanism associated with color tuning and modulation of absorption energies. This concept is well exemplified by natural photosynthetic proteins, and can also be achieved in synthetic nucleic acid nanostructures. Here we report the coupling of barbituric acid merocyanine (BAM) nucleoside analogues and show that exciton coupling can be tuned by the double helix conformation. BAM is a nucleobase mimic that was incorporated in the phosphodiester backbone of RNA, DNA and GNA oligo&#173;nucleo&#173;tides. Duplexes with different backbone constitutions and geometries afforded different mutual dye arrangements, leading to distinct optical signatures due to competing modes of chromo&#173;phore organization via electro&#173;static, dipolar, &#960;&#8722;&#960;&#8208;stack&#173;ing and hydrogen bonding inter&#173;actions. The realized supra&#173;molecular motifs include hydrogen&#8208;bonded BAM&#8208;adenine base pairs and antiparallel as well as rotationally stacked BAM dimer aggregates with distinct absorption, CD and fluorescence properties.</dc:description>

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Switchable Zwitterionic Peptide for Rapid Detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transmission of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 coronavirus has led to the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Nucleic acid testing while specific has limitations for mass surveillance. One alternative is the main protease (Mpro) due to its functional importance in mediating the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a combination of modular substrate and gold colloids to detect Mpro via visual readout. The strategy involves zwitterionic peptide that carries opposite charges at the C&#8208;/N&#8208;terminus to exploit the specific recognition by Mpro. Autolytic cleavage releases positively&#8208;charged moiety that assembles the nanoparticles with rapid color changes (t &lt;10 min). We determine a limit of detection for Mpro in breath condensate matrices &lt;10 nM. We further assayed ten COVID&#8208;negative subjects and found no false&#8208;positive result. In the light of simplicity, our test for viral protease is not limited to an equipped laboratory, but also is amenable to integrating as portable point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices including those on face&#8208;coverings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemical Biology Toolbox Targeting the Intracellular Binding Site of CCR9: Fluorescent Ligands, New Drug Leads and PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A conserved intracellular allosteric binding site (IABS) has recently been identified at several G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs). Starting from vercirnon, an intracellular C&#8208;C chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) antagonist and previous phase III clinical candidate for the treatment of Crohn&#8217;s disease, we developed a chemical biology toolbox targeting the IABS of CCR9. We first synthesized a fluorescent ligand enabling equilibrium and kinetic binding studies via NanoBRET as well as fluorescence microscopy. Applying this molecular tool in a membrane&#8208;based setup and in living cells, we discovered a 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine analogue as a new intracellular CCR9 antagonist with improved affinity. To chemically induce CCR9 degradation, we then developed the first PROTAC targeting the IABS of GPCRs. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle study, we succeeded in showing that our CCR9&#8208;PROTAC is able to reduce CCR9 levels, thereby offering an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel Mediated Enantioselective Photoredox Allylation of Aldehydes with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a practical, highly enantioselective photoredox allylation of aldehydes mediated by chiral nickel complexes with commercially available allyl acetate as the allylating agent. The methodology allows the clean stereoselective allylation of aldehydes in good to excellent yields and up to 93% e.e. using a catalytic amount of NiCl  2  (glyme) in the presence of the chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived bis(oxazoline) as the chiral ligand. The photoredox system is constituted by the organic dye 3DPAFIPN and a Hantzsch&#8217;s ester as the sacrificial reductant. The reaction proceeds under visible light irradiation (blue LEDs, 456 nm) at 8&#8211;12 &#176;C with excellent stereoselectivities. Compared to other published procedures, no metal reductants (such as Zn or Mn), additives (e.g. CuI) or air&#8208;sensitive Ni(COD)  2  are necessary for this reaction. Accurate DFT calculations and photophysical experiments have clarified the mechanistic picture of this stereoselective allylation reaction showing a key role played by Hantzsch&#8217;s ester for the turnover of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Atom&#8208;Substitution Engineered Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Nanofibers with High&#8208;Valence Fe for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key for scalable water electrolysis, for instance, the NiFe&#8208;based materials. Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from low controllability on electronic structures of NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  , along with long&#8208;term stability (&gt; 20 h) at 100 mA cm  &#8722;2  . The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based OER catalysts.</dc:description>

Recognizing monogenic RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) in vivo is challenging. We developed a module&#8208;assembled multifunctional probes assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells.







Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), non&#8208;canonical nucleic acid secondary structure, regulate many biological functions and are considered potential molecular targets for cancer therapeutics. However, due to the lack of analytical methods, the regulating mechanism of monogenic G4s is still unclear. Here, we developed a Module Assembled Multifunctional Probes Assay (MAMPA) for visualizing endogenous G4s in individual genes in single cells. Two modular probes separately recognize G4 structures and the adjacent RNA sequences, and the module assembly enables imaging of G4s in an individual RNA with high specificity. Through imaging G4s in several individual genes, we found that G4s were steadily occupied by G4 Binding Proteins (G4BPs) in various mRNAs in every cell line and defined &#8220;Occupied G4 Ratio&#8221;. We demonstrated MAMPA was suitable for most experimental situations and found that Occupied G4 Ratios had the potential to become a new parameter for the study of G4s in living cells.

         <title>Fluorescence Imaging of Mitochondrial DNA Base Excision Repair Reveals Dynamics of Oxidative Stress Responses</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;up fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites visualizes base excision repair (BER) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in cells. Monitoring of the mtDNA BER process in cells over time illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of DNA repair, along with the effect of DNA defensive enzymes, MTH1 and OGG1.







Abstract
Mitochondrial function in cells declines with aging and with neurodegeneration, due in large part to accumulated mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that arise from deficient DNA repair. However, measuring this repair activity is challenging. We employ a molecular approach for visualizing mitochondrial base excision repair (BER) activity in&#8197;situ by use of a fluorescent probe (UBER) that reacts rapidly with AP sites resulting from BER activity. Administering the probe to cultured cells revealed signals that were localized to mitochondria, enabling selective observation of mtDNA BER intermediates. The probe showed elevated DNA repair activity under oxidative stress, and responded to suppression of glycosylase activity. Furthermore, the probe illuminated the time lag between the initiation of oxidative stress and the initial step of BER. Absence of MTH1 in cells resulted in elevated demand for BER activity upon extended oxidative stress, while the absence of OGG1 activity limited glycosylation capacity.

         <title>Imaging Membrane Order and Dynamic Interactions in Living Cells with a DNA Zipper Probe</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cholesterol&#8208;modified programmable DNA probes are developed to image transient interactions and membrane order in live cell membranes. The membrane order during the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signaling has also been measured.







Abstract
The cell membrane is a dynamic and heterogeneous structure composed of distinct sub&#8208;compartments. Within these compartments, preferential interactions occur among various lipids and proteins. Currently, it is still challenging to image these short&#8208;lived membrane complexes, especially in living cells. In this work, we present a DNA&#8208;based probe, termed &#8220;DNA Zipper&#8221;, which allows the membrane order and pattern of transient interactions to be imaged in living cells using standard fluorescence microscopes. By fine&#8208;tuning the length and binding affinity of DNA duplex, these probes can precisely extend the duration of membrane lipid interactions via dynamic DNA hybridization. The correlation between membrane order and the activation of T&#8208;cell receptor signaling has also been studied. These programmable DNA probes function after a brief cell incubation, which can be easily adapted to study lipid interactions and membrane order during different membrane signaling events.

         <title>Bimetallic Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for the Chemiresistive Detection of Carbon Monoxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isorecticular and heterobimetallic two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks achieves chemiresistive sensing of ppm concentrations of carbon monoxide at low power. Spectroscopic techniques and computational methods, along with comparative experiments, suggest the contribution of Cu nodes to CO binding and the essential role of metallophthalocyanine units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.







Abstract
This paper describes the demonstration of a series of heterobimetallic, isoreticular 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metallophthalocyanine (MPc, M=Co and Ni) units interconnected by Cu nodes towards low&#8208;power chemiresistive sensing of ppm levels of carbon monoxide (CO). Devices achieve a sub&#8208;part&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) limit of detection (LOD) of 0.53&#8197;ppm toward CO at a low driving voltage of 0.1&#8197;V. MPc&#8208;based Cu&#8208;linked MOFs can continuously detect CO at 50&#8197;ppm, the permissible exposure limit required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), for multiple exposures, and realize CO detection in air and in humid environment. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and comparison experiments suggest the contribution of Cu nodes to CO binding and the essential role of MPc units in tuning and amplifying the sensing response.

         <title>Directed Evolution of Artificial Metalloenzymes in Whole Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Whole&#8208;cell E. coli platform enables directed evolution campaigns with ArMs containing an abiotic Ir&#8208;porphyrin cofactor involving the generation of more than 4000 mutants to develop an enantioselective insertion of a simple acyclic carbene from a diazo ester into the N&#8722;H bond of N&#8208;methyl aniline that has formed product with poor enantioselectivity when catalyzed by prior enzyme systems.







Abstract
Artificial metalloenzymes (ArMs), created by introducing synthetic cofactors into protein scaffolds, are an emerging class of catalyst for non&#8208;natural reactions. Although many classes of ArMs are known, in vitro reconstitution of cofactors and proteins has been a limiting step in the high&#8208;throughput screening and directed evolution of ArMs because purification of individual host proteins is time&#8208;consuming. We describe the application of a platform to combine mutants of the P450 enzyme CYP119 and the cofactor Ir(Me)MPIX in vivo, by coexpression of the CYP119 mutants with the heme transporter encoded by the hug operon, to the directed evolution of ArMs containing Ir(Me)MPIX in whole cells. We applied this platform to the development an ArMs catalyzing the insertion of the acyclic carbene from &#945;&#8208;diazopropanoate esters (Me&#8208;EDA) into the N&#8722;H bonds of N&#8208;alkyl anilines, a combination of carbene and amine classes for which mutant enzymes of natural hemoproteins previously reacted with low enantioselectivity. The mutants of the artificial metalloenzyme Ir(Me)CYP119 identified by an evolution campaign involving more than 4000 mutants are shown to catalyze the reaction of Me&#8208;EDA with N&#8208;methyl anilines to form chiral chiral amino esters with high TON and good enantioselectivity, thereby demonstrating that the directed evolution of ArMs can rival that of natural enzymes in vivo.

         <title>Sustainable Superhydrophobic Surface with Tunable Nanoscale Hydrophilicity for Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fog collection can be a sustainable solution to water scarcity in many regions around the world. Recently, great efforts have been undertaken to develop low&#8208;cost and highly efficient water collectors to address water shortages, especially in arid regions. However, the design of a scalable water harvesting surface remains elusive to the trade&#8208;off between water deposition and transport. Herein, we developed a hydrophilic/superhydrophobic surface using a &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; facile approach to enable an efficient water deposition and transport process. Preferential exposure of hydrophilic cellulose nanocrystal outer surface could be used to accelerate droplet deposition, coupled with wax microspheres with distinct wetting features for the manipulation of the droplet mobility. Appropriate tuning of the wetting characteristics of the surfaces, optimizing the hydrophobicity and density of the water affinity nanodomains allowed us to enhance the water deposition rate without the sacrifice of water transport. An optimal hydrophilic/superhydrophobic topography through the control of nanoscale hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains yielded a water harvesting flux of 3.402 L/m  2  /h for a plate and 5.02 L/m  2  /h for a mesh. This strategy of decorating a superhydrophobic surface with moderately hydrophilic nanodomains allows the manipulation of droplet nucleation and removal to enhance the water collection efficiency.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inorganic chiral hybrid nanostructures embedding chirality within distinct material compositions can create novel chiral properties and functionalities absent from achiral ones, but remain largely unexplored. We report for the first time a class of chiral plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor core&#8208;shell nanostructures by employing structurally chiral nanoparticles as chirality inducing templates to grow functional shell materials, which allows us to independently control material parameters including core geometry and shell thickness, as well as handedness of the system. We experimentally and theoretically achieve enhanced and tunable chiroptical activity of the hetero&#8208;structures as a result of the core&#8208;shell strong coupling effect. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we show the chiral hybrid nanostructures can drive chirality&#8208;dependent photocatalytic hydrogen generation under circularly polarized light. This study enables rational design and functionalization of chiral hybrid nanomaterials towards enhanced chiral light&#8208;matter interactions and chiral device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet Dynamic Nuclear Polarization of Guest Molecules through Induced Fit in a Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization utilizing photoexcited triplet electrons (triplet&#8208;DNP) has great potential for room&#8208;temperature hyperpolarization of nuclear spins. However, the polarization transfer to molecules of interest remains a challenge due to the fast spin relaxation and weak interaction with target molecules at room temperature in conventional host materials. Here, we demonstrate the first example of DNP of guest molecules in a porous material at around room temperature by utilizing the induced&#8208;fit&#8208;type structural transformation of a crystalline yet flexible metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). In contrast to the usual hosts,  1  H spin&#8208;lattice relaxation time becomes longer by accommodating a pharmaceutical model target 5&#8208;fluorouracil  as the flexible MOF changes its structure upon guest accommodation to maximize the host&#8208;guest interactions. Combined with triplet&#8208;DNP and cross&#8208;polarization (CP), this system realizes an enhanced  19  F&#8208;NMR signal of guest target molecules.</dc:description>

Here, we demonstrate the first example of DNP of guest molecules in a porous material at around room temperature by utilizing the induced-fit-type structural transformation of a crystalline yet flexible metal-organic framework (MOF). In contrast to the usual hosts,  1  H spin-lattice relaxation time becomes longer by accommodating a pharmaceutical model target 5-fluorouracil  as the flexible MOF changes its structure upon guest accommodation to maximize the host-guest interactions. Combined with triplet-DNP and cross-polarization (CP), this system realizes an enhanced  19  F-NMR signal of guest target molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Access Route to High&#8208;Nuclearity, Metal&#8208;Functionalized Molecular Vanadium Oxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular metal oxides are key materials in diverse fields like energy storage and conversion, molecular magnetism and as model systems for solid&#8208;state metal oxides. To improve their performance and increase the variety of accessible motifs, new synthetic approaches are necessary. Herein, we report a universal, new precursor to access different metal&#8208;functionalized polyoxovanadate (POV) clusters. The precursor is synthesized by a novel solid&#8208;state thermal treatment procedure. Solution&#8208;phase test reactions at room temperature and pressure show that reaction of the precursor with various metal nitrate salts gives access to a range of metal&#8208;functionalized POVs. The first nitrate&#8208;templated molecular calcium vanadate cluster is reported. We show that this precursor could open new access routes to POV components for molecular magnetism, energy technologies or catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Developing an Effective Glycan&#8208;based Vaccine for Streptococcus Pyogenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Streptococcus pyogenes is a primary infective agent that causes approximately 700 million human infections each year, resulting in more than 500,000 deaths. Carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccines are proven to be one of the most promising subunit vaccine candidates, as the bacterial glycan pattern(s) are different from mammalian cells and show increased pathogen serotype conservancy than the protein components. In this review we highlight reverse vaccinology for use in the development of subunit vaccines against S. pyogenes, and report reproducible methods of carbohydrate antigen production, in addition to the structure&#8208;immunogenicity correlation between group A carbohydrate epitopes and alternative vaccine antigen carrier systems. We also report recent advances used to overcome hurdles in carbohydrate&#8208;based vaccine development.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescent Sensor for Quantitative Super&#8208;resolution Imaging of Amyloid Fibril Assembly.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many soluble proteins can self&#8208;assemble into macromolecular structures called amyloids, a subset of which are implicated in a range of neurodegenerative disorders. The nanoscale size and structural heterogeneity of prefibrillar and early aggregates, as well as mature amyloid fibrils, pose significant challenges for the quantification of amyloid species, identification of their cellular interaction partners and for elucidation of the molecular basis for cytotoxicity. We report a fluorescent amyloid sensor  AmyBlink&#8208;1  and its application in super&#8208;resolution imaging of amyloid structures.  AmyBlink&#8208;1  exhibits a 5&#8208;fold increase in ratio of the green (thioflavin T) to red (Alexa Fluor 647) emission intensities upon interaction with amyloid fibrils. Using  AmyBlink&#8208;1  , we performed nanoscale imaging of four different types of amyloid fibrils, achieving a resolution of ~30 nm.  AmyBlink&#8208;1  enables nanoscale visualization and subsequent quantification of morphological features, such as the length and skew of individual amyloid aggregates formed at different times along the amyloid assembly pathway.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>One great challenge for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lies in their poor operational stability under harsh stimuli by humidity, heat, light,  etc  . Herein, a thermal&#8208;triggered self&#8208;healing polyurethane (PU) is tailored to simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of inorganic CsPbIBr  2  PSC. The dynamic covalent disulfide bonds between adjacent molecule chains in PU at high temperatures self&#8208;heal the in&#8208;service formed defects within CsPbIBr  2  perovskite film. Finally, the best device free of encapsulation achieves a champion efficiency up to 10.61% and an excellent long&#8208;term stability in air atmosphere over 80 days and persistent heat attack (85  o  C) over 35 days. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances are recovered by a simple heat treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordinating the mechanism of actions of ferroptosis and photothermal effect for cancer theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Combination therapy based on different mechanisms of cell death has shown promises in tumor therapy. However, design considerations for integrating different modalities are often lack of rationale to synergize the therapeutic effects to the maximal extent. Here, we report a cancer theranostic nanomedicine formula by attentively considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and photothermal effect in combination therapy. We applied the croconaine molecule as both a photothermal converter and an iron&#8208;chelating agent which could be readily encapsulated with BSA thus attaining biocompatible and stable Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles. The Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoprticles in the tumor milieu showed an activated photothermal effect which could enhance the radical formation due to the temperature&#8208;dependent Fenton reaction kinetics, while the radical formation during ferroptosis could in turn destruct the heat&#8208;induced formation of heat shock proteins, thus preventing the self&#8208;protection mechanism of cancer cells in response to heat. This mutually beneficial strategy led to an efficient anticancer effect both in vitro and in a subcutaneous mouse tumor model. Furthermore, the activatable photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging performance of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles provided an intelligent paradigm for safe and reliable cancer theranostics. This study may open up new avenues in designing nanomedicines from a vantage point of synergizing different therapeutic modalities.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Nanocomplex Containing Cascade DNAzymes and Promoter&#8208;Like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite for Combined Gene/Chemo&#8208;dynamic Therapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite was synthesized. The promoter&#8208;like ZMF decomposed in response to intratumoral glutathione to release a sufficient quantity of metal ions, thus promoting cascade DNA/RNA cleavage and free radical generation, and achieving combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy.







Abstract
Sequential control of exogenous chemical events inside cells is a promising way to regulate cell functions and fate. Herein we report a DNA nanocomplex containing cascade DNAzymes and promoter&#8208;like Zn&#8208;Mn&#8208;Ferrite (ZMF), achieving combined gene/chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy. The promoter&#8208;like ZMF decomposed in response to intratumoral glutathione to release a sufficient quantity of metal ions, thus promoting cascade DNA/RNA cleavage and free radical generation. Two kinds of DNAzymes were designed for sequential cascade enzymatic reaction, in which metal ions functioned as cofactors. The primary DNAzyme self&#8208;cleaved the DNA chain with Zn2+ as cofactor, and produced the secondary DNAzyme; the secondary DNAzyme afterwards cleaved the EGR&#8208;1 mRNA, and thus downregulated the expression of target EGR&#8208;1 protein, achieving DNAzyme&#8208;based gene therapy. Meanwhile, the released Zn2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ induced Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions, during which free radicals were catalytically generated and efficient chemo&#8208;dynamic therapy was achieved. In a breast cancer mouse model, the administration of DNA nanocomplex led to a significant therapeutic efficacy of tumor growth suppression.

         <title>Titanocene(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Precision Deuteration of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanocene catalysis delivers D to the more substituted C&#8208;atom of epoxides with high efficiency, deuterium incorporation, and stereoselectivity. A novel method of catalyst activation that prevents isotope scrambling warrants the excellent performance of the reaction.







Abstract
We describe a titanocene(III)&#8208;catalyzed deuterosilylation of epoxides that provides &#946;&#8208;deuterated anti&#8208;Markovnikov alcohols with excellent D&#8208;incorporation, in high yield, and often excellent diastereoselectivity after desilylation. The key to the success of the reaction is a novel activation method of Cp2TiCl2 and (tBuC5H4)2TiCl2 with BnMgBr and PhSiD3 to provide [(RC5H4)2Ti(III)D] without isotope scrambling. It was developed after discovering an off&#8208;cycle scrambling with the previously described method. Our precision deuteration can be applied to the synthesis of drug precursors and highlights the power of combining radical chemistry with organometallic catalysis.

         <title>A Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ravel Assembled by Anion Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) between organic tris&#8208;carboxylates and tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands afforded an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination centers in constructing novel topologies on account of the modifiable size and function of these organic anions.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) is showing increasing power in the construction of anionic supramolecular architectures. Herein, by expanding the anion centers from oxoanion (phosphate or sulfate) to organic tris&#8208;carboxylates, an Archimedean solid (truncated tetrahedron) and a highly entangled, double&#8208;walled tetrahedron featuring a ravel topology have been assembled with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands. The results demonstrate the promising ability of tris&#8208;carboxylates as new anion coordination centers in constructing novel topologies with increasing complexity and diversity compared to phosphate or sulfate ions on account of the modifiable size and easy functionalization character of these organic anions.

         <title>SnF2&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of Polymerized Dioxolane as Solid Electrolyte and its Thermal Decomposition Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnF2 is an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL and also an effective additive for improving the interfacial wettability with Li&#8208;metal, of benefit in reaching the dendrite free and dense Li&#8208;deposition in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells. However, P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE tends to be thermally decomposed at 110&#8201;&#176;C with the formation of formaldehyde gas and other epoxides, restricting the operating temperature window of P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.







Abstract
Polymerized&#8208;dioxolane(P&#8208;DOL) is of potential as a solid&#8208;polymer&#8208;electrolyte(SPE) due to its high Li+&#8208;conductivity, good compatibility with Li&#8208;metal and desired preparation method of in situ polymerization in cells. In this study, SnF2 was demonstrated not only to be an efficient catalyst for the polymerization of DOL at room temperature, but also an effective additive for improving interfacial wettability and suppressing dendrite through the reaction with Li&#8208;metal and the formation of LiF/LixSn based composite solid electrolyte interlayer(SEI). Using the SnF2 polymerized P&#8208;DOL containing 1&#8197;M LiTFSI as SPE(P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE), obviously denser Li&#8208;deposition was obtained, and the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state(ASS) Li/LiFePO4 cell delivered stable cycling over 350 cycles at 45&#8201;&#176;C. At the same time, the irreversible decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE into formaldehyde and small molecule epoxides are observed at 110&#8201;&#176;C, which is even initiated at lower temperature of 40&#8201;&#176;C under vacuum. This thermal decomposition of P&#8208;DOL&#8208;SPE in pouch cell causes huge volume swell, and therefore putting a strict limitation on the operating temperature window for the P&#8208;DOL based electrolytes.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cubic arsenic nitride was synthesized from arsenic and nitrogen under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions using a laser heated diamond anvil cell. The crystalline structure of AsN (P213), in which every As atom is single&#8208;bonded to three N atoms and vice versa, was determined by synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction. The discovery of AsN is relevant to the fundamental chemistry of pnictogens and to synthesis of new advanced materials.







Abstract
Chemical reactivity between As and N2, leading to the synthesis of crystalline arsenic nitride, is here reported under high pressure and high temperature conditions generated by laser heating in a diamond anvil cell. Single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction at different pressures between 30 and 40&#8197;GPa provides evidence for the synthesis of a covalent compound of AsN stoichiometry, crystallizing in a cubic P213 space group, in which each of the two elements is single&#8208;bonded to three atoms of the other and hosts an electron lone pair, in a tetrahedral anisotropic coordination. The identification of characteristic structural motifs highlights the key role played by the directional repulsive interactions between non&#8208;bonding electron lone pairs in the formation of the AsN structure. Additional data indicate the existence of AsN at room temperature from 9.8 up to 50&#8197;GPa. Implications concern fundamental aspects of pnictogens chemistry and the synthesis of innovative advanced materials.

         <title>A Supramolecular Polymer Constituted of Antiaromatic NiII Norcorroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular polymer that consists of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer has been created. An amide&#8208;functionalized NiII norcorrole derivative forms a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions. The formation of a long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking array ensures the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation and achieves high charge&#8208;carrier mobility along the tightly&#8208;bound linear aggregates.







Abstract
For the creation of next&#8208;generation organic electronic materials, the integration of &#960;&#8208;systems has recently become a central theme. Such functional materials can be assembled by supramolecular polymerization when aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems are used as monomers, and the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymer strongly depend on the electronic structure of the monomers. Here, we demonstrate the construction of a supramolecular polymer consisting of an antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;system as the monomer. An amide&#8208;functionalized NiII norcorrole derivative formed a one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymer through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, ensuring the persistency of the conducting pathway against thermal perturbation, which results in higher charge mobility along the tightly bound linear aggregates than that of the aromatic analogue composed of ZnII porphyrins.

         <title>Development of Chiral Ligands for the Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Silylation and Borylation of C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview presents an overview of the recent progress in the design of chiral ligands and substrates for the enantioselective borylation and silylation of C&#8722;H bonds, as well as the salient mechanistic features and reaction scope, thereby revealing the limitations and challenges in this area and inspiring continued development of this synthetic method.







Abstract
Enantioselective reactions that install functional groups at the positions of unactivated C&#8722;H bonds can be envisioned to produce intermediates for the synthesis of the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals directly from simple feedstocks. Among these C&#8722;H bond functionalization reactions, those that form carbon&#8211;silicon (C&#8722;Si) and carbon&#8211;boron (C&#8722;B) bonds have been pursued because the products of these reactions can be converted to those containing a wide range of functional groups and because compounds containing silicon and boron possess unique properties that can be valuable for medicinal and materials chemistry. Although the silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds have undergone extensive development during the past two decades, enantioselective versions of these reactions were not known until a few years ago. In this Minireview, we present the rapid development of enantioselective silylation and borylation of C&#8722;H bonds, with an emphasis on the design and development of the types of chiral ligands needed to achieve these reactions and an intention to inspire an expansion of these types of transformations.

         <title>Radiation Chemistry Provides Nanoscopic Insights into the Role of Intermediate Phases in CeO2 Mesocrystal Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of radiation chemistry, different stages of CeO2 mesocrystal formation are revealed. The nucleation and growth of the primary particles, followed by their self&#8208;assembly into mesocrystals, occur inside a hydrated CeIV hydroxide phase. The hydroxide forms as the initial phase and serves as an intermediate in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation. Mesocrystals can be used as buildings blocks for designing complex hierarchical structures.







Abstract
The role of intermediate phases in CeO2 mesocrystal formation from aqueous CeIII solutions subjected to &#947;&#8208;radiation was studied. Radiolytically formed hydroxyl radicals convert soluble CeIII into less soluble CeIV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of samples from different stages of the process allowed the identification of several stages in CeO2 mesocrystal evolution following the oxidation to CeIV: (1)&#8197;formation of hydrated CeIV hydroxides, serving as intermediates in the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transformation; (2)&#8197;CeO2 primary particle growth inside the intermediate phase; (3)&#8197;alignment of the primary particles into &#8220;pre&#8208;mesocrystals&#8221; and subsequently to mesocrystals, guided by confinement of the amorphous intermediate phase and accompanied by the formation of &#8220;mineral bridges&#8221;. Further alignment of the obtained mesocrystals into supracrystals occurs upon slow drying, making it possible to form complex hierarchical architectures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Expanding Ion&#8208;Transport Channels on Anodes for Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concept of self&#8208;expanding Li&#8208;ion transport channels is demonstrated to construct a fast&#8208;charging anode and realize high&#8208;performance fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries. The self&#8208;expanded Li&#8208;ion transport channels, which are enabled by a self&#8208;reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode, allow a fast Li&#8208;ion solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics and effectively eliminate Li metal plating under fast&#8208;charging conditions.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A concept of self-expanding Li-ion transport channels is demonstrated to construct a fast-charging anode and realize high-performance fast-charging Li-ion batteries. The self-expanded Li-ion transport channels, which are enabled by a self-reversible conversion of chemical bonds with different bond lengths in the anode, allow a fast Li-ion solid-state diffusion kinetics and effectively eliminate Li metal plating under fast-charging conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Application of Perovskite Quantum Dots as an Absorber in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) display the quantum confinement effect yet maintain the characteristics of bulk materials. In this Review the advantages and disadvantages of perovskite QDs and significant strategies (exchange chemistry, passivation engineering, and structure engineering) for the advancement of perovskite solar cells with perovskite QDs as an absorber are discussed.







Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) preserve the attractive properties of perovskite bulk materials and present additional advantages, owing to their quantum confinement effect, leading to their suitability as an absorber in perovskite solar cells. In this Review, the issues and advantages of perovskite QDs are analyzed in the context of purification, device fabrication with perovskite QDs, light absorption, charge transport, and stability. In addition, promising strategies to enhance perovskite QDs and QD&#8208;based solar cells are elucidated based on exchange chemistry (ion and ligand exchange), passivation engineering (ion and ligand passivation), and structure engineering (conventional/inverted, planar/mesoscopic and dimensionally graded structures). These discussions will give a clue to the further development of perovskite QDs and thus the advancement of QD&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Azaphilones as Activation&#8208;Free Primary&#8208;Amine&#8208;Specific Bioconjugation Reagents for Peptides, Proteins and Lipids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique natural reaction of azaphilones with amines, an efficient, high chemoselective and activation&#8208;free primary amine bioconjugation protocol has been developed and demonstrated in a variety of applications.







Abstract
Residue&#8208;selective bioconjugation methods for biomolecules are highly sought to expand the scope of their biological and medical applications. Inspired by the mechanism of the generation of natural vinylogous &#947;&#8208;pyridones (vPDNs), we have developed a novel unique azaphilone&#8208;based, activation&#8208;free primary&#8208;amine&#8208;selective bioconjugation method for biomolecules. Our strategy allows facile functionalization of primary amine groups in peptides and proteins, including the clinically used therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, by generating a highly stable vPDN linkage. Excellent chemoselectivity toward primary amines also enables the azaphilone derivatives to specifically modify the lipid components of Gram&#8208;positive bacteria while bypassing Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and mammalian cells. The new method shows significant advantages including chemoselectivity, efficiency, flexibility and biocompatibility, and therefore provides a valuable addition to the current toolbox for biomolecule conjugation.

         <title>Rational Design of Axially Chiral Styrene&#8208;Based Organocatalysts and Their Application in Catalytic Asymmetric (2+4) Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts has been rationally designed. They enable the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines. This work represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, and it gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.







Abstract
A new class of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based thiourea tertiary amine catalysts, which have unique characteristics such as an efficient synthetic route, multiple chiral elements, and multiple activating groups, has been rationally designed. These new chiral catalysts have proven to be efficient organocatalysts, enabling the chemo&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines with homophthalic anhydrides in good yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with excellent stereoselectivities (all &gt;95:5 dr, up to 98&#8201;% ee). More importantly, theoretical calculations elucidated the important role of an axially chiral styrene moiety in controlling both the reactivity and enantioselectivity. This work not only represents the first design of styrene&#8208;based chiral thiourea tertiary amine catalysts and the first catalytic asymmetric (2+4) cyclization of 2&#8208;benzothiazolimines, but also gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of axially chiral styrene&#8208;based organocatalysts.

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry MOF&#8208;Based Patchy Colloids and Their Precise Linking via Site&#8208;Selective Liquid Bridging to Form Supra&#8208;Colloidal and Supra&#8208;Framework Architectures</title>

         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;symmetry, MOF&#8208;based patchy colloids are reported, which carry both shape and chemical information that enables precise directional colloidal assembly, producing hierarchical, multicomponent, and supra&#8208;framework architectures with unprecedented control over the position, rotation, and orientation of the constituent building blocks.







Abstract
Colloids with surface patches (or patchy particles) can bind and assemble with directionality. However, the bonding between the usually high&#8208;symmetry, dome&#8208;shaped patches is not precise, as it cannot lock the exact position and orientation of the relevant particles. This issue prevents the assembly of well&#8208;defined colloidal superstructures by design. Herein, we introduce low&#8208;symmetry, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based patchy colloids, which feature a polyhedral matrix and flat hexagonal patches, along with anisotropic surfaces and compositions. Guided by the encoded shape/chemical information and mediated by a site&#8208;selective liquid&#8208;bridging interaction, the distinct patchy particles self&#8208;assemble into supra&#8208;colloidal (or supra&#8208;framework) structures with unprecedented precision. In this case, the valence, position, and orientation of the particles within assemblies are fully coordinated and precisely aligned. The dynamic nature of the liquid bridges also allows us to investigate the unique assembly kinetics. Our strategy not only defines new modes of colloidal bonding, but also provides a powerful means toward creating hierarchical and multi&#8208;component MOF materials.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dithia[5]helicenes and their Postsynthetic Functionalization to Access Dithia[9]helicenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a chiral Au catalyst bearing an &#945;&#8208;cationic phosphonite as an ancillary ligand and two successive alkyne hydroarylation events allows the assembly of dithia[5]helicenes with excellent enantioselectivity. Moreover, regioselective postsynthetic bromination of the dithia[5]helicene products generates starting materials for the efficient preparation of even more &#960;&#8208;expanded systems, such as dithia[9]helicenes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective synthesis of 5,13&#8208;disubstituted dibenzo[d,d&#8242;]benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophenes is reported. Key for the successful assembly of these helical architectures is the last two successive Au&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular alkyne hydroarylation events. Specifically, the second cyclization is the enantiodetermining step of the whole process and provides the desired helicenes with excellent ee values when a TADDOL&#8208;derived 1,2,3&#8208;(triazolium)phosphonite moiety (TADDOL: &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8242;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethanol) is employed as an ancillary ligand. The absolute stereochemistry of the newly prepared structures has been determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography to be P; the optical properties of these heterohelicenes are also reported. A three&#8208;step procedure was subsequently developed that allows the transformation of the initially obtained dithia[5]helicenes into dithia[9]helicenes without erosion of the enantiopurity.

         <title>Metallization&#8208;Prompted Robust Porphyrin&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic and computational studies on a series of porphyrinic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) reveal that metallization of porphyrin centers greatly alters the orbital overlap of the adjacent porphyrin, the geometry of the molecule/layer, and the strength of noncovalent interactions. Therefore, metalloporphyrin HOFs exhibit much higher stability, surface area, and catalytic activity than metal&#8208;free porphyrinic HOFs.







Abstract
Under topological guidance, the self&#8208;assembly process based on a tetratopic porphyrin synthon results in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) with the predicted square layers topology (sql) but unsatisfied stability. Strikingly, simply introducing a transition metal in the porphyrin center does not change the network topology but drastically causes noticeable change on noncovalent interaction, orbital overlap, and molecular geometry, therefore ultimately giving rise to a series of metalloporphyrinic HOFs with high surface area, and excellent stability (intact after being soaked in boiling water, concentrated HCl, and heated to 270&#8201;&#176;C). On integrating both photosensitizers and catalytic sites into robust backbones, this series of HOFs can effectively catalyze the photoreduction of CO2 to CO, and their catalytic performances greatly depend on the chelated metal species in the porphyrin centers. This work enriches the library of stable functional HOFs and expands their applications in photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Surface Gelation on Disulfide Electrocatalysts in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface gelation on disulfide electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;S batteries is identified for the first time. The gel layer, formed through the solvent polymerization triggered by the Lewis acid sites, covers the active electrocatalytic sites and renders reduced redox kinetics. Herein, a Lewis base triethylamine is introduced to suppress the surface gelation and promote the electrocatalytic activity of disulfide electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are deemed as future energy storage devices due to ultrahigh theoretical energy density. Cathodic polysulfide electrocatalysts have been widely investigated to promote sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Probing the surface structure of electrocatalysts is vital to understanding the mechanism of polysulfide electrocatalysis. In this work, we for the first time identify surface gelation on disulfide electrocatalysts. Concretely, the Lewis acid sites on disulfides trigger the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the dioxolane solvent to generate a surface gel layer, covering disulfides and reducing the electrocatalytic activity. Accordingly, a Lewis base triethylamine (TEA) is introduced as a competitive inhibitor. Consequently, Li&#8211;S batteries with disulfide electrocatalysts and TEA afford high specific capacity and improved rate responses. This work affords new insights on the actual surface structure of electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Tunable Second&#8208;Level Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Solid Supramolecules between Acrylamide&#8211;Phenylpyridium Copolymers and Cucurbit[7]uril</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8211;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups and cucurbit[7]uril not only exhibit tunable ultralong phosphorescence with lifetimes varying from 0.9&#8197;s to 2.2&#8197;s, but also co&#8208;assemble with organic dyes Eosin&#8197;Y or SR101 to display high&#8208;performance phosphorescence energy transfer with multicolor delayed fluorescence properties.







Abstract
A series of solid supramolecules based on acrylamide&#8211;phenylpyridium copolymers with various substituent groups (P&#8722;R: R=&#8722;CN, &#8722;CO2Et, &#8722;Me, &#8722;CF3) and cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) are constructed to exhibit tunable second&#8208;level (from 0.9&#8197;s to 2.2&#8197;s) room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the amorphous state. Compared with other solid supramolecules P&#8722;R/CB[7] (R=&#8722;CN, &#8722;CO2Et, &#8722;Me), P&#8722;CF3/CB[7] displays the longest lifetime (2.2&#8197;s), which is probably attributed to the fluorophilic interaction of cucurbiturils leading to a uncommon host&#8211;guest interaction between 4&#8208;phenylpyridium with &#8722;CF3 and CB[7]. Furthermore, the RTP solid supramolecular assembly (donors) can further react with organic dyes Eosin Y or SR101 (acceptors) to form ternary supramolecular systems featuring ultralong phosphorescence energy transfer (PpET) and visible delayed fluorescence (yellow for EY at 568&#8197;nm and red for SR101 at 620&#8197;nm). Significantly, the ultralong multicolor PpET supramolecular assembly can be further applied in fields of anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption and painting.

Compared with other solid supramolecules P&#8722;R/CB[7] (R=&#8722;CN, &#8722;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et, &#8722;Me), P&#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CB[7] displays the longest lifetime (2.2&#8197;s), which is probably attributed to the fluorophilic interaction of cucurbiturils leading to a uncommon host&#8211;guest interaction between 4-phenylpyridium with &#8722;CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CB[7]. Furthermore, the RTP solid supramolecular assembly (donors) can further react with organic dyes Eosin Y or SR101 (acceptors) to form ternary supramolecular systems featuring ultralong phosphorescence energy transfer (PpET) and visible delayed fluorescence (yellow for EY at 568&#8197;nm and red for SR101 at 620&#8197;nm). Significantly, the ultralong multicolor PpET supramolecular assembly can be further applied in fields of anti-counterfeiting and information encryption and painting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Molten Salt Synthesis of Platinum Alloys Planted in Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Graphene for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt&#8722;Co nanoalloys planted in the metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;graphene system achieved by a scalable molten salt pyrolysis method demonstrate improved activity and stability for oxygen reduction through a synergistic effect among multiple active sites and a strong metal&#8211;support interaction.







Abstract
Fuel cells are considered as a promising alternative to the existing traditional energy systems towards a sustainable future. Nevertheless, the synthesis of efficient and robust platinum (Pt) based catalysts remains a challenge for practical applications. In this work, we present a simple and scalable molten&#8208;salt synthesis method for producing a low&#8208;platinum (Pt) nanoalloy implanted in metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;graphene. The as&#8208;prepared low&#8208;Pt alloyed graphene exhibits a high oxygen reduction activity of 1.29&#8197;A&#8201;mgPt&#8722;1 and excellent durability over 30&#8201;000 potential cycles. The catalyst nanoarchitecture of graphene encased Pt nanoalloy provides a robust capability against nanoparticle migration and corrosion due to a strong metal&#8211;support interaction. Similarly, advanced characterization and theoretical calculations show that the multiple active sites in platinum alloyed graphene synergistically account for the improved oxygen reduction. This work not only provides an efficient and robust low&#8208;Pt catalyst but also a facile design idea and scalable preparation technique for integrated catalysts to achieve more profound applications in fuel cells and beyond.

         <dc:description>Protonolysis of [Cp*M] (M = Ga, In, Tl) with [(Me4TACD)H][BAr4Me] (Me4TACD = N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane; [BAr4Me]&#8208; = [B{C6H3&#8208;3,5&#8208;(CH3)2}4]&#8208;) provided monovalent salts [(Me4TACD)M][BAr4Me], whereas [Cp*Al]4 yielded trivalent [(Me4TACD)AlH][BAr4Me]2. Protonation of [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me] with [Et3NH][BAr4Me] gave an unusually acidic (pKa(CH3CN) = 24.5) gallium(III) hydride dication [(Me4TACD)GaH][BAr4Me]2: deprotonation with IMe4 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;ylidene) returned [(Me4TACD)Ga][BAr4Me]. These reversible processes occur with formal two&#8208;electron oxidation and reduction of gallium. DFT calculations suggest that gallium(I) protonation is facilitated by strong coordination of the tetradentate ligand, which raises the HOMO energy. High nuclear charge of [(Me4TACD)GaH]2+ facilitates hydride&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during deprotonation. Attempts to prepare a gallium(III) dihydride cation resulted in spontaneous dehydrogenation to [(Me4TACD)Ga]+.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Single&#8208;electron transfer mode coupled with the shuttle behavior of organic iodine batteries results in insufficient capacity, low redox potential, and poor cycle durability. Sluggish kinetics are well identified in the conventional lithium&#8208;iodine (Li&#8208;I) batteries, inferior to other conversion congeners. Herein, we demonstrate the new two&#8208;electron redox chemistry of I  &#8208;  /I  +  with the inter&#8208;halogens cooperation based on a developed haloid cathode. The new iodide ion conversion battery exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;art capacity of 408 mAh g&#8208;1 I with fast redox kinetics and superior cycle stability. Equipped with a newly emerged 3.42 V discharge voltage plateau, a recorded high energy density of 1324 Wh kg&#8208;1 I is achieved. Such robust redox chemistry is temperature&#8208;insensitive and operates efficiently at &#8208;30 &#176;C. With systematic theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations, the formation of Cl&#8208;I  +  species and their functions are clarified.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrical Reverse Shift: Sustainable CO2 Valorization for Industrial Scale</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of CO  2  is a requirement for a sustainable production of carbon&#8208;based chemicals. Reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (RWGS) can valorize CO  2  by reaction with hydrogen to produce a synthesis gas compatible with existing industrial infrastructure. Fully electrified reverse water&#8208;gas&#8208;shift (eRWGS&#8482;) was achieved using integrated ohmic heating and a nickel type catalyst at industrially relevant conditions. Using a feed of H  2  :CO  2  in a ratio of 2.25 at 10 barg, utilizing high temperature operation at 1050&#176;C allowed for production of a synthesis gas with a H  2  /CO ratio of 2.0 and no detectable methane, ideal for production of sustainable fuel by e.g. the Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis. Facilitating RWGS through CH  4  as intermediate was found superior to the selective RWGS route, due to higher activity and suppression of carbon formation. The eRWGS&#8482; catalyst is found to provide a preferential emissions free route for production of synthesis gas for any relevant H  2  /CO ratio, enabling production of sustainable carbon&#8208;based chemicals from CO  2  and renewable electricity with high hydrogen and carbon efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>The Underlying Molecular Mechanism of Fence Engineering to Break the Activity&#8208;stability Trade&#8208;off of Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal (NPM) catalysts often face the formidable challenge of a trade&#8208;off between long&#8208;term stability and high activity, which has not yet been widely addressed. Here we propose distinct molecule&#8208;selective fence as a promising novel concept to solve this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off. This unique fence has the characteristics of preventing poisonous species from invading catalysts, but allowing catalytic reaction&#8208;related species to diffuse freely. We applied this concept to construct CoS2 layer with the function of molecular selectivity on the external surface of highly active Co doped MoS2, achieving a remarkable catalytic stability towards alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction, along with a further optimized activity. In situ spectroscopy technologies uncovered the underlying molecule mechanism of the CoS2 fence for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of the MoS2 catalyst. This work offers valuable guidance for rationally designing efficient and stable NPM catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of Molecular Cascade Reactions by a Reconfigurable DNA Origami Domino Array</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by efficient biomolecular reactions in the cell, versatile DNA nanostructures have been explored for manipulating the spatial position and regulating reactions at the molecular level. Spatially controlled arrangement of molecules on the artificial scaffolds generally leads to enhanced reaction activities. Especially, the rich toolset of dynamic DNA nanostructures provides a potential route towards more sophisticated and vigorous regulation of molecular reactions. Herein, reconfigurable DNA origami domino array (DODA) as dynamic scaffolds was adopted in this work for temporal&#8208;controlled and switchable molecular cascade reactions. Dynamic regulation of the assembly of G&#8208;quadruplex, hybridization of parallel&#8208;stranded duplex and assembly of binary DNAzyme were demonstrated. Molecular cascade reactions proceed on the triggered reconfiguration of DODAs were realized, resulting in more complex, dynamic, and switchable control over the reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Module&#8208;Patterned Polymerization towards Crystalline 2D sp2&#8208;Carbon Covalent Organic Framework Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite a rapid progress over the past decade, most&#160; polycondensation&#160; systems even upon a small structural variation of building units eventually result in amorphous polymers other than desired crystalline covalent organic frameworks. This synthetic dilemma is a central and challenging issue of the field. Here we report a novel approach based on module&#8208;patterned polymerization to enable efficient and designed synthesis of crystalline porous polymeric frameworks. This strategy features a wide applicability to allow the use of various knots of different structures, enables polycondensation with diverse linkers , and&#160; develops a diversity of novel crystalline 2D polymers and frameworks, as demonstrated by using the C=C bond formation&#160; polycondensation&#160; reaction. The new sp  2  &#160;carbon frameworks are highly emissive and enable up&#8208;conversion luminescence, offer low bandgap semiconductors with tunable band structures, and achieve ultrahigh charge mobilities close to theoretically predicted maxima.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Melt&#8208;Processable Supramolecular Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of polythiourethane soft actuators based on liquid crystal and thiourethane segments has been developed by a one&#8208;pot approach. The formation of well&#8208;defined thiourethane segments affords supramolecular cross&#8208;links through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions yielding materials that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes. A detailed understanding and characterization of the developed material are presented.







Abstract
The application of reprocessable and reprogrammable soft actuators is limited by the synthetic strategies, 3D&#8208;shaping capabilities, and small deformations. In this work, melt&#8208;processable supramolecular soft actuators based on segmented copolymers containing thiourethane and liquid crystal segments have been prepared via sequential thiol addition reactions in a one&#8208;pot approach using commercially available building blocks. The actuators demonstrated immediate, reversible response and weightlifting capabilities with large deformations up to 32&#8201;%. Through exploiting the supramolecular cross&#8208;links, the material could be recycled and reprogrammed into 3D actuators and welded into an actuator assembly with different deformation modes. Our work offers a one&#8208;pot synthesis and straightforward melt&#8208;processable approach to prepare supramolecular soft actuators with large deformations that can be reprocessed and reprogrammed into arbitrary 3D shapes.

         <title>Stabilizing Interface pH by N&#8208;Modified Graphdiyne for Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. We constructed a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface to stabilize pH by accelerating hydrated zinc ions desolvation, enabling the direct electron transfer from anode to Zn2+ (rather than the coordinated H2O). Operando pH detection reveals the pH stabilization. Zn&#8208;V6O13 battery works well at 20.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.07&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work highlights interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.







Abstract
Zn dendrite issue was intensively studied via tuning zinc ion flux. pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. Here, we construct a N&#8208;modification graphdiyne interface (NGI) to stabilize pH by mediating hydrated zinc ion desolvation. Operando pH detection reveals pH stabilization by NGI. This works with pores in NGI to achieve dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition and an increased symmetric cell lifespan by 116 times. Experimental and theoretical results owe pH stabilization to desolvation with a reduced activation energy achieved by electron transfer from solvation sheath to N atom. The efficient desolvation ensures that electron directly transfers from substrate to Zn2+ (rather than the coordinated H2O), avoiding O&#8722;H bond splitting. Hence, Zn&#8208;V6O13 battery achieves a long lifespan at 20.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1.07&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work reveals the significance of interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zn dendrite issue was intensively studied via tuning zinc ion flux. pH change seriously influences dendrite formation, while its importance has not been revealed. Here, we construct a N-modification graphdiyne interface (NGI) to stabilize pH by mediating hydrated zinc ion desolvation. Operando pH detection reveals pH stabilization by NGI. This works with pores in NGI to achieve dendrite-free Zn deposition and an increased symmetric cell lifespan by 116 times. Experimental and theoretical results owe pH stabilization to desolvation with a reduced activation energy achieved by electron transfer from solvation sheath to N atom. The efficient desolvation ensures that electron directly transfers from substrate to Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (rather than the coordinated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), avoiding O&#8722;H bond splitting. Hence, Zn-V&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; battery achieves a long lifespan at 20.65&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1.07&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work reveals the significance of interface pH and provides a new approach to address Zn dendrite issue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Herein, we report the rich morphological and conformational versatility of a biologically active peptide (PEP&#8208;1), which follows diverse self&#8208;assembly pathways to form up to six distinct nanostructures and up to four different secondary structures through subtle modulation in pH, concentration and temperature. PEP&#8208;1 forms twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structures and nanofibers at pH&#8197;7.4, which transform into fractal&#8208;like structures with strong &#946;&#8208;sheet conformations at pH&#8197;13.0 or short disorganized elliptical aggregates at pH&#8197;5.5. Upon dilution at pH&#8197;7.4, the nanofibers with twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structural elements convert into nanoparticles with random coil conformations. Interestingly, these two self&#8208;assembled states at pH&#8197;7.4 and room temperature are kinetically controlled and undergo a further transformation into thermodynamically stable states upon thermal annealing: whereas the twisted &#946;&#8208;sheet structures and corresponding nanofibers transform into 2D sheets with well&#8208;defined &#946;&#8208;sheet domains, the nanoparticles with random coil structures convert into short nanorods with &#945;&#8208;helix conformations. Notably, PEP&#8208;1 also showed high biocompatibility, low hemolytic activity and marked antibacterial activity, rendering our system a promising candidate for multiple bio&#8208;applications.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on strained oligoparaphenylene loops and a flexible cyclooctatetrathiophene moiety, a fully conjugated bis&#8208;macrocycle is efficiently constructed, and processes rigid and guest&#8208;adaptive cavities. Its peanut&#8208;like 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexes with C60 or C70 have been isolated and characterized, respectively.







Abstract
A fully conjugated figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight nanohoop is presented with facile synthesis. The molecule's lemniscular skeleton features the combination of two strained oligoparaphenylene loops and a flexible cyclooctatetrathiophene core. Its rigid yet guest&#8208;adaptive cavities enable the formation of the peanut&#8208;like 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexes with C60 or C70, which have been confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and characterized in solution. Further computational studies suggest notable geometric variations and non&#8208;covalent interactions of the cavities upon binding with different fullerenes, as well as overall conjugation comparable to cycloparaphenylenes.

The solution phase molecular structure of five redox&#8208; and photo&#8208;active bimetallic complexes was directly probed using high energy X&#8208;ray scattering and atomic pairwise distribution function in the Research Article by Xiaosong Li, Karen&#8197;L. Mulfort, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202111764). The analysis reveals significant conformational differences between the solution phase and solid&#8208;state structures of these complexes that may be relevant for interactions between the two metal centers.

Abstract
Nanomaterials offer exciting properties and functionalities. However, their production and processing frequently involve complex methods, cumbersome equipment, harsh conditions, and hazardous media. The capability of organisms to accomplish this using mild conditions offers a sustainable, biocompatible, and environmentally friendly alternative. Different nanomaterials such as metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, silica nanostructures, and nanocellulose are being synthesized increasingly through living entities. In addition, the bionanofabrication potential enables also the in situ processing of nanomaterials inside biomatrices with unprecedented outcomes. In this Minireview we present a critical state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vision of current nanofabrication approaches mediated by living entities (ranging from unicellular to higher organisms), in order to expand this knowledge and scrutinize future prospects. An efficient interfacial interaction at the nanoscale by green means is within reach through this approach.

         <title>A Phenanthrocarbazole&#8208;Based Dopant&#8208;Free Hole&#8208;Transport Polymer with Noncovalent Conformational Locking for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) based on the phenanthrocarbazole derivative PC6 features a two&#8208;dimensionally conjugated phenanthrocarbazole and S&#8208;O noncovalent conformational locking. Perovskite solar cells employing PC6 as a dopant&#8208;free HTM afforded an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.2&#8201;% and long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Adequate hole mobility is the prerequisite for dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs). Constraining the configurational variation of polymer chains to afford a rigid and planar backbone can reduce unfavorable reorganization energy and improve hole mobility. Herein, a noncovalent conformational locking via S&#8211;O secondary interaction is exploited in a phenanthrocarbazole (PC) based polymeric HTM, PC6, to fix the molecular geometry and significantly reduce reorganization energy. Systematic studies on structurally explicit repeats to targeted polymers reveals that the broad and planar backbone of PC remarkably enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of adjacent polymers, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer greatly. The inserted &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; oxygen atoms passivate the trap sites efficiently at the perovskite/HTM interface and further suppress interfacial recombination. Consequently, a PSC employing PC6 as a dopant&#8208;free HTM offers an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.2&#8201;% and significantly improved longevity, rendering it as one of the best PSCs based on dopant&#8208;free HTMs.

Herein, a noncovalent conformational locking via S&#8211;O secondary interaction is exploited in a phenanthrocarbazole (&lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt;) based polymeric HTM, &lt;b&gt;PC6&lt;/b&gt;, to fix the molecular geometry and significantly reduce reorganization energy. Systematic studies on structurally explicit repeats to targeted polymers reveals that the broad and planar backbone of &lt;b&gt;PC&lt;/b&gt; remarkably enhances &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of adjacent polymers, facilitating intermolecular charge transfer greatly. The inserted &#8220;Lewis soft&#8221; oxygen atoms passivate the trap sites efficiently at the perovskite/HTM interface and further suppress interfacial recombination. Consequently, a PSC employing &lt;b&gt;PC6&lt;/b&gt; as a dopant-free HTM offers an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.2&#8201;% and significantly improved longevity, rendering it as one of the best PSCs based on dopant-free HTMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Transition Metal Oxide Electrocatalysts for the Reversible Carbon Dioxide&#8211;Carbon Monoxide Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthesis of trimetallo&#8208;substituted polyanions enables the preparation of designer catalysts. Here this approach was used to prepare electrocatalysts for the selective reduction of CO2 to CO using a tri&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted polyanion. In contrast, Fe&#8211;Ni&#8208;substituted polyanions preferably catalyzed the oxidation of CO to CO2, showing a reactivity profile reminiscent of the reactivity of Fe&#8211;Ni&#8208;based carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes.







Abstract
Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) enzymes are active for the reversible CO oxidation&#8211;CO2 reduction reaction and are of interest in the context of CO2 abatement and carbon&#8208;neutral solar fuels. Bioinspired by the active&#8208;site composition of the CODHs, polyoxometalates triply substituted with first&#8208;row transition metals were modularly synthesized. The polyanions, in short, {SiM3W9} and {SiM&#8242;2M&#8242;&#8242;W9}, M, M&#8242;, M&#8242;&#8242;=CuII, NiII, FeIII are shown to be electrocatalysts for reversible CO oxidation&#8211;CO2 reduction. A catalytic Tafel plot showed that {SiCu3W9} was the most reactive for CO2 reduction, and electrolysis reactions yielded significant amounts of CO with 98&#8201;% faradaic efficiency. In contrast, Fe&#8211;Ni compounds such as {SiFeNi2W9} preferably catalyzed the oxidation of CO to CO2 similar to what is observed for the [NiFe]&#8208;CODH enzyme. Compositional control of the heterometal complexes, now and in the future, leads to control of reactivity and selectivity for CO2 electrocatalytic reduction.

         <title>A Ni0 &#963;&#8208;Borane Complex Bearing a Rigid Bidentate Borane/Phosphine Ligand: Boryl Complex Formation by Oxidative Dehydrochloroborylation and Catalytic Activity for Ethylene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a rigid bidentate borane/phosphine ligand was explored within the background of statistical olefin copolymerization with group 10 metals. During this work, a mild oxidative dehydrochloroborylation reaction was found to convert different Ni0 &#963;&#8208;borane complexes into NiII boryl chloride complexes. This new ligand also allows the nickel catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, a first for a B&#8208;donor in group 10 olefin polymerization.







Abstract
While of interest, synthetically feasible access to boryl ligands and complexes remains limited, meaning such complexes remain underexploited in catalysis. For bidentate boryl ligands, oxidative addition of boranes to low&#8208;valent IrI or Pt0 are the only examples yet reported. As part of our interest in developing improved group 10 ethylene polymerization catalysts, we present here an optimized synthesis of a novel, rigid borane/phosphine ligand and its Ni0 &#963;&#8208;borane complex. From the latter, an unprecedented oxidative dehydrochloroborylation, to give a NiII boryl complex, was achieved. Furthermore, this new B/P ligand allowed the nickel&#8208;catalyzed polymerization of ethylene, which suggests that Ni0 &#963;&#8208;hydroborane complexes act as masked NiII boryl hydride reagents.

         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;electron reduced, luminescent forms of perylene diimides can be employed for thermodynamically challenging photoredox reactions in aqueous and in organic solution.







Abstract
The two&#8208;electron reduced forms of perylene diimides (PDIs) are luminescent closed&#8208;shell species whose photochemical properties seem underexplored. Our proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrates that straightforward (single) excitation of PDI dianions with green photons provides an excited state that is similarly or more reducing than the much shorter&#8208;lived excited states of PDI radical monoanions, which are typically accessible after biphotonic excitation with blue photons. Thermodynamically demanding photocatalytic reductive dehalogenations and reductive C&#8722;O bond cleavage reactions of lignin model compounds have been performed using sodium dithionite acts as a reductant, either in aqueous solution or in biphasic water&#8211;acetonitrile mixtures in the presence of a phase transfer reagent. Our work illustrates the concept of multi&#8208;electron reduction of a photocatalyst by a sacrificial reagent prior to irradiation with low&#8208;energy photons as a means of generating very reactive excited states.

On contrary, isospecific polymerization of polar styrenes has&#160;remained less explored, which needs to break the dilemma of high selectivity and activity of the involved catalysts. Herein, we present new racemic ansa&#8208;bis(benz[e]indenyl) rare&#8208;earth metal complexes and their high activity and perfect isoselectivity (  mmmm  &gt; 99 %) for the polymerization of unmasked polar styrenes without any activators. Moreover, the copolymerizations of  para  /  meta  &#8208;methoxystyrenes with styrene give gradient and random copolymers, respectively. The insertion rate of polar monomers could be readily tuned in the range of 0&#8208;100 mol % by changing their loading ratios.

         <title>Regeneration of Phytochemicals by Structure&#8208;Driven Organization of Microbial Biosynthetic Steps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Medicinal phytochemicals, such as artemisinin and taxol, have impacted the world, and hypericin might do so if its availability issue could be addressed. Hypericin is the hallmark component of Saint John&#8217;s wort (  Hypericum perforatum  L.), an approved depression alleviator documented in the US, European, and British pharmacopoeias with its additional effectiveness against diverse cancers and viruses. However, the academia&#8208;to&#8208;industry transition of hypericin remain hampered by its low  in planta  abundance, unfeasible bulk chemical synthesis, and unclear biosynthetic mechanism. Here, we present a strategy consisting of the hypericin&#8208;structure&#8208;centered modification and reorganization of microbial biosynthetic steps in the repurposed cells that have been repurposed to enable the designed consecutive reactions to afford hypericin (43.1 mg/L), without acquiring its biosynthetic knowledge in native plants. The study provides a synthetic biology route to hypericin and establishes a platform for biosustainable access to medicinal phytochemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted CO2 Hydrogenation over Pd3Cu@UiO&#8208;66 Promoted by Active Sites in Close Proximity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol has attracted great interest while suffering from low conversion and high energy input.  Herein, tiny Pd  3  Cu nanoparticles are confined into a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66, to afford Pd  3  Cu@UiO&#8208;66 for CO  2  hydrogenation. Remarkably, it achieves a methanol production rate of 340 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  at 200 &#176;C and 1.25 MPa under light irradiation, far surpassing that in the dark. The photo&#8208;generated electron transfer from the MOF to antibonding orbitals of CO  2  * promotes CO  2  activation and HCOO* formation. In addition, the Pd  3  Cu microenvironment plays a critical role in CO  2  hydrogenation. In contrast to the MOF&#8208;supported Pd  3  Cu (Pd  3  Cu/UiO&#8208;66), the Pd  3  Cu@UiO&#8208;66 exhibits a much higher methanol production rate due to the close proximity between CO  2  and H  2  activation sites, which greatly facilitates their interaction and conversion. This work provides a new avenue to the integration of solar and thermal energy for efficient CO  2  hydrogenation under moderate conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Upgrading Carbonate Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;stable Practical Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>LiNO  3  is a widely used salt&#8208;additive that markedly improves the stability of ether&#8208;based electrolytes at a Li metal anode but is generally regarded as incompatible with alkyl carbonates. Here we find that contrary to common wisdom, cyclic carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate can dissolve up to 0.7 M LiNO  3  without any additives, largely improving the anode reversibility.    We demonstrate the effect by upgrading various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbonate electrolytes with LiNO  3  , which provides large improvements in batteries composed of thin lithium (50 &#956;m) anode and high voltage cathodes.  Capacity retentions of 90.5% after 600 cycles and 92.5% after 200  cycles  are reported for LiNi  0.6  Mn  0.2  Co  0.2  O  2  (2 mAh/cm  2  , 0.5 C) and LiNi  0.8  Mn  0.1  Co  0.1  O  2  cathode (4 mAh/cm  2  , 0.2 C), respectively. 1 Ah pouch cells (~300 Wh/kg) retain more than 87.9 % after 100 cycles at 0.5 C. This work illustrates that reforming traditional carbonate electrolytes provides a scalable, cost&#8208;effective approach towards practical LMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Deposition of a Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanorod Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Film with Efficient Charge and Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical deposition has emerged as an efficient technique for preparing conjugated polymer films on electrodes. However, this method encounters difficulties in synthesizing crystalline products and controlling their orientation on electrodes. Here we report electrochemical film deposition of a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The film is composed of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods, in which the molecules adopt a cofacial stacking arrangement along the &#960;&#8208;&#960; direction. Film thickness and crystal size can be controlled by electrochemical conditions such as scan rate and electrolyte species, while the choice of anode material determines crystal orientation. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both free carriers and excitons: the free carrier mobility reaches over 30 cm  2  V  &#8211;1  s  &#8211;1  , whereas the excitons are delocalized with a low binding energy of 118.5 meV and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45 nm.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid ultramicroporous materials, HUMs, are comprised of metal cations linked by combinations of inorganic and organic ligands. Their modular nature makes them amenable to crystal engineering studies, which have thus far afforded four HUM platforms (as classified by the inorganic linkers).

         <title>Transformation of Crowded Oligoarylene into Perylene&#8208;Cored Chiral Nanographene by Sequential Oxidative Cyclization and 1,2&#8208;Phenyl Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene processively transforms into &#960;&#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with two helical breaches under Scholl's conditions. The acquisition of various intermediates implies a distinctive reaction pathway mainly involving the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the peri&#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration.







Abstract
Synthetic innovation for constructing sophisticated nanographenes is of fundamental significance for a variety of advanced applications. Herein, we report a distinctive method to prepare &#960;&#8208;extended chiral nanographenes with 29 benzenoid rings and two helical breaches from a highly crowded perylene&#8208;cored oligoarylene precursor. Under Scholl's conditions, the reaction predominantly involves the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the peri&#8208; and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1&#8208;phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2&#8208;phenyl migration. The resulting chiral nanographenes are configurationally stable at 180&#8201;&#176;C due to the high diastereomerization barriers of ca. 45&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. These molecules also possess globally delocalized &#960;&#8208;systems with low HOMO/LUMO gaps, leading to nearly panchromatic absorption, intensive electronic circular dichroism signals and deep&#8208;red circularly polarized luminescence.

&lt;p&gt;A highly crowded perylene-cored oligoarylene processively transforms into &#960;-extended chiral nanographenes with two helical breaches under Scholl's conditions. The acquisition of various intermediates implies a distinctive reaction pathway mainly involving the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;- and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1-phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2-phenyl migration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic innovation for constructing sophisticated nanographenes is of fundamental significance for a variety of advanced applications. Herein, we report a distinctive method to prepare &#960;-extended chiral nanographenes with 29 benzenoid rings and two helical breaches from a highly crowded perylene-cored oligoarylene precursor. Under Scholl's conditions, the reaction predominantly involves the regioselective and sequential cyclization in the &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt;- and bay regions of the perylene core, and the complanation of the 1-phenyl[5]helicene intermediate module via 1,2-phenyl migration. The resulting chiral nanographenes are configurationally stable at 180&#8201;&#176;C due to the high diastereomerization barriers of ca. 45&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These molecules also possess globally delocalized &#960;-systems with low HOMO/LUMO gaps, leading to nearly panchromatic absorption, intensive electronic circular dichroism signals and deep-red circularly polarized luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Desaturative &#946;&#8208;Acylation of Cyclic N&#8208;Aryl Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and simple method of electrochemical desaturative &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of cyclic N&#8208;aryl amines has been developed to access the desired &#946;&#8208;substituted enamines with excellent levels of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity under mild conditions. This procedure proved to be a powerful route to the late&#8208;stage modification of natural products and derivatives.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose a straightforward, robust, and simple route to access &#946;&#8208;substituted desaturated cyclic amines via an electrochemically driven desaturative &#946;&#8208;functionalization of cyclic amines. This transformation is based on multiple single&#8208;electron oxidation processes using catalytic amounts of ferrocene. The reaction proceeds in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of electrolyte under mild conditions, affording the desired products with high chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction was tolerant of a broad range of substrates and also enables late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H acylation of potentially valuable products. Preliminary mechanistic studies using cyclic voltammetry reveal the key role of ferrocene as a redox mediator in the reaction.

         <title>Biosynthesis of Gut&#8208;Microbiota&#8208;Derived Lantibiotics Reveals a Subgroup of S8 Family Proteases for Class III Leader Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of rat gut&#8208;microbiota&#8208;derived class III lanthipeptides with moderate antimicrobial activities were discovered by genome mining. The investigation of their biosynthesis revealed a subgroup of S8 family serine proteases for the removal of class III leader peptides.







Abstract
Lanthipeptides are a group of ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptides with diverse structural features and bioactivities. Gut&#8208;microbiota&#8208;derived lanthipeptides play important roles in gut homeostasis of the host. Herein, we report the discovery and biosynthesis of class III lantibiotics named amylopeptins, which are derived from the gut microbiota of Sprague&#8208;Dawley rats and display a narrow antimicrobial spectrum. In contrast to known class III lanthipeptides, the biosynthesis of amylopeptins employs AmyP, which belongs to a subgroup of S8 family serine proteases, to remove the leader of corresponding precursor peptides in a site&#8208;specific manner during the last step of their maturation. Overall, this study shows for the first time that S8 family proteases participate in the biosynthesis of class III lanthipeptides.

         <title>A Carbene Strategy for Progressive (Deutero)Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroalkyl Ketones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbene strategy for the sequential (deutero)hydrodefluorination of fluoroalkyl ketones is reported. This method allowed for the controllable preparation of difluoroalkyl&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl ketones from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted perfluoroalkyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Hydrodefluorination is one of the most promising chemical strategies to degrade perfluorochemicals into partially fluorinated compounds. However, controlled progressive hydrodefluorination remains a significant challenge, owing to the decrease in the strength of C&#8722;F bonds along with the defluorination. Here we describe a carbene strategy for the sequential (deutero)hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl ketones under rhodium catalysis, allowing for the controllable preparation of difluoroalkyl&#8208; and monofluoroalkyl ketones from aryl&#8208; and even alkyl&#8208;substituted perfluoro&#8208;alkyl ketones in high yield with excellent functional group tolerance. The reaction mechanism and the origin of the intriguing chemoselectivity of the reaction were rationalized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Unexpected Role of a Short&#8208;Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Family Protein in Type II Polyketide Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family protein, MrqM, was revealed as a cyclase in the biosynthesis of murayaquinone by the in vivo genetic experiment, which is a new strategy used in type II polyketide cyclization. This finding not only broadens the functions of the short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins, but also paves the way for future work in polyketide cyclization and engineering.







Abstract
We investigated the biosynthetic pathway of type II polyketide murayaquinone. The murayaquinone biosynthetic cluster contains genes for three putative short&#8208;chain dehydrogenase/reductase family enzymes including MrqF and MrqH with known functions and MrqM with unclear function. We report the functional characterization of MrqM for its role in murayaquinone biosynthesis. Our gene deletion experiment and structural elucidation of the accumulated intermediates revealed that MrqM is related with the second polyketide ring cyclization, because the inactivation of mrqM resulted in the accumulation of an off&#8208;pathway intermediate SEK43 and disrupted the second and third ring cyclization. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies showed that two conserved residues in MrqM and homologous proteins Y151 and K155 are essential for its activity. The previously proposed second/third ring cyclase, MrqD, might instead play another important role in the chain releasing step of the murayaquinone biosynthesis.

         <title>M&#246;bius ZnII&#8208;Hexaphyrins Bearing a Chiral Coordinating Arm: A Chiroptical Switch Featuring P/M Twist Inversion Controlled by Achiral Effectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How far can the dynamic chirality of M&#246;bius hexaphyrins be controlled lies firstly on the capacity of an attached source of chirality to explore the M&#246;bius ring environment, which depends on several convoluted dynamic processes; secondly on the responsiveness of the system, making this exploration tunable and multi&#8208;reversible; and thirdly on the unwavering optimism of the experimenter.







Abstract
By their conformational flexibility, M&#246;bius aromatic hexaphyrins provide a dynamic chirality attractive to develop stimuli responsive systems such as chiroptical switches. A regular [28]hexaphyrin has been equipped with a chiral coordinating arm to achieve transfer of chirality from a fix stereogenic element to the dynamic M&#246;bius one. The arm allows straightforward formation of labile monometallic ZnII complexes with an exogenous ligand, either a carboxylato or an amino with opposite inwards/outwards orientations relative to the M&#246;bius ring. As a corollary, the chiral coordinating arm is constrained over the ring or laterally, inducing opposite P and M M&#246;bius configurations with unprecedented high stereoselectivity (diast. excess greater than 95&#8201;%). By tuning the transfer of chirality, these achiral effectors generate electronic circular dichroism spectra with bisignate Cotton effect of opposite signs. Switching between distinct chiroptical states was ultimately achieved in mild conditions owing to ligand exchange, with high robustness (10 cycles).

As a corollary, the chiral coordinating arm is constrained over the ring or laterally, inducing opposite P and M M&#246;bius configurations with unprecedented high stereoselectivity (diast. excess greater than 95&#8201;%). By tuning the transfer of chirality, these achiral effectors generate electronic circular dichroism spectra with bisignate Cotton effect of opposite signs. Switching between distinct chiroptical states was ultimately achieved in mild conditions owing to ligand exchange, with high robustness (10 cycles).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Development of a Bioorthogonal, Visualizable and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reported herein is a triple&#8208;functional H2S delivery system, which is triggered by the bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction between a newly designed diphenylamino&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) and a strained alkyne. This COS&#8208;based H2S release platform can realize in&#8208;mitochondria H2S release in a controllable manner, and provide a concomitant fluorescence for spatiotemporal feedback of the exogenous H2S in cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an important endogenous gasotransmitter, but the targeted delivery and real&#8208;time feedback of exogenous H2S are still challenging. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we designed a new 1,3&#8208;dithiolium&#8208;4&#8208;olate (DTO) compound, which can react with a strained alkyne via the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition and the retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder reaction to generate carbonyl sulfide (COS) as the precursor of H2S, and a thiophene derivative with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Moreover, the diphenylamino substituent in DTO greatly increases the mitochondrial targeting of this H2S delivery system. Such a bioorthogonal click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction has integrated three functions in one system for the first time: (1)&#8197;in situ controllable H2S release, (2)&#8197;concomitant fluorescence response, and (3)&#8197;mitochondria&#8208;targeted delivery. In addition, we investigated the mitochondrial membrane potential loss alleviation by using this system in H9c2 cells under oxidative stress.

         <title>Rapid, Ordered Polymerization of Crystalline Semiconducting Covalent Triazine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid synthesis of crystalline semiconducting covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) through a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ordered polymerization mechanism is demonstrated by Yuxi Xu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202113926). Increasing the crystallinity of CTFs can significantly facilitate the photogenerated carrier transport and improve the photocatalytic activity. Single&#8208;layer/few&#8208;layer 2D triazine polymer nanosheets can be further obtained by ball&#8208;milling exfoliation of the bulk CTFs and exhibit superior photocatalytic performance.

         <dc:description>
Amides are ubiquitous in biological and medicinal chemistry. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202112668), Jiannan Zhao et&#8197;al. report an &#8220;oxidation&#8212;reduction condensation&#8221; reaction through the use of PPh3 as organic reductant. Synergistic cooperation between a Co(III) and a Ir(III) photoredox catalyst captures electrons from phosphorus and facilitates the formation of acyloxyphosphonium species, which enable direct amidation. The synthetic utility of this photocatalytic method is highlighted by rapid gram&#8208;scale peptide synthesis and successful assembly of a tetrapeptide through SPPS.

         <title>Programmable Transient Supramolecular Chiral G&#8208;quadruplex Hydrogels via a Chemically Fueled Non&#8208;Equilibrium Self&#8208;assembly Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The temporal and spatial control of natural systems has aroused great interest in the creation of synthetic mimics. Operating with boronic ester&#8208;based dynamic covalent chemistry and coupling it with an internal pH feedback system, herein, we developed a new chemically fueled reaction network to design non&#8208;equilibrium supramolecular chiral G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogels with programmable lifetime from minutes, to hours, to days, as well as high transparency and conductivity, excellent injectability and rapid self&#8208;healability. The cycle system can be controlled  via  in&#8208;situ  kinetically&#8208;controlled formation and dissociation of dynamic boronic ester bonds between cis&#8208;diols of guanosine (G) and 5&#8208;fluorobenzoxaborole (B) under chemical fuels (KOH and 1,3&#8208;propanesultone), leading to the formation of a precipitate&#8208;solution&#8208;gel&#8208;precipitate cycle under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach revealed that the underlying mechanism of the non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly involves aggregation and disaggregation of right&#8208;handed helical G&#8208;quadruplex superstructure. With consecutive cycles of fuel addition, the non&#8208;equilibrium system can be easily refueled at least 6 cycles without obvious loss in the rheological moduli of the transient hydrogels. The proposed dynamic boronic ester&#8208;based non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;assembly strategy offers a new option to design next&#8208;generation adaptive and interactive smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Smart Nano&#8208;PROTACs Reprogram Tumor Microenvironment for Activatable Photo&#8208;metabolic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) has been one of the major hurdles to cancer immunotherapy. Protease inhibitors have emerged to be a potential way to modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram TME, which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off&#8208;targeted side effects. We herein report smart nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer&#8208;specific protein degradation to reprogram TEM for photo&#8208;metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano&#8208;PROTAC (SPNCOX) has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX&#8208;1/2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) brushes via a cathepsin B (CatB)&#8208;cleavable segment. In the presence of the tumor&#8208;overexpressed CatB, CPP can be specifically activated to induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent and effective degradation of COX&#8208;1/2 depletes their metabolite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which is an immunosuppressive regulator responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Additionally, SPNCOX&#8208;mediated phototherapy improves tumor immunogenicity via inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Such a smart PROTAC strategy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity, which consequently inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Thus, this study contributes to advancing PROTACs in cancer immunotherapy.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) has been one of the major hurdles to cancer immunotherapy. Protease inhibitors have emerged to be a potential way to modulate intratumoral metabolic processes to reprogram TME, which however suffer from the limited efficacy and off-targeted side effects. We herein report smart nano-proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano-PROTACs) with phototherapeutic ablation and cancer-specific protein degradation to reprogram TEM for photo-metabolic cancer immunotherapy. This nano-PROTAC (SPNCOX) has a semiconducting polymer backbone linked with cyclooxygenase 1/2 (COX-1/2)-targeting PROTAC peptide (CPP) brushes via a cathepsin B (CatB)-cleavable segment. In the presence of the tumor-overexpressed CatB, CPP can be specifically activated to induce targeted intratumoral degradation of COX-1/2 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The persistent and effective degradation of COX-1/2 depletes their metabolite, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) which is an immunosuppressive regulator responsible for activation of immune suppressor cells. Additionally, SPNCOX-mediated phototherapy improves tumor immunogenicity via inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD). Such a smart PROTAC strategy specifically reprograms the immunosuppressive TME and reinvigorates antitumor immunity, which consequently inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Thus, this study contributes to advancing PROTACs in cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Observation of Ultrafast Proton Rocking in the BLUF Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present direct observation of ultrafast proton rocking in the central motif of a BLUF domain protein scaffold. The mutant design has taken considerations of modulating the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) driving forces by replacing Tyr in the original motif with Trp, as well as of removing the interference of a competing electron transfer pathway. Using femtosecond pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and detailed kinetics analysis, we resolved an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;coupled Grotthuss&#8208;type forward and reversed proton rocking along the FMN&#8208;Gln&#8208;Trp proton relay chain. The rates of forward and reversed proton transfer are determined to be very close, namely 51 ps vs 52 ps. The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) constants associated with the forward and reversed proton transfer are 3.9 and 5.3, respectively. The observation of ultrafast proton rocking is not only a crucial step towards revealing the nature of proton relay in BLUF domain, but also provides a new paradigm of proton transfer in proteins for theoretical investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>AIE Featured Supramolecular Tubisomes for Imaging&#8208;Guided Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymeric cylinders, a fascinating type of nanostructures with high surface area, internal volume and rigidity, have been exploited as novel drug delivery vehicles over the past decade. However, it&#8217;s still an open challenge to afford cylindrical nanostructures using polymeric building blocks  via  traditional self&#8208;assembly processes. Herein, we report a hierarchical self&#8208;assembly strategy of preparing cylindrical aggregates (tubisomes) from an amphiphilic supramolecular bottlebrush polymer in which cyclic peptide nanotube is employed as the noncovalent backbone. Additionally, aggregation induced emission effect was introduced into the tubisomes to endow them with excellent fluorescent property. Intriguingly, encapsulation of anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) can inactivate the fluorescence of both tubisome and DOX due to the energy transfer relay (ETR). The release of DOX can interrupt the ETR effect and light up the silenced fluorescence, thereby permitting the in&#8208;situ visualization of drug release. The supramolecular tubisomes described here paves an alternative way for fabricating polymeric cylindrical nanostructures, and holds great potential in imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS) is an attractive method for the proteome&#8208;wide characterization of protein structures and interactions. Currently, the depth of in vivo XL&#8208;MS studies is lagging behind the established applications to cell lysates, because cross&#8208;linking reagents that can penetrate intact cells and strategies to enrich cross&#8208;linked peptides lack in efficiency. To tackle these limitations, we develop a phosphonate&#8208;containing cross&#8208;linker, tBu&#8208;PhoX that efficiently permeates various biological membranes and can be robustly enriched using routine Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity Chromatography. We establish a tBu&#8208;PhoX&#8208;based in vivo XL&#8208;MS pipeline, achieving high cross&#8208;link identification numbers in intact human cells with substantially reduced analysis time. Collectively, the developed cross&#8208;linker and XL&#8208;MS pipeline pave the way for comprehensive XL&#8208;MS characterization of living systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aprotic Li&#8208;O  2  battery has attracted extensive attention in the past decade owing to the high theoretical energy density, however it is obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at cathodes and large voltage hysteresis. Herein, we regulate the spin state of partial Ni  2+  metal centers (  t  2g  6  e  g  2  ) of conductive nickel catecholate framework (Ni  II  &#8208;NCF) nanowire arrays to high&#8208;valence Ni  3+  (  t  2g  6  e  g  1  ) for Ni  III  &#8208;NCF. The spin&#8208;state modulation enables enhanced nickel&#8208;oxygen covalency in Ni  III  &#8208;NCF, which facilitates electron exchange between the Ni sites and oxygen adsorbates and accelerates the oxygen redox kinetics. The high affinity of Ni  3+  sites with the intermediate LiO  2  promotes formation of nanosheet&#8208;like Li  2  O  2  in the void space among Ni  III  &#8208;NCF nanowires upon discharging. These merit the Li&#8208;O  2  battery based on Ni  III  &#8208;NCF with remarkably reduced discharge/charge voltage gaps, superior rate capability, and long cycling stability of over 200 cycles. This work highlights the domination of electron spin state on the redox kinetics and will shed insights into electronic structure regulation of electrocatalysts for Li&#8208;O  2  battery and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimized Synthesis of Solution&#8208;Processable Crystalline Poly(Triazine Imide) with Minimized Defects for OLED Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of low&#8208;energy defects, charge delocalization, and exfoliation on the optical and electronic performance of a layered, metal&#8208;free intercalation compound, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) are reported. Using an adjusted synthetic protocol, the quantum yield and the photocurrent of the semiconducting PTI could be increased. Due to the high quality of the product, structure&#8211;property relationships could be studied and PTI could be integrated in a single&#8208;layer OLED.







Abstract
Poly(triazine imide) (PTI) is a highly crystalline semiconductor, and though no techniques exist that enable synthesis of macroscopic monolayers of PTI, it is possible to study it in thin layer device applications that are compatible with its polycrystalline, nanoscale morphology. We find that the by&#8208;product of conventional PTI synthesis is a C&#8722;C carbon&#8208;rich phase that is detrimental for charge transport and photoluminescence. An optimized synthetic protocol yields a PTI material with an increased quantum yield, enabled photocurrent and electroluminescence. We report that protonation of the PTI structure happens preferentially at the pyridinic N&#8197;atoms of the triazine rings, is accompanied by exfoliation of PTI layers, and contributes to increases in quantum yield and exciton lifetimes. This study describes structure&#8211;property relationships in PTI that link the nature of defects, their formation, and how to avoid them with the optical and electronic performance of PTI. On the basis of our findings, we create an OLED prototype with PTI as the active, metal&#8208;free material.

Their LUMOs are higher in energy and their HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps are significantly larger compared to those of the respective laterally functionalized species. Photooxygenation studies reveal effective singlet oxygen sensitization with a largely reduced tendency for self&#8208;sensitized endoperoxide formation.







Abstract
The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) via B&#8592;N Lewis pair formation offers an opportunity to judiciously fine&#8208;tune the structural features and optoelectronic properties, to suit the demands of applications in organic electronic devices, bioimaging, and as sensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. We demonstrate that the N&#8208;directed electrophilic borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;yl)anthracene offers access to linearly extended acene derivatives Py&#8208;BR (R=Et, Ph, C6F5). In comparison to indeno&#8208;fused 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene, the formal &#8220;BN for CC&#8221; replacement in Py&#8208;BR selectively lowers the LUMO, resulting in a much reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap. An even more extended conjugated system with seven six&#8208;membered rings in a row (Qu&#8208;BEt) is obtained by borylation of 2,6&#8208;di(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)anthracene. Fluorinated Py&#8208;BPf shows particularly advantageous properties, including relatively lower&#8208;lying HOMO and LUMO levels, strong yellow&#8208;green fluorescence, and effective singlet oxygen sensitization, while resisting self&#8208;sensitized conversion to its endoperoxide.

         <title>Trifluoroethanol as a Unique Additive for the Chemoselective Electrooxidation of Enamines to Access Unsymmetrically Substituted NH&#8208;Pyrroles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemoselective electrooxidative heterocoupling of two different enamines is reported for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles. A &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol is utilized to achieve the desired chemoselectivity by tuning the oxidation potentials and controlling the activation energy of the rate&#8208;determining step.







Abstract
An electrochemical method for the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted NH&#8208;pyrroles is described. The synthetic strategy comprises a challenging heterocoupling between two structurally diverse enamines via sequential chemoselective oxidation, addition, and cyclization processes. A series of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted enamines were effectively cross&#8208;coupled from an equimolar mixture to synthesize various unsymmetrical pyrrole derivatives up to 84&#8201;% yield. The desired cross&#8208;coupling was achieved by tuning the oxidation potential of the enamines by utilizing a &#8220;magic effect&#8221; of the additive trifluoroethanol (TFE). Additionally, extensive computational studies reveal the unique role of TFE in promoting the heterocoupling process by regulating the activation energies of the reaction steps through H&#8208;bonding and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. Importantly, the developed electrochemical protocol was found to be equally efficient for the homocoupling of enamines to form symmetric pyrroles up to 92&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Modification of Multi&#8208;Component Building Blocks for Assembling Giant Chiral Lanthanide&#8211;Titanium Molecular Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Building blocks with multiple components are promising for the synthesis of complex molecular assemblies, but are rarely available. Herein, we report a modification procedure for a multicomponent building block [Ln3Ti(HSA)6(SA)4(H2O)]&#8722; ({Ln3Ti&#8208;SA}, H2SA = salicylic acid, Ln = Eu/Gd) to form new building blocks {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} (H2MSA = 5&#8208;Methoxysalicylic acid, x = 1, 2, 3) by constructing [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8208; units. The obtained {Ln3Tix&#8208;MSA} can further assemble into a chiral Ln22Ti14 ring with the formulae [Eu22Ti14(MSA)48(HMSA)22(CH3COO)4(H2O)10(iPrOH)] and [Gd22Ti14(MSA)46(HMSA)26(CH3COO)4(H2O)8]. Parallel experiments without Ti4+ result in linear Ln chains. Detailed analysis shows that the [Ti(MSA)4]4&#8208; unit makes the originally variable Ln chain become available building blocks and the modified [Ti(MSA)3]2&#8208; further triggers interesting chiral&#8208;sorting behavior. Finally, the electronic adsorption and magneto&#8208;optic responses of these molecular rings are investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Lactone Backbone Density in Rigid Electron&#8208;Deficient Semiconducting Polymers Enabling High n&#8208;type Organic Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three new n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers, P&#8208;0, P&#8208;50, and P&#8208;75 are developed, in which the lactone group density were maximized by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75), to enable co&#8208;planar polymers with deep&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. As a result, the polymer of P&#8208;75 exhibits a good thermoelectric performance with a maximum electrical conductivity of 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8208;1 and Figure of merit power factor of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8208;1&#8197;K&#8208;2.







Abstract
Three lactone&#8208;based rigid semiconducting polymers were designed to overcome major limitations in the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics, namely electrical conductivity and air stability. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrated that increasing the lactone group density by increasing the benzene content from 0&#8201;% benzene (P&#8208;0), to 50&#8201;% (P&#8208;50), and 75&#8201;% (P&#8208;75) resulted in progressively larger electron affinities (up to 4.37&#8197;eV), suggesting a more favorable doping process, when employing (N&#8208;DMBI) as the dopant. Larger polaron delocalization was also evident, due to the more planarized conformation, which is proposed to lead to a lower hopping energy barrier. As a consequence, the electrical conductivity increased by three orders of magnitude, to achieve values of up to 12&#8197;S&#8201;cm and Power factors of 13.2 &#956;Wm&#8722;1&#8197;K&#8722;2 were thereby enabled. These findings present new insights into material design guidelines for the future development of air stable n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <title>Imparting CO2 Electroreduction Auxiliary for Integrated Morphology Tuning and Performance Boosting in a Porphyrin&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and the obtained materials can be applied in highly selective CO2 electroreduction into CH4.







Abstract
Strategies that enable simultaneous morphology&#8208;tuning and electroreduction performance boosting are much desired for the exploration of covalent organic frameworks in efficient CO2 electroreduction. Herein, a kind of functionalizing exfoliation agent has been selected to simultaneously modify and exfoliate bulk COFs into functional nanosheets and investigate their CO2 electroreduction performance. The obtained nanosheets (Cu&#8722;Tph&#8722;COF&#8722;Dct) with large&#8208;scale (&#8776;1.0&#8197;&#956;m) and ultrathin (&#8776;3.8&#8197;nm) morphology enable a superior FECH4 (&#8776;80&#8201;%) (almost doubly enhanced than bare COF) with large current&#8208;density (&#8722;220.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V. The boosted performance can be ascribed to the immobilized functionalizing exfoliation agent (Dct groups) with integrated amino and triazine groups that strengthen CO2 absorption/activation, stabilize intermediates and enrich the CO concentration around the Cu active sites as revealed by DFT calculations. The point&#8208;to&#8208;point functionalization strategy for modularly assembling Dct&#8208;functionalized COF catalyst for CO2 electroreduction will open up the attractive possibility of developing COFs as efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.

The point-to-point functionalization strategy for modularly assembling Dct-functionalized COF catalyst for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction will open up the attractive possibility of developing COFs as efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparing Two&#8208;Dimensional Ordered Li0.33La0.557TiO3 Crystal in Interlayer Channel of Thin Laminar Inorganic Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte towards Ultrafast Li+ Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>
2D LLTO crystal with large&#8208;size, oriented, and crystal defect&#8208;free structure was obtained by controlling the LLTO crystal growth and arrangement in the confined space of 2D laminar channels, which achieved faster Li+ transfer than LLTO Pellet.







Abstract
Inorganic superionic conductor holds great promise for high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, the ionic conductivity of traditional inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) is always unsatisfactory owing to the grain boundary resistance and large thickness. Here, a 13&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick laminar framework with &#8776;1.3&#8197;nm interlayer channels is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling rigid, hydrophilic vermiculite (Vr) nanosheets. Then, Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) precursors are impregnated in interlayer channels and afterwards in situ sintered to large&#8208;size, oriented, and defect&#8208;free LLTO crystal. We demonstrate that the confinement effect permits ordered arrangement of LLTO crystal along the c&#8208;axis (the fastest Li+ transfer direction), permitting the resultant 15&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;thick Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte an ionic conductivity of 8.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and conductance of 87.2&#8197;mS at 30&#8201;&#176;C. These values are several times&#8217; higher than that of traditional LLTO&#8208;based electrolytes. Moreover, Vr&#8208;LLTO electrolyte has a compressive modulus of 1.24&#8197;GPa. Excellent cycling performance is demonstrated with all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li/LiFePO4 battery.

         <title>Oriented Two&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with High Ion Flux and Smart Gating Nanofluidic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework membranes that offer vertically aligned nanofluidic channel arrays, leading to an ultrahigh ion flux and pH&#8208;gating nanofluidic transport.







Abstract
Nanofluidic ion transport holds high promise in bio&#8208;sensing and energy conversion applications. However, smart nanofluidic devices with high ion flux and modulable ion transport capabilities remain to be realised. Herein, we demonstrate smart nanofluidic devices based on oriented two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (2D COF) membranes with vertically aligned nanochannel arrays that achieved a 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude higher ion flux compared with that of conventional single&#8208;channel nanofluidic devices. The surface&#8208;charge&#8208;governed ion conductance is dominant for electrolyte concentration up to 0.01&#8197;M. Moreover, owing to the customisable pH&#8208;responsivity of imine and phenol hydroxyl groups, the COF&#8208;DT membranes attained an actively modulable ion transport with a high pH&#8208;gating on/off ratio of &#8776;100. The customisable structure and rich chemistry of COF materials will offer a promising platform for manufacturing nanofluidic devices with modifiable ion/molecular transport features.

         <title>Zinc Containing Small&#8208;Pore Zeolites for Capture of Low Concentration Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low concentration CO2 is adsorbed in zinc containing CHA&#8208;type zeolites with a high capacity of 0.67&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite. The materials exhibit higher CO2 capacity, faster kinetics, lower desorption energy than low&#8208;silica 13X zeolites. Zeolite framework and the states and locations of zinc ions play crucial roles in the adsorption performance.







Abstract
The capture of low concentration CO2 presents numerous challenges. Here, we report that zinc containing chabazite (CHA) zeolites can realize high capacity, fast adsorption kinetics, and low desorption energy when capturing ca. 400&#8197;ppm CO2. Control of the state and location of the zinc ions in the CHA cage is critical to the performance. Zn2+ loaded onto paired anionic sites in the six&#8208;membered rings (6MRs) in the CHA cage are the primary sites to adsorb ca. 0.51&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=ca. 7, a 17&#8208;fold increase compared to the parent H&#8208;form. The capacity is increased further to ca. 0.67&#8197;mmol CO2/g&#8208;zeolite with Si/Al=ca. 2 due to more paired sites for zinc exchange. Zeolites with double six&#8208;membered rings (D6MRs) that orient 6MRs into the cages give enhanced uptakes for CO2 adsorption with zinc exchange. The results reveal that zinc exchanged CHA and several other small pore, cage containing zeolites merit further investigation for the capture of low concentration CO2.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Embedded Approach to Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Isoelectronic Structures for Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was synthesized by condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde derivative, which was readily converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacing oxonium with nitrogen atoms under the treatment of ammonia.







Abstract
Embedding heteroatoms into the main backbones of polymeric materials has become an efficient tool for tailoring their structures and improving their properties. However, owing to comparatively harsh heteroatom&#8208;doping conditions, this has rarely been explored in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, upon aldol condensation of a trimethyl&#8208;substituted pyrylium salt with a tritopic aromatic aldehyde, a two&#8208;dimensional oxonium&#8208;embedded COF with vinylene linkages was achieved, which was further converted to a neutral pyridine&#8208;cored COF by in situ replacement of oxonium ions with nitrogen atoms under ammonia treatment. The two heteroatom&#8208;embedded COFs are conceptually isoelectronic with each other, featuring similar geometric structures but different electronic structures, rendering them capable of catalyzing the visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component synthesis of tri&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives with good recyclability.

A metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer (1&#8835;2) for in vivo image&#8208;guided photodynamic inactivation of bacteria. Through host&#8208;guest interaction, the assembly 1&#8835;2, with improved fluorescence signals and ROS production capabilities, is employed for in vivo fluorescence tracking as well as accurate image&#8208;guided treatment of S. aureus infection without minimal side effects.







Abstract
Bacterial infection is one of the greatest threats to public health. In vivo real&#8208;time monitoring and effective treatment of infected sites through non&#8208;invasive techniques, remain a challenge. Herein, we designed a PtII metallacycle&#8208;based supramolecular photosensitizer through the host&#8208;guest interaction between a pillar[5]arene&#8208;modified metallacycle and 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;4&#8208;[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)styryl]pyridinium. Leveraging the aggregation&#8208;induced emission supramolecular photosensitizer, we improved fluorescence performance and antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation. In vivo studies revealed that it displayed precise fluorescence tracking of S. aureus&#8208;infected sites, and in situ performed image&#8208;guided efficient PDI of S. aureus without noticeable side effects. These results demonstrated that metallacycle combined with host&#8208;guest chemistry could provide a paradigm for the development of powerful photosensitizers for biomedicine.

         <title>Assembly of Hexagonal Column Interpenetrated Spheres from Plant Polyphenol/Cationic Surfactants and Their Application as Antimicrobial Molecular Banks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lasting and broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial agents with the special structure of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are constructed through non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid and quaternary ammonium surfactants. HCISs possess high substrate&#8208;adhesion on various substrates and high anti&#8208;water washing property, and can continuously provide antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, avoiding one&#8208;time burst release of antimicrobial units.







Abstract
Microbial infections have become a great threat to human health and one of the main risks arises from direct contact with the surfaces contaminated by pathogenic microbes. Herein, a kind of hexagonal column interpenetrated spheres (HCISs) are fabricated by non&#8208;covalent assembly of plant gallic acid with quaternary ammonium surfactants. Different from one&#8208;time burst release of conventional antimicrobial agents, the HCIS acts like a &#8220;antimicrobial molecular bank&#8221; and releases the antimicrobial ingredients in a multistage way, leading to long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial performance. Taking advantage of strong hydrophobicity and adhesion, HCISs are applicable to various substrates and endowed with anti&#8208;water washing property, thus showing high in vitro antimicrobial efficiency (&gt;99&#8201;%) even after being used for 10 cycles. Meanwhile, HCISs exhibit broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, and have good biocompatibility with mammalian cells. Such a low&#8208;cost and portable long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent meets the growing anti&#8208;infection demand in public spaces.

         <title>Unexpectedly High Capacitance of the Metal Nanoparticle/Water Interface: Molecular&#8208;Level Insights into the Electrical Double Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry revealed an anomalously high capacitance for Pt nanoparticles and to a lower extent for Au nanoparticles at potentials more negative than their potential of zero charge. MD calculations showed that the strong interaction of metal with water molecules leads to water chemisorption and accumulation of ions in the Helmholtz layer beyond expectation, resulting in a higher interface charge storage ability.







Abstract
The electrical double&#8208;layer plays a key role in important interfacial electrochemical processes from catalysis to energy storage and corrosion. Therefore, understanding its structure is crucial for the progress of sustainable technologies. We extract new physico&#8208;chemical information on the capacitance and structure of the electrical double&#8208;layer of platinum and gold nanoparticles at the molecular level, employing single nanoparticle electrochemistry. The charge storage ability of the solid/liquid interface is larger by one order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude than predicted by the traditional mean&#8208;field models of the double&#8208;layer such as the Gouy&#8211;Chapman&#8211;Stern model. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the possible relationship between the measured high capacitance and adsorption strength of the water adlayer formed at the metal surface. These insights may launch the active tuning of solid&#8211;solvent and solvent&#8211;solvent interactions as an innovative design strategy to transform energy technologies towards superior performance and sustainability.

         <title>Unraveling the Electrical and Magnetic Properties of Layered Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Framework With Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unambiguous structural elucidation using microcrystal electron diffraction provides insight into unique properties of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Cu3(C6O6)2. The presence of strong interlayer electronic coupling exerts a profound effect on the electrical and magnetic properties of the MOF.







Abstract
This paper describes structural elucidation of a layered conductive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) material Cu3(C6O6)2 by microcrystal electron diffraction with sub&#8208;angstrom precision. This insight enables the first identification of an unusual &#960;&#8208;stacking interaction in a layered MOF material characterized by an extremely short (2.73&#8197;&#197;) close packing of the ligand arising from pancake bonding and ordered water clusters within pores. Band structure analysis suggests semiconductive properties of the MOF, which are likely related to the localized nature of pancake bonds and the formation of a singlet dimer of the ligand. The spin of CuII within the Kagom&#233; arrangement dominates the paramagnetism of the MOF, leading to strong geometrical magnetic frustration.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for In Vivo Real&#8208;Time Imaging of Hydrogen Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To reveal the biomedical effects and mechanisms of hydrogen molecules urgently needs hydrogen molecular imaging probes as an imperative tool, but the development of these probes is extremely challenging. In this work, a catalytic hydrogenation strategy is proposed to design and synthesize a ratiometric fluorescent probe by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles and conjugating azido&#8208;/coumarin&#8208;modified fluorophore into mesoporous silica nanoparticles, realizing in vitro and in vivo fluorescence imaging of hydrogen molecules. The developed hydrogen probe exhibits high sensitivity, rapid responsivity, high selectivity and low detection limit, enabling rapid and real&#8208;time detection of hydrogen molecules both in cells and in the body of animal and plant. By application of the developed fluorescent probe, we have directly observed superhigh transmembrane and ultrafast transport abilities of hydrogen molecules in cell, animal and plant, and discovered in vivo high diffusion of hydrogen molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Absorbing and Emissive Quadruple Helicene Enabled by the Scholl Reaction of Perylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis, structural analysis, optical and chiroptical properties of a novel quadruple helicene, which has two [6] and two [7]helicene moieties fused in a contorted framework of 92  sp  2  carbon atoms.&#160; It was synthesized by the Scholl reaction of a perylene&#8208;containing substrate with the formation of eight carbon&#8211;carbon bonds on the perylene unit in a single synthetic operation. Chemical oxidation of the quadruple helicene with tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)ammoniumyl hexachloroantimonate resulted in an air&#8208;stable dication, which exhibits the same helicity in its four helicene moieties as unambiguously identified by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The quadruple helicene exhibits unusual near&#8208;infrared absorption and emission with absorption and emission maxima at 848 nm and 977 nm, respectively, and its isolated enantiomers exhibit electronic circular dichroism in the near&#8208;infrared and visible light regions.</dc:description>

         <title>Transforming Rhodamine Dyes for (d)STORM Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy via 1,3&#8208;Disubstituted Imidazolium Substitution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a strategy to optimize the photoswitching behavior of rhodamines for (d)STORM super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By replacing the benzene ring in the rhodamine core with a permanently charged 1,3&#8208;disubstituted imidazolium, the resultant dyes are markedly sensitized toward photoswitching, and exhibit outstanding (d)STORM performance with fast on&#8208;off switching, long&#8208;lasting blinking, and bright single&#8208;molecule emission. We thus attain excellent (d)STORM images under green excitation that are on par with the &#8220;ideal&#8221; red&#8208;excited dyes, including for difficult structures as the mammalian actin cytoskeleton, and demonstrate high&#8208;quality two&#8208;color three&#8208;dimensional (d)STORM.</dc:description>

         <title>Collateral Damage Occurs When Using Photosensitizer Probes to Detect or Modulate Nucleic Acid Modifications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids are chemically modified to fine&#8208;tune their properties for biological function. Chemical tools for selective tagging of base modifications enables new approaches; the photosensitizers riboflavin and anthraquinone were previously proposed to oxidize N6&#8208;methyladenine (m6A) or 5&#8208;methylcytosine (5mdC) selectively. Herein, riboflavin, anthraquinone, or Rose Bengal were allowed to react with the canonical nucleosides dA, dC, dG, and dT, and the modified bases 5mdC, m6A, 8&#8208;oxoguanine (dOG), and 8&#8208;oxoadenine (dOA) to rank their reactivities. The nucleoside studies reveal that dOG is the most reactive and that the native nucleoside dG is higher or similar in reactivity to 5mdC or m6A; competition in both single&#8208; and double&#8208;stranded DNA of dG vs. 5mdC or 6mdA for oxidant confirmed that dG is favorably oxidized. Thus, photosensitizers are promiscuous nucleic acid oxidants with poor chemoselectivity that will negatively impact attempts at targeted oxidation of modified nucleotides in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Polyoxometalate Charge Carriers via Redox&#8208;Driven Nanoconfinement in Single&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation of hybrid redox materials based on polyoxomolybdates encapsulated within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Polyoxomolybdates readily oxidize SWNTs under ambient conditions in solution, and here we study their charge&#8208;transfer interactions with SWNTs to provide a detailed mechanistic insight into the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation of these &#8211; and similar &#8211; nanoclusters. We are able to correlate the relative redox potentials of the encapsulated clusters with the level of SWNT oxidation in the resultant hybrid materials and use this to show that precise redox tuning is a necessary requirement for successful encapsulation. The host&#8208;guest redox materials described here exhibit exceptional electrochemical stability, retaining up to 86% of their charge capacity over 1000 oxidation/reduction cycles despite the typical lability and solution&#8208;phase electrochemical instability of the polyoxomolybdates we have explored. Our findings illustrate the broad applicability of the redox&#8208;driven encapsulation approach to the design and fabrication of tunable, highly conductive, ultra&#8208;stable nanoconfined energy materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Giant Calixarene&#8208;Like Polyoxoniobate Nanocups {Cu12Nb120} and {Cd16Nb128} Built From Mixed Macrocyclic Cluster Motifs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cup&#8208;shaped molecules are of great interest due to their appealing architectures and properties. Compared with widely studied calixarenes, polyoxometalate&#8208;based cup&#8208;shaped molecules currently remain a virgin land waiting for exploration. In this work, we report the first discovery of two giant cup&#8208;shaped inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid polyoxoniobates (PONbs) of {Cu  12  Nb  120  } and {Cd  16  Nb  128  } . The former integrates three tricyclic Nb  24  clusters and a hexacyclic Nb  48  cluster into a cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a Cu  12  metallacalixarene, while the latter unifies two tricyclic Nb  24  clusters and a brand&#8208;new pentacyclic Nb  40  cluster into another cup&#8208;shaped molecule via a hybrid Cd  16  unit. With 132 and 144 metal centers, {Cu  12  Nb  120  } and {Cd  16  Nb  128  } show the largest two inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid PONb s known to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Aquimarins, Peptide Antibiotics with Amino&#8208;Modified C&#8208;Termini from a Sponge&#8208;Derived Aquimarina sp. Bacterium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Genome mining and bioactivity studies suggested the sponge&#8208;derived bacterium  Aquimarina  sp. Aq135 as a producer of new antibiotics. Activity&#8208;guided isolation identified antibacterial peptides, named aquimarins, featuring a new scaffold with an unusual C&#8208;terminal amino group and chlorine moieties. Responsible for the halogenation is the Fe(II)/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate&#8208;dependent chlorinase AqmA that halogenates up to two isoleucine residues in a carrier protein&#8208;dependent fashion. Total syntheses of two natural aquimarins and eight non&#8208;natural variants were developed. Structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies with these compounds showed that the synthetically more laborious chlorinations are not required for antibacterial activity but enhance cytotoxicity. In contrast, variants lacking the C&#8208;terminal amine were virtually inactive, suggesting diamines similar to the terminal aquimarine residue as candidate building blocks for new peptidomimetic antibiotics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Surface modification induced core size/structure change is a recent discovery in inorganic nanoparticles research, and has rarely been revealed at the molecular level. Here, we exemplify with atomically precise Au nanoclusters (NCs) that proper surface modification can selectively stabilize desired Au(0) core, conducive to the formation of size/structure&#8208;controlled Au NCs. Leveraging on &#960;&#8208;&#960; enhanced ion&#8208;pairing interactions, ionic liquid (IL) cations are bonded to Au(I)&#8208;thiolate complexes. The hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophobic interactions between IL cations subsequently provide a good mechanism to prolong the size of the Au(I)&#8208;thiolate complexes, selectively producing small&#8208;sized Au NCs upon reduction. Through combined control over the structure and concentration of IL cations, pH and solvent polarity, we are able to produce atomically precise Au NCs with customizable size, atomic packing structure, and surface chemistry. This work also provides a facile means to integrate/synergize the materials functionalities of Au NCs and ILs, increasing their acceptance in diverse fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Configurationally Chiral SuFEx&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel methods to make synthetic chiral polymers are highly desirable given their potential in a rapidly increasing number of bio&#8208;inspired applications. The enantiospecific sulfur&#8208;fluorine exchange (SuFEx) reaction of chiral di&#8208;sulfonimidoyl fluorides (di&#8208;SFs) with diphenols, was used to produce high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight chiral polymers with configurational backbone chirality. The resulting new class of polymers, polysulfonimidates, can be efficiently produced  via  this step&#8208;growth mechanism for a wide range of di&#8208;SFs and diphenols, yielding  M  n  PS  up to 283 kDa with typical dispersity  &#272;  around 1.6. The optical activity of the resulting chiral polymers is largely due to the intrinsic asymmetry of the S atoms (configurational chirality). Finally, the enantiospecificity (  ee  &gt; 98%) of the polymerization reaction was demonstrated by the degradation of a disulfide&#8208;containing polysulfonimidate. This novel route towards configurational main&#8208;chain chirality opens up new approaches towards tailor&#8208;made chiral polymers with precisely defined properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Core&#8208;Shell Structured Upconversion / Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanoparticles for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In view of their excellent luminescence properties, nanocrystalline metal halide perovskites have diverse optoelectronic applications, including those related to anticounterfeiting. However, high&#8208;quality optical anticounterfeiting typically requires multiple encryptions relying on several optical modes to ensure information security. Herein, an efficient anticounterfeiting strategy based on dual optical encryption is realized by combining up&#8208; and downconversion luminescence in a nanocomposite with a NaYF  4  :Er  3+  ,Yb  3+  as core and a CsMnCl  3  as shell. The emission color of this nanocomposite depends on the penetration depth of incident radiation and can be changed by varying the excitation source (980 nm laser or UV light) to produce different luminescent patterns. This feature allows one to effectively improve the anticounterfeiting index and fabricate professional anticounterfeiting materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Active Centers Bridged by Oxygen Vacancies of Ru Single Atoms Hybrids Supported on Molybdenum Oxide for Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH  3  ) holds significant potential compared with the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, the reported photocatalysts suffered from low efficiency owing to localized electrons deficiency. Here, Ru&#8208;SA (single atoms)/H  x  MoO  3&#8208;y  hybrids with abundant of Mo  n+  (n &lt; 6) species neighboring oxygen vacancies (O  V  ) are synthesized  via  a H&#8208;spillover process. Detailed characterizations demonstrate that Ru&#8208;SA/H  x  MoO  3  y hybrids can quantitatively produce NH  3  from N  2  and H  2  by the synergetic effect of dual active centers (Ru SA and Mo  n+  ). That is, Ru SA boost the activation and migration of H  2  , and Mo  n+  species act as the trapping sites of localized electrons and the adsorption and dissociation sites of N  2  , finally leading to NH  3  synthesis on Mo  n+  &#8208;OH. The NH  3  generation rate is as high as 4.0 mmol h  &#8208;1  g  &#8208;1  , accompanied by an apparent quantum efficiency over 6.0% at 650 nm. Our finding may open up a new strategy for acquiring a better NH  3  synthesis approach under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>A Symmetric All&#8208;Organic Proton Battery in Mild Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;organic proton batteries are attracting extensive attention due to their sustainability merits and excellent rate capability. Generally, strong acids (e.g. H  2  SO  4  ) have to be employed as the electrolytes to provide H  +  for all&#8208;organic proton batteries due to the high H  +  intercalation energy barrier. Until now, the design of all&#8208;organic proton batteries in mild electrolytes is still a challenge. Herein, a poly(2, 9&#8208;dihydroquinoxalino[2, 3&#8208;b]phenazine) (PO) molecule was designed and synthesized, where the adjacent C=N groups show two different chemical environment, resulting in two&#8208;step redox reactions. Moreover, the two reactions possess considerable voltage difference because of the large LUMO energy gap between PO and its reduction product. More impressively, the C=N groups endows &#960;&#8208;conjugated PO molecule with H  +  uptake/removal in ZnSO  4  electrolyte. As a result, a symmetric all&#8208;organic proton battery is achieved in mild electrolyte for the first time, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance and also broadens the chemistry of proton&#8208;based batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Active Nanobots Based on Soft Nanoarchitectonics Powered by an Ultralow Fuel Concentration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme catalysis to power micro/nanomotors has received tremendous attention because of the vast potential in applications ranging from biomedicine to environmental remediation. However, the current design is mainly based on a complex three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architecture, with limited accessible surface areas for the catalytic sites, and thus require a higher fuel concentration to achieve active motion. Herein we report for the first time an enzyme&#8208;powered 2D nanobot, which was designed by a facile strategy based on soft nanoarchitectonics for active motion at an ultralow fuel concentration (0.003% H  2  O  2  ). The 2D nanobot exhibited efficient positive chemotactic behavior and the ability to swim against gravity by virtue of solutal buoyancy. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the 2D nanobots showed an excellent capability for &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; removal of methylene blue (MB) dye with an efficiency of 85%.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A protocol for the modular assembly of  &#945;  &#8208;fluoroamide motif has been developed, which provides a practical method for the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse  &#945;  &#8208;fluoroamides from easily available aldehydes and tertiary amines through a three&#8208;component fluorination&#8208;aminocarbonylation process. The key to the success of this process is taking advantage of the multiple roles of the unique difluorocarbene reagent TMSCF  2  Br (TMS = trimethylsilyl). The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2&#8208;fluorine and oxygen migrations of the  in&#8208;situ  formed TMS&#8208;protected  &#945;  &#8208;aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.</dc:description>

The mechanism of the process involves the 1,2-fluorine and oxygen migrations of the  in-situ  formed TMS-protected  &#945;  -aminodifluoromethyl carbinol intermediates, which represents a new type of deoxyfluorination reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>We report hierarchical&#8208;ordered ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx MXene core&#8208;sheath fibers, in which ZIF&#8208;L(Zn) nanowall array sheath is grown vertically on anisotropic Ti3C2Tx core by Ti&#8208;O&#8208;Zn/Ti&#8208;F&#8208;Zn chemical bonds. Through high&#8208;efficient microfluidic assembly and microchannel reactions, ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx exhibits well&#8208;developed micro/meso&#8208;porosity, ordered ionic pathways, fast interfacial electron conduction and large&#8208;scale fabrication, significantly boosting charges dynamic transport and intercalation. The resultant ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber presents large capacitance (1700 F cm&#8208;3) and outstanding rate performance in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;L(Zn)@Ti3C2Tx fiber&#8208;based solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy density (19.0 mWh cm&#8208;3), excellent capacitance (854 F cm&#8208;3), large deformable/wearable capabilities and long&#8208;time cyclic stability (20000 cycles), which realize natural sunlight&#8208;induced self&#8208;powered applications to drive water level/earthquake alarm devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We reported mesoporosity engineering as a general strategy to promote semihydrogenation selectivity of palladium (Pd)&#8208;based nanobundles catalysts. The best mesoporous PdP displayed full conversion, remarkable activity, excellent selectivity, and high stability in semihydrogenation of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyne, all of which are remarkably better than commercial Lindlar catalysts. Mechanistic investigations ascribed high semihydrogenation selectivity to continuous crystalline framework and penetrated mesoporous channel of catalysts that weakened the adsorption and interaction capacity of alkenes and thus inhibited over&#8208;hydrogenation of alkenes to industrially unfavorable alkanes. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that convex crystalline mesoporosity of nanobundles catalysts electronically optimized the coordination environment of Pd active sites and energetically changed hydrogenation trends, resulting in a superior semihydrogenation selectivity to targeted alkenes.</dc:description>

A strategy toward the optimization of photothermal conversion materials with broad optical absorption and high conversion efficiency via the d&#8208;d interband transitions is demonstrated. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles could realize an excellent solar harvesting performance especially compositing with up to seven 3d elements in a single phase, ascribing to the fully filled energy regions below and above the Fermi level.







Abstract
Photothermal materials with broadband optical absorption and high conversion efficiency are intensively pursued to date. Here, proposing by the d&#8208;d interband transitions, we report an unprecedented high&#8208;entropy alloy FeCoNiTiVCrCu nanoparticles that the energy regions below and above the Fermi level (&#177;4&#8197;eV) have been fully filled by the 3d transition metals, which realizes an average absorbance greater than 96&#8201;% in the entire solar spectrum (wavelength of 250 to 2500&#8197;nm). Furthermore, we also calculated the photothermal conversion efficiency and the evaporation rate towards the steam generation. Due to its pronounced full light capture and ultrafast local heating, our high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle&#8208;based solar steam generator has over 98&#8201;% efficiency under one sun irradiation, meanwhile enabling a high evaporation rate of 2.26&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>Strongly Coupled Cobalt Diselenide Monolayers for Selective Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction to H2O2 under Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 26922-26931, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that narrows the interlayer distance of cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) is reported, which enables strong coupling between CoSe2 monolayers. The strongly coupled CoSe2 can catalyze electrosynthesis of H2O2 in acidic media efficiently, which yields Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, outperforming all catalysts reported previously in acidic environments.







Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the acidic environment could largely prevent its decomposition to water, but efficient catalysts that constitute entirely earth&#8208;abundant elements are lacking. Here we report the experimental demonstration of narrowing the interlayer gap of metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2), which creates high&#8208;performance catalyst to selectively drive two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction toward H2O2 in an acidic electrolyte. The enhancement of the interlayer coupling between CoSe2 atomic layers offers a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the critical *OOH adsorption, promoting the energetics for H2O2 production. Consequently, on the strongly coupled CoSe2 catalyst, we achieved Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;milliamperes per square centimeter, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. Moreover, this catalyst shows no sign of degradation when operating at &#8722;63 milliamperes per square centimeter over 100&#8197;hours.

The strongly coupled CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can catalyze electrosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in acidic media efficiently, which yields Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming all catalysts reported previously in acidic environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the acidic environment could largely prevent its decomposition to water, but efficient catalysts that constitute entirely earth-abundant elements are lacking. Here we report the experimental demonstration of narrowing the interlayer gap of metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which creates high-performance catalyst to selectively drive two-electron oxygen reduction toward H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an acidic electrolyte. The enhancement of the interlayer coupling between CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atomic layers offers a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the critical *OOH adsorption, promoting the energetics for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Consequently, on the strongly coupled CoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, we achieved Faradaic efficiency of 96.7&#8201;%, current density of 50.04&#8197;milliamperes per square centimeter, and product rate of 30.60&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, this catalyst shows no sign of degradation when operating at &#8722;63 milliamperes per square centimeter over 100&#8197;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) was firstly realized in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework with photochromic azobenzene guests.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that can be reversibly switched by light are of immense interest. Among them, photo&#8208;responsive spin crossover (SCO) complexes have great promises to combine the photoactive inputs with multifaceted outputs into switchable materials and devices. However, the reversible control the spin&#8208;state change by photochromic guests is still challenging. Herein, we report an unprecedented guest&#8208;driven light&#8208;induced spin change (GD&#8208;LISC) in a Hofmann&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), [Fe(bpn){Ag(CN)2}2]&#8901;azobenzene. (1, bpn=1,4&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)naphthalene). The reversible trans&#8211;cis photoisomerization of azobenzene guest upon UV/Vis irradiation in the solid&#8208;state results in the remarkable magnetic changes in a wide temperature range of 10&#8211;180&#8197;K. This finding not only establishes a new switching mechanism for SCO complexes, but also paves the way toward the development of new generation of photo&#8208;responsive magnetic materials.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Resistive Switching Behavior through Embedding a D&#8208;A System into 2D Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type covalent organic frameworks have been designed and prepared following a novel strategy for the construction of endurable and reliable memory devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memristor&#8208;based COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT thin film showed typical rewritable resistive switching behavior, a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105), good endurance of 319 cycles, and a long retention time of 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s.







Abstract
Developing new materials for the fabrication of resistive random&#8208;access memory is of great significance in this period of big data. Herein, we present a novel design strategy of embedding donor (D) and acceptor (A) fragments into imine&#8208;linked frameworks to construct resistive switching covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for high&#8208;performance memristors. Two D&#8208;A&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional COFs, COF&#8208;BT&#8208;TT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT, were designed and synthesized using a conventional solvothermal approach, and high&#8208;quality thin films of these materials deposited on ITO substrate exhibited great potential as an active layer for memristors. Rewritable memristors based on 100&#8197;nm thick COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT and COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT films showed a high ON/OFF current ratio (ca. 105 and 104) and low driving voltage (1.30 and 1.60&#8197;V). The cycle period and retention time for COF&#8208;TT&#8208;BT&#8208;based rewritable devices were as high as 319 cycles and 3.3&#215;104&#8197;s at a constant voltage of 0.1&#8197;V (160 cycles and 1.2&#215;104&#8197;s for the COF&#8208;TT&#8208;TVT memristor).

A divergent synthesis of skeletally distinct arboridinine (1) and arborisidine (2) was achieved. The central divergent strategy was inspired by the divergent biosynthetic cyclization mode of arboridinine (1) and arborisidine (2) and their hidden topological connection.







Abstract
A divergent synthesis of skeletally distinct arboridinine and arborisidine was achieved. The central divergent strategy was inspired by the divergent biosynthetic cyclization mode of arboridinine and arborisidine and their hidden topological connection. The branch point was reached through a Michael and Mannich cascade process. A site&#8208;selective intramolecular Mannich reaction was developed to construct the tetracyclic core of arboridinine, while a site&#8208;selective intramolecular &#945;&#8208;amination of ketone was used to access the tetracyclic core of arborisidine. A strategic Peterson olefination through intramolecular nucleophile delivery was able to set up the exocyclic olefin of arboridinine.

         <title>Parahydrogen Hyperpolarization Allows Direct NMR Detection of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids in Complex (Bio)mixtures</title>

Non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization allows the detection and quantification of &#945;&#8208;amino acids down to sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method can also be applied to aqueous mixtures after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment. This direct approach was tested on human urine, allowing a well&#8208;resolved detection of amino acids despite the complexity of the mixture.







Abstract
The scope of non&#8208;hydrogenative parahydrogen hyperpolarization (nhPHIP) techniques has been expanding over the last years, with the continuous addition of important classes of substrates. For example, pyruvate can now be hyperpolarized using the Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) technique, offering a fast, efficient and low&#8208;cost PHIP alternative to Dynamic Nuclear Polarization for metabolic imaging studies. Still, important biomolecules such as amino acids have so far resisted PHIP, unless properly functionalized. Here, we report on an approach to nhPHIP for unmodified &#945;&#8208;amino acids that allows their detection and quantification in complex mixtures at sub&#8208;micromolar concentrations. This method was tested on human urine, in which natural &#945;&#8208;amino acids could be measured after dilution with methanol without any additional sample treatment.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Difluoromethylation of Alkyl Iodides Enabled by Aryl Radical Activation of Carbon&#8211;Iodine Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27070-27077, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aryl radical activation strategy has been developed that can engage unactivated alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The strategy is based on the largely overlooked yet highly efficient reactivity of aryl radicals to abstract iodine atoms from alkyl iodides.







Abstract
The engagement of unactivated alkyl halides in copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions has been historically challenging, due to their low reduction potential and the slow oxidative addition of copper(I) catalysts. In this work, we report a novel strategy that leverages the halogen abstraction ability of aryl radicals, thereby engaging a diverse range of alkyl iodides in copper&#8208;catalyzed Negishi&#8208;type cross&#8208;coupling reactions at room temperature. Specifically, aryl radicals generated via copper catalysis efficiently initiate the cleavage of the carbon&#8211;iodide bonds of alkyl iodides. The alkyl radicals thus generated enter the copper catalytic cycles to couple with a difluoromethyl zinc reagent, thus furnishing the alkyl difluoromethane products. This unprecedented Negishi&#8208;type difluoromethylation approach has been applied to the late&#8208;stage modification of densely functionalized pharmaceutical agents and natural products.

         <title>Non&#8208;uniform Photoinduced Unfolding of Supramolecular Polymers Leading to Topological Block Nanofibers</title>

Helically folded supramolecular polymers with a high internal rigidity undergo non&#8208;uniform unfolding upon UV&#8208;irradiation, affording topological block nanofibers consisting of two distinct domains with helically folded and unfolded structures.







Abstract
Synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional nanofibers with distinct topological (higher&#8208;order structural) domains in the same main chain is one of the challenging topics in modern supramolecular polymer chemistry. Non&#8208;uniform structural transformation of supramolecular polymer chains by external stimuli may enable preparation of such nanofibers. To demonstrate feasibility of this post&#8208;polymerization strategy, we prepared a photoresponsive helically folded supramolecular polymers from a barbiturate monomer containing an azobenzene&#8208;embedded rigid &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold. In contrast to previous helically folded supramolecular polymers composed of a more flexible azobenzene monomer, UV&#8208;light induced unfolding of the newly prepared helically folded supramolecular polymers occurred nonuniformly, affording topological block copolymers consisting of folded and unfolded domains. The formation of such blocky copolymers indicates that the photoinduced unfolding of the helically folded structures initiates from relatively flexible parts such as termini or defects. Spontaneous refolding of the unfolded domains was observed after visible&#8208;light irradiation followed by aging to restore fully folded structures.

         <title>Ultrahigh Supramolecular Cascaded Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Capturing System</title>

An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded RTP&#8208;capturing system was constructed based on a multivalent supramolecular aggregate using cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD) in aqueous medium. Energy transfer from G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD to primary (RhB or DBT) and then to secondary energy acceptors (Cy5 or NiB) gives rise to long&#8208;range and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence, especially NIR delayed emission (675&#8197;nm).







Abstract
An ultrahigh supramolecular cascaded phosphorescence&#8208;capturing aggregate was constructed by multivalent co&#8208;assembly of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and amphipathic sulfonatocalix[4]arene (SC4AD). The initial dibromophthalimide derivative (G) generated a weak phosphorescent emission at 505&#8197;nm by host&#8211;guest interaction with CB[7], which further assembled with SC4AD to form homogeneously spherical nanoparticles with a dramatic enhancement of both phosphorescence lifetime to 1.13&#8197;ms and emission intensity by 40&#8208;fold. Notably, this G&#8834;CB[7]@SC4AD aggregate exhibited efficient phosphorescence energy transfer to Rhodamine B (RhB) and benzothiadiazole (DBT) with high efficiency (&#981;ET) of 84.4&#8201;% and 76.3&#8201;% and an antenna effect (AE) of 289.4 and 119.5, respectively, and then each of these can function as a bridge to further transfer their energy to second near&#8208;IR acceptors Cy5 or Nile blue (NiB) to achieve cascaded phosphorescence energy transfer. The final aggregate with long&#8208;range effect from 425&#8197;nm to 800&#8197;nm and long&#8208;lived photoluminescence was further employed as an imaging agent for multicolour cell labeling.

Structural snapshots and mechanistic investigation of a key spiroketal synthase provide insights into extensive oxidative backbone rearrangements and spiroketal pharmacophore assembly in rubromycin biosynthesis.







Abstract
The medically important bacterial aromatic polyketide natural products typically feature a planar, polycyclic core structure. An exception is found for the rubromycins, whose backbones are disrupted by a bisbenzannulated [5,6]&#8208;spiroketal pharmacophore that was recently shown to be assembled by flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes. In particular, a flavoprotein monooxygenase proved critical for the drastic oxidative rearrangement of a pentangular precursor and the installment of an intermediate [6,6]&#8208;spiroketal moiety. Here we provide structural and mechanistic insights into the control of catalysis by this spiroketal synthase, which fulfills several important functions as reductase, monooxygenase, and presumably oxidase. The enzyme hereby tightly controls the redox state of the substrate to counteract shunt product formation, while also steering the cleavage of three carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. Our work illustrates an exceptional strategy for the biosynthesis of stable chroman spiroketals.

         <title>Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalyzed Dearomatization by Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation/Claisen Rearrangement: Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of Spirolactams</title>

A Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement is disclosed that involves an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds and allows the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of various valuable spirolactams. Moreover, the asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization is also achieved via kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis.







Abstract
Described herein is a novel Br&#248;nsted acid catalyzed intramolecular hydroalkoxylation/Claisen rearrangement, allowing the practical and atom&#8208;economic synthesis of a range of valuable spirolactams from readily available ynamides in generally good to excellent yields with excellent diastereoselectivities and broad substrate scope. Importantly, an unexpected dearomatization of nonactivated arenes and heteroaromatic compounds is involved in this tandem sequence. Moreover, an asymmetric version of this tandem cyclization was also achieved by efficient kinetic resolution by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. In addition, the [3,3]&#8208;rearrangement is shown to be kinetically preferred over the related [1,3]&#8208;rearrangement by theoretical calculations.

We report an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) inducer, which can specifically accumulate in cancer cell lysosomes for evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD) and converting immunologically cold tumors into hot tumors.







Abstract
Lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death induced by lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) has recently attracted increasing attention. However, nearly no studies show that currently available LMP inducers can evoke immunogenic cell death (ICD) or convert immunologically cold tumors to hot. Herein, we report a LMP inducer named TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY, which can respond to alkaline phosphatase (ALP), leading to formation of nanoassembies along with fluorescence and singlet oxygen turn&#8208;on. TPE&#8208;Py&#8208;pYK(TPP)pY tends to accumulate in ALP&#8208;overexpressed cancer cell lysosomes as well as induce LMP and rupture of lysosomal membranes to massively evoke ICD. Such LMP&#8208;induced ICD effectively converts immunologically cold tumors to hot as evidenced by abundant CD8+ and CD4+ T cells infiltration into the cold tumors. Exposure of ALP&#8208;catalyzed nanoassemblies in cancer cell lysosomes to light further intensifies the processes of LMP, ICD and cold&#8208;to&#8208;hot tumor conversion. This work thus builds a new bridge between lysosome&#8208;relevant cell death and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Ion Intercalation and High Volumetric Capacitance in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Porous Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27119-27125, December 20, 2021. </description>

A two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer (Ni3BHT) demonstrates rapid and reversible intercalation of both cations and anions in an electrochemical capacitor (EC). This first observation of dual&#8208;ion intercalation in ECs presents a unique scenario, wherein cation intercalation in Ni3BHT is pseudocapacitive but anion intercalation is capacitive in nature.







Abstract
Intercalation is a promising ion&#8208;sorption mechanism for enhancing the energy density of electrochemical capacitors (ECs) because it offers enhanced access to the electrochemical surface area. It requires a rapid transport of ions in and out of a host material, and it must occur without phase transformations. Materials that fulfil these requirements are rare; those that do intercalate almost exclusively cations. Herein, we show that Ni3(benzenehexathiol) (Ni3BHT), a non&#8208;porous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered coordination polymer (CP), intercalates both cations and anions with a variety of charges. Whereas cation intercalation is pseudocapacitive, anions intercalate in a purely capacitive fashion. The excellent EC performance of Ni3BHT provides a general basis for investigating similar dual&#8208;ion intercalation mechanisms in the large family of non&#8208;porous 2D CPs.

         <title>Flower&#8208;Like Colloidal Particles through Precipitation Polymerization of Redox&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27026-27030, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flower&#8208;like particles of a redox&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline mixture prepared by precipitation polymerization are reported. The influences of monomer composition, polymerization temperature, and solvent on the particle shape are investigated. The shapes formed in the early stage of polymerization remain unchanged. Under reducing conditions, the flower&#8208;like particles are degraded much more rapidly than the spherical particles due to their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.







Abstract
We report on the synthesis of monodisperse, flower&#8208;like, liquid crystalline (LC) polymer particles by precipitation polymerization of a LC mixture consisting of benzoic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylates and disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates. Introduction of a minor amount of redox&#8208;responsive disulfide&#8208;functionalized diacrylates (&#8804;10&#8197;wt&#8201;%) induced the formation of flower&#8208;like shapes. The shape of the particles can be tuned from flower&#8208; to disk&#8208;like to spherical by elevating the polymerization temperature. The solvent environment also has a pronounced effect on the particle size. Time&#8208;resolved TEM reveals that the final particle morphology was formed in the early stages of the polymerization and that subsequent polymerization resulted in continued particle growth without affecting the morphology. Finally, the degradation of the particles under reducing conditions was much faster for flower&#8208;like particles than for spherical particles, likely a result of their higher surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio.

         <title>Strong SHG Responses in a Beryllium&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;UV&#8208;Transparent Hydroxyborate via Covalent Bond Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27151-27157, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical hydroxyborate, NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), was constructed by a covalent bond modification strategy via a facile hydrothermal reaction. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH is SHG&#8208;active at both 1064&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm, with deep&#8208;UV transparency to wavelengths below 190&#8197;nm, and good phase&#8208;matchability in the near deep&#8208;UV region, a rare combination for NLO hydroxyborates.







Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet (deep&#8208;UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are key materials in creating tunable deep&#8208;UV lasers for frequency conversion technology. However, practical application of the sole usable crystal, KBe2BO3F2, has been hindered by the high toxicity of beryllium and its layering tendency in crystal growth. Herein, we report a beryllium&#8208;free deep&#8208;UV NLO material NaSr3(OH)(B9O16)[B(OH)4] (NSBOH), synthesized by a covalent bond modification strategy under hydrothermal conditions. Moisture&#8208;stable NSBOH exhibits strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) at 1064&#8197;nm (3.3 &#215; KH2PO4) and 532&#8197;nm (0.55 &#215; &#946;&#8208;BaB2O4), both amongst the largest powder SHG responses for a deep&#8208;UV borate, with good phase&#8208;matchability and a short wavelength cutoff edge (below 190&#8197;nm). NSBOH possesses a 3D covalent anionic [B9O19]&#8734; honeycomb&#8208;like framework with no layering. The Sr2+ and Na+ ions, residing in the cavities of the anionic framework, act as templates for the assembly and favorable alignment of NLO&#8208;active groups, resulting in an optimal balance between strong SHG activities and wide UV transparency. These merits indicate NSBOH is a very attractive candidate for deep&#8208;UV NLO applications.

A kagome network on the Ag(111) surface hosts guest molecules with enantiomeric selectivity. Each larger pore confines a single guest molecule. The punctuated pirouette of the guest molecule in this confined space is unravelled by a combination of density functional theory and variable temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy in real time at the single molecule level.







Abstract
Tailored nano&#8208;spaces can control enantioselective adsorption and molecular motion. We report on the spontaneous assembly of a dynamic system&#8212;a rigid kagome network with each pore occupied by a guest molecule&#8212;employing solely 2,6&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic acid on Ag(111). The network cavity snugly hosts the chemically modified guest, bestows enantiomorphic adsorption and allows selective rotational motions. Temperature&#8208;dependent scanning tunnelling microscopy studies revealed distinct anchoring orientations of the guest unit switching with a 0.95&#8197;eV thermal barrier. H&#8208;bonding between the guest and the host transiently stabilises the rotating guest, as the flapper on a raffle wheel. Density functional theory investigations unravel the detailed molecular pirouette of the guest and how the energy landscape is determined by H&#8208;bond formation and breakage. The origin of the guest's enantiodirected, dynamic anchoring lies in the specific interplay of the kagome network and the silver surface.

Safety is always a topic of concern after reports of devices catching fire due to battery failure. Using non&#8208;flammable electrolyte as an ultimate solution is difficult to be applied to commercial batteries because of various problems such as poor compatibility, high viscosity and so on. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte with excellent comprehensive performance, and applied it to sodium&#8208;ion pouch cells with different promising materials.







Abstract
The safety of energy storage equipment has always been a stumbling block to the development of battery, and sodium ion battery is no exception. However, as an ultimate solution, the use of non&#8208;flammable electrolyte is susceptible to the side effects, and its poor compatibility with electrode, causing failure of batteries. Here, we report a non&#8208;flammable electrolyte design to achieve high&#8208;performance sodium ion battery, which resolves the dilemma via regulating the solvation structure of electrolyte by hydrogen bonds and optimizing the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase. The reported non&#8208;flammable electrolyte allows stable charge&#8208;discharge cycling of both sodium vanadium phosphate@hard carbon and Prussian blue@hard carbon full pouch cell for more than 120 cycles with a capacity retention of &gt;85&#8201;% and high cycling Coulombic efficiency (99.7&#8201;%).

         <title>Hyperbranched Microwire Networks of Organic Cocrystals with Optical Waveguiding and Light&#8208;Harvesting Abilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27046-27052, December 20, 2021. </description>

Hierarchical micro&#8208; and nanostructures made of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are not yet reported due to the weak control over intermolecular interactions and little&#8208;known complex assembly behavior of organic species. Hyperbranched microwire networks comprising binary organic arene&#8208;perfluoroarene cocrystals were created, which show optical waveguiding and light&#8208;harvesting abilities.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of hyperbranched organic microwire (MW) networks comprising 1,4&#8208;bis(pentafluorostyryl)benzene (10Ft) and 9,10&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene (BA) using a simple solution co&#8208;assembly route. Pure 10Ft or BA assemblies cannot produce such complex MW networks; in contrast with a binary cocrystal of 10Ft and BA with a 2:1 molar ratio ((2:1)10Ft:BA), which is formed via intermolecular arene&#8208;perfluoroarene (AP) interactions. A new generation of multiple MWs grow epitaxially on the previous generation of MWs to form MW arrays in which BA may also act as an intermediate product to facilitate the regeneration of (2:1)10Ft:BA. Highly aligned and well&#8208;connected MW networks enable superior optical waveguiding ability. Moreover, a red&#8208;emitting dopant, 5,12&#8208;bis(phenylethynyl)naphthacene (BN) was incorporated into (2:1)10Ft:BA host MWs, giving light&#8208;harvesting hierarchical MW networks via an energy&#8208;transfer (ET) process. The realization of the hyperbranched MWs provides us with deep insight into the rational creation of complex branched arrays from functional organic cocrystals.

         <title>Sink/Float Magnetic Immunoassays for In&#8208;Field Bioassays</title>

Sink/float magnetic immunoassays detect proteins, antibodies, and bacteria in samples using a simple mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe protocol that uses a biofunctionalized small sphere, some liquid reagents and a small permanent magnet. A simple sink/float test of the sphere identifies if the analyte is above or below a predetermined level; the sphere sinks only if the analyte is above the concentration level.







Abstract
Analytical tests/devices that are used outside laboratory settings are required to have a very simple analytical protocol to get clearance by regulatory authorities. This study describes sink/float magnetic immunoassays, a new type of rapid, mix&#8208;and&#8208;observe, instrument&#8208;free tests for the detection of biomarkers in untreated biological samples that are very simple and might meet the simple&#8208;to&#8208;use criterion of authorities to be used in the field. These tests can tell whether an analyte is above or below a predetermined level within 25&#8211;45&#8197;minutes based on the sinking or floating of a mm&#8208;sized sphere on the surface of which an immunoassay that uses reporter antibodies conjugated to superparamagnetic nanoparticles is performed. This manuscript describes the theory and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept applications of sink/float magnetic immunoassays for the detection of C&#8208;Reactive Protein, anti&#8208;Treponema pallidum antibodies and E.&#8197;coli bacteria.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Green Process to Synthesize MXene with Controllable Surface Terminations using Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27013-27018, December 20, 2021. </description>

This is the first study to use a molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching (MS&#8208;E&#8208;etching) method to synthesize Ti3C2Cl2 without metallic impurities. The Tx surface terminations could be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S in this one&#8208;pot process. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx electrode exhibited a significant increase in capacity.







Abstract
Surface terminations of two&#8208;dimensional MXene (Ti3C2Tx) considerably impact its physicochemical properties. Commonly used etching methods usually introduce &#8208;F surface terminations or metallic impurities in MXene. We present a new molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical etching method to synthesize fluorine&#8208;free Ti3C2Cl2. Using electrons as reaction agents, cathode reduction and anode etching can be spatially isolated; thus, no metallics are present in the Ti3C2Cl2 product. The surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations. The obtained &#8722;O&#8208;terminated Ti3C2Tx are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors, exhibiting capacitances of 225&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;Ag&#8722;1, good rate performance (91.1&#8201;% at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), and excellent capacitance retention (100&#8201;% after 10000 charge/discharge cycles at 10&#8197;Ag&#8722;1), which is superior to multi&#8208;layered Ti3C2Tx prepared by other etching methods.

The surface terminations can be in situ modified from &#8722;Cl to &#8722;O and/or &#8722;S, which considerably shortens the modification steps and enriches the variety of surface terminations. The obtained &#8722;O-terminated Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Discovery of a Rhombohedral Twelve&#8208;Connected Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Ordered Terephthalate and Fumarate Linkers</title>

         <dc:description>
The ordered arrangement of terephthalate and fumarate linkers over the fcu net produces a zirconium&#8208;based MOF Zr6(BDC)3(Fum)3 with two distinct windows and multiple guest diffusion pathways. This phase is formed by single&#8208;step synthesis in a narrow region of the available chemical space, and its identification required a large set of synthetic experiments that were facilitated by automated high&#8208;throughput methods.







Abstract
We report a metal&#8208;organic framework where an ordered array of two linkers with differing length and geometry connect [Zr6(OH)4O4]12+ clusters into a twelve&#8208;connected fcu net that is rhombohedrally distorted from cubic symmetry. The ordered binding of equal numbers of terephthalate and fumarate ditopic carboxylate linkers at the trigonal antiprismatic Zr6 core creates close&#8208;packed layers of fumarate&#8208;connected clusters that are connected along the single remaining threefold axis by terephthalates. This well&#8208;defined linker arrangement retains the three&#8208;dimensional porosity of the Zr cluster&#8208;based UiO family while creating two distinct windows within the channels that define two distinct guest diffusion paths. The ordered material is accessed by a restricted combination of composition and process parameters that were identified by high&#8208;throughput synthesis.

Through rational molecular design, simple chemical synthesis, and structure&#8211;property computation analysis, a new catholyte with high potential, two&#8208;electron transfer, and high solubility is developed for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries.







Abstract
This report describes the design of diaminocyclopropenium&#8208;phenothiazine hybrid catholytes for non&#8208;aqueous redox flow batteries. The molecules are synthesized in a rapid and modular fashion by appending a diaminocyclopropenium (DAC) substituent to the nitrogen of the phenothiazine. Combining a versatile C&#8208;N coupling protocol (which provides access to diverse derivatives) with computation and structure&#8208;property analysis enabled the identification of a catholyte that displays stable two&#8208;electron cycling at potentials of 0.64 and 1.00&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+ as well as high solubility in all oxidation states (&#8805;0.45&#8197;M in TBAPF6/MeCN). This catholyte was deployed in a high energy density two&#8208;electron RFB, exhibiting &gt;90&#8201;% capacity retention over 266&#8197;hours of flow cell cycling at &gt;0.5&#8197;M electron concentration.

         <title>Tailoring Co3d and O2p Band Centers to Inhibit Oxygen Escape for Stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27102-27112, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode. The oxygen escape is significantly inhibited by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band centers and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping, which enables a stable cycling of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 cathode.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 delivers a high capacity but sharp fading is a critical issue, and the capacity decay mechanism is also poorly understood. Herein, we clarify that the escape of surface oxygen and Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 formation are the main causes for the capacity fading of 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2. We propose the inhibition of the oxygen escape for achieving stable 4.6&#8197;V LiCoO2 by tailoring the Co3d and O2p band center and enlarging their band gap with MgF2 doping. This enhances the ionicity of the Co&#8722;O bond and the redox activity of Co and improves cation migration reversibility. The inhibition of oxygen escape suppresses the formation of Li&#8208;insulator Co3O4 and maintains the surface structure integrity. Mg acts as a pillar, providing a stable and enlarged channel for fast Li+ intercalation/extraction. The modulated LiCoO2 shows almost zero strain and achieves a record capacity retention at 4.6&#8197;V: 92&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 1C and 86.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5C.

         <title>Water Splitting by C60&#8208;Supported Vanadium Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27095-27101, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Splitting of water by a single vanadium is greatly facilitated by a C60 support, which can be regarded as a small piece of porous carbon nanomaterials, especially those with intrinsic pentagonal defects and curvatures. The compelling experimental and theoretical evidence demonstrates the important role of support in single vanadium atom catalysis.







Abstract
Water splitting is an important source of hydrogen, a promising future carrier for clean and renewable energy. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of water splitting, catalyzed by supported metal atoms or nanoparticles, is essential to improve the design of efficient catalysts. Here, we report an infrared spectroscopic study of such a water splitting process, assisted by a C60 supported vanadium atom, C60V++H2O&#8594;C60VO++H2. We probe both the entrance channel complex C60V+(H2O) and the end product C60VO+, and observe the formation of H2 as a result from resonant infrared absorption. Density functional theory calculations exploring the detailed reaction pathway reveal that a quintet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet spin crossing facilitates the water splitting reaction by C60&#8208;supported V+, whereas this reaction is kinetically hindered on the isolated V+ ion by a high energy barrier. The C60 support has an important role in lowering the reaction barrier with more than 70&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 due to a large orbital overlap of one water hydrogen atom with one carbon atom of the C60 support. This fundamental insight in the water splitting reaction by a C60&#8208;supported single vanadium atom showcases the importance of supports in single atom catalysts by modifying the reaction potential energy surface.

         <title>Spatial Structure Regulation: A Rod&#8208;Shaped Viologen Enables Long Lifetime in Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
We report a rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) anolyte for aqueous redox flow batteries (AORFBs). R&#8208;Vi possesses a low membrane&#8208;penetration rate of &#8776;10&#8722;10&#8197;cm2&#8201;s&#8722;1 and the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologens in AORFBs simultaneously. The R&#8208;Vi&#8208;based AORFB exhibits an extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous charging&#8211;discharging processes.







Abstract
A stable rod&#8208;like sulfonated viologen (R&#8208;Vi) derivative is developed through a spatial&#8208;structure&#8208;adjustment strategy for neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs). The obtained R&#8208;Vi features four individual methyl groups on the 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;positions of the 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine core ring. The tethered methyls confine the movement of the alkyl chain as well as the sulfonic anion, thus driving the spatial structure from sigmoid to rod shape. The R&#8208;Vi with weak charge attraction and large molecular dimension displays an ultralow membrane permeability that is only 14.7&#8201;% of that of typical sigmoid viologen. Moreover, the electron&#8208;donating effect of methyls endows R&#8208;Vi with the lowest redox potential of &#8722;0.55&#8197;V vs. SHE among one&#8208;electron&#8208;storage viologen&#8208;based AORFBs. The AORFB with the R&#8208;Vi anolyte and a K4Fe(CN)6 catholyte exhibits an energy efficiency up to 87&#8201;% and extremely low capacity&#8208;fade rate of 0.007&#8201;% per cycle in 3200 continuous cycles.

         <title>Engineering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Iridium Clusters Stabilized on Amorphous Bimetal Borides Array for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

Iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on an amorphous metal boride array are reported, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induces the formation of high&#8208;valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridges between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale.







Abstract
Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts requires significant advances in material design and in&#8208;depth understanding for water electrolysis. Herein, we report iridium clusters stabilized surface reconstructed oxyhydroxides on amorphous metal borides array, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 178&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline medium. The coupling of iridium clusters induced the formation of high valence cobalt species and Ir&#8211;O&#8211;Co bridge between iridium and oxyhydroxides at the atomic scale, engineering lattice oxygen activation and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer to trigger multiple active sites for intrinsic pH&#8208;dependent OER activity. The lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) was confirmed by in situ 18O isotope labeling mass spectrometry and chemical recognition of negative peroxo&#8208;like species. Theoretical simulations reveal that the OER performance on this catalyst is intrinsically dominated by LOM pathway, facilitating the reaction kinetics. This work not only paves an avenue for the rational design of electrocatalysts, but also serves the fundamental insights into the lattice oxygen participation for promising OER application.

         <title>Oil&#8211;Water&#8211;Oil Triphase Synthesis of Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27078-27085, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on a phase engineering strategy is developed for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs). A favourable reaction region with moderate monomer concentration is achieved in the middle water phase. The resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs show potential for ultrathin biogas separation membranes.







Abstract
Ionic covalent organic framework nanosheets (iCOFNs) with long&#8208;range ordered and mono&#8208;dispersed ionic groups hold great potential in many advanced applications. Considering the inherent drawbacks of oil&#8211;water biphase method, herein, we explore an oil&#8211;water&#8211;oil triphase method based on phase engineering strategy for the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of iCOFNs. The middle water phase serves as a confined reaction region, and the two oil phases are reservoirs for storing and supplying monomers to the water phase. A large aqueous space and low monomer concentration lead to the anisotropic gradual growth of iCOFNs into few&#8208;layer thickness, large lateral size, and high crystallinity. Notably, the resulting three cationic and anionic iCOFNs exhibit ultra&#8208;high aspect ratios of up to 20,000. We further demonstrate their application potential by processing into ultrathin defect&#8208;free COF membranes for efficient biogas separation. Our triphase method may offer an alternative platform technology for the synthesis and innovative applications of iCOFNs.

         <title>Chiroptical Switching and Quantitative Chirality Sensing with (Pseudo)halogenated Quinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27031-27038, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinones are used for quantitative UV/CD sensing of the concentration and enantiomeric excess of more than thirty aliphatic and aromatic chiral amines, amino alcohols and amino acids. The integration of redox switching into the sensing protocol allows spectral deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra that are obtained with challenging compound mixtures.







Abstract
(Pseudo)halogenated quinones react smoothly with chiral amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids toward push&#8211;pull conjugates with optical sensing and switching applications. The chiroptically active conjugates serve as redox switches between two reversibly interconverting states with remarkably different UV and CD signatures. Addition of sodium borohydride generates a hydroquinone derivative that is quantitatively re&#8208;oxidized to the original quinone upon exposure to air. This chiroptical quinone/hydroquinone redox switch system combines several attractive features such as simple set&#8208;up, use of inexpensive chemicals, short response time, and thermal and photochemical stability. A conceptually new sensing approach that is based on integrated chiroptical amplification and redox switching enables on&#8208;the&#8208;fly deconvolution of otherwise overlapping CD spectra and is used for quantitative er analysis of challenging samples containing constitutional isomers in varying enantiomeric compositions.

         <title>Construction of Tricyclic Nitrogen Heterocycles by a Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Cyclization of Allenynes and Application to Polycyclic &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27019-27025, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gold&#8208;catalyzed biscyclization of hydroxyisobutyryl (Hib)&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was promoted by BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to give 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives, some of which were converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A hexacyclic indolium salt (see structure) showed concentration&#8208;dependent photophysical properties attributable to aggregate formation.

A novel approach to the direct construction of tricyclic nitrogen heterocycles based on gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade cyclization of aminoallenynes is described. The expected biscyclization reaction of hydroxyisobutyryl&#8208;protected aminoallenynes was efficiently promoted by a catalytic amount of BrettPhosAuNTf2 in the presence of iPrOH to produce 1,2&#8208;dihydrobenzo[cd]indole derivatives in good yields. When the reaction was combined with Friedel&#8211;Crafts acylation or palladium&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;arylation, the resulting tricyclic products were efficiently converted into nitrogen&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic compounds (N&#8208;PACs) with highly conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron systems. A newly obtained hexacyclic indolium salt showed characteristic concentration&#8208;dependent absorption and emission properties.

         <title>Irradiation&#8208;Wavelength Directing Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Self&#8208;Organized Helical Superstructures Enabled by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Chiral Fluorescent Molecular Switches</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27158-27163, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phototuning the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals is obtained in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical cholesteric superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch, which derives from the different conversion ratio of Z/E photoisomerization of the switch upon different light irradiations.







Abstract
Two light&#8208;driven chiral fluorescent molecular switches, (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 1 and (R,S,R)&#8208;switch 2, are prepared by means of hydrogen&#8208;bonded (H&#8208;bonded) assembly of a photoresponsive (S) chiral fluorescent molecule, respectively with a cyano substitution at different positions as an H&#8208;bond acceptor and an opposite (R) chiral molecule as an H&#8208;bond donor. The resulting two switches exhibit tunable and reversible Z/E photoisomerization irradiated with 450&#8197;nm blue and 365&#8197;nm UV light. When doped into an achiral liquid crystal, both switches are found to be able to form a CPL tunable luminescent helical superstructure. In contrast to the tunable CPL characteristics of the system incorporating switch 2, exposure of the system incorporating switch 1 to 365&#8197;nm and 450&#8197;nm radiation can lead to controllable different photostationary CPL behavior, including switching&#8208;off and polarization inversion. In addition, optical information coding is demonstrated using the system containing switch 1.

The first osmium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative C&#8722;H annulation is disclosed. While improved selectivities are possible, unprecedented osmium intermediates are presented along with detailed kinetic studies, which revealed the working mode of osmaelectrocatalysis.







Abstract
Herein, we disclose osmaelectrocatalyzed C&#8722;H activations that set the stage for electrooxidative alkyne annulations by benzoic acids. The osmium electrocatalysis enables site&#8208; and chemoselective electrooxidative C&#8722;H activations with unique levels of selectivity. The isolation of unprecedented osmium(0) and osmium(II) intermediates, along with crystallographic characterization and analyses by spectrometric and spectroscopic in&#8197;operando techniques delineate a synergistic osmium redox catalyst regime. Detailed mechanistic studies revealed a facile C&#8722;H cleavage, which allows for an ample substrate scope, providing provide robust and user&#8208;friendly access to annulated heterocycles.

         <title>Three&#8208;Component Reaction to 1,4,2&#8208;Diazaborole&#8208;Type Heteroarene Systems</title>

The reaction product between the bulky FmesBH2 borane and an isonitrile serves as a B/N frustrated Lewis pair that adds nitriles to form the dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole heteroarene derivatives. One example of this class of compounds was shown to undergo a cycloaddition reaction with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide.







Abstract
The borane FmesBH2 reacts in a three&#8208;component reaction with an isonitrile and a small series of organonitriles to give rare examples of the class of dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivatives. In a related way, annulated BN&#8208;indolizine derivatives became conveniently available, as were dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;oxaza&#8208; or thiazaborole derivatives. The nucleophilic framework of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole example allowed for an uncatalyzed acylation reaction. It also served as a 1,3&#8208;dipolar reagent and underwent a [3+2] cycloaddition/[4+2] cycloreversion sequence when treated with methyl propiolate to give the respective pyrrole product. The [3+2] cycloaddition product of a dihydro&#8208;1,4,2&#8208;diazaborole derivative with N&#8208;phenylmaleimide was isolated and its heterobicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derived structure characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>A Free Aluminylene with Diverse &#963;&#8208;Donating and Doubly &#963;/&#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligand Features for Transition Metals**

A crystalline carbazolylaluminylene with a monocoordinated aluminium atom featuring a lone pair of electrons and two vacant orbitals has been isolated at room temperature. The coordination behavior of this aluminylene towards transition metal centers is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene and alumanyl complexes with diverse coordination modes in a one&#8208;step process.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis, characterization, and coordination chemistry of a free N&#8208;aluminylene, namely a carbazolylaluminylene 2&#8201;b. This species is prepared via a reduction reaction of the corresponding carbazolyl aluminium diiodide. The coordination behavior of 2&#8201;b towards transition metal centers (W, Cr) is shown to afford a series of novel aluminylene complexes 3&#8211;6 with diverse coordination modes. We demonstrate that the tri&#8208;active ambiphilic Al center in 2&#8201;b can behave as: 1.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; 2.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating, &#963;&#8208;accepting and &#960;&#8208;accepting ligand; and 3.&#8197;a &#963;&#8208;donating and doubly &#963;&#8208;accepting ligand. Additionally, we show ligand exchange at the aluminylene center providing access to the modulation of electronic properties of transition metals without changing the coordinated atoms. Investigations of 2&#8201;b with IDippCuCl (IDipp=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) show an unprecedented aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation leading to a rare terminal Cu&#8208;alumanyl complex 8. The electronic structures of such complexes and the mechanism of the aluminylene&#8208;alumanyl transformation are investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Nuclear&#8208;spin driven relaxation collaborating with the ligands in lanthanide single molecule magnets (SMMs) remains ambiguous. In their Communication on page&#8197;27282, Liviu Ungur, Jun&#8208;Liang Liu, and co&#8208;workers report two HoIII isotopic&#8208;isomorphic SMMs, whose magnetization dynamics reveals a switch in the relative relaxation rates at low/high temperatures. A theoretical analysis suggests that the noticeable isotope effect arises from the tunnel splitting and the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the distinct nuclear spin numbers of 1H and 2H.

Irradiation&#8208;wavelength directing circularly polarized luminescence in emissive self&#8208;organized helical superstructures is demonstrated by Jinbao Guo, Quan Li, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article on page&#8197;27158. Phototuning of the turning&#8208;off and the polarization inversion of circularly polarized luminescence signals was achieved in the corresponding photostationary state of the same helical superstructure constructed from the light&#8208;driven hydrogen&#8208;bonded chiral fluorescent molecular switch.

Like well&#8208;manicured trees in nature, hyperbranched nanotrees are generated by sequential growth of multiple generations of aligned branches on the trunks, giving efficient light absorption and trapping. In their Research Article on page&#8197;27046, Yilong Lei and co&#8208;workers develop a solution co&#8208;assembly strategy to access ordered binary and ternary hyperbranched microwires comprising arene&#8208;perfluoroarene cocrystals, which display optical waveguiding and light&#8208;harvesting abilities.

A modular synthetic approach paves the way to nanoscale platform molecules for supramolecular graphite surface patterns at the solid/liquid interface, studied by scanning tunnelling microscopy and simulated by GFN&#8208;FF calculations. In their Communication on page&#8197;27264, Stefan Grimme, Stefan&#8208;S. Jester, Sigurd H&#246;ger et&#8197;al. show that the fullerene ester performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.

This Review describes recent advances in the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven preparation of nanometric molecular films of various molecules on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena. We hope to encourage the design of a facile and efficient route for molecular optoelectronic and flexible electronic applications.







Abstract
Molecules are fascinating candidates for constructing tunable and electrically conducting devices by the assembly of either a single molecule or an ensemble of molecules between two electrical contacts followed by current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) analysis, which is often termed &#8220;molecular electronics&#8221;. Recently, there has been also an upsurge of interest in spin&#8208;based electronics or spintronics across the molecules, which offer additional scope to create ultrafast responsive devices with less power consumption and lower heat generation using the intrinsic spin property rather than electronic charge. Researchers have been exploring this idea of utilizing organic molecules, organometallics, coordination complexes, polymers, and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, oligopeptides, DNA) in integrating molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Although several methods exist to prepare molecular thin&#8208;films on suitable electrodes, the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven technique has emerged as highly efficient. In this Review we describe recent advances in the electrochemical potential driven growth of nanometric various molecular films on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena.

High&#8208;entropy alloys offer a huge variety of multielement active sites on a single catalytic surface. This special polyelemental arrangement implies several different fundamental concepts in structure&#8211;activity correlations compared to traditional electrocatalysts, which are summarised and their implications for the possibility to adjust the catalytic properties with different limitations are discussed in detail.







Abstract
The formation of a vast number of different multielement active sites in compositionally complex solid solution materials, often more generally termed high&#8208;entropy alloys, offers new and unique concepts in catalyst design, which mitigate existing limitations and change the view on structure&#8211;activity relations. We discuss these concepts by summarising the currently existing fundamental knowledge and critically assess the chances and limitations of this material class, also highlighting design strategies. A roadmap is proposed, illustrating which of the characteristic concepts could be exploited using which strategy, and which breakthroughs might be possible to guide future research in this highly promising material class for (electro)catalysis.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Triazolate&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived FeN4Cl1 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Hierarchical Porosity for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27324-27329, December 20, 2021. </description>

A Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic metal&#8208;triazolate framework (MET) modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole (dcIm) was used to prepare the Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst FeN4Cl1/NC. In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the catalyst offers fast mass transfer and high catalytic activity because of abundant mesopores (pore:volume ratio 0.92), a high Fe loading (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%), and defined FeN4Cl1 sites with a distinct electronic structure.







Abstract
The construction of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high single atom densities, favorable electronic structures and fast mass transfer is highly desired. We have utilized metal&#8208;triazolate (MET) frameworks, a subclass of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high N content, as precursors since they can enhance the density and regulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites, as well as generate abundant mesopores simultaneously. Fe single atoms dispersed in a hierarchically porous N&#8208;doped carbon matrix with high metal content (2.78&#8197;wt&#8201;%) and a FeN4Cl1 configuration (FeN4Cl1/NC), as well as mesopores with a pore:volume ratio of 0.92, were obtained via the pyrolysis of a Zn/Fe&#8208;bimetallic MET modified with 4,5&#8208;dichloroimidazole. FeN4Cl1/NC exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations confirm that Cl can optimize the adsorption free energy of Fe sites to *OH, thereby promoting the ORR process. The catalyst demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This strategy selects, designs, and adjusts MOFs as precursors for high&#8208;performance SACs.

         <title>Structural Basis for Inhibition of ROS&#8208;Producing Respiratory Complex I by NADH&#8208;OH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27277-27281, December 20, 2021. </description>

The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH binds with high affinity to respiratory complex I, thereby blocking NADH oxidation and the production of reactive oxygen species. The tight interaction is mediated by residues conserved in complex I but lacking in other enzymes containing a Rossmann&#8208;fold. Accordingly, it is a lead structure for the development of new drugs for fighting oxygen stress.







Abstract
NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, respiratory complex I, plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. As a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) it affects ageing and mitochondrial dysfunction. The novel inhibitor NADH&#8208;OH specifically blocks NADH oxidation and ROS production by complex I in nanomolar concentrations. Attempts to elucidate its structure by NMR spectroscopy have failed. Here, by using X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, we report the structure of NADH&#8208;OH bound in the active site of a soluble fragment of complex I at 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution. We have identified key amino acid residues that are specific and essential for binding NADH&#8208;OH. Furthermore, the structure sheds light on the specificity of NADH&#8208;OH towards the unique Rossmann&#8208;fold of complex I and indicates a regulatory role in mitochondrial ROS generation. In addition, NADH&#8208;OH acts as a lead&#8208;structure for the synthesis of a novel class of ROS suppressors.

         <title>Precise Spatial&#8208;Designed Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Energy Transfer and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27258-27263, December 20, 2021. </description>

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), especially MOF nanosheets (NS), are very good candidates for photocatalysis. In this work, two types of donor&#8211;acceptor MOF NSs were prepared, including an acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS and a donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS. It was found that the acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS type has very good performance even with fewer catalytic centres. This may help future research to design photocatalysts.







Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency photocatalysis in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) and MOF nanosheets (NSs) are often limited by their short&#8208;lived charge separation as well as self&#8208;quenching. Here, we propose to use the energy&#8208;transfer process (EnT) to increase charge separation, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of a series of MOF NSs. With the use of NS, the photocatalyst can also be well isolated to reduce self&#8208;quenching. Tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin (H4TCPP) and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (H4TBAPy) linkers were chosen as the acceptor and donor moieties, respectively. Accounting for the precise spatial design afforded by the MOF NSs, the donor and acceptor moieties could be closely positioned on the NSs, allowing for an efficient EnT process as well as a high degree of site isolation. Two templates, donor&#8208;on&#8208;acceptor NS and acceptor&#8208;on&#8208;donor NS catalysts, were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to site&#8208;isolated active photocatalysts.

Two templates, donor-on-acceptor NS and acceptor-on-donor NS catalysts, were successfully synthesized, and the results show that the second one has much enhanced catalytic performances over the first one due to site-isolated active photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Hybrid Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanosheets of Phase Pure n=2: Stabilized Colloids Stored in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27312-27317, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum confined nanosheets (NSs) of 3D perovskites with a thickness of two lead halide layers can be prepared by using the dodecylammonium/tosylate ligand pair. The addition of Eu&#8208;nanodots to the colloid prevented the NSs from a structural rearrangement and/or coalescence. Deep blue&#8208;emissive colloids were recovered by simply dispersing it in toluene.







Abstract
Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper lead halide perovskite (RP&#8208;LHP) nano&#8208;nanostructures can be regarded as self&#8208;assembled quantum wells or superlattices of 3D perovskites with an intrinsic quantum well thickness of a single or a few (n=2&#8208;4) lead halide layers; the quantum wells are separated by organic layers. They can be scaled down to a single quantum well dimension. Here, the preparation of highly (photo)chemical and colloidal stable hybrid LHP nanosheets (NSs) of ca. 7.4&#8197;&#956;m lateral size and 2.5&#8197;nm quantum well height (thereby presenting a deep blue emission at ca. 440&#8197;nm), is reported for the first time. The NSs are close&#8208;lying and they even interconnect when deposited on a substrate. Their synthesis is based on the use of the p&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid/dodecylamine (pTS/DDA) ligand pair and their (photo)chemical stability and photoluminescence is enhanced by adding EuBr2 nanodots (EuNDs). Strikingly, they can be preserved as a solid and stored for at least one year. The blue emissive colloid can be recovered from the solid as needed by simply dispersing the powder in toluene and then using it to prepare solid films, making them very promising candidates for manufacturing devices.

A highly efficient, versatile and atom&#8208;economic protocol to chiral allylic phosphine oxides is demonstrated via palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrophosphinylation of allenes with phosphine oxides. A family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups were obtained in high yield (up to 99&#8201;%) and enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrophosphinylation of alkyl and aryl&#8208;oxyallenes with phosphine oxides has been developed for the efficient and rapid construction of a family of chiral allylic phosphine oxides with a diverse range of functional groups. This methodology was further applied in the facile construction of chiral 2H&#8208;chromene and later stage functionalization of cholesterol.

         <title>Magnetization Dynamics on Isotope&#8208;Isomorphic Holmium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27282-27287, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the nuclear&#8208;spin driven magnetization dynamics involving both metal ion and the ligand, for first time, in two HoIII isomorphic single&#8208;molecule magnets, where the behavior is originated from the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in nuclear spin number of protium (I=1/2) and deuterium (I=1).







Abstract
Here we reported the deuteration of the metal&#8208;binding equatorial water molecules in a reported HoIII single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) with pentagonal&#8208;bipyramidal geometry, from [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(H2O)5]3+ to [Ho(CyPh2PO)2(D2O)5]3+. The hyperfine structures originating from the nuclear spin of 165HoIII can be clearly observed. Moreover, the resulting magnetization dynamics revealed the switch of the relative relaxation rates for the two isotope&#8208;isomorphic complexes&#8212;respectively faster/slower at low/high temperature. The noticeable isotope effect arises from not only the paramagnetic metal center but also the diamagnetic ligands, which can be explained by the ab initio calculated tunnel splitting and the involvement of the super&#8208;hyperfine interaction related to the difference in the nuclear spin number of protium (1H, I=1/2) and deuterium (2H, I=1).

         <title>Probing Redox Non&#8208;Innocence in Iron&#8211;Carbene Complexes {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11 by 1,2H and 13C Pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance</title>

         <dc:description>
Presented herein are detailed 1/2H and 13C pulse EPR and DFT investigations of an S=1/2 terminal iron&#8211;carbene species. These studies reveal substantial spin density localized at the carbene&#8208;bound Fe center, in contrast with what has been reported to date for radical metal&#8211;carbenoid species. The {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 complex serves as a well&#8208;defined reference compound for comparison to data reported for in situ trapped intermediates.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a series of iron&#8208;carbene complexes in redox states {Fe=C(H)Ar}10&#8211;11. Pulse EPR studies of the 1,2H and 13C isotopologues of {Fe=C(H)Ar}11 reveal the high covalency of the Fe&#8211;carbene bonding, leading to a more even spin distribution than commonly observed for reduced Fischer carbenes.

Two n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and a n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI) are synthesized, and electron mobility of 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics are achieved by TP&#8208;DMBI doped films, which out&#8208;perform N&#8208;DMBI doped films.







Abstract
Achieving high electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor simultaneously for n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics is still challenging. By constructing two new acceptor&#8208;acceptor n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with different backbones and introducing the 3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl group to form the new n&#8208;type dopant 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(3,4,5&#8208;trimethoxyphenyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (TP&#8208;DMBI), high electrical conductivity of 11&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and power factor of 32&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;2 are achieved. Calculations using Density Functional Theory show that TP&#8208;DMBI presents a higher singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) energy level of &#8722;1.94&#8197;eV than that of the common dopant 4&#8208;(1, 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2, 3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenyl) dimethylamine (N&#8208;DMBI) (&#8722;2.36&#8197;eV), which can result in a larger offset between the SOMO of dopant and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of n&#8208;type polymers, though that effect may not be dominant in the present work. The doped polymer films exhibit higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor than films using N&#8208;DMBI at the same doping levels or similar electrical conductivity levels. Moreover, TP&#8208;DMBI doped polymer films offer much higher electron mobility of up to 0.53&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 than films with N&#8208;DMBI doping, demonstrating the potential of TP&#8208;DMBI, and 3,4,5&#8208;trialkoxy DMBIs more broadly, for high performance n&#8208;type organic thermoelectrics.

         <title>Palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Kinetic Resolution of sec&#8208;Phosphine Oxides by P&#8208;Benzylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both, tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, and transition metal complexes.







Abstract
P&#8208;stereogenic tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphines have wide applications in asymmetric catalysis, materials, and pharmaceutical chemistry, however, their practical synthesis still constitutes a significant challenge. Herein, a successful kinetic resolution of rac&#8208;secondary phosphine oxides via the enantioselective P&#8208;benzylation process catalyzed by the palladium/Xiao&#8208;Phos was designed. Both tert&#8208; and sec&#8208;phosphine oxides were delivered in good yield and excellent enantiopurity (selectivity factor up to 226.1). The appealing synthetic utilities are further demonstrated by the facile preparation of several valuable P&#8208;chiral compounds, precursors of bidentate ligands, as well as transition metal complexes.

         <title>The Formal Cross&#8208;Coupling of Amines and Carboxylic Acids to Form sp3&#8211;sp3 Carbon&#8211;Carbon Bonds</title>

An amine&#8211;carboxylic acid C&#8722;C coupling would be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox of carbon&#8211;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions. Using miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation, we have developed the first amine&#8211;acid cross&#8208;coupling to form C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds based on preactivation of the building blocks and nickel catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed a deaminative&#8211;decarboxylative protocol to form new carbon(sp3)&#8211;carbon(sp3) bonds from activated amines and carboxylic acids. Amines and carboxylic acids are ubiquitous building blocks, available in broad chemical diversity and at lower cost than typical C&#8722;C coupling partners. To leverage amines and acids for C&#8722;C coupling, we developed a reductive nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling utilizing building block activation as pyridinium salts and redox&#8208;active esters, respectively. Miniaturized high&#8208;throughput experimentation studies were critical to our reaction optimization, with subtle experimental changes such as order of reagent addition, composition of a binary solvent system, and ligand identity having a significant impact on reaction performance. The developed protocol is used in the late&#8208;stage diversification of pharmaceuticals while more than one thousand systematically captured and machine&#8208;readable reaction datapoints are reposited.

The first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I, an isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloid, is realized through a biomimetic strategy. The synthesis sheds light to the possible biosynthetic origins of these elusive natural product family members.







Abstract
The biosynthetic origins of the structurally related racemic isoxazolidine Papaveraceae alkaloids Setigerumine&#8197;I, Dactylicapnosinine and Dactylicapnosine have remained elusive since their original isolation over two decades ago. Herein we report the first biosynthetic hypothesis for their formation and, inspired by it, the first synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;Setigerumine&#8197;I with accompanying computational rationale. Based on the results, these isoxazolidine alkaloids arise from racemizing oxidative rearrangements of prominent isoquinoline alkaloids Noscapine and Hydrastine. The key steps featured in this synthesis are a room temperature Cope elimination and a domino oxidation/inverse&#8208;electron demand 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of an axially chiral, yet configurationally unstable, intermediate. The work opens this previously inaccessible family of natural products for biological studies.

         <title>A Molecular Compound for Highly Selective Purification of Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27184-27188, December 20, 2021. </description>

Structurally flexible, copper scorpionate binds ethylene extremely selectively from an ethylene&#8211;ethane mixture and displays excellent performance as a reusable material for the important and challenging C2H4/C4H6 separation.







Abstract
Purification of C2H4 from an C2H4 /C2H6 mixture is one of the most challenging separation processes, which is achieved mainly through energy&#8208;intensive, cryogenic distillation in industry. Sustainable, non&#8208;distillation methods are highly desired as alternatives. We discovered that the fluorinated bis(pyrazolyl)borate ligand supported copper(I) complex {[(CF3)2Bp]Cu}3 has features very desirable in an olefin&#8211;paraffin separation material. It binds ethylene exclusively over ethane generating [(CF3)2Bp]Cu(C2H4). This molecular compound exhibits extremely high and record ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) C2H4 /C2H6 gas separation selectivity, affording high purity (&gt;99.5&#8201;%) ethylene that can be readily desorbed from separation columns.

         <title>Direct, Site&#8208;Selective and Redox&#8208;Neutral &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization of Tetrahydrofurans via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>

As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, THF is activated by visible light irradiation of quantum dots in a direct, site&#8208;selective and redox&#8208;neutral manner. The resultant &#945;&#8208;oxyalkyl radicals, generated from &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H of THF on the surface of QD, enable either coupling with the &#945;&#8208;amino radical of amines, or addition to chromones and terminal alkynes.







Abstract
As one of the most ubiquitous bulk reagents available, the intrinsic chemical inertness of tetrahydrofuran (THF) makes direct and site&#8208;selective C(sp3)&#8722;H bond activation difficult, especially under redox neutral condition. Here, we demonstrate that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can activate &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond of THF via forming QDs/THF conjugates. Under visible light irradiation, the resultant alkoxyalkyl radical directly engages in radical cross&#8208;coupling with &#945;&#8208;amino radical from amino C&#8722;H bonds or radical addition with alkene or phenylacetylene, respectively. In contrast to stoichiometric oxidant or hydrogen atom transfer reagents required in previous studies, the scalable benchtop approach can execute &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bond activation of THF only by a QD photocatalyst under redox&#8208;neutral condition, thus providing a broad of value added chemicals starting from bulk THFs reagent.

         <title>Influence of Isomerism on Radioluminescence of Purely Organic Phosphorescence Scintillators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27195-27200, December 20, 2021. </description>

We present an isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, all isomers showed bright phosphorescence with an efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;%. Unexpectedly, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA scintillators showed bright luminescence under X&#8208;ray irradiation, which was ascribed to both excellent electrical conductivity and efficient suppression of non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
There are few reports about purely organic phosphorescence scintillators, and the relationship between molecular structures and radioluminescence in organic scintillators is still unclear. Here, we presented isomerism strategy to study the effect of molecular structures on radioluminescence. The isomers can achieve phosphorescence efficiency of up to 22.8&#8201;% by ultraviolet irradiation. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, both m&#8208;BA and p&#8208;BA show excellent radioluminescence, while o&#8208;BA has almost no radioluminescence. Through experimental and theoretical investigation, we found that radioluminescence was not only affected by non&#8208;radiation in emissive process, but also highly depended on the material conductivity caused by the different molecular packing. This study not only allows us to clearly understand the relationship between the molecular structures and radioluminescence, but also provides a guidance to rationally design new organic scintillators.

The catalytic asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral phosphorus compounds is an important way to construct P&#8208;chiral ligands. Herein, we report a new strategy that adopts the pyridinyl moiety as the coordinating group in the cobalt&#8208;catalysed asymmetric nucleophilic addition/alkylation of secondary phosphine oxides (SPOs). A series of tertiary phosphine oxides (TPOs) were generated with up to 99&#8201;% yield and 99.5&#8201;% ee, and with broad functional&#8208;group tolerance.

         <title>Experimental Observation of Hydrocarbon Growth by Resonance&#8208;Stabilized Radical&#8211;Radical Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27230-27235, December 20, 2021. </description>

Radical&#8211;radical chain reactions may contribute to rapid growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in combustion and astrochemical environments. Phenyl and benzyl radicals were experimentally observed to complete this chain reaction, producing diphenylmethyl and triphenylmethyl radicals by prompt H&#8208;atom loss (see scheme). This observation confirms the plausibility of such chain reactions at high temperature and low pressure.







Abstract
Rapid molecular&#8208;weight growth of hydrocarbons occurs in flames, in industrial synthesis, and potentially in cold astrochemical environments. A variety of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature chemical mechanisms have been proposed and confirmed, but more facile pathways may be needed to explain observations. We provide laboratory confirmation in a controlled pyrolysis environment of a recently proposed mechanism, radical&#8211;radical chain reactions of resonance&#8208;stabilized species. The recombination reaction of phenyl (c&#8208;C6H5) and benzyl (c&#8208;C6H5CH2) radicals produces both diphenylmethane and diphenylmethyl radicals, the concentration of the latter increasing with rising temperature. A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8211;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8211;1600&#8197;K) and low pressure (ca. 3&#8197;kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.

A second phenyl addition to the product radical forms both triphenylmethane and triphenylmethyl radicals, confirming the propagation of radical&#8211;radical chain reactions under the experimental conditions of high temperature (1100&#8211;1600&#8197;K) and low pressure (ca. 3&#8197;kPa). Similar chain reactions may contribute to particle growth in flames, the interstellar medium, and industrial reactors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Iridium Catalytic System Compatible with Inorganic and Organic Nitrogen Sources for Dual Asymmetric Reductive Amination Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27307-27311, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two successive asymmetric reductive aminations (ARAs) have been merged into one reaction system to generate enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amines. The iridium&#8208;phosphoramidite complex successfully manages the dual ARAs by using two distinctly different types of amine sources: an inorganic ammonium salt and an organic primary amine.







Abstract
Asymmetric reductive amination (ARA) is one of the most promising methods for the synthesis of chiral amines. Herein we report our efforts on merging two ARA reactions into a single&#8208;step transformation. Catalyzed by a complex formed from iridium and a steric hindered phosphoramidite, readily available and inexpensive aromatic ketones initially undergo the first ARA with ammonium acetate to afford primary amines, which serve as the amine sources for the second ARA, and finally provide the enantiopure C2&#8208;symmetric secondary amine products. The developed process competently enables the successive coupling of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources with ketones in the same reaction system. The Br&#248;nsted acid additive plays multiple roles in this procedure: it accelerates the formation of imine intermediates, minimizes the inhibitory effect of N&#8208;containing species on the iridium catalyst, and reduces the primary amine side products.

A new perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation protocol debuts: Consecutive triple fluorinations of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) generate (CF3)3C&#8722; species, which enables efficient nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation of various electrophiles. The C(CF3)3&#8208;containing products can be successfully applied in 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging.







Abstract
Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reaction has long remained a challenging task. We now report the use of 1,1&#8208;dibromo&#8208;2,2&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)ethylene (DBBF) as a practical reagent for perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylation reactions for the first time. Through a consecutive triple&#8208;fluorination process with DBBF and CsF, the (CF3)3C&#8722; species can be liberated and observed, which is able to serve as a robust nucleophilic perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylating agent for various electrophiles. The power of this synthetic protocol is evidenced by the efficient synthesis of structurally diverse perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated molecules. Multiple applications demonstrate the practicability of this method, as well as the superiority of perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated compounds as sensitive probes. The perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butylated product was successfully applied in 1H&#8208; and 19F&#8208;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment with an ultra&#8208;low field (ULF) MRI system.

         <title>Electrochemical Oxo&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes under Air: Facile Access to &#946;&#8208;Keto Sulfonyl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27271-27276, December 20, 2021. </description>

The generation of FSO2 radicals under electrochemical conditions is reported. Various sulfonyl fluorides and heterocycles, including a novel oxathiazole dioxide heterocycle, can be obtained in good to excellent yields. Some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives showed potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.







Abstract
Radical fluorosulfonylation is emerging as an appealing approach for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides, which have widespread applications in many fields, in particular in the context of chemical biology and drug development. Here, we report the first investigation of FSO2 radical generation under electrochemical conditions, and the establishment of a new and facile approach for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides via oxo&#8208;fluorosulfonylation of alkynes with sulfuryl chlorofluoride as the radical precursor and air as the oxidant. This electrochemical protocol is amenable to access two different products (&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides or &#945;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides) with the same reactants. The &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluoride products can be utilized as useful building blocks in the synthesis of various derivatives and heterocycles, including the first synthesis of an oxathiazole dioxide compound. Furthermore, some &#946;&#8208;keto sulfonyl fluorides and derivatives exhibited notably potent activities against Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.

         <title>Enzyme Catalysis in Non&#8208;Native Environment with Unnatural Selectivity Using Polymeric Nanoreactors</title>

Amphiphilic random copolymers were employed to construct enzyme nanoreactors for catalysis in an organic solvent. Unnatural selectivity over a range of substrates was introduced by tuning the cross&#8208;linking density.







Abstract
The utilization of enzymes for catalysis in organic solvents, while exhibiting selectivity to different substrates, is a big challenge. We report an amphiphilic random copolymer system that self&#8208;assembles with enzymes in an organic solvent to form nanoreactors. These encapsulated enzymes are not denatured and they do preserve the catalytic activity. The cross&#8208;linkable functional groups in the hydrophobic compartments of the polymers offer to control accessibility to the enzyme. This varied accessibility due to the polymer host, rather than the enzyme itself, endows the nanoreactor with an unnatural selectivity. The findings here highlight the significant potential of simple polymer&#8208;based enzyme nanoreactors to execute selective organic reactions under non&#8208;native conditions.

Pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbenes, also named cyclic&#8208;bentallenes (CBA), can be more basic than Verkade proazaphosphatrane and even Schwesinger phosphazene P4(tBu). With these results it is demonstrated that carbenes should not be overlooked as neutral purely organic superbases.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Pyrazol-4-ylidenes, a type of mesoionic carbenes, also named cyclic-bentallenes (CBA), can be more basic than Verkade proazaphosphatrane and even Schwesinger phosphazene P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;Bu). With these results it is demonstrated that carbenes should not be overlooked as neutral purely organic superbases.

         <title>Stabilization of Reactive Nitrene by Silylenes without Using a Reducing Metal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27206-27211, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uncharged univalent and reactive nitrene is captured and stabilized by silylenes. Two nitrene compounds are synthesized and fully characterized. The nitrene character was established by X&#8208;ray analysis, first&#8208;principles electronic structure studies using density functional theory, and natural bond orbital&#8208;based bonding analysis.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of nitrene reagents as the source of a nitrogen atom to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;incorporated R1LSi&#8208;N&#8592;SiLR2 (1) [L=PhC(NtBu)2; R1=NTMS2, R2=NTMS]. Compound 1 is synthesized by reacting LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 3.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at low temperature to afford a triene&#8208;like structural framework. Whereas the reaction of the LSi(I)&#8208;SiIL with 2.1&#8197;equivalents of Me3SiN3 at room temperature produced silaimine 2 with a central four&#8208;membered Si2N2 ring which is accompanied by a silylene LSi and a cleaved silylene fragment. 1 further reacts with AgOTf at room temperature to yield compound 3 which shows coordination of nitrene to silver with the triflate salt. The compounds 1 and 2 were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The quantum mechanical calculations reveal that compounds 1 and 2 have dicoordinated monovalent N atoms having two active lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs are stabilized by hyperconjugative interactions.

         <title>Combined Precursor Engineering and Grain Anchoring Leading to MA&#8208;Free, Phase&#8208;Pure, and Stable &#945;&#8208;Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskites for Efficient Solar Cells</title>

Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based additives in precursor solutions suppressed the formation of the undesired &#948; phase during the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskites, and heat&#8208;induced permeation of 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide (tBBAI) into inner perovskite grains stabilized the &#945; structure. Solar cells assembled from this material exhibited improved power conversion efficiency and stability.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Formamidinium lead iodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is one of the most promising candidate materials for high&#8208;efficiency and thermally stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its outstanding optoelectrical properties and high thermal stability. However, achieving a stable form of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 where both the composition and the phase are pure is very challenging. Herein, we report on a combined strategy of precursor engineering and grain anchoring to successfully prepare methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free and phase&#8208;pure stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films. The incorporation of volatile FA&#8208;based additives in the precursor solutions completely suppresses the formation of non&#8208;perovskite &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 during film crystallization. Grains of the desired &#945;&#8208;phase are anchored together and stabilized when 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium iodide is permeated into the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film interior via grain boundaries. This cooperative scheme leads to a significantly increased efficiency close to 21&#8201;% for FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells. Moreover, the stabilized PSCs exhibit improved thermal stability and maintained &#8776;90&#8201;% of their initial efficiency after storage at 50&#8201;&#176;C for over 1600&#8197;hours.

An unprecedented NiH&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and anti&#8208;selective intramolecular coupling of alkynones to construct O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;containing endocyclic allylic alcohols was developed. The choice of metal precursors plays a key role in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selectivity. This study offers a new anti&#8208;hydrocyclization mode for enantioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective NiH&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyclization of alkynones with unparalleled anti&#8208; and endocyclic selectivities is described. The choice of the precatalysts has significant influence in tuning the regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Using Ni(OTs)2/Phox as a precatalyst and (EtO)2MeSiH as a hydride source, an array of enantioenriched O&#8208;, N&#8208;, and S&#8208;containing heterocyclic tertiary allylic alcohols are obtained in 24&#8211;81&#8201;% yields with 80:20&#8211;99:1 er. Mechanistic investigations and synthetic application are also carried out. This study represents an efficient access to a set of allylic alcohols that are unable to access by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coupling reactions.

         <title>Supramolecular Nanopatterns of Molecular Spoked Wheels with Orthogonal Pillars: The Observation of a Fullerene Haze</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 52, Page 27264-27270, December 20, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular synthetic approach paves the way to nanoscale platform molecules for supramolecular graphite surface patterns at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. While a perylene dye bound at the end of the pillar remains fixed above the molecule center and points into solution, a fullerene ester bound at the same position performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.







Abstract
Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two&#8208;dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0&#8197;nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These also show that, in contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2&#8197;nm above the graphite substrate. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8211;pillar distances by 15&#8201;% and block unspecific intercalation.

While a perylene dye bound at the end of the pillar remains fixed above the molecule center and points into solution, a fullerene ester bound at the same position performs a tumbling motion that translates as a &#8220;haze&#8221; in the otherwise submolecularly resolved images.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular spoked wheels with intraannular functionalizable pillars are synthesized in a modular approach. The functionalities at their ends are variable, and a propargyl alcohol, a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyrate, and a perylene monoimide are investigated. All compounds form two-dimensional crystals on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. As determined by submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, the pillars adopt equilibrium distances of 6.0&#8197;nm. The fullerene has a residual mobility, limited by the length of the flexible connector unit. The experimental results are supported and rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations. These also show that, in contrast, the more rigidly attached perylene monoimide units remain oriented along the surface normal and maintain a smallest distance of 2&#8197;nm above the graphite substrate. The robust packing concept also holds for cocrystals with molecular hexagons that expand the pillar&#8211;pillar distances by 15&#8201;% and block unspecific intercalation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorinated S&#8208;Adenosylmethionine as a Reagent for Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Fluoromethylation</title>

In a biocatalytic approach to the production of fluorinated compounds, halide methyltransferases (HMTs) were found to form fluorinated S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Although too unstable for isolation, fluorinated SAM was accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases (MTs) to enable the fluoromethylation of small molecules (see scheme).







Abstract
Strategic replacement of protons with fluorine atoms or functional groups with fluorine&#8208;containing fragments has proven a powerful strategy to optimize the activity of therapeutic compounds. For this reason, the synthetic chemistry of organofluorides has been the subject of intense development and innovation for many years. By comparison, the literature on fluorine biocatalysis still makes for a slim chapter. Herein we introduce S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases as a new tool for the production of fluorinated compounds. We demonstrate the ability of halide methyltransferases to form fluorinated SAM (S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;S&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;L&#8208;homocysteine) from S&#8208;adenosylhomocysteine and fluoromethyliodide. Fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) is too unstable for isolation, but is accepted as a substrate by C&#8208;, N&#8208; and O&#8208;specific methyltransferases for enzyme&#8208;catalyzed fluoromethylation of small molecules.
