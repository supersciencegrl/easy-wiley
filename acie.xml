      <title>Prebiotic Phosphorylation and Concomitant Oligomerization of Deoxynucleosides to form DNA</title>
      <dc:description>Recent demonstrations of RNA&#8208;DNA chimeras enabling RNA and DNA replication, coupled with prebiotic co&#8208;synthesis of deoxyribo&#8208; and ribo&#8208;nucleotides, have resurrected the hypothesis of co&#8208;emergence of RNA and DNA. As further support, we show that diamidophosphate (DAP) with 2&#8208;aminoimidazole (amido)phosphorylates and oligomerizes deoxynucleosides to form DNA &#8211; under conditions similar to those of ribonucleosides. The pyrimidine 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;amidophosphates are formed in good (&#8776; 60%) yields. Intriguingly, the presence of pyrimidine nucleos(t)ides increased the yields of purine&#8208;deoxynucleotides (&#8776; 20%). Concomitantly, oligomerization (&#8776; 18&#8208;31%) is observed with predominantly 3',5'&#8208;phosphodiester DNA linkages, and some (&lt;5%) pyrophosphates. Combined with previous observations of DAP mediated chemistries and the constructive role of RDNA chimeras, the results reported here help set the stage for systematic investigation of a systems chemistry approach of RNA&#8208;DNA coevolution.</dc:description>

When conjugated to 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;6&#8208;aminobenzothiazole and a peptide substrate specific for the tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzyme furin, it can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles that can be detected by chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST MRI). &#160;We report here that these nano&#8208;assemblies can also be detected with high specificity in furin&#8208;overexpressing tumor cells by Raman spectroscopy with a distinct scattering signature and demonstrate the utility of this sensing mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that Raman spectroscopy could be used for high&#8208;resolution image&#8208;guided surgery to precisely delineate tumor margins during and after resection in real&#8208;time as well as to determine microscopic tumor invasion and multifocal locoregional tumor spread, which are currently impossible to visualize with available imaging technologies including CEST MRI.</dc:description>

      <title>Identifying the Critical Anion&#8722;Cation Coordination to Regulate Electric Double Layer for Efficient Lithium Metal Anode Interface</title>
      <dc:description>The persistent efforts to reveal the formation and evolution mechanisms of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are of fundamental significance for the rational regulation. In this work, through combined theoretical and experimental model investigations, we elucidate that the electric double layer (EDL) chemistry at the electrode/electrolyte interface instead of the thermodynamic stability of electrolyte components predominately controls the competitive reduction reactions during SEI construction on Li metal anode. Specifically, the negatively&#8208;charged surface of Li metal will prompt substantial cation enrichment and anion deficiency within the EDL. Necessarily, only the species participating in the solvation shell of cations could be electrostatically accumulated in proximity of Li metal surface and thereafter be preferentially reduced during sustained dynamic cycling. Incorporating multi&#8208;valent cation additives to more effectively drag the favorable anionic SEI enablers into EDL is validated as a promising strategy to upgrade the Li protection performance. The conclusions drawn herein afford deeper understandings to bridge the EDL principle, cation solvation, and SEI formation, shedding fresh light on the targeted regulation of reactive alkali metal interfaces.</dc:description>

      <title>Assembly of the mitochondrial Complex I assembly complex suggests a regulatory role for deflavination</title>
      <dc:description>Fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation (FAO) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are mitochondrial redox processes that generate ATP. The biogenesis of the respiratory Complex I, a 1 MDa multiprotein complex that is responsible for initiating OXPHOS, is mediated by assembly factors including the mitochondrial complex I assembly (MCIA) complex. However, the organisation and the role of the MCIA complex are still unclear. Here we show that ECSIT functions as the bridging node of the MCIA core complex. Furthermore, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy together with biochemical and biophysical experiments reveal that the C&#8208;terminal domain of ECSIT directly binds to the vestigial dehydrogenase domain of the FAO enzyme ACAD9 and induces its deflavination, switching ACAD9 from its role in FAO to an MCIA factor. These findings provide the structural basis for the MCIA complex architecture and suggest a unique molecular mechanism for coordinating the regulation of the FAO and OXPHOS pathways to ensure an efficient energy production.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;Responsive Dynamic DNA&#8208;Origami&#8208;Based Plasmonic Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology offers a versatile toolbox for precise spatial and temporal manipulation of matter on the nanoscale. However, rendering DNA&#8208;based systems responsive to light has remained challenging. Here, we describe the remote&#160;manipulation of native (non&#8208;photoresponsive) chiral plasmonic molecules (CPMs) using light. Our strategy is based on the use of a photoresponsive medium comprising a merocyanine&#8208;based photoacid. Upon exposure to visible light, the medium decreases its pH, inducing the formation of DNA triplex links, leading to a spatial reconfiguration of the CPMs. The process can be reversed simply by turning the light off and it can be repeated for multiple cycles. The degree of the overall chirality change in an ensemble of CPMs depends on the CPM fraction undergoing reconfiguration, which, remarkably, depends on and can be tuned by the intensity of incident light. Such a dynamic remotely controlled system could aid in further advancing DNA&#8208;based devices and nanomaterials.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Fabrication of Crystalline Smart Materials for Rapid Detection and Efficient Removal of Ozone</title>
      <dc:description>Traditional ozone sensing and removal materials still suffer from high energy consumption and low efficiency. Thus, seeking new ozone&#8208;responsive materials with high efficiency and broad working conditions is of great significance. In this contribution, we first developed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for smart sensing and efficient removal of ozone. Notably, imine&#8208;based COFs possess dramatically fast optical responses (&lt;1 s) to ozone as low as 0.1 ppm under broad working conditions (e.g., in the presence or absence of moisture, room temperature). Moreover, we found that imine&#8208;based COFs can also be applied as excellent ozone removers that can efficiently reduce the ozone concentration below the recommended safety limit (&lt;0.1 ppm) for humans. The mechanism for the outstanding performance of imine&#8208;based COFs was in&#8208;depth unveiled by various characterization techniques and analyses. This study not only provides a new type of advanced materials for ozone sensing and removal but also broadens the application scope of COFs.</dc:description>

      <title>Ammonium&#8208;Ion Storage in Electrodeposited Manganese Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>NH4+  ions as charge carriers show great potential in aqueous rechargeable batteries. Herein, we study for the first time the NH4+  storage chemistry in electrodeposited manganese oxide (MnOx). MnOx  experiences morphology and phase transformation during charge/discharge in diluted ammonium acetate (NH 4Ac) electrolyte. The NH4Ac concentration plays an important role in NH4+  storage inside MnOx. The transformed MnOx  with layered structure delivers a high specific capacity of 176 mAh g&#8208;1  at the current density of 0.5 A g&#8208;1  , and exhibits good cycling stability over 10000 cycles in 0.5 M NH4Ac, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+  hosting materials. Experimental results suggest a solid&#8208;solution behavior associated with NH4+  migration in layered MnOx. Spectroscopy studies and theoretical calculations indicate that the reversible NH4+  insertion/deinsertion is accompanied by H bond formation/breaking between NH4+  and the MnOx  layers. These findings provide a new study prototype (i.e., layered MnOx) for NH4+&#8208;based energy storage and contribute to the fundamental understanding of the NH4+  storage mechanism in metal oxides.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Characterization of Two CO Molecules Bound to the Nitrogenase Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>As an approach towards unraveling the nitrogenase mechanism, we have studied the binding of CO to the active site FeMo&#8208;cofactor. CO is not only an inhibitor of nitrogenase, but it is also a substrate, undergoing reduction to hydrocarbons (Fischer&#8208;Tropsch&#8208;type chemistry). The C&#8208;C bond forming capabilities of nitrogenase suggest that multiple CO, or CO&#8208;derived ligands, bind to the active site. Herein, we report a crystal structure with two CO ligands coordinated to the FeMo&#8208;cofactor of the molybdenum nitrogenase at 1.33 &#197; resolution. In addition to the previously observed bridging CO ligand between Fe2 and Fe6 of the FeMo&#8208;cofactor, a new ligand binding mode is revealed through a second CO ligand coordinated terminally to Fe6. While the relevance of this state to nitrogenase&#8208;catalyzed reactions remains to be established, it highlights the privileged role for Fe2 and Fe6 in ligand binding, with multiple coordination modes available depending on the ligand and reaction conditions.</dc:description>

Sava&#8197;Gallis et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013012). Subtle compositional changes have a pronounced effect on intermetallic energy transfer, and thus, on the resulting photophysical properties. Concomitant multi&#8208;emissive spectra and luminescence lifetimes result in tags with both overt (visible) and covert (near infrared) properties, authenticated using orthogonal detection methodologies.

      <title>Isomerization Reactions in Anionic Mesoionic Carbene&#8208;Borates and Control of Properties and Reactivities in the Resulting CoII Complexes through Agostic Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Anionic borate&#8208;based bi&#8208;mesoionic carbenes based on 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;ylidenes show unique C&#8722;N isomerization reactions. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013376), Biprajit Sarkar and co&#8208;workers report on the isomerized ligands in CoII&#160;complexes. The picture shows these complexes, which, although having a similar first coordination sphere, differ in geometry, spin state and reactivity. All of these differences are caused by the control of the second coordination sphere, in which agostic interactions influence the cobalt center.

      <title>Sugar&#8208;Based Polymers from D&#8208;xylose: Living Cascade Polymerization, Tunable Degradation, and Small Molecule Release</title>
      <dc:description>
D&#8208;xylose can be transformed into a polymerizable enyne sugar&#8208;based monomer, as shown in the cover picture. Chalked in are the achieved properties of the various degradable polymers. The polymerization evolves a D&#8208;xylose&#8208;derived monomer to a full polymer chain which can be decomposed under mild acidic conditions, as explained by Tae&#8208;Lim Choi et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202012544). The act of drawing rough ideas on a board, a practice chemists still enjoy, and the coming to fruition of those ideas on a molecular level are represented by the 2D chalk board transition to 3D polymer.

      <title>NiSn Atomic Pair on Integrated Electrode for Synergistic Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical CO  2  reduction (CO  2  RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals offers an efficient way to mitigate global warming and energy supply issues. However, the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for CO  2  RR to boost reaction efficiency and guide understanding of catalytic mechanism remains a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a NiSn atomic pair electrocatalyst (NiSn&#8208;APC) on a hierarchical integrated electrode, which exhibits a synergistic effect in simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity of CO  2  RR to formate. The NiSn atomic pair consist of adjacent Ni and Sn coordinated with four nitrogen atoms (N  4  &#8208;Ni&#8208;Sn&#8208;N  4  ) respectively, which is confirmed by high&#8208;angle annular dark field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Typically, the as&#8208;prepared NiSn&#8208;APC displays an exceptional activity toward CO  2  RR to formate with a turnover frequency of 4752 h  &#8208;1  , a formate productivity of 36.7 mol h  &#8208;1  g  Sn  &#8208;1  and an utilization degree of active sites (57.9%), which are superior to the previously reported single&#8208;atomic catalysts (SACs). Moreover, both in situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;infrared (ATR&#8208;IR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculation verify the electron redistribution of Sn imposed by adjacent Ni, which reduces the energy barrier of *OCHO intermediate and makes this potential&#8208;determining step thermodynamically spontaneous. The NiSn synergistic catalysis for CO  2  RR in this work provides a successful paradigm for rational design and preparation of atomic pair electrocatalysts with largely enhanced performance.</dc:description>

      <title>An Aluminosilicate Zeolite Containing Rings of Tetrahedral Atoms with All Odd Numbers from Five to Eleven</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the synthesis, structure solution, and catalytic properties of PST&#8208;31 with an unprecedented framework topology. This high&#8208;silica (Si/Al = 16) zeolite was synthesized using a pyrazolium&#8208;based dication with a tetramethylene linker as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA) in hydroxide media. The PST&#8208;31 structure is built from new building layers containing 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 7&#8208;rings, which are connected by single 4&#8208;rings in the interlayer region to form a two&#8208;dimensional pore system. Its channels consist of [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] cavities and are thus delimited by 9&#8208;, 10&#8208;, and 11&#8208;rings. The OSDA cations in as&#8208;synthesized PST&#8208;31 were determined to reside without disorder in the large [4  2  .5  14  .6  4  .7  2  .9  4  ] cavities composed of smaller [4.5  6  .6.9.11] and [5.6.7.9.10.11] ones, leading to a symmetry coincidence between the OSDA and the surrounding zeolite cavity. The proton form of PST&#8208;31 was found to be selective for the cracking of  n  &#8208;hexane to light olefins.</dc:description>

      <title>Novel Series of Mononuclear Aluminum Complexes for High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices</title>
      <dc:description>Light metal complexes, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and aluminum (Al) complexes, are attractive candidates for the fabrication of thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Nevertheless, mononuclear Al complexes with delayed fluorescence have not been developed so far. In this study, we successfully developed a novel series of highly luminescent Al complexes with two phenylacridine&#8208;modified asymmetric acetylacetonate&#8208;type ligands. These complexes exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of up to 79% in the solid state with a short delayed fluorescence lifetime of approximately 4 &#956;s. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) using these Al complexes exhibit excellent performance with an external quantum efficiency of 17.5% at 100 cd/m2. This is the best performance in light metal&#8208;based TADF OLEDs reported so far. The results are expected to guide the advancement of the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lighting technology.</dc:description>

      <title>Piptides: New, Easily Accessible Chemotypes For Interactions&#160;With Biomolecules</title>
      <dc:description>Small molecule probe development is pivotal in biomolecular science. Research described here was undertaken to develop a non&#8208;peptidic chemotype, piptides, that is amenable to convenient, iterative solid&#8208;phase syntheses, and useful in biomolecular probe discovery. Piptides can be made from readily accessible pip acid building blocks and have good proteolytic and pH stabilities. An illustrative application of piptides against a protein&#8208;protein interaction (PPI) target was explored. The Exploring Key Orientations, EKO, strategy was used to evaluate piptide candidates for this. A library of only 14 piptides contained five members that disrupted epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor, EGFR, at low micromolar concentrations. These piptides also caused apoptotic cell death, and antagonized EGF&#8208;induced phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine residues in EGFR.</dc:description>

A zwitterionic polydopamine engineered interface was designed to suppress nonspecific protein binding in complex biological fluids while enhancing interfacial electron transfer, the electrochemical stability of the electrode, and low acute neuroinflammatory responses. In their Communication on page&#8197;23445, M.

      <title>Topological Distortion Driven Amorphous Spherical MOFs for High Quality Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as appealing platforms to construct microlasers owing to their compelling characters combining excellent stability of inorganic materials and processable characters of organic materials. However, MOFs microstructures developed thus far are generally composed of multiple edge boundaries due to their crystalline nature, which consequently raises significant scattering losses that are detrimental to lasing performance. In this work, we propose a strategy to overcome the above drawback by designing spherically&#8208;shaped MOFs microcavities. Such spherical MOFs microstructures are constructed by amorphizing MOFs with topological distortion network through introducing flexible building blocks into the growth environment. With an ultra&#8208;smooth surface and excellent circular boundaries, the acquired spherical microcavities possess a Q factor as high as ~10  4  and can provide sufficient feedback for high quality single&#8208;mode lasing oscillations. We hope that these results will pave an avenue for the construction of new types of flexible MOFs&#8208;based photonic components.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Resistance in the Biosynthesis of Fungal Macrolides Involving Cycles of Extracellular Oxidative Activation and Intracellular Reductive Inactivation</title>
      <dc:description>Self&#8208;resistance genes are employed by many microbial producers of bioactive natural products to avoid self&#8208;harm. Here, we describe a unique strategy for self&#8208;resistance toward a macrolide antibiotic, A26771B (  1  ), identified by elucidating its biosynthetic pathway in the fungus  Penicillium egyptiacum  . A highly reducing polyketide synthase and a  trans  &#8208;acting thioesterase generate the macrolide backbone, and a P450 and an acyltransferase respectively catalyze hydroxylation and succinylation to form the prodrug berkeleylactone E (  2  ). Then, extracellular oxidative activation by a secreted flavin&#8208;dependent oxidase forms  1  , while intracellular reductive inactivation by a short&#8208;chain reductase reforms  2  , forming a redox cycle.

Abstract
Proposed are Prussian blue analogue hosts with ordered and continuous channels, and electrocatalytic functionality with open Co and Fe species, which facilitate maximum I2 utilization efficiency and direct I2 to I&#8722; conversion kinetics of the I2 reduction reaction, and free up 1/3 I&#8722; from I3&#8722;. Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6] exhibits a low energy barrier (0.47&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and low Tafel slope (76.74&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Accordingly, the Co[Co1/4Fe3/4(CN)6]/I2//Zn battery delivers a capacity of 236.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a rate performance with 151.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The battery delivers both high energy density and high&#8208;power density of 305.5&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and 109.1&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, higher than I2//Zn batteries reported to date. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state flexible batteries were constructed. A 100&#8197;mAh high capacity solid&#8208;state I2//Zn battery is demonstrated with excellent cycling performance of 81.2&#8201;% capacity retained after 400 cycles.

      <title>Dimerization of Linear Butenes and Pentenes in an Acidic Zeolite (H&#8208;MFI)</title>
      <dc:description>
Dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites yield, rather than branched alkenes, alkanes featuring a cyclohexane ring. The absence of any C=C double bond in the latter explains not only the observed change of the IR spectra, but also the observation that oligomerization stops at the dimer.







Abstract
Quantum chemical evidence is produced to show that dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted sites in H&#8208;MFI yields alkanes featuring cyclohexane rings rather than branched alkenes. The absence of any C=C double bond in the formed cyclic alkane explains the observations that oligomerization stops at the dimer. The calculated reaction enthalpies for the dimerization of 2&#8208;pentene in the gas phase are &#8722;84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for branched alkenes, but &#8722;153 and &#8722;154&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for alkyl&#8208;cyclopentane and &#8208;hexane, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;Dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites yield, rather than branched alkenes, alkanes featuring a cyclohexane ring. The absence of any C=C double bond in the latter explains not only the observed change of the IR spectra, but also the observation that oligomerization stops at the dimer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum chemical evidence is produced to show that dimerization of linear butenes and pentenes at zeolitic Br&#248;nsted sites in H&#8208;MFI yields alkanes featuring cyclohexane rings rather than branched alkenes. The absence of any C=C double bond in the formed cyclic alkane explains the observations that oligomerization stops at the dimer. The calculated reaction enthalpies for the dimerization of 2&#8208;pentene in the gas phase are &#8722;84&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for branched alkenes, but &#8722;153 and &#8722;154&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for alkyl&#8208;cyclopentane and &#8208;hexane, respectively. Together with calculated adsorption enthalpies of the dimers, &#8722;111 and &#8722;127&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, this implies surface dimer formation enthalpies of &#8722;264 and &#8722;281&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, in close agreement with the experimental value of &#8722;285&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <title>Glycoengineering of NK Cells with Glycan Ligands of CD22 and Selectins for B&#8208;Cell Lymphoma Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
We report the use of a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to create CD22&#8208;specific ligands and sialyl Lewis X on NK cells (NK&#8208;92MI or CIK cells) to target and eradicate B&#8208;lymphoma efficiently.







Abstract
CD22, a member of Siglec family of sialic acid binding proteins, has restricted expression on B cells. Antibody&#8208;based agents targeting CD22 or CD20 on B lymphoma and leukemia cells exhibit clinical efficacy for treating these malignancies, but also attack normal B cells leading to immune deficiency. Here, we report a chemoenzymatic glycocalyx editing strategy to introduce high&#8208;affinity and specific CD22 ligands onto NK&#8208;92MI and cytokine&#8208;induced natural killer cells to achieve tumor&#8208;specific CD22 targeting. These CD22&#8208;ligand modified cells exhibited significantly enhanced tumor cell binding and killing in&#8197;vitro without harming healthy B cells. For effective lymphoma cell killing in&#8197;vivo, we further functionalized CD22 ligand&#8208;modified NK&#8208;92MI cells with the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X to promote trafficking to bone marrow. The dual&#8208;functionalized cells resulted in the efficient suppression of B lymphoma in a xenograft model. Our results suggest that nature killer cells modified with glycan ligands to CD22 and selectins promote both targeted killing of B lymphoma cells and improved trafficking to sites where the cancer cells reside, respectively.

      <dc:description>Aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AABs) are regarded as a promising next&#8208;generation energy storage device, and the current reported cathodes for AABs mainly focused on inorganic materials which usually implement a typical Al  3+  ions (de)insertion mechanism.

Herein, we employ an organic compound with redox&#8208;active moieties, phenazine (PZ), as the cathode material in AABs. Different from conventional inorganic materials confined by limited lattice spacing and rigid structure, the flexible organic molecules allow a large&#8208;size Al&#8208;complex co&#8208;intercalation via reversible redox active centers (&#8211;C=N&#8211;) of PZ. This co&#8208;intercalation behavior can effectively reduce desolvation penalty, and substantially lower the Coulombic repulsion during the ion (de)insertion process. Consequently, this organic cathode exhibits a high capacity and excellent cyclability, which exceeds those of most reported electrode materials for AABs.

      <dc:description>Variation of DNA conformation plays important roles in regulating gene expression and mediating drug&#8208;DNA interactions. However, direct probing transient DNA conformation changes remains challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of this process. Here, we demonstrate a label&#8208;free fluorescence method to monitor transient DNA conformation changes in DNA structures with various lengths and shapes using a DNA intercalator, K21. We find that K21 can form transient excimers on the surface of DNA and the ratiometric emission of monomer and excimer strongly correlate to DNA transient conformation stability in a variety of DNA structures, including i&#8208;motifs, G&#8208;quadruplex structures, and single nucleotides mutation at random positions. We further analyze the conformation dynamics of a single plasmid before and after enzyme digestion with confocal fluorescence microscopy. This method provides a label&#8208;free fluorescence strategy to probe the transient conformation changes of DNA structures, and holds great potential in uncovering transient genomic processes in living cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Non&#8208;Carbohydrate Glycomimetics as Inhibitors of Calcium(II)&#8208;binding Lectins</title>
      <dc:description>Because of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, lectins are considered novel drug targets. Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes LecA and LecB in the infection process. Inhibition of both lectins with carbohydrate&#8208;derived molecules can reduce biofilm formation to restore antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we focused on non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitors for LecA to explore new avenues for lectin inhibition. From a screening cascade we obtained one experimentally confirmed hit, a catechol, belonging to the well&#8208;known PAINS compounds. Rigorous analyses validated electron&#8208;deficient catechols as millimolar LecA inhibitors. The first co&#8208;crystal structure of a non&#8208;carbohydrate inhibitor in complex with a bacterial lectin clearly demonstrates the catechol mimicking the binding of natural glycosides with LecA. Importantly, catechol 3 is the first non&#8208;carbohydrate lectin ligand that binds bacterial and mammalian calcium(II)&#8208;binding lectins, giving rise to this fundamentally new class of glycomimetics.</dc:description>

Importantly, catechol 3 is the first non&#8208;carbohydrate lectin ligand that binds bacterial and mammalian calcium(II)&#8208;binding lectins, giving rise to this fundamentally new class of glycomimetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Alkyne 1,1&#8208;Hydroboration to a Reactive Frustrated P/B&#8208;H Lewis Pair.</title>
      <dc:description>The Mes2P&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;SiMe3 alkyne reacts with the borane H2B&#8208;Fmes by means of a rare 1,1&#8208;hydroboration reaction to give an unsaturated C2&#8208;bridged P/B&#8208;H functional Lewis pair. Most of its reactions are determined by the presence of the B&#8208;H functionality at the FLP function and the activated connecting carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. It reduces carbon monoxide to the formyl stage. With nitriles it reacts in an extraordinary way: it undergoes a reaction sequence that eventually results in the formation of a P&#8208;substituted 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2&#8208;azaborole derivative. Several similar examples were found. In one case a P&#8208;ylide was isolated that was related to an intermediate of the reaction sequence. It subsequently opened in an alternative way to give an alkenyl borane product.</dc:description>

      <title>Gradient Solid Electrolyte Interphase and Lithium ion Solvation Regulated by Bisfluoroacetamide for Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The structure and components of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are extremely important to influence the performance of full cells, which is determined by the formulation of electrolyte used. However, it is still challenging to control the formation of high&#8208;quality SEI from structure to components. Herein, we designed bisfluoroacetamide (BFA) as the electrolyte additive for the construction of a gradient solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure that consists of a lithophilic surface with C&#8208;F bonds to uniformly capture Li ions and a LiF&#8208;rich bottom layer to guide the rapid transportation of Li ions, endowing the homogeneous deposition of Li ions. Moreover, the BFA molecule changes the Li  +  solvation structure by reducing free solvents in electrolyte to improve the antioxidant properties of electrolyte and prevent the extensive degradation of electrolyte on the cathode surface, which can make sure superior cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) with high&#8208;content LiF. In addition, the Li||LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  (NCM622) full cells show excellent cycling stability (a high capacity of 149 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 200 cycles at 0.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) and good rate capability (a capacity of 117 mA h g  &#8208;1  at a high current density of 5 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) when NCM622 was used as the cathode. This work demonstrates that the design of electrolyte additives is powerful to construct the structure and components of high&#8208;quality SEI and CEI through theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Artificial Heterointerfaces Achieve Delicate Reaction Kinetics towards Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrazine Oxidation Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical water splitting for H2 production is limited by the sluggish&#160;anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus using hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) to replace OER has received great attention.

Although nanoparticle vehicles are promising in overcoming biological barriers for drug delivery, fibrosis causes hypoxia, immunosuppression and limited immunocytes infiltration, and thus reduces antitumor efficacy of nanosystems.

The drugs&#8208;loaded nanoassemblies disassociate into individual CDs to release LOS to mitigate stroma and hypoxia in response to CAFs. The individual CDs carrying DOX and Fe ion efficiently penetrate deep into tumor to trigger intensified immune responses.

      <title>Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging of T Lymphocytes</title>
      <dc:description>Development of real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive imaging probes to assess infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) is critical to predict the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, which however remains challenging. We herein report an activatable semiconducting polymer nanoprobe (SPNP) for near&#8208;infrared florescence (NIRF) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of a biomarker (granzyme B) associated with activation of CTLs. SPNP comprises a semiconducting polymer (SP) conjugated with a granzyme B cleavable and dye&#8208;labeled peptide as the side chain, both of which emit NIRF and PA signals. After systemic administration, SPNP passively targets the tumor and in&#8208;situ reacts with granzyme B to release the dye&#8208;labeled peptide, leading to decreased NIRF and PA signals from the dye but unchanged signals from the polymer. Such ratiometric NIRF and PA signals of SPNP correlate well with the expression level of granzyme B and intratumoral population of CTLs. Thus, this study not only presents the first PA probes for&#160;  in vivo  &#160;imaging of immune activation but also provides a molecular design strategy that can be generalized for molecular imaging of other immune&#8208;related biomarkers.</dc:description>

      <title>A Systematic Study of Unsaturation in Lipid Nanoparticles Leads to Improved mRNA Transfection In Vivo</title>
      <dc:description>Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) represent the leading concept for mRNA delivery. Unsaturated lipids play important roles in nature with potential for mRNA therapeutics but are difficult to access through chemical synthesis. To systematically study the role of unsaturation, modular reactions were utilized to access a library of 91 amino lipids, enabled by the synthesis of unsaturated thiols. An ionizable lipid series (4A3) emerged from  in vitro  and  in vivo  screening, where the 4A3 core with a citronellol&#8208;based (Cit) periphery emerged as best. We studied the interaction between LNPs and a model endosomal membrane where 4A3&#8208;Cit demonstrated superior lipid fusion over saturated lipids, suggesting its unsaturated tail promotes endosomal escape. Furthermore, 4A3&#8208;Cit significantly improved mRNA delivery efficacy  in vivo  via Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT), resulting in 18&#8208;fold increased protein expression over parent LNPs. These findings provide insight into how lipid unsaturation promotes mRNA delivery and demonstrate how lipid mixing can enhance efficacy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>pH monitoring in tumor lesions provide abundant physiological information. However, currently developed pH sensors only achieve sensitive detection in the settled response region around the pH transition point (pHt). To realize tumor pH monitoring with high sensitivity in wider response region, we herein design a serial of pHt adjustable sensors (pTAS) through simply regulating the component ratio of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission aza&#8208;BODIPY (NAB) donor and pH sensitive rhodamine&#8208;based pre&#8208;acceptor (NRh) in F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system. Combining the pH response regions of pTAS, a twofold widened pH detection range (6.11&#8208;7.22) is obtained compared to the pHt settled sensor (6.38&#8208;6.94). With pHt adjustable feature, in vivo tumor pH increase and decrease process could be dynamically visualized through dual&#8208;channel ratiometric bioimaging in NIR&#8208;II window with coefficient of variation under 1% compared to the standard pH meter.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable eg orbital occupancy in Heusler compounds for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Heusler compounds have great potential in electrocatalysis due to their mechanical robustness, metallic conductivity, and wide tunability in the electronic structure and element compositions. This study reports the first application of Co  2  YZ  type Heusler compounds as electrocatalysts towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A range of Co  2  YZ  crystals was synthesized through the arc&#8208;melting method and the  e  g  orbital filling of Co was precisely regulated by varying  Y  and  Z  sites of the compound. A strong correlation between the  e  g  orbital filling of reactive Co sites and OER activity was found on Co  2  Mn  Z  compounds (  Z  = Ti, Al, V, and Ga) whereby higher catalytic current was achieved with  e  g  orbital filling approaching to unity. A similar trend of  e  g  orbital filling on the reactivity of cobalt sites was also observed for other set of Heusler compounds (Co  2  V  Z  ,  Z  = Sn and Ga). This work demonstrates proof of concept of application of Heusler compounds as a new class of OER electrocatalyst and the influence of the manipulation of the spin orbitals on their catalytic performances.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the diffraction limit by analyzing intensity fluctuations of statistically independent emitters in a time series of images. The final images are background&#8208;free and show confocality and enhanced spatial resolution (super&#8208;resolution). Fluorophore photobleaching, however, is a key limitation for recording long time&#8208;series of images that will allow for the calculation of higher order SOFI results with correspondingly increased resolution. Here, we demonstrate that photobleaching can be circumvented by using fluorophore labels that reversibly and transiently bind to a target, and which are being replenished from a buffer which serves as a reservoir. Using fluorophore&#8208;labeled short DNA oligonucleotides, we labeled cellular structures with target&#8208;specific antibodies that contain complementary DNA sequences and record the fluctuation events caused by transient emitter binding. We show that this concept bypasses extensive photobleaching and facilitates two&#8208;color imaging of cellular structures with SOFI.</dc:description>

      <title>Three&#8208;Component Alkene Difunctionalization via Direct and Selective Activation of Aliphatic C&#8208;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Catalytic alkene difunctionalization is a powerful strategy for the rapid assembly of complex molecules and has wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry. Despite significant progress, a  compelling  challenge that still needs to be solved is to install highly functionalized C(sp  3  )&#8208;hybridized centers without requiring pre&#8208;activated substrates. We herein report that inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize decatungstate photo&#8208;HAT, in combination with nickel catalysis, provides a versatile platform for three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization through direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8208;H bonds. Compared with previous studies, the significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary and primary C(sp  3  )&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Catalytic alkene difunctionalization is a powerful strategy for the rapid assembly of complex molecules and has wide range of applications in synthetic chemistry. Despite significant progress, a  compelling  challenge that still needs to be solved is to install highly functionalized C(sp  3  )&#8208;hybridized centers without requiring pre&#8208;activated substrates. We herein report that inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize decatungstate photo&#8208;HAT, in combination with nickel catalysis, provides a versatile platform for three&#8208;component alkene difunctionalization through direct and selective activation of aliphatic C&#8208;H bonds. Compared with previous studies, the significant advantages of this strategy are that the most abundant hydrocarbons are used as feedstocks, and various highly functionalized tertiary, secondary and primary C(sp  3  )&#8208;hybrid centers can be easily installed. The practicability of this strategy is demonstrated in the selective late&#8208;stage functionalization of natural products and the concise synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant molecules including Piragliatin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ultra&#8208;low molecular weight photoswitchable hydrogelators</title>
      <dc:description>Two photoswitchable arylazopyrozoles form hydrogels at a concentration of 1.2% (w/v). With a molecular weight of 258.28 g/mol, these are the lowest known molecular weight hydrogelators that respond reversibly to light.

In the case of the  meta  &#8208;arylazopyrozole, cryogenic transmission electron microscopy suggests that the 29&#177;7 nm wide sheets in the  E  &#8208;gel state narrow to 13&#177;2 nm upon photoswitching to the predominantly  Z  &#8208;solution state. Photoswitching for  meta  &#8208;arylazopyrozole is reversible through cycles of 365 nm and 520 nm excitation with little fatigue. The release of a Rhodamine B dye encapsulated in gels formed by the arylazopyrozoles is accelerated more than 20&#8208;fold upon photoswitching with 365 nm light, demonstrating these materials are suitable for light&#8208;controlled cargo release.</dc:description>

      <title>Light&#8208;triggered transformable ferrous ion delivery system for photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has been recognized as an emerging and alternative tumor therapeutic modality, which mainly involved the catalytic generation of highly toxic hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) from hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ) through metal ions&#8208;mediated Fenton or Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Among metal ions, ferrous ion (Fe  2+  ) is a classical catalyst ion, however, it suffers easy oxidation and systemic side effects. Therefore, the development of controllable Fe  2+  delivery system is a big challenge to maintain its valence state, reduce toxicity and improve therapeutic efficacy. Here, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;triggered transformable Fe  2+  delivery agent (denoted as LET&#8208;6) for fluorescence (FL) and photoacoustic (PA) dual&#8208;modality imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The LET&#8208;6 was composed of cyanine analogue (tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe) and distearoylphosphoethanolamine&#8208;polyethylene glycol (DSPE&#8208;PEG). The   tPy&#8208;Cy&#8208;Fe  contains a cyanine structure for FL/PA imaging and a chelating ligand, 4'&#8208;(amino&#8208; methyl phenyl)&#8208;2,2':6',2"&#8208;terpyridine (tPy), for  Fe  2+  binding  . Thermal expansion caused by 808 nm laser irradiation triggered the transformation of LET&#8208;6 to expose Fe  2+  from its hydrophobic layer, which primed the catalytic breakdown of endogenous H  2  O  2  in tumor microenvironment, thus generating abundant of &#8226;OH for enhanced CDT. The LET&#8208;6 showed remarkable therapeutic effects under laser irradiation  ,  both in vitro and in vivo, achieving 100% tumor elimination after just once treatment. This high&#8208;performance Fe  2+  delivery system provides a sound basis for future metal&#8208;ions&#8208;mediated cancer synergistic therapy.</dc:description>

      <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Enantioselectivity in 3D Porous Chiral Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but the confinement effect of frameworks on molecular catalysts has yet to be explored. Here we demonstrate the utilization of 3D COFs with well&#8208;defined porous channels capable of inducing chiral molecular catalysts from non&#8208;enantioselective to highly enantioselective in catalyzing organic transformations, sharply different from the typical methods for tailoring enantioselectivities by varying steric and electronic properties of molecular catalysts.

Obviously enhanced Br&#248;nsted acidity was observed for the chiral BINOL units that are uniformly distributed within the tubular channels compared to the non&#8208;immobilized acids. This facilitates the Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis of cyclocondensation of aldehydes and anthranilamides to produce 2,3&#8208;dihydroquinazolinones. While homogeneous BINOL controls display no enantioselectivity and/or low activity, constraint of their conformations in CCOFs leads to up to 91% isolated yield with 97% ee.

In this work, a series of azo&#8208;based macrocyclic arenes  1  ,  2  ,  3  and  4  distinguished by the substituted positions of azo groups are rationally designed and synthesized via a fragment cyclization method. From the crystal and computed structures of  1  ,  2  and  3  , we observe that the cavity size of these azo&#8208;macrocycles decreases gradually upon  E  &#8594;  Z  photoisomerization. Moreover, light&#8208;controlled host&#8211;guest complexations between azo&#8208;macrocycle  1  and guest molecules (7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane, terephthalonitrile) are successfully achieved. This work provides a simple and effective method to prepare azo&#8208;macrocycles, and the light&#8208;responsive molecular encapsulation systems in this work may further advance the design and applications of novel photo&#8208;responsive host&#8211;guest systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Single Pt Atom Doping to Silver Clusters Enables Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;Blue Photon Upconversion</title>
      <dc:description>Photon upconversion (UC) from near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible has been realized using&#160;singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet absorption of sensitizers, which are currently&#160;limited to osmium complexes and semiconductor nanocrystals.&#160;Motivated by the atomically precise tunability of electronic structure and photophysical properties of noble metal clusters, which often possess absorption bands that extend into the NIR region, we investigated MAg  24  (SR)  18  &#160;(M = Ag, Pt; SR = 2,4&#8208;dimethylbenzenethiolate) clusters as a new NIR&#8208;absorbing sensitizer for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation UC. Combined with a blue light emitter, the NIR excitation&#160;(  &#955;  ex  &#160;= 785 nm) of Ag  25  (SR)  18  results in no UC emission, while PtAg  24  (SR)  18  &#160;exhibits strong UC emission. This enhancement is primarily due to a significant increase in the intersystem crossing quantum yield of the cluster associated with the spin&#8208;orbit coupling enhancement in the M@Ag  12  core.</dc:description>

      <title>Accurate Determination of the Quantity and Spatial Distribution of Counterions around a Spherical Macroion</title>
      <dc:description>The distribution of counterions around a macroion is an important feature for macroionic systems. Here we report the determination of the accurate number and the spatial distribution of countercations (Sr  2+  , Rb  +  ) around a rigid, spherical, 2.9&#8208;nm size polyoxometalate cluster, {Mo  132  }  42&#8208;  ,  using anomalous small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (ASAXS). The results show that both Rb  +  and Sr  2+  ions have shorter diffuse lengths than theoretical prediction. In addition, most of Rb  +  ions are closely associated with {Mo  132  } by staying near the skeleton of {Mo  132  } or in the Stern layer, whereas Sr  2+  ions preferred to loosely associate with {Mo  132  } in the diffuse layer. The results also explain the observations that monovalent Rb  +  ions have a stronger affinity towards {Mo  132  } in comparison to divalent Sr  2+  ions, as well as the anomalous lower critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of {Mo  132  } in the presence of Rb  +  ions compared to Sr  2+  ions.   The anomalous CCC behavior of {Mo  132  } can be attributed to most of the negative charges being located on the inner surface of its cavity. The longer anion&#8208;cation distance weakens the Coulomb interaction and, hence, making the enthalpy change due to the breakage of hydration layers of cations more important in regulating the counterion&#8208;{Mo  132  } interaction. Macroions with charges distributed on their external surfaces, e.g., {U  60  }, do not show such abnormal behavior.</dc:description>

      <title>Simultaneous dual&#8208;gene diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 based on CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated lateral flow assay</title>
      <dc:description>Accurate and large&#8208;scale screening of infected individuals has proven to be an effective means to control the spread of COVID&#8208;19. Currently, many assays have been developed to meet the huge testing requirements and the availability of diverse detection settings. However, few methods emphasize the capability to simultaneously detect two genes in a single test, which is a key measure to improve detection accuracy, as adopted by the gold standard RT&#8208;qPCR method. Herein, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;line lateral flow assay (TL&#8208;LFA) combined with multiplex reverse transcription&#8208;recombinase polymerase amplification (RT&#8208;RPA) for rapid and simultaneous dual&#8208;gene detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in a single strip test. This assay is characterized by the detection of envelope (E) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) genes from cell&#8208;cultured SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viral RNA standards,&#160;showing a sensitivity of 100 RNA copies per reaction (25 &#956;L). Furthermore, dual&#8208;gene analysis of 64 nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples showed 100% negative predictive agreement (NPA) and 97.14% positive predictive agreement (PPA). Expectantly, this developed platform will provide a more accurate and convenient pathway for diagnosis of COVID&#8208;19 or other infectious diseases in low&#8208;resource regions.</dc:description>
