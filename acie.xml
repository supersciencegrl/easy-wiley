         <title>Solution&#8208;Grown Chloride Perovskite Crystal of Red Afterglow</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide&#8208;based afterglow materials were usually produced through high&#8208;temperature treatment (&gt; 1000 &#176;C), which brought both considerable energy consumption and safety risk to manufacturer. Here, we report the growth of a halide&#8208;based double perovskite, Cs  2  Na  x  Ag  1&#8208;x  InCl  6  :y%Mn, via a facile hydrothermal reaction at 180 &#176;C. Through a co&#8208;doping strategy of both Na  +  and Mn  2+  , the as&#8208;prepared crystals exhibited a red afterglow featuring a high color purity (~ 100%) and a long duration time (&gt; 5400 s), three orders of magnitude longer than those solution&#8208;processed organic afterglow crystals. The energy transfer (ET) process between self&#8208;trapped excitons (STE) and activators was investigated through time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, which suggested an ET efficiency up to 41%. Importantly, the nominal concentration of dopants, especially in the case of Na  +  , was found a useful tool to control both energy level and number distribution of traps. Cryogenic afterglow measurements suggested that the afterglow phenomenon was likely governed by thermal&#8208;activated exciton diffusion and electron tunneling process. Our work provided a convenient access to a new class of afterglow materials with low lattice energy, representing a paradigm for low&#8208;temperature synthesis of afterglow crystals.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium Nitride Nanozyme for pH&#8208;Responsive and Irradiation Enhanced Cascade Catalytic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozyme&#8208;based tumor catalytic therapy is an emerging therapeutic method with high reactivity in response to tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome the current limitations of deficient catalytic activity of nanozymes, we studied the contributing factors of enzymatic activity based on non&#8208;metallic atom doping and irradiation. Except for the chemical state of transition metal element, we demonstrated that nitrogen doping significantly enhanced the peroxidase (POD) activity of Ti&#8208;based nanozymes experimentally and theoretically for the first time. Based on the excellent NIR adsorption induced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and photothermal effect, the enzymatic activity of TiN NPs was further improved under NIR laser irradiation. Hence, an acidic TME&#8208;responsive and irradiation mediated cascade nanocatalyst (TLGp) is presented by using TiN NPs encapsulated liposomes linked with pH&#8208;responsive PEG&#8208;modified glucose oxidase (GOx). The integration of pH&#8208;responsive GOx&#8208;mediated H  2  O  2  self&#8208;supply, nitrogen&#8208;doping and irradiation enhanced enzymatic activity of TiN NPs, and mild&#8208;photothermal therapy, endow TLGp effective tumor inhibition with minimal side effects in vivo.</dc:description>

         <title>Metathesis Cascade&#8208;Triggered Depolymerization of Enyne Self&#8208;Immolative Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel class of enyne self&#8208;immolative polymers (SIPs) capable of metathesis cascade&#8208;triggered depolymerization is reported. Studies on model compounds established 1,6&#8208;enyne structures for efficient metathesis cascade reactions. SIPs incorporating the optimized 1,6&#8208;enyne motif were prepared via both polycondensation and iterative exponential growth approaches. These SIPs demonstrated excellent stability in strong acid,&amp;nbsp;base, nucleophiles, or at elevated temperatures, and can undergo efficient and complete depolymerization once triggered by a metathesis catalyst. Further studies revealed that introducing a terminal alkene to the chain end of the enyne SIPs improved the depolymerization efficiency, and established their potential as stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Enhanced Antimicrobial Activity of Polymers Containing an Embedded Photosensitiser</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work presents the synthesis of a novel photosensitive acrylate monomer for use as both a self&#8208;catalyst in the photoinduced electron/energy transfer &#8211; reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerisation process and a photosensitiser (PS) for antibacterial applications. A range of hydrophilic, cationic, and antimicrobial formulations are explored to compare the antibacterial effects between charged and non&#8208;charged polymers. Covalent attachment of catalyst to well&#8208;defined linear polymer chains has no effect on polymerisation control, or singlet oxygen generation. The addition of PS to polymers provides activity against gram&#8208;positive  S. aureus  for all polymer formulations, resulting in up to a 99.99999% killing efficacy in 30 min. Of note is that antimicrobial peptide mimetic polymers previously active against  P. aeruginosa  , but not  S. aureus  , gain significant bactericidal activity against  S. aureus  through the inclusion of PS groups, with 99.998% killing efficiency after 30 min incubation with light. In essence, a broader spectrum of antimicrobial activity is achieved using two distinct mechanisms of bactericidal activity via the incorporation of a photosensitiser monomer into an antimicrobial polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>Switchable, Reagent&#8208;Controlled Diastereodivergent Photocatalytic Carbocyclisation of Imine&#8208;Derived &#945;&#8208;Amino Radicals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A reagent&#8208;controlled stereodivergent carbocyclisation of aryl aldimine&#8208;derived, photocatalytically&#8208;generated, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals possessing adjacent conjugated alkenes, affording either bicyclic or tetracyclic products, is described. Under net reductive conditions using commercial Hantzsch ester, the &#945;&#8208;amino radical species underwent a single stereoselective cyclisation to give trans&#8208;configured amino&#8208;indane structures in good yield, whereas using a substituted Hantzsch ester as a milder reductant afforded cis&#8208;fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline frameworks, resulting from two consecutive radical cyclisations. Judicious choice of the reaction conditions allowed libraries of both single and dual cyclisation products to be synthesised with high selectivity, notable predictability, and good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Computational analysis employing DFT revealed the reaction pathway and mechanistic rationale behind this finely&#8208;balanced yet readily&#8208;controlled photocatalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Switching of Calmodulin in a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) Nanopore&#8208;Trap</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

To improve the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, it is essential but still challenging to steer the coordination environment of Ni centers for promoting the CO formation kinetics.

         <title>Conversion of ammonia to hydrazine induced by high frequency ultrasound</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrazine is a chemical of outmost importance in our society, either for organic synthesis or energy purpose. The direct conversion of NH  3  to hydrazine is highly appealing but it remains a very difficult task because the degradation of hydrazine is thermodynamically more feasible than the cleavage of the N&#8208;H bond of NH  3  . As a result, any catalyst capable of activating NH  3  will thus unavoidably decompose N  2  H  4  . Here we show that cavitation bubbles, created by ultrasonic irradiation of aqueous NH  3  at a high frequency, act as micro&#8208;reactors to activate and convert NH  3  to NH species, without assistance of any catalyst, yielding hydrazine at the bubble&#8208;liquid interface. The compartmentation of  in situ  produced hydrazine in the bulk solution, which is maintained close to 30&#176;C, advantageously prevents its thermal degradation, a recurrent problem faced by previous technologies. This work also points towards a path to scavenge &#8226;OH radicals by adjusting the NH  3  concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Design and Crystal Structure of a Highly Efficient Benzoylecgonine Hydrolase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for cocaine&#8208;induced long&#8208;term toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. We computationally identified, re&#8208;designed, and crystallized a novel BZEase. The obtained BZEase mutant shows a 427&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency toward BZE compared to WT BZEase. In vivo tests prove that the BZEase mutant is a promising treatment for BZE detoxification.







Abstract
Benzoylecgonine (BZE) is the major toxic metabolite of cocaine and is responsible for the long&#8208;term cocaine&#8208;induced toxicity owing to its long residence time in humans. BZE is also the main contaminant following cocaine consumption. Here, we identified the bacterial cocaine esterase (CocE) as a BZE&#8208;metabolizing enzyme (BZEase), which can degrade BZE into biological inactive metabolites (ecgonine and benzoic acid). CocE was redesigned by a reactant&#8208;state&#8208;based enzyme design theory. An encouraging mutant denoted as BZEase2, presented a &gt;400&#8208;fold improved catalytic efficiency against BZE compared with wild&#8208;type (WT) CocE. In vivo, a single dose of BZEase2 (1&#8197;mg&#8201;kg&#8722;1, IV) could eliminate nearly all BZE within only two minutes, suggesting the enzyme has the potential for cocaine overdose treatment and BZE elimination in the environment by accelerating BZE clearance. The crystal structure of a designed BZEase was also determined.

         <title>Saucer[n]arenes: Synthesis, Structure, Complexation, and Guest&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence Property</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes named saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) are synthesized by one&#8208;pot and templated methods. Saucer[n]arenes show strong fluorescence properties and form 1:1 complexes with various ammonium salts. Moreover, the chiral guests can induce the chirality of dynamically racemic saucer[n]arenes in the host&#8211;guest systems, which provides a new way to construct CPL organic materials.







Abstract
Macrocycles denoted as saucer[n]arenes (n=4,5) were easily synthesized by the one&#8208;pot condensation of 2,7&#8208;dimethoxynaphthalene (2,7&#8208;DMN) and paraformaldehyde in the presence of TFA or catalytic BF3&#8901;OEt2. With 1,1&#8208;dimethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;ium as the template, saucer[4]arene was selectively obtained. Crystal structures show that saucer[n]arenes are all composed of 2,7&#8208;DMN moiety bridged by the methylene groups at 1,6&#8208;positions: all of the 7&#8208;methoxy groups lie on one face, and all of the 2&#8208;methoxy groups lie on the other. Saucer[n]arenes exhibit strong fluorescence properties with the quantum yields of 19.6&#8201;% and 23.4&#8201;%. They form 1:1 complexes with ammonium salts in both solution and solid state (association constant up to 105&#8197;M&#8722;1 in CDCl3). Chiral quaternary ammonium salts can induce the chirality of the dynamically racemic inherently chiral saucer[n]arenes in solution, and thus show mirror&#8208;imaged circular dichroism signals and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Enantiopure Pyrrolidines by C(sp3)&#8722;H Amination of Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple hydrocarbons such as alkanes are shown to be useful building blocks for the asymmetric synthesis of heterocycles. They are converted in only two steps to pyrrolidines by application of stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amination reactions. Symmetrical and non&#8208;symmetrical enantiopure 2,5&#8208;disubstituted pyrrolidines are isolated in good yields.







Abstract
The asymmetric synthesis of enantiopure pyrrolidines is reported via a streamlined strategy relying on two sequential C&#8722;H functionalizations of simple hydrocarbons. The first step is a regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalytic nitrene C&#8722;H insertion. Then, a subsequent diastereoselective cyclization involving a 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a N&#8208;centered radical leads to the formation of pyrrolidines that can then be converted to their free NH&#8208;derivatives.

         <title>Highly Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Methanol through Atomically Dispersed Sn Coupled with Defective CuO Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have prepared atomically dispersed Sn catalysts on defective CuO for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. The Faradaic efficiency of methanol could reach 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The catalyst was beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The *CO was then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.







Abstract
Using renewable electricity to drive CO2 electroreduction is an attractive way to achieve carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle and produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. As an important platform molecule and clean fuel, methanol requires 6&#8208;electron transfer in the process of CO2 reduction. Currently, CO2 electroreduction to methanol suffers from poor efficiency and low selectivity. Herein, we report the first work to design atomically dispersed Sn site anchored on defective CuO catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to methanol. It exhibits high methanol Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 88.6&#8201;% with a current density of 67.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability in a H&#8208;cell, which is the highest FE(methanol) with such high current density compared with the results reported to date. The atomic Sn site, adjacent oxygen vacancy and CuO support cooperate very well, leading to higher double&#8208;layer capacitance, larger CO2 adsorption capacity and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Operando experiments and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the catalyst is beneficial for CO2 activation via decreasing the energy barrier of *COOH dissociation to form *CO. The obtained key intermediate *CO is then bound to the Cu species for further reduction, leading to high selectivity toward methanol.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Permeable Nanobodies Allow Dual&#8208;Color Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy in Untransfected Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;permeable nanobodies equipped with a fluorophore and a photostabilizer are introduced as powerful tools for live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution microscopy. By using intramolecular photostabilization dynamic processes can be monitored in untransfected living cells.







Abstract
Super&#8208;resolution microscopy in living cells can be restricted by the availability of small molecule probes, which only exist against few targets and genetically encoded tags. Here, we expand the applicability of live&#8208;cell STED by engineering cell&#8208;permeable and highly fluorescent nanobodies as intracellular targeting agents. To ensure bright fluorescent signals at low concentrations we used the concept of intramolecular photostabilization by ligating a fluorophore along with the photostabilizer trolox to the nanobody using expressed protein ligation (EPL). Furthermore, these semi&#8208;synthetic nanobodies are equipped with a cleavable cell&#8208;penetrating peptide for efficient cellular entry, which enables super&#8208;resolution imaging of GFP and mCherry, as well as two endogenous targets, nuclear lamins and the DNA replication and repair protein PCNA. We monitored cell division and DNA replication via confocal and STED microscopy thus demonstrating the utility of these new intracellular tools for functional analysis.

         <title>Double proton transfer across a table: theformic acid dimer &#8211; fluorobenzene complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton transfer proceeding via tunneling is a fundamental quantum&#8208;mechanical phenomenon.Here we report rotational spectroscopy measurements of this process in thecomplex of the formic acid dimer with fluorobenzene. The assignment of the spectrumindicates that this complex exists in the form of a &#8208; stacked structure. Each rotationaltransition of the parent isotopologue exhibits a splitting feature. Isotopic substitution experimentsreveal that the spectral splitting results from double&#8208;proton transfer tunnelingin the formic acid dimer. The results demonstrate that the presence of fluorobenzene asa neighboring molecule does not quench the double proton transfer in the formic aciddimer but decreases its tunneling splitting from 341(3) MHz to 267.608(1) MHz. Thetheoretical calculations suggest that the presence of the weakly bounded fluorobenzenedoes not influence the activation energy of the proton transfer. The observed decrease ofthe tunneling rate in the complex with respect to the formic acid dimer is explained usingthe concept of the molecular environment reorganization energy (Marcus energy).The fluorobenzene is reoriented with respect to the formic acid dimer during the courseof the reaction, which slows down the proton transfer motion.</dc:description>

         <title>Can One Measure Resonance Raman Optical Activity?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Measured resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) often did not agree with theoretical predictions. We uncover a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, that explains some of these inconsistencies. This combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman has also immense potential as a sensitive technique for applications in chemistry or biology.







Abstract
Resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) is commonly measured as the difference in intensity of Raman scattered right and left circularly polarized light, IR&#8722;IL, when a randomly polarized light is in resonance with a chiral molecule. Strong and sometimes mono&#8208;signate experimental RROA spectra of several chiral solutes were reported previously, although their signs and relative intensities could not be reproduced theoretically. By examining multiple light&#8208;matter interaction events which can occur simultaneously under resonance, we show that a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy, eCP&#8208;Raman, a combination of electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized Raman, prevails. By incorporating the finite&#8208;lifetime approach for resonance, the experimental patterns of the model chiral solutes are captured theoretically by eCP&#8208;Raman, without any RROA contribution. The results open opportunity for applications of eCP&#8208;Raman spectroscopy and for extracting true RROA experimentally.

         <title>Electrochemical Potential&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Throughput Molecular Electronic and Spintronic Devices: From Molecules to Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review describes recent advances in the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven preparation of nanometric molecular films of various molecules on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena. We hope to encourage the design of a facile and efficient route for molecular optoelectronic and flexible electronic applications.







Abstract
Molecules are fascinating candidates for constructing tunable and electrically conducting devices by the assembly of either a single molecule or an ensemble of molecules between two electrical contacts followed by current&#8208;voltage (I&#8208;V) analysis, which is often termed &#8220;molecular electronics&#8221;. Recently, there has been also an upsurge of interest in spin&#8208;based electronics or spintronics across the molecules, which offer additional scope to create ultrafast responsive devices with less power consumption and lower heat generation using the intrinsic spin property rather than electronic charge. Researchers have been exploring this idea of utilizing organic molecules, organometallics, coordination complexes, polymers, and biomolecules (proteins, enzymes, oligopeptides, DNA) in integrating molecular electronics and spintronics devices. Although several methods exist to prepare molecular thin&#8208;films on suitable electrodes, the electrochemical potential&#8208;driven technique has emerged as highly efficient. In this Review we describe recent advances in the electrochemical potential driven growth of nanometric various molecular films on technologically relevant substrates, including non&#8208;magnetic and magnetic electrodes to investigate the stimuli&#8208;responsive charge and spin transport phenomena.

         <title>Decarboxylation&#8208;Induced Defects in MOF&#8208;Derived Single Cobalt Atom@Carbon Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decarboxylation gives Co&#8208;N4 catalysts with rich defects for use in the oxygen reduction reaction. The defect near the Co&#8208;N4 site weakens the adsorption free energy of OOH on the cobalt active center, which significantly improves the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Co&#8208;N4 site and leads to a remarkable turnover frequency.







Abstract
Developing transition metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance. Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as a subgroup of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are distinguished as SAC precursors, due to their large porosity and N content. However, the activity of the formed metal sites is limited. Herein, we report a decarboxylation&#8208;induced defects strategy to improve their intrinsic activity via increasing the defect density. Carboxylate/amide mixed&#8208;linker MOF (DMOF) was chosen to produce defective Co SACs (Co@DMOF) by gas&#8208;transport of Co species to DMOF upon heating. Comparing with ZIF&#8208;8 derived SAC (Co@ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;900), Co@DMOF&#8208;900 with more defects yet one fifth Co content and similar specific double&#8208;layer capacitance show better ORR activity and eight times higher turnover frequency (2.015&#8197;e&#8201;s&#8722;1&#8201;site&#8722;1). Quantum calculation confirms the defects can weaken the adsorption free energy of OOH on Co sites and further boost the ORR process.

         <title>Reversible and Irreversible [2+2] Cycloaddition Reactions of Heteroallenes to a Gallaphosphene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene 1 with carbodiimides and isocyanates yield four&#8208;membered metallaheterocyles 2&#8211;6. The carbodiimide cycloadditions are fully reversible at elevated temperature, as was also observed in reactions of compounds 4&#8211;6 with CO2.







Abstract
[2+2] Cycloaddition reactions of gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(2,6&#8208;i&#8208;Pr2C6H3)]2) with carbodiimides [C(NR)2; R=i&#8208;Pr, Cy] and isocyanates [RNCO; R=Et, i&#8208;Pr, Cy] yielded four&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(X)NR]GaL (X=NR, R=i&#8208;Pr 2, Cy 3; X=O, R=Et 4, i&#8208;Pr 5, Cy 6). Compounds 4&#8211;6 reversibly react with CO2 via [2+2] cycloaddition at ambient temperature to the six&#8208;membered metallaheterocycles LGa(Cl)P[&#956;&#8208;C(O)O]&#8208;&#956;&#8208;C(O)N(R)GaL (R=Et 7, i&#8208;Pr 8, Cy 9). Compounds 2&#8211;9 were characterized by IR and heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, while quantum chemical calculations provided a deeper understanding on the energetics of the reactions.

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Construction of Chiral Azepine Skeleton Bearing Multiple&#8208;Stereogenic Elements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution was developed. With this methodology, four types of stereogenic elements including chiral nitrogen center, C&#8722;N axial chirality, C&#8722;C axial chirality and conformational behavior of the seven&#8208;membered ring were stereoselectively constructed.







Abstract
Enantioselective construction of molecules bearing multiple stereogenic elements is increasingly related to the synthesis of enantiopure natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials. However, atom&#8208;economical and enantioselective approaches to install multiple stereogenic elements in a small molecular template by limited chemical transformation remain challenging. We describe an organocatalytic enantioselective method for the preparation of polychiral molecules bearing four types of stereogenic elements in fused azepines via vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM)&#8208;mediated intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution. This method was proved robust with a wide range of substrate scope (46&#8211;92&#8201;% yield), with excellent diastereoselectivity (&gt;20:1 dr) and enantioselectivity achieved (up to 97&#8201;% ee). Optical properties and Ru3+&#8208;induced fluorescence responses of these compounds suggest their potential applications in optoelectronic materials and heavy metal ion detection.

         <title>Charge Transfer from Donor to Acceptor in Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Enhanced Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy to trigger charge transfer for improving photosensitization is the covalent modification of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Charge transfer from the PAH donor to the Bodipy acceptor in CMPs can facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8211;hole separation, leading to excellent performance for both energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer reactions.







Abstract
Photosensitization associated with light absorption and energy/electron&#8208;transfer represents the central processes for photosynthesis. However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP&#8208;1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP&#8208;2&#8211;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron&#8208;hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy&#8208;/electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Remarkably, CMP&#8208;2 as a representative CMP can efficiently drive the photosynthesis of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with 92&#8201;% yield, substantially higher than that of CMP&#8208;1 (32&#8201;%). Experiments and theory calculations demonstrate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship of these CMPs, opening a new horizon for developing HAF heterogeneous photosensitizers with highly efficient sensitizing activity by rational structure regulation at a molecular level.

However, it's still a challenge to develop a heavy-atom-free (HAF) strategy to improve the sensitizing ability of polymeric photosensitizers. Herein, we propose a new protocol to significantly improve the photosensitization by decorating mother conjugated microporous polymer (CMP-1) with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), resulting in a series of CMPs (CMP-2&#8211;4). Systematic study reveals that covalent modification with PAHs can transfer charge to Bodipy in CMP to further facilitate both intersystem crossing and electron-hole separation, which can dramatically boost energy-/electron-transfer reactions.

         <title>Implanting Numerous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in a Cu&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Based Nanosheet to Boost CH4 Selectivity in Neutral&#8208;Media CO2 Electroreduction</title>

         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based large&#8208;scale, ultrathin nanosheet with numerous hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks was developed for the highly selective electroreduction of CO2 to CH4 under neutral conditions. This catalyst exhibits a superior FE
 of 70&#8201;% with a high current density (&#8722;183.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;1.6&#8197;V under rarely reported neutral conditions and maintains FE
&gt;51&#8201;% over a wide potential range (&#8722;1.5 to &#8722;1.7&#8197;V) in a flow cell.







Abstract
The exploration of novel systems for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for the production of hydrocarbons like CH4 remains a giant challenge. Well&#8208;designed electrocatalysts with advantages like proton generation/transferring and intermediate&#8208;fixating for efficient CO2RR are much preferred yet largely unexplored.

&lt;p&gt;A Cu-porphyrin-based large-scale, ultrathin nanosheet with numerous hydrogen-bonding networks was developed for the highly selective electroreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under neutral conditions. This catalyst exhibits a superior FE

&lt;p&gt;The exploration of novel systems for the electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) for the production of hydrocarbons like CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; remains a giant challenge. Well-designed electrocatalysts with advantages like proton generation/transferring and intermediate-fixating for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR are much preferred yet largely unexplored.

         <title>Grotthuss Proton&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Pseudocapacitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly crystalline, robust covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were fabricated with intrinsic Grotthuss proton conductivity. The assembled covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;based pseudocapacitors displayed both high energy density and high power density that surpassed that of all other reported COF&#8208;based systems.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the synthesis of two highly crystalline, robust, hydrophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that display intrinsic proton conduction by the Grotthuss mechanism. The enriched redox&#8208;active azo groups in the COFs can undergo a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making the COFs ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in situ hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three&#8208;electrode specific capacitance of 440&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, among the highest for COF&#8208;based supercapacitors, and can retain 90&#8201;% capacitance even after 10&#8201;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. This is the first example using Grotthuss proton&#8208;conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two&#8208;electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a maximum power density of 42&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, surpassing that of all reported COF&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Glycine from Oxalic Acid and Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By electrochemical method, stable oxalic acid and nitrate substrates were coupled into an amino acid, glycine. Insertion of electrons resulted in their conversion into nucleophile and electrophile, respectively, which led to C=N bond formation between them, as well as the conversion of the reversible C=N double bond to a stable C&#8722;N single bond.







Abstract
In manufacturing C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing compounds, it is an important challenge to alternate the conventional methodologies that utilize reactive substrates, toxic reagents, and organic solvents. In this study, we developed an electrochemical method to synthesize a C&#8722;N bond&#8208;containing molecule avoiding the use of cyanides and amines by harnessing nitrate (NO3&#8722;) as a nitrogen source in an aqueous electrolyte. In addition, we utilized oxalic acid as a carbon source, which can be obtained from electrochemical conversion of CO2. Thus, our approach can provide a route for the utilization of anthropogenic CO2 and nitrate wastes, which cause serious environmental problems including global warming and eutrophication. Interestingly, the coreduction of oxalic acid and nitrate generated reactive intermediates, which led to C&#8722;N bond formation followed by further reduction to an amino acid, namely, glycine. By carefully controlling this multireduction process with a fabricated Cu&#8211;Hg electrode, we demonstrated the efficient production of glycine with a faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of up to 43.1&#8201;% at &#8722;1.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/AgCl (current density&#8776;90&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Epitaxially Grown Heterostructured SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 with High&#8208;Valence Mn3+/4+ for Improved Oxygen Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An epitaxially grown SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 heterostructure has been developed for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the effect of interfacial chemistry on ORR performance, the formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial in promoting the positive shift of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and improving catalytic activity.







Abstract
Heterostructured catalysts show outstanding performance in electrochemical reactions owing to their beneficial interfacial properties. However, the rational design of heterostructured catalysts with the desired interfacial properties and charge&#8208;transfer characteristics is challenging. Herein, we developed a SrMn3O6&#8722;x&#8208;SrMnO3 (SMOx&#8208;SMO) heterostructure through epitaxial growth, which demonstrated excellent electrocatalyst performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The formation of high&#8208;valence Mn3+/4+ is beneficial for promoting a positive shift in the position of the d&#8208;band center, thereby optimizing the adsorption and desorption of ORR intermediates on the heterojunction surface and resulting in improved catalytic activity. When SMOx&#8208;SMO was applied as an air&#8208;electrode catalyst in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, a high output voltage and power density was achieved, with performance comparable to a battery prepared with Pt/C&#8208;IrO2 air&#8208;electrode catalysts, albeit with much better cycling stability.

         <title>Imaging of Cancer Cells and Dictated Cytotoxicity Using Aptamer&#8208;Guided Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)&#8208;Generated G&#8208;Quadruplex Chains</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatility of DNA nanotechnology enables the aptamer&#8208;guided hybridization chain reaction (HCR)&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains to a discriminative imaging of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The permeation of ZnIIPPIX functionalized nanowires into the malignant TNBC cells leads to a selective cytotoxicity and an effective photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) treatment toward cancer cells.







Abstract
DNA nanotechnology provides powerful tools for developing cancer theranostics. Here we introduce the autonomous surface&#8208;nucleolin&#8208;guided HCR that leads to the polymerization of G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, in which the ZnII&#8208;protoporphyrin IX is intercalated. We demonstrate that MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 (Triple Negative Breast Cancer cells, TNBC) with overexpressed surface nucleolin were able to induce HCR leading to the formation of the ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains, while the M10 epithelial breast cells served as control. The ZnIIPPIX&#8208;loaded nanowires allow the selective imaging of TNBC, and their permeation into the TNBC leads to selective cytotoxicity and guided photodynamic therapy toward the cancer cells due to structural perturbation of the membranes. The aptamer&#8208;guided HCR&#8208;generated G&#8208;quadruplex polymer chains may serve as a versatile tool to target TNBC featuring poor prognosis and high pathological risk of recurrence, thus offering a promising theranostic platform.

         <title>Revealing Ammonia Quantification Minefield in Photo/Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The analytical methods for the detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2&#8197;ppm in photo/electrocatalytic N2 fixation are evaluated rigorously, reliably, and insightfully. The low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification minefield was indicated and a rigorous ammonia detection flowchart as well as another reference standard to achieve a more accurate and responsible ammonia detection in photo/electrocatalysis was concluded.







Abstract
Photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis has recently developed fast while the ammonia yields over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photo/electrocatalysts are still very moderate. Such low concentration of synthesized NH3 brings about a challenge to the reliable quantification of the product in photo/electrocatalysis. Notably, we found that the quantitative detection of ammonia concentration below 0.2 ppm is error&#8208;prone, which is likely the case happening in the majority of photo/electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis, thus arising concerns about the rationality and accuracy for low&#8208;concentration ammonia quantification in these processes. Herein, we discuss the methodology used and analyze the reliability of various detection methods for the detection of trace ammonia in aqueous media. The challenges facing the detection of low concentration of ammonia in photo/electrocatalysis can be overcome by integration with multiple detection methods. According to the data presented, we also propose an effective criterion for precise quantification of ammonia, avoiding the unreasonable comparisons in photo/electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Sensing Fluorogenic Probe for Monitoring Ethylene in Living Cells and Plants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic probes were developed for rapid (&lt;2&#8197;min), highly selective, and quantitative detection of ethylene. Among the coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes developed, CEP&#8208;1 has the capacity to detect endogenous ethylene gas in living cells and plants.







Abstract
Ethylene (ET) is an important gaseous plant hormone. It is highly desirable to develop fluorescent probes for monitoring ethylene in living cells. We report an efficient RhIII&#8208;catalysed coupling of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides to ethylene in the presence of an alcohol. The newly discovered coupling reaction exhibited a wide scope of N&#8208;phenoxyacetamides and excellent regioselectivity. We successfully developed three fluorophore&#8208;tagged RhIII&#8208;based fluorogenic coumarin&#8208;ethylene probes (CEPs) using this strategy for the selective and quantitative detection of ethylene. CEP&#8208;1 exhibited the highest sensitivity with a limit of detection of ethylene at 52&#8197;ppb in air. Furthermore, CEP&#8208;1 was successfully applied for imaging in living CHO&#8208;K1 cells and for monitoring endogenous&#8208;induced changes in ethylene biosynthesis in tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana plants. These results indicate that CEP&#8208;1 has great potential to illuminate the spatiotemporal regulation of ethylene biosynthesis and ethylene signal transduction in living biological systems.

         <title>Enabling the Use of Alkyl Thianthrenium Salts in Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions by Copper Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of thianthrenium salts have been developed that can undergo C(sp3)&#8722;S bond cleavage and be used as reliable alkyl reagents. This ability has been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira and Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Alkyl groups are one of the most widely used groups in organic synthesis. Here, a a series of thianthrenium salts have been synthesized that act as reliable alkylation reagents and readily engage in copper&#8208;catalyzed Sonogashira reactions to build C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp) bonds under mild photochemical conditions. Diverse alkyl thianthrenium salts, including methyl and disubstituted thianthrenium salts, are employed with great functional breadth, since sensitive Cl, Br, and I atoms, which are poorly tolerated in conventional approaches, are compatible. The generality of the developed alkyl reagents has also been demonstrated in copper&#8208;catalyzed Kumada reactions.

         <title>Smart 131I&#8208;Labeled Self&#8208;Illuminating Photosensitizers for Deep Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel responsive nanoparticles based on Cerenkov resonance energy transfer are suitable for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of deep tumors without the need for exogenous light. The nanoparticles have low toxicity and few harmful side effects on normal tissue.







Abstract
Stimulating photosensitizers (PS) by Cerenkov radiation (CR) can overcome the light penetration limitation in traditional photodynamic therapy. However, separate injection of radiopharmaceuticals and PS cannot guarantee their efficient interaction in tumor areas, while co&#8208;delivery of radionuclides and PS face the problem of nonnegligible phototoxicity in normal tissues. Here, we describe a 131I&#8208;labeled smart photosensitizer, composed of pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (photosensitizer), a diisopropylamino group (pH&#8208;sensitive group), an 131I&#8208;labeled tyrosine group (CR donor), and polyethylene glycol, which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (131I&#8208;sPS NPs). The 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed low phototoxicity in normal tissues due to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, but could self&#8208;produce reactive oxygen species in tumor sites upon disassembly. Upon intravenous injection, 131I&#8208;sPS NPs showed great tumor inhibition capability in subcutaneous 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing Balb/c mice and orthotopic VX2 liver tumor bearing rabbits. We believed 131I&#8208;sPS NPs could expand the application of CR and provide an effective strategy for deep tumor theranostics.

         <title>Exporting Metal&#8208;Carbene Chemistry to Live Mammalian Cells: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Intracellular Synthesis of Quinoxalines Enabled by N&#8722;H Carbene Insertions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that catalytic processes involving metal&#8211;carbene intermediates can be exported to the crowded magma of a live mammalian cell. In particular, reactions involving copper carbenes can be used for the synthesis of fluorescent cyclic products in cellular media, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8722;H carbene insertion. The method also allows the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions.







Abstract
Implementing catalytic organometallic transformations in living settings can offer unprecedented opportunities in chemical biology and medicine. Unfortunately, the number of biocompatible reactions so far discovered is very limited, and essentially restricted to uncaging processes. Here, we demonstrate the viability of performing metal carbene transfer reactions in live mammalian cells. In particular, we show that copper (II) catalysts can promote the intracellular annulation of alpha&#8208;keto diazocarbenes with ortho&#8208;amino arylamines, in a process that is initiated by an N&#8208;H carbene insertion. The potential of this transformation is underscored by the in cellulo synthesis of a product that alters mitochondrial functions, and by demonstrating cell selective biological responses using targeted copper catalysts. Considering the wide reactivity spectrum of metal carbenes, this work opens the door to significantly expanding the repertoire of life&#8208;compatible abiotic reactions.

         <title>Intrinsic ORR Activity Enhancement of Pt Atomic Sites by Engineering the d&#8208;Band Center via Local Coordination Tuning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;coordinated atomic Pt&#8208;Nx sites are theoretically predicted and experimentally realized, offering enhanced kinetics for four&#8208;electron electrochemical oxygen reduction. Exceptional activity is attributed to the tuning of the d&#8208;band electron center via local coordination asymmetry. This chemistry provides an effective guideline for atomic Pt catalysts in batteries and fuel cells.







Abstract
A considerable amount of platinum (Pt) is required to ensure an adequate rate for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. Thus, the implementation of atomic Pt catalysts holds promise for minimizing the Pt content. In this contribution, atomic Pt sites with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co&#8208;coordination on a carbon matrix (PtNPC) are conceptually predicted and experimentally developed to alter the d&#8208;band center of Pt, thereby promoting the intrinsic ORR activity. PtNPC with a record&#8208;low Pt content (&#8776;0.026&#8197;wt&#8201;%) consequently shows a benchmark&#8208;comparable activity for ORR with an onset of 1.0 VRHE and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85 VRHE. It also features a high stability in 15&#8201;000&#8208;cycle tests and a superior turnover frequency of 6.80&#8197;s&#8722;1 at 0.9 VRHE. Damjanovic kinetics analysis reveals a tuned ORR kinetics of PtNPC from a mixed 2/4&#8208;electron to a predominately 4&#8208;electron route. It is discovered that coordinated P species significantly shifts d&#8208;band center of Pt atoms, accounting for the exceptional performance of PtNPC.

         <title>Quick and Easy Method to Dramatically Improve the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Activity of an Iron Porphyrin Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical CO2 reduction activity of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, is dramatically enhanced by a simple one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction. The resulting complex, FeTPP, shows improved solubility. Its turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile is 7.3&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of relevant molecular catalysts.







Abstract
The development of artificial molecular catalysts for CO2 reduction is the key to solving energy and environmental problems. Although chemical modifications can generally improve the catalytic activity of this class of compounds, they often require complicated synthetic procedures. Here, we report a simple procedure that dramatically enhances electrochemical CO2 reduction activity. A one&#8208;step counteranion&#8208;exchange reaction increased the solubility of a commercially available catalyst, iron(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride, in a variety of solvents, allowing the investigation of its catalytic performance under various conditions. Surprisingly, the turnover frequency for CO evolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) reached 7&#8201;300&#8201;000&#8197;s&#8722;1, which is the highest among those of current best&#8208;in&#8208;class molecular catalysts. This excellent catalytic activity originates from the unique reaction between the generated FeI species and CO2 in MeCN during catalysis. The present study offers a &#8220;quick and easy&#8221; method for obtaining an efficient catalytic system for electrochemical CO2 reduction.

         <title>Chemical Genetics Reveals a Role of Squalene Synthase in TGF&#946; Signaling and Cardiomyogenesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis. Chemical genetics of KY02111 identified squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling and recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes an inherited heart disease.







Abstract
KY02111 is a widely used small molecule that boosts cardiomyogenesis of the mesoderm cells derived from pluripotent stem cells, yet its molecular mechanism of action remains elusive. The present study resolves the initially perplexing effects of KY02111 on Wnt signaling and subsequently identifies squalene synthase (SQS) as a molecular target of KY02111 and its optimized version, KY&#8208;I. By disrupting the interaction of SQS with cardiac ER&#8208;membrane protein TMEM43, KY02111 impairs TGF&#946; signaling, but not Wnt signaling, and thereby recapitulates the clinical mutation of TMEM43 that causes arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), an inherited heart disease that involves a substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue. These findings reveal a heretofore undescribed role of SQS in TGF&#946; signaling and cardiomyogenesis. KY02111 may find its use in ARVC modeling as well as serve as a chemical tool for studying TGF&#946;/SMAD signaling.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Formation of Polymer Janus Discs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs were fabricated from ABC triblock terpolymers through cross&#8208;linking and disassembly of prolate ellipsoidal particles. By varying the pore diameter of a Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane, the size of prolate ellipsoidal particles and the corresponding Janus discs can be well controlled.







Abstract
A straightforward method is presented for the preparation of nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized Janus discs with controlled shape, size, and aspect ratio. The method relies on cross&#8208;linkable ABC triblock terpolymers and involves first the preparation of prolate ellipsoidal microparticles by combining Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane emulsification with evaporation&#8208;induced confinement assembly (EICA). By varying the pore diameter of the SPG membrane, we produce Janus discs with controlled size distributions centered around hundreds of nanometers to several microns. We further transferred the discs to water by mild sulfonation of PS to polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) and verified the Janus character by subsequent labelling with cationic nanoparticles. Finally, we show that the sulfonated Janus discs are amphiphilic and can be used as efficient colloidal stabilizers for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (O/W) emulsions.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;dominated stable N97 respirators for airborne virus capture based on nanofibrous membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The worldwide COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has led to an extensive attention on the usage of N95&#8208;grade face respirators(N95 FFRs), which are dominated by external electrostatic charged polypropylene meltblown fabrics. However, their longevity and reusability are limited by consecutive donning and disinfection treatments. Herein, we developed stable N97 nanofibrous respirators based on chemically modified surface to enable remarkable filtration characteristics via polarity driven interaction. This was achieved by a thin&#8208;film coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (TFPNM), giving an overall long&#8208;lasting filtration performance with high quality factor at 0.42 Pa  &#8208;1  (filtration efficiency: over 97%; pressure drop: around 10 Pa), which is higher than that of the commercial N95 FFRs (0.10&#8208;0.41 Pa  &#8208;1  ) tested with a flow rate of 5 L/min and the 0.26 &#956;m NaCl aerosol. A coxsackie B4 virus filtration test demonstrated that TFPNM also had strong virus capture capacity of 97.67%. As compared with N95 FFRs, the TFPNM was more resistant to a wider variety of disinfection protocols, and the overall filtration characteristics remained N97 standard.</dc:description>

The PK diversity is constructed by a variety of factors, including the b&#8208;keto processing, chain length, methylation pattern, and relative and absolute configurations of the substituents. In this study, we examined the stereochemical course of the PK processing for the synthesis of polyhydroxy PKs such as phialotides, phomenoic acid, and ACR&#8208;toxin. Heterologous expression of a HR&#8208;PKS gene, a trans&#8208;acting enoylreductase gene, and a truncated non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase gene resulted in the formation of a linear PK with multiple stereogenic centers. The absolute configurations of the stereogenic centers were determined by chemical degradation followed by comparison of the degradation products with synthetic standards. A stereochemical rule was proposed to explain the absolute configurations of other reduced PKs and highlights an error in the absolute configurations of a reported structure. The present work demonstrates that focused functional analysis of functionally related HR&#8208;PKSs leads to a better understanding of the stereochemical course.</dc:description>

         <title>Subsurface Carbon&#8208;Induced Local Charge of Copper for On&#8208;Surface Displacement Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal carbides have sparked unprecedented enthusiasm as high&#8208;performance catalysts in recent years. Still, the catalytic properties of copper (Cu) carbide remain unexplored. By introducing subsurface carbon (C) to Cu(111), displacement reaction of proton in carboxyl acid group with single Cu atom is demonstrated at the atomic scale and room temperature. Its occurrence is attributed to the C&#8208;doping induced local charge of surface Cu atoms (up to +0.30 e/atom), which accelerates the rate of on&#8208;surface deprotonation via reduction of the corresponding energy barrier, thus enabling the instant displacement of a proton with a Cu atom when the molecules land on the surface. Such well&#8208;defined and robust Cu  d+  surface based on the subsurface C doping offers a novel catalytic platform for on&#8208;surface synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Access to Dihydroquinoxalinones via Formal &#945;&#8208;Halo Acyl Halide Synthon in One&#8208;Pot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A first enantioselective one&#8208;pot catalytic strategy to dihydroquinoxalinones, featuring novel 1&#8208;phenylsulfonyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyano enantioenriched epoxides as masked &#945;&#8208;halo acyl halide synthon, followed by a domino ring&#8208;opening cyclization (DROC), is documented. A popular quinine&#8208;derived urea served as the catalyst in two, out of the three steps performed in the same solvent, using commercially available aldehydes, (phenylsulfonyl)acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide and 1,2&#8208;phenylendiamines. Medicinally relevant 3&#8208;aryl/alkyl substituted heterocycles are isolated in generally good to high overall yield and high enantioselectivity (up to 99% ee). A rare example of excellent reusability at higher scale of an organocatalyst, subjected to oxidative conditions, is demonstrated. Mechanistically, labile &#945;&#8208;ketosulfone has been detected as the intermediate involved in the DROC process. Theoretical calculations, on the key epoxidation step, rationalize the observed stereocontrol, highlighting the important role played by the sulfone group.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical 1,4/5&#8208;Amino Shift Enables Access to Fluoroalkyl&#8208;Featured Primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;Aminoketones under Metal&#8208;Free Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel radical 1,4/5&#8208;amino shift from the oxygen center of alkene&#8208;tethered diphenyl ketoxime ethers to the carbon center to achieve high value&#8208;added fluoroalkyl&#8208;featured primary &#946;(&#947;)&#8208;aminoketones is reported. This conversion is initiated by fluoroalkyl radical derived from the EDA (electron donor&#8208;acceptor) complex of Togni's reagent/fluoroalkyl iodides and quinuclidine. Mechanism studies reveal that the migration involves a unique 5(6)&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization of the carbon&#8208;centered radical onto the N&#8208;atom of ketoxime ethers followed by a cascade N&#8208;O bond cleavage and dehydrogenation sequence. Notably, besides Togni's reagent/fluoroalkyl iodides, this protocol is also compatible with other radical precursors to provide various functionalized primary aminoketones.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Protein Dynamics to Sense Rapid Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Dynamics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multi&#8208;scale&#160;calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, exhibiting wide&#8208;ranging temporal kinetics, constitutes a ubiquitous mode of signal transduction. We report a novel endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted Ca2+  indicator, R&#8208;CatchER, which showed superior kinetics  in vitro  (koff  &#8805;&#160;2x103  s&#8208;1  ,  kon  &#8805;&#160;7x106  M&#8208;1s&#8208;1  ) and in multiple cell types. R&#8208;CatchER captured spatiotemporal ER Ca2+  dynamics in neurons and hotspots at dendritic branchpoints, enabled the first report of ER Ca2+  oscillations mediated by calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs), and revealed ER Ca2+&#8208;based functional cooperativity of CaSR. We elucidate the mechanism of R&#8208;CatchER and propose a principle to rationally design genetically encoded Ca2+  indicators, with a single Ca2+&#8208;binding site and fast kinetics, by tuning rapid fluorescent protein dynamics and the electrostatic potential around the chromophore. The design principle is supported by the development of G&#8208;CatchER2, an upgrade of our previous (G&#8208;)CatchER with improved dynamic range. Our work may facilitate protein design, visualizing Ca2+  dynamics, and drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented enantioselective synthesis of spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a sequential C&#8722;H olefination/asymmetric [4+1] spirocyclization under a simple Co(II)/chiral spiro phosphoric acid (SPA) binary system is reported. A range of biologically important spiro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams are obtained with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 98% ee). The concise, asymmetric synthesis of an aldose reductase inhibitor was successfully achieved. Notably, contrast to previous reports that relied on the use of cyclopentadienyl or its derivatives (achiral Cp*, Cp  tBu  , or chiral Cp  x  ) ligated Co(III) complexes requiring tedious steps to prepare, cheap and commercially available cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate was used as an efficient precatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>From Selection to Instruction and Back: Competing Conformational Selection and Induced Fit Pathways in Abiotic Hosts</title>

Abiotic hosts use both conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms to capture guests. In this regard, the order by which encapsulation takes place can easily be directed for applications such as tuning the action of allosteric molecular machines and increasing their operational efficiency.







Abstract
Two limiting cases of molecular recognition, induced fit (IF) and conformational selection (CS), play a central role in allosteric regulation of natural systems. The IF paradigm states that a substrate &#8220;instructs&#8221; the host to change its shape after complexation, while CS asserts that a guest &#8220;selects&#8221; the optimal fit from an ensemble of preexisting host conformations. With no studies that quantitatively address the interplay of two limiting pathways in abiotic systems, we herein and for the first time describe the way by which twisted capsule M&#8208;1, encompassing two conformers M&#8208;1(+) and M&#8208;1(&#8722;), trap CX4 (X=Cl, Br) to give CX4&#8834;M&#8208;1(+) and CX4&#8834;M&#8208;1(&#8722;), with all four states being in thermal equilibrium. With the assistance of 2D EXSY, we found that CBr4 would, at its lower concentrations, bind M&#8208;1 via a M&#8208;1(+)&#8594;M&#8208;1(&#8722;)&#8594;CBr4&#8834;M&#8208;1(&#8722;) pathway corresponding to conformational selection. For M&#8208;1 complexing CCl4 though, data from 2D EXSY measurements and 1D NMR line&#8208;shape analysis suggested that lower CCl4 concentrations would favor CS while the IF pathway prevailed at higher proportions of the guest. Since CS and IF are not mutually exclusive, we reason that our work sets the stage for characterizing the dynamics of a wide range of already existing hosts to broaden our fundamental understanding of their action. The objective is to master the way in which encapsulation takes place for designing novel and allosteric sequestering agents, catalysts and chemosensors akin to those found in nature.

         <title>A Boratafulvene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 20055-20060, September 1, 2021. </description>

The first boratafulvene was accessed by deprotonation of a B&#8208;methyl borole. The boratafulvene is a new C&#8208;nucleophilic synthon for substituted boroles and reacts with carbonyls in a bora&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type reaction transferring the methylene group.







Abstract
Structurally authenticated free B&#8208;alkyl boroles are presented and electronic implications of alkyl substitution were assessed. Deprotonation of a boron&#8208;bound exocyclic methyl group in a B&#8208;methyl borole yields the first 5&#8208;boratafulvene anion&#8212;an isomer to boratabenzene. Boratafulvene was structurally characterized and its electronic structure probed by DFT calculations. The pKa value of the exocyclic B&#8722;CH3 in a set of boroles was computationally approximated and confirmed a pronounced acidic character caused by the boron atom embedded in an anti&#8208;aromatic moiety. The non&#8208;aromatic boratafulvene reacts as a C&#8208;centered nucleophile with the mild electrophile Me3SnCl to give a stannylmethyl borole, regenerating the anti&#8208;aromaticity. As nucleophilic synthons for boroles, boratafulvenes thus open an entirely new avenue for synthetic strategies toward this highly reactive class of heterocycles. Boratafulvene reacts as a methylene transfer reagent in a bora&#8208;Wittig&#8208;type reaction generating a borole oxide.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopic Evidence of Key Intermediate Species and Role of NiFe Dual&#8208;Catalytic Center in Water Oxidation</title>

Bifunctional superstructures consisting of plasmonic Au core and catalytically active Ni3FeOx satellites were used to study the OER process on NiFe&#8208;based catalysts. The in situ spectroscopic results on interfacial reaction intermediates disclose the synergistic mechanism of the dual&#8208;metal&#8208;centered OER catalyst.







Abstract
NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted great interests due to the low price and high activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the complex reaction mechanism of NiFe&#8208;catalyzed OER has not been fully explored yet. Detection of intermediate species can bridge the gap between OER performances and catalyst component/structure properties. Here, we performed label&#8208;free surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) monitoring of interfacial OER process on Ni3FeOx nanoparticles (NPs) in alkaline medium. By using bifunctional Au@Ni3FeOx core&#8208;satellite superstructures as Raman signal enhancer, we found direct spectroscopic evidence of intermediate O&#8208;O&#8722; species. According to the SERS results, Fe atoms are the catalytic sites for the initial OH&#8722; to O&#8208;O&#8722; oxidation. The O&#8208;O&#8722; species adsorbed across neighboring Fe and Ni sites experiences further oxidation caused by electron transfer to NiIII and eventually forms O2 product.

         <title>Partial Coordination&#8208;Perturbed Bi&#8208;Copper Sites for Selective Electroreduction of CO2 to Hydrocarbons</title>

During the process of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, the different synergistic effects (the distance DCu&#8208;Cu and the dihedral angle &#946;Cu&#8208;Cu) between neighboring catalytic copper (bi&#8208;copper) active sites induced by the variations of coordination microenvironment lead to regular FECH4: FEC2H4 changes in crystalline single&#8208;chain models (Cu&#8208;PzH, Cu&#8208;PzCl, Cu&#8208;PzBr, and Cu&#8208;PzI).







Abstract
In the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), it is challenging to develop a stable, well&#8208;defined catalyst model system that is able to examine the influence of the synergistic effect between adjacent catalytic active sites on the selective generation of C1 or C2 products. We have designed and synthesized a stable crystalline single&#8208;chain catalyst model system for electrochemical CO2RR, which involves four homomorphic one&#8208;dimensional chain&#8208;like compounds (Cu&#8208;PzH, Cu&#8208;PzCl, Cu&#8208;PzBr, and Cu&#8208;PzI). The main structural difference of these four chains is the substituents of halogen atoms with different electronegativity on the Pz ligands. Consequently, different synergistic effects between bi&#8208;copper centers lead to changes in the faradic efficiency (FE
:FE
). This work provides a simple and stable crystalline single&#8208;chain model system for systematically studying the influence of coordination microenvironment on catalytically active centers in the CO2RR.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Ion Binding Mediates the Reversible Interconversion of Cis and Trans Peroxido Dicopper Cores</title>

Calcium&#8208;ion binding mediates the reversible interconversion of the prototypical trans&#8208;peroxido Cu2O2 core (TP) to the rare and biologically relevant cis&#8208;peroxido Cu2O2 core (CP). This provides new opportunities to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O2 activation in biomimetic systems.







Abstract
Coupled dinuclear copper oxygen cores (Cu2O2) featured in type III copper proteins (hemocyanin, tyrosinase, catechol oxidase) are vital for O2 transport and substrate oxidation in many organisms. &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;cis peroxido dicopper cores (CP) have been proposed as key structures in the early stages of O2 binding in these proteins; their reversible isomerization to other Cu2O2 cores are directly relevant to enzyme function. Despite the relevance of such species to type III copper proteins and the broader interest in the properties and reactivity of bimetallic CP cores in biological and synthetic systems, the properties and reactivity of CP Cu2O2 species remain largely unexplored. Herein, we report the reversible interconversion of &#956;&#8208;1,2&#8208;trans peroxido (TP) and CP dicopper cores. CaII mediates this process by reversible binding at the Cu2O2 core, highlighting the unique capability for metal&#8208;ion binding events to stabilize novel reactive fragments and control O2 activation in biomimetic systems.

         <title>Discrete Self&#8208;Assembled Metallo&#8208;Foldamers with Heteroleptic Sequence Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 20027-20035, September 1, 2021. </description>

A turn for the better: ligands with orthogonal binding&#8208;site pairings allow the self&#8208;assembly of discrete heteroleptic PdII&#8208;containing sequences. These adopt persistent conformations in solution, allowing &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; metallo&#8208;foldamer formation under thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Discrete and structurally diverse foldamer sequences are constructed in both natural and abiotic systems primarily using inert connectivity with irreversible organic covalent bonds, serving to preserve the identity of the sequence. The formation of sequences under thermodynamic control using labile coordination bonds would be attractive for synthetic ease and modular capability, but this presents issues regarding sequence preservation. Here is presented an approach integrating palladium(II) metal ions into the sequence itself, with fidelity maintained through use of complementary pairings of ligand arrangements at the metal centre. This is accomplished using sites of different denticity and/or hydrogen bonding capability. In this fashion, discrete and ordered metallo&#8208;sequences are formed as thermodynamic products in a single step, and these then fold into defined conformations due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between electron&#8208;rich and &#8208;poor aromatic regions of the combined componentry.

         <title>&#8220;Repaired and Activated&#8221; DNAzyme Enables the Monitoring of DNA Alkylation Repair in Live Cells</title>

We report &#8220;repaired and activated&#8221; DNAzymes (RADzymes) as a simple and versatile platform for the measurement of multiple DNA alkylation repair in living cells. The catalytic activity of RADzymes was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair, thus providing a useful strategy for the study of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.







Abstract
Direct measurement of DNA repair is critical for the annotation of their clinical relevance and the discovery of drugs for cancer therapy. Here we reported a &#8220;repaired and activated&#8221; DNAzyme (RADzyme) by incorporating a single methyl lesion (O6MeG, 3MeC, or 1MeA) at designated positions through systematic screening. We found that the catalytic activity of the RADzyme was remarkably suppressed and could be restored via enzyme&#8208;mediated DNA repair. Benefit from these findings, a fluorogenic RADzyme sensor was developed for the monitoring of MGMT&#8208;mediated repair of O6MeG lesion. Importantly, the sensor allowed the evaluation of MGMT repair activity in different cells and under drugs treatment. Furthermore, another RADzyme sensor was engineered for the monitoring of ALKBH2&#8208;mediated repair of 3MeC lesion. This strategy provides a simple and versatile tool for the study of the basic biology of DNA repair, clinical diagnosis and therapeutic assessment.

In the presence of co&#8208;modulator alcohol, the putative strong &#963; donor, CDC is reshaped into frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;like reactivity. The unique synergistic FLP behavior of CDC; unachievable by its counterpart NHCs, is shown to have beneficial and complementary effects on isocyanate cyclotrimerization, LA polymerization, MMA polymerization and dehydrosilylation of alcohols.







Abstract
Carbodicarbene (CDC), unique carbenic entities bearing two lone pairs of electrons are well&#8208;known for their strong Lewis basicity. We demonstrate herein, upon introducing a weak Br&#248;nsted acid benzyl alcohol (BnOH) as a co&#8208;modulator, CDC is remolded into a Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP)&#8208;like reactivity. DFT calculation and experimental evidence show BnOH loosely interacting with the binding pocket of CDC via H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Four distinct reactions in nature were deployed to demonstrate the viability of proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as synergistic FLP/Modulator (CDC/BnOH), demonstrating enhanced catalytic reactivity in cyclotrimerization of isocyanate, polymerization process for L&#8208;lactide (LA), methyl methacrylate (MMA) and dehydrosilylation of alcohols. Importantly, the catalytic reactivity of carbodicarbene is uniquely distinct from conventional NHC which relies on only single chemical feature of nucleophilicity. This finding also provides a new spin in diversifying FLP reactivity with co&#8208;modulator or co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Ultrafast Water Transport in Two&#8208;Dimensional Channels Enabled by Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes with Controllable Flexibility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19933-19941, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast and high&#8208;efficiency water transport behaviour in 2D GO confined spacing assisted by spherical polyelectrolyte brushes can be easily realized. Further studies revealed that the water transport capacity was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent.







Abstract
Fast water transport channels are crucial for water&#8208;related membrane separation processes. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between flux and selectivity is still a major challenge. To address this, we constructed spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) structures with a highly hydrophilic polyelectrolyte brush layer, and introduced them into GO laminates, which increased both the flux and the separation factor. At 70&#8201;&#176;C, the flux reached 5.23&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1, and the separation factor of butanol/water increased to &#8776;8000, which places it among the most selective separation membranes reported to date. Interestingly, further studies demonstrated that the enhancement of water transport was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains, but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structure&#8208;performance correlations between water molecule migration and the flexibility of the ordered polymer chains in the 2D confined space.

     alt="Ultrafast Water Transport in Two-Dimensional Channels Enabled by Spherical Polyelectrolyte Brushes with Controllable Flexibility"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast and high-efficiency water transport behaviour in 2D GO confined spacing assisted by spherical polyelectrolyte brushes can be easily realized. Further studies revealed that the water transport capacity was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast water transport channels are crucial for water-related membrane separation processes. However, overcoming the trade-off between flux and selectivity is still a major challenge. To address this, we constructed spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) structures with a highly hydrophilic polyelectrolyte brush layer, and introduced them into GO laminates, which increased both the flux and the separation factor. At 70&#8201;&#176;C, the flux reached 5.23&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the separation factor of butanol/water increased to &#8776;8000, which places it among the most selective separation membranes reported to date. Interestingly, further studies demonstrated that the enhancement of water transport was not only dependent on the hydrophilicity of the polyelectrolyte chains, but also influenced by their flexibility in the solvent. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structure-performance correlations between water molecule migration and the flexibility of the ordered polymer chains in the 2D confined space.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Dependent Second&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Effect in 1D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Bulk Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 20021-20026, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite single crystals are used to effectively distinguish the circularly polarized light in the near infrared region by chirality&#8208;dependent second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD) effect with a high anisotropy factor (gSHG&#8208;CD=0.21).







Abstract
The introduction of chirality into organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) is expected to achieve excellent photoelectric and nonlinear materials related to circular dichroism. Owing to the existence of asymmetric center and intrinsic chirality in the chiral OIHPs, the different efficiencies of second harmonic generation (SHG) signal occurs when the circularly polarized light (CPL) with different phases passes through the chiral crystal, which is defined as second harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG&#8208;CD). Here, the SHG&#8208;CD effect is developed in bulk single crystals of chiral one&#8208;dimensional (1D) [(R/S)&#8208;3&#8208;aminopiperidine]PbI4. It is the first time that CPL is distinguished using chirality&#8208;dependent SHG&#8208;CD effect in OIHPs bulk single crystals. Such SHG&#8208;CD technology extends the detection range to near infrared region (NIR). In this way, the anisotropy factor (gSHG&#8208;CD) through SHG&#8208;CD signal is as high as 0.21.

         <title>Expanding the Occurrence of Polysaccharides to the Viral World: The Case of Mimivirus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19897-19904, September 1, 2021. </description>

The giant virus Mimivirus has an icosahedral capsid embedded in a thick layer of fibrils, resembling the glycocalyx of many bacteria. This study revealed that these fibrils are composed by a limited set of carrier proteins which bear two distinct polysaccharides. The presence of polysaccharides refutes the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses and opens new avenues in the field of glycosciences and viral biology.







Abstract
The general perception of viruses is that they are small in terms of size and genome, and that they hijack the host machinery to glycosylate their capsid. Giant viruses subvert all these concepts: their particles are not small, and their genome is more complex than that of some bacteria. Regarding glycosylation, this concept has been already challenged by the finding that Chloroviruses have an autonomous glycosylation machinery that produces oligosaccharides similar in size to those of small viruses (6&#8211;12 units), albeit different in structure compared to the viral counterparts. We report herein that Mimivirus possesses a glycocalyx made of two different polysaccharides, now challenging the concept that all viruses coat their capsids with oligosaccharides of discrete size. This discovery contradicts the paradigm that such macromolecules are absent in viruses, blurring the boundaries between giant viruses and the cellular world and opening new avenues in the field of viral glycobiology.

         <title>Discharge&#8208;Induced Enhancement of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 20042-20048, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current mechanism studies mainly concern surface reconstruction at high potential with respect to formation of high&#8208;valence metal sites and metal oxyhydroxides. The understanding of correlation between low potential scanning, surface structure, and electrochemical activity is lacking. This work suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.







Abstract
The fundamental understanding of the surface reconstruction induced by the applied potential is of great significance for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we show that a previously overlooked discharge current in the low applied potential region also leads to in situ electrochemical activation of a nitrogen&#8208;doped nickel oxyhydroxide surface. We exploit the fact that doping of heteroatoms weakens the surface structure, and hence, a weak discharge current originating from the capacitive nature of nickel oxyhydroxide has a strong structure&#8208;reforming ability to promote the formation of nitrogen and oxygen vacancies. The current density at 1.4&#8197;V (vs. Hg/HgO) can dramatically increase by as much as 31.3&#8201;% after discharge in the low applied potential region. This work provides insight into in situ enhancement of the OER and suggests that the low applied potential region must be a primary consideration in evaluating the origin of the activity of electrocatalysts.

Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photosensitizers generate ROS exclusively by the Type&#8208;I process upon near&#8208;infrared light illumination for tumor ablation.







Abstract
Developing Type&#8208;I photosensitizers is considered as an efficient approach to overcome the deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) for hypoxic tumors. However, it remains a challenge to design photosensitizers for generating reactive oxygen species by the Type&#8208;I process. Herein, we report a series of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;linked BODIPY dimers and a trimer that exclusively generate superoxide radical (O2&#8722;.) by the Type&#8208;I process upon light irradiation. The triplet formation originates from an effective excited&#8208;state relaxation from the initially populated singlet (S1) to triplet (T1) states via an intermediate triplet (T2) state. The low reduction potential and ultralong lifetime of the T1 state facilitate the efficient generation of O2&#8722;. by inter&#8208;molecular charge transfer to molecular oxygen. The energy gap of T1&#8208;S0 is smaller than that between 3O2 and 1O2 thereby precluding the generation of singlet oxygen by the Type&#8208;II process. The trimer exhibits superior PDT performance under the hypoxic environment.

Isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir complexes showed distinctive reactivity to hen egg white lysozyme by forming adducts at different binding sites and/or underwent different ligand exchange reactions. Protein crystallography, mass spectrometry and computational studies demonstrated the role of the metal centers and the protein microenvironment in determining their selectivity for a specific site.







Abstract
Metal complexes can be considered a &#8220;paradigm of promiscuity&#8221; when it comes to their interactions with proteins. They often form adducts with a variety of donor atoms in an unselective manner. We have characterized the adducts formed between a series of isostructural N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with Ru, Os, Rh, and Ir centers and the model protein hen egg white lysozyme by X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Distinctive behavior for the metal compounds was observed with the more labile Ru and Rh complexes targeting mainly a surface l&#8208;histidine moiety through cleavage of p&#8208;cymene or NHC co&#8208;ligands, respectively. In contrast, the more inert Os and Ir derivatives were detected abundantly in an electronegative binding pocket after undergoing ligand exchange of a chlorido ligand for an amino acid side chain. Computational studies supported the binding profiles and hinted at the role of the protein microenvironment for metal complexes eliciting selectivity for specific binding sites on the protein.

         <title>A Dynamic Chemical Clip in Supramolecular Framework for Sorting Alkylaromatic Isomers using Thermodynamic and Kinetic Preferences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19921-19927, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic adsorbent that acts like a chemical clip was realized, which sorts alkylaromatic isomers with high selectivity. The design of the chemical clip is based on a supramolecular coordination polymer, and the thermodynamic and kinetic preferences towards the isomers are unveiled by a combinatorial experimental and computational approach.







Abstract
Adsorptive chemical separation is at the forefront of future technologies, for use in chemical and petrochemical industries. In this process, a porous adsorbent selectively allows a single component from a mixture of three or more chemical components to be adsorbed or permeate. To separate the unsorted chemicals, a different adsorbent is needed. A unique adsorbent which can recognize and separate each of the chemicals from a mixture of three or more components is the necessity for the next generation porous materials. In this regard, we demonstrate a &#8220;dynamic chemical clip&#8221; in a supramolecular framework capable of thermodynamic and kinetics&#8208;based chemical separation. The dynamic space, featuring a strong preference for aromatic guests through &#960;&#8208;&#960; and C&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and adaptability, can recognize the individual chemical isomers from mixtures and separate those based on thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The liquid&#8208;phase selectivity and separation of the aromatic isomers are possible by the adaptability of the &#8220;chemical clip&#8221; and here we elucidate the prime factors in a combinatorial approach involving crystallographic evidence and detailed computational studies.

         <title>Preparation of Patterned and Multilayer Thin Films for Organic Electronics via Oxygen&#8208;Tolerant SI&#8208;PET&#8208;RAFT</title>

Surface&#8208;initiated polymerization is used to create the multilayer architectures of 3rd&#8208; and 4th&#8208;generation OLEDs using photoinduced electron transfer reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization. Direct photomasking and digital projection lithography allow for complex patterning at low cost.







Abstract
An oxygen&#8208;tolerant approach is described for preparing surface&#8208;tethered polymer films of organic semiconductors directly from electrode substrates using polymer brush photolithography. A photoinduced electron transfer&#8208;reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) approach was used to prepare multiblock polymer architectures with the structures of multi&#8208;layer organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), including electron&#8208;transport, emissive, and hole&#8208;transport layers. The preparation of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and thermally assisted fluorescence (TAF) trilayer OLED architectures are described. By using direct photomasking as well as a digital micromirror device, we also show that the surface&#8208;initiated (SI)&#8208;PET&#8208;RAFT approach allows for enhanced control over layer thickness, and spatial resolution in polymer brush patterning at low cost.

Systematic manipulation of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains in combination with elucidation of the interactions between the unique domains and structure revealed several hitherto unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A.







Abstract
Systematic inactivation of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) domains and translocation of the thioesterase (TE) domain revealed several unprecedented nonlinear NRPS assembly processes during the biosynthesis of the cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A in Streptomyces sp. SNM55. First, two sets of type &#921;&#921; TE (TE&#921;&#921;)&#8208;like enzymes mediate the shuttling of activated amino acids between two sets of stand&#8208;alone adenylation (A)&#8208;thiolation (T) didomain modules and an &#8220;A&#8208;less&#8221; condensation (C)&#8208;T module with distinctive specificities and flexibilities. This was confirmed by the elucidation of the affinities of the A&#8208;T didomains for the TE&#921;&#921;s and its structure. Second, the C&#8208;T didomain module operates iteratively and independently from other modules in the same protein to catalyze two chain elongation cycles. Third, this biosynthetic pathway includes the first example of module skipping, where the interpolated C and T domains are required for chain transfer.

         <title>Synthesis and Structural Elucidation of Bisdibenzocorannulene in Multiple Redox States</title>

Chemical reduction/oxidation of a new type of curved &#960;&#8208;network (BDBC) provided access to its multiple redox states. For the one&#8208;electron reduced state, the BDBC.&#8722; was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as a solvent&#8208;separated radical anion; while the two&#8208;electron oxidized state was revealed as an unusual singlet diradical dication (BDBC..)2+. As a consequence of their redox behaviours, their structures and ring currents have large differences.







Abstract
We report an anti&#8208;folded bowl&#8208;shaped bisdibenzocorannulene (BDBC) featuring a new chair&#8208;cyclohexane&#8208;like hexagon as a bridge of two dibenzocorannulene moieties. The neutral compound showed multiple redox&#8208;active properties and could be converted to the corresponding redox states through chemical reduction or oxidation. Chemical reduction of BDBC by stoichiometric addition of metallic potassium in the presence of [18]crown&#8208;6 ether, provided a radical anion BDBC.&#8722; and a dianion BDBC2&#8722;, respectively; while chemical oxidation by silver hexafluoroantimonate(V), converted the neutral compound to an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical dication (BDBC..)2+. The structural consequences of both electron&#8208;reduction and oxidation were closely related to the release of ring&#8208;strain of the bowl&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;scaffold and imposed steric hindrance of the hexagonal bridge. In addition, the unusual open&#8208;shell nature of the dication could mainly be attributed to the changing of localized antiaromaticity in the closed&#8208;shell structure to delocalized character in the biradical, and thus the emergence of weakly bonded &#960;&#8208;electrons.

         <title>Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Ligands Enable Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Markovnikov Protoboration and Protosilylation of Terminal Alkynes: A Versatile Portal to Functionalized Alkenes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Copper catalysts bearing cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands exhibit remarkably high Markovnikov selectivity in the protoboration and &#8208;silylation of terminal alkynes. This work demonstrates the ability of this strongly &#963;&#8208;donating family of ligands to perturb regioselectivity in the addition of copper&#8722;boryl species to C&#8722;C &#960;&#8208;bonds.







Abstract
Regioselective hydrofunctionalization of alkynes represents a straightforward route to access alkenyl boronate and silane building blocks. In previously reported catalytic systems, high selectivity is achieved with a limited scope of substrates and/or reagents, with general solutions lacking. Herein, we describe a selective copper&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydrofunctionalization of terminal alkynes that is facilitated by strongly donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands. Using this method, both alkyl&#8208; and aryl&#8208;substituted alkynes are coupled with a variety of boryl and silyl reagents with high &#945;&#8208;selectivity. The reaction is scalable, and the products are versatile intermediates that can participate in various downstream transformations. Preliminary mechanistic experiments shed light on the role of CAAC ligands in this process.

The first multifunctionalized phosphoinositide polyphosphate derivatives featuring a photo&#8208;removable protecting group, a photo&#8208;crosslinkable diazirine group, and a terminal alkyne group useful for click chemistry were synthesized. The lipid derivatives readily enter cells and rapid trafficking of uncaged derivatives to the plasma membrane is observed, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved.







Abstract
We synthesized the first multifunctionalized phosphoinositide polyphosphate derivatives featuring a photo&#8208;removable protecting group (&#8220;cage&#8221;), a photo&#8208;crosslinkable diazirine group, and a terminal alkyne group useful for click chemistry. We demonstrate that the lipid derivatives readily enter cells. After photo&#8208;crosslinking, cell fixation and fluorescent tagging via click chemistry, we determined the intracellular location of the lipid derivatives before and after uncaging of the lipids. We find that there is rapid trafficking of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 derivatives to the plasma membrane, opening the intriguing possibility that there is active transport of these lipids involved. We employed the photo&#8208;crosslinking and click chemistry functions to analyze the proteome of PI(3,4,5)P3&#8208;binding proteins. From the latter, we validated by RNAi that the putative lipid binding proteins ATP11A and MPP6 are involved in the transport of PI(3,4,5)P3 to the plasma membrane.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Phthalocyanine&#8208;Derived Molecular Isolation Layer for Highly Stable Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19852-19859, September 1, 2021. </description>

A planar molecular cobalt phthalocyanine was introduced into the bare electrolyte of a Li|LiFePO4 full&#8208;cell under lean electrolyte conditions (3&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1), thereby protecting the cathode and anode electrodes at the same time, and enhancing the electrochemical performance. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure was used to verify the protective mechanism of additives at the cathode and anode electrodes.







Abstract
The uneven consumption of anions during the lithium (Li) deposition process triggers a space charge effect that generates Li dendrites, seriously hindering the practical application of Li&#8208;metal batteries. We report on a cobalt phthalocyanine electrolyte additive with a planar molecular structure, which can be tightly adsorbed on the Li anode surface to form a dense molecular layer. Such a planar molecular layer cannot only complex with Li ions to reduce the space charge effect, but also suppress side reactions between the anode and the electrolyte, producing a stable solid electrolyte interphase composed of amorphous lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium carbonate (LiCO3), as verified by X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy. As a result, the Li|Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent cycling stability above 700&#8197;h under a high plating capacity of 3&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the assembled Li|lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) full&#8208;cell can also deliver excellent cycling over 200&#8197;cycles under lean electrolyte conditions (3&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1).

         <title>Cyclic Amplification of the Afterglow Luminescent Nanoreporter Enables the Prediction of Anti&#8208;cancer Efficiency</title>

An organic afterglow luminescent nanoreporter (PFODBT@CPPO) is developed for visualizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and predicting immunogenic cell death during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy. The thiophene&#8208;based afterglow luminescent nanoplatform is important to develop novel afterglow luminescent materials and provide instant information to avoid adverse immune responses.







Abstract
We developed a cyclic amplification method for an organic afterglow nanoreporter for the real&#8208;time visualization of self&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). We promoted semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (PFODBT) as a candidate for emitting near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescence. Introduction of a chemiluminescent substrate (CPPO) into PFODBT (PFODBT@CPPO) resulted in a significant enhancement of afterglow intensity through the dual cyclic amplification pathway involving singlet oxygen (1O2). 1O2 produced by PFODBT@CPPO induced cancer cell necrosis and promoted the release of damage&#8208;related molecular patterns, thereby evoking immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;associated immune responses through ROS&#8208;based oxidative stress. The afterglow luminescent signals of the nanoreporter were well correlated with light&#8208;driven 1O2 generation and anti&#8208;cancer efficiency. This imaging strategy provides a non&#8208;invasive tool for predicting the therapeutic outcome that occurs during ROS&#8208;mediated cancer therapy.

         <title>Post&#8208;Translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide&#8208;Modifying Radical SAM Enzyme</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19957-19964, September 1, 2021. </description>

We report a biochemical study of a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally synthesized and post&#8208;translationally modified peptide (RiPP). This rSAM enzyme exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity, which produces cyclophane in vivo but formylglycine and aminomalonate (Ama) in vitro. Unlike most enzymes involved in RiPP biosynthesis, this enzyme does not require leader peptide for activity.







Abstract
Aminomalonate (Ama) is a widespread structural motif in Nature, whereas its biosynthetic route is only partially understood. In this study, we show that a radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in cyclophane biosynthesis exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity. This enzyme, named three&#8208;residue cyclophane forming enzyme (3&#8208;CyFE), mainly produces cyclophane in vivo, whereas it produces formylglycine (FGly) as a major product and barely produce cyclophane in vitro. Importantly, the enzyme can further oxidize FGly to produce Ama. Bioinformatic study revealed that 3&#8208;CyFEs have evolved from a common ancestor with anaerobic sulfatase maturases (anSMEs), and possess a similar set of catalytic residues with anSMEs. Remarkably, the enzyme does not need leader peptide for activity and is fully active on a truncated peptide containing only 5 amino acids of the core sequence.

     alt="Post-Translational Formation of Aminomalonate by a Promiscuous Peptide-Modifying Radical SAM Enzyme"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report a biochemical study of a radical S-adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP). This rSAM enzyme exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity, which produces cyclophane in vivo but formylglycine and aminomalonate (Ama) in vitro. Unlike most enzymes involved in RiPP biosynthesis, this enzyme does not require leader peptide for activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aminomalonate (Ama) is a widespread structural motif in Nature, whereas its biosynthetic route is only partially understood. In this study, we show that a radical S-adenosylmethionine (rSAM) enzyme involved in cyclophane biosynthesis exhibits remarkable catalytic promiscuity. This enzyme, named three-residue cyclophane forming enzyme (3-CyFE), mainly produces cyclophane in vivo, whereas it produces formylglycine (FGly) as a major product and barely produce cyclophane in vitro. Importantly, the enzyme can further oxidize FGly to produce Ama. Bioinformatic study revealed that 3-CyFEs have evolved from a common ancestor with anaerobic sulfatase maturases (anSMEs), and possess a similar set of catalytic residues with anSMEs. Remarkably, the enzyme does not need leader peptide for activity and is fully active on a truncated peptide containing only 5 amino acids of the core sequence. Our work discloses the first ribosomal path towards Ama formation, providing a possible hint for the rich occurrence of Ama in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Indolizy Carbene Ligand. Evaluation of Electronic Properties and Applications in Asymmetric Gold(I) Catalysis</title>

AuI complexes coordinated to the Indolizy ligand, a new carbene ligand that results from the gold&#8208;promoted cyclization of a pyridyl&#8208;allene were investigated. The electronic properties of the Indolizy ligand were analysed. The introduction of a stereogenic center in &#945;&#8208;position to the carbene center coupled to the introduction of a pending phosphine oxide group affords highly efficient and enantioselective AuI catalysts.







Abstract
We report herein a new family of carbene ligands based on an indolizine&#8208;ylidene (Indolizy) moiety. The corresponding gold(I) complexes are easily obtained from the gold(I)&#8208;promoted cyclization of allenylpyridine precursors. Evaluation of the electronic properties by experimental methods and also by DFT calculations confirms strong &#963;&#8208;donating and &#960;&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands. Cationization of the gold(I) complexes generates catalytic species that trigger diverse reactions of (poly)unsaturated precursors. When armed with a methylene phosphine oxide moiety on the stereogenic center adjacent to the nitrogen atom, the corresponding bifunctional carbene ligands give rise to highly enantioselective heterocyclizations. DFT calculations brought some rationalization and highlighted the critical roles played by the phosphine oxide group and the tosylate anion in the asymmetric cyclization of &#947;&#8208;allenols.

Fc region binding peptide conjugated with attenuated lytic peptide L17E trimer [FcB(L17E)3] was designed for intracellular delivery of IgG. Liquid droplets were formed by mixing Alexa Fluor 488 labeled IgG (Alexa488&#8208;IgG) with FcB(L17E)3. Droplet contact with cell membrane led to quick influx of Alexa488&#8208;IgG throughout cells. Successful delivery of functional proteins into cells allowed binding to subcellular targets in the presence of FcB(L17E)3.







Abstract
Fc region binding peptide conjugated with attenuated cationic amphiphilic lytic peptide L17E trimer [FcB(L17E)3] was designed for immunoglobulin G (IgG) delivery into cells. Particle&#8208;like liquid droplets were generated by mixing Alexa Fluor 488 labeled IgG (Alexa488&#8208;IgG) with FcB(L17E)3. Droplet contact with the cellular membrane led to spontaneous influx and distribution of Alexa488&#8208;IgG throughout cells in serum containing medium. Involvement of cellular machinery accompanied by actin polymerization and membrane ruffling was suggested for the translocation. Alexa488&#8208;IgG negative charges were crucial in liquid droplet formation with positively charged FcB(L17E)3. Binding of IgG to FcB(L17E)3 may not be necessary. Successful intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 594&#8208;labeled anti&#8208;nuclear pore complex antibody and anti&#8208;mCherry&#8208;nanobody tagged with supernegatively charged green fluorescence protein allowed binding to cellular targets in the presence of FcB(L17E)3.

         <title>Chemoresponsive Supramolecular Polypseudorotaxanes with Infinite Switching Capability</title>

We report a novel polypseudorotaxane [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. It depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 upon addition of H and AgSF6, while it reforms with successive addition of G. The transformations between [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n and H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 can be switched for infinite cycles.







Abstract
Chemoresponsive supramolecular systems with infinite switching capability are important for applications in recycled materials and intelligent devices. To attain this objective, here a chemoresponsive polypseudorotaxane is reported on the basis of a bis(p&#8208;phenylene)&#8208;34&#8208;crown&#8208;10 macrocycle (H) and a cyano&#8208;substituted viologen guest (G). H and G form a [2]pseudorotaxane (H&#8835;G) both in solution and in the solid state. Upon addition of AgSF6, a polypseudorotaxane (denoted as [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n) forms as synergistically driven by host&#8211;guest complexation and metal&#8208;coordination interactions. [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n depolymerizes into a [3]pseudorotaxane (denoted as H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2) upon addition of H and AgSF6, while it reforms with successive addition of G. The transformations between [H&#8901;G&#8901;Ag]n and H2&#8901;G&#8901;Ag2&#8901;acetone2 can be switched for infinite cycles, superior to the conventional chemoresponsive supramolecular polymeric systems with limited switching capability.

         <title>Macrolactonization Reactions Driven by a Pentafluorobenzoyl Group**

Old made new again: The onset of macrolactonizations can be initiated using the inexpensive pentafluorobenzoyl chloride as an activating agent to deliver a large variety of macrolactones, macrodiolides and esters with high efficiency through a robust protocol. Notably, this process could be easily extended to less reactive phenol derivatives.







Abstract
Macrolactones constitute a privileged class of natural and synthetic products with a broad range of applications in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry. Despite all the progress made towards their synthesis, notably from seco&#8208;acids, a macrolactonization promoter system that is effective, selective, flexible, readily available, and, insofar as possible, compatible with manifold functional groups is still lacking. Herein, we describe a strategy that relies on the formation of a mixed anhydride incorporating a pentafluorophenyl group which, due to its high electronic activation enables a convenient access to macrolactones, macrodiolides and esters with a broad versatility. Kinetic studies and DFT computations were performed to rationalize the reactivity of the pentafluorophenyl group in macrolactonization reactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrolactones constitute a privileged class of natural and synthetic products with a broad range of applications in the fine chemicals and pharmaceutical industry. Despite all the progress made towards their synthesis, notably from &lt;i&gt;seco&lt;/i&gt;-acids, a macrolactonization promoter system that is effective, selective, flexible, readily available, and, insofar as possible, compatible with manifold functional groups is still lacking. Herein, we describe a strategy that relies on the formation of a mixed anhydride incorporating a pentafluorophenyl group which, due to its high electronic activation enables a convenient access to macrolactones, macrodiolides and esters with a broad versatility. Kinetic studies and DFT computations were performed to rationalize the reactivity of the pentafluorophenyl group in macrolactonization reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

We present a localized water&#8208;in&#8208;salt gel electrolyte with low&#8208;cost and high safety for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This electrolyte was fabricated by in situ gelling TEGDA monomer in an aqueous solution based on inexpensive LiNO3 salt and PD diluent. The as&#8208;developed Mo6S8 | LWIS gel | LMO batteries delivered outstanding cycling performance with a Coulombic efficiency of 98.53&#8201;% % after 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.







Abstract
Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes using super&#8208;concentrated organic lithium (Li) salts are of interest for aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, the high salt cost, high viscosity, poor wettability, and environmental hazards remain a great challenge. Herein, we present a localized water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (LWIS) electrolyte based on low&#8208;cost lithium nitrate (LiNO3) salt and 1,5&#8208;pentanediol (PD) as inert diluent. The addition of PD maintains the solvation structure of the WIS electrolyte, improves the electrolyte stability via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with water and NO3&#8722; molecules, and reduces the total salt concentration. By in situ gelling the LWIS electrolyte with tetraethylene glycol diacrylate (TEGDA) monomer, the electrolyte stability window can be further expanded to 3.0&#8197;V. The as&#8208;developed Mo6S8|LWIS gel electrolyte|LiMn2O4 (LMO) batteries delivered outstanding cycling performance with an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.53&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C.

         <title>Tissue Fluid Triggered Enzyme Polymerization for Ultrafast Gelation and Cartilage Repair</title>

We employ an artificial enzyme complex to trigger ultrafast hydrogelation by the tandem biocatalytic generation of carbon radicals from tissue glucose, which demonstrates a high cellular biocompatibility and a significant promotion of cartilage regeneration following the in situ injection.







Abstract
The in situ gelation of injectable precursors is desirable in the field of tissue regeneration, especially in the context of irregular defect filling. The current driving forces for fast gelation include the phase&#8208;transition of thermally sensitive copolymers, click chemical reactions with tissue components, and metal coordination effect. However, the rapid formation of tough hydrogels remains a challenge. Inspired by aerobic metabolism, we herein propose a tissue&#8208;fluid&#8208;triggered cascade enzymatic polymerization process catalyzed by glucose oxidase and ferrous glycinate for the ultrafast gelation of acryloylated chondroitin sulfates and acrylamides. The highly efficient production of carbon radicals and macromolecules contribute to rapid polymerization for soft tissue augmentation in bone defects. The copolymer hydrogel demonstrated the regeneration&#8208;promoting capacity of cartilage. As the first example of using artificial enzyme complexes for in situ polymerization, this work offers a biomimetic approach to the design of strength&#8208;adjustable hydrogels for bio&#8208;implanting and bio&#8208;printing applications.

         <title>Dynamic Catalytic Highly Enantioselective 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloadditions</title>

A highly enantioselectively catalyzed dynamic covalent one&#8208;pot&#8208;tandem 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides to &#945;&#8242;&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentenones is described. Time&#8208;dependend enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent synthesis was achieved by using the same set of reagents. A reversible cycloaddition of the kinetically favored product enables the interconversion to its more stable thermodynamically favored product through a chiral complex&#8208;mediated process.







Abstract
In dynamic covalent chemistry, reactions follow a thermodynamically controlled pathway through equilibria. Reversible covalent&#8208;bond formation and breaking in a dynamic process enables the interconversion of products formed under kinetic control to thermodynamically more stable isomers. Notably, enantioselective catalysis of dynamic transformations has not been reported and applied in complex molecule synthesis. We describe the discovery of dynamic covalent enantioselective metal&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reactions. We have developed a stereodivergent tandem synthesis of structurally and stereochemically complex molecules that generates eight stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity through asymmetric reversible bond formation in a dynamic process in two consecutive Ag&#8208;catalyzed 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of azomethine ylides with electron&#8208;poor olefins. Time&#8208;dependent reversible dynamic covalent&#8208;bond formation gives enantiodivergent and diastereodivergent access to structurally complex double cycloadducts with high selectivity from a common set of reagents.

         <title>Mechanically Triggered Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>

A mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction was developed for the detection and amplification of cell mechanics. It enables the quantification of cellular receptor forces with improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio on a microscope and in a more rapid manner with a conventional plate reader.







Abstract
Cells transmit piconewton forces to receptors to mediate processes such as migration and immune recognition. A major challenge in quantifying such forces is the sparsity of cell mechanical events. Accordingly, molecular tension is typically quantified with high resolution fluorescence microscopy, which hinders widespread adoption and application. Here, we report a mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano&#8208;HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano&#8208;HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano&#8208;IC50 for aspirin, Y&#8208;27632, and eptifibatide. Given that cell mechanical phenotypes are of clinical importance, mechano&#8208;HCR may offer a convenient route for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and disease diagnosis.

         <title>A Unified Catalytic Asymmetric (4+1) and (5+1) Annulation Strategy to Access Chiral Spirooxindole&#8208;Fused Oxacycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19813-19820, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peroxides, which function as umpoled bielectrophilic synthons, enable unified catalytic asymmetric (4+1) and (5+1) annulation reactions in the presence of a phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC). This new strategy provides an unconventional protocol to access the biologically important chiral spirooxindole&#8208;tetrahydrofurans and &#8208;tetrahydropyrans in good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 94&#8201;% ee).







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Peroxides, which function as umpoled bielectrophilic synthons, enable unified catalytic asymmetric (4+1) and (5+1) annulation reactions in the presence of a phase-transfer catalyst (PTC). This new strategy provides an unconventional protocol to access the biologically important chiral spirooxindole-tetrahydrofurans and -tetrahydropyrans in good yields and high enantioselectivities (up to 94&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Formation and Cycloaddition Reactions of a Reactive Boraalkene Stabilized Internally by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>

A readily available cyclic boraalkene contains a neutral B=C functionality. The reactive polar main&#8208;group&#8208;element&#8208;carbon &#960;&#8208;bond undergoes an unusual series of reactions upon addition of various small molecules, such as carbon dioxide, N2O or elements, such as selenium.







Abstract
The synthesis of element&#8722;carbon double bonds is of great importance for the development and understanding of reactive &#960;&#8208;bonded systems in chemistry. The seven&#8208;membered heterocyclic system 4&#8201;b is readily made by internal C&#8722;H activation at a pendent isopropyl methyl group of the respective [(IPr)C6F5BH]+ borenium ion. Subsequent deprotonation with the IMes carbene gives the neutral cyclic boraalkene system 5&#8201;b. The B=C double bond in compound 5&#8201;b adds carbon dioxide, CS2, sulfur dioxide, phenyl isocyanate, an acetylenic ester or two NO molecules to give the corresponding four&#8208;membered ring annulated heterocycles. With sulfur or selenium 5&#8201;b gives the respective three&#8208;membered ring systems. N2O reacts with 5&#8201;b to give a mixture of the related oxaborirane 18 and a unique [B]OH containing diazoalkane product 19.

         <title>A Cationic Micelle as In Vivo Catalyst for Tumor&#8208;Localized Cleavage Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19750-19758, September 1, 2021. </description>

Cationic micelles accelerate desilylation&#8208;induced cleavage chemistry over 1400&#8208;fold under physiological conditions. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed desilylation strategy unveils the potential that micelles may act beyond carriers but as in vivo catalysts for local perturbing or activation.







Abstract
The emerging strategies of accelerating the cleavage reaction in tumors through locally enriching the reactants is promising. Yet, the applications are limited due to the lack of the tumor&#8208;selectivity for most of the reactants. Here we explored an alternative approach to leverage the rate constant by locally inducing an in vivo catalyst. We found that the desilylation&#8208;induced cleavage chemistry could be catalyzed in vivo by cationic micelles, and accelerated over 1400&#8208;fold under physiological condition. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed controlled release platform is demonstrated by the release of a 6&#8208;hydroxyl&#8208;quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;benzothiazole derivative (HQB) in two cancer cell lines and a NIR dye in mouse tumor xenografts. Through intravenous injection of a pH&#8208;sensitive polymer micelles, we successfully applied this strategy to a prodrug activation of hydroxyl camptothecin (OH&#8208;CPT) in tumors. Its &#8220;decaging&#8221; efficiency is 42&#8208;fold to that without cationic micelles&#8208;mediated catalysis. This micelle&#8208;catalyzed desilylation strategy unveils the potential that micelle may act beyond a carrier but a catalyst for local perturbing or activation.

         <title>Beyond Takai's Olefination Reagent: Persistent Dehalogenation Emerges in a Chromium(III)&#8208;&#956;3&#8208;Methylidyne Complex</title>

The methylidyne complex [CrIII3Cl3(&#956;&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] displays the ultimate product of the CrCl2/CHI3 redox reaction, significantly affecting carbonylic group transformation; the trimetallic compound also exhibits unusual magnetic behavior and provides ready access to half&#8208;sandwich clusters.







Abstract
Reaction of CHI3 with six equivalents of CrCl2 in THF at low temperatures affords [Cr3Cl3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] as the first isolable high&#8208;yield CrIII &#956;3&#8208;methylidyne complex. Substitution of the terminal chlorido ligands via salt metathesis with alkali&#8208;metal cyclopentadienides generates isostructural half&#8208;sandwich chromium(III)&#8208;&#956;3&#8208;methylidynes [CpR3Cr3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)] (CpR=C5H5, C5Me5, C5H4SiMe3). Side and decomposition products of the Cl/CpR exchange reactions were identified and structurally characterized for [Cr4(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)4(&#956;2&#8208;I)2(&#956;4&#8208;O)(thf)4] and [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H4SiMe3)CrCl(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)2Li(thf)2]. The Cl/CpR exchange drastically changed the ambient&#8208;temperature effective magnetic moment &#956;eff from 9.30/9.11&#8197;&#956;B (solution/solid) to 3.63/4.32&#8197;&#956;B (CpR=C5Me5). Reactions of [Cr3Cl3(&#956;2&#8208;Cl)3(&#956;3&#8208;CH)(thf)6] with aldehydes and ketones produce intricate mixtures of species through oxy/methylidyne exchange, which were partially identified as radical recombination products through GC/MS analysis and 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy.

We present a series of rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes with a naphthalene&#8208;di&#8208;imide N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand that behave as effective redox&#8208;switchable catalysts for the cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. The catalysts can adopt three electronically different stages with distinct catalytic activities. The activity of catalysts can toggle between the activated and inactivated forms for several cycles.







Abstract
Two naphthalene&#8208;diimide (NDI) bis&#8208;imidazolium salts have been used as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors for the preparation of NDI&#8208;functionalized complexes of rhodium and iridium of general formula [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] (M=Rh, Ir; NDI&#8208;NHC=NDI&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand). Comparison of the IR spectra of the complexes [IrCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(CO)2] and their related one&#8208; and two&#8208;electron reduced forms, reveal that each one&#8208;electron reduction produces a decrease of the average &#957;(CO) of 9&#8211;10&#8197;cm&#8722;1, indicating a significant enhancement of the electron&#8208;richness of the metal. The [MCl(NDI&#8208;NHC)(COD)] complexes were tested in the catalytic cycloisomerization of alkynoic acids. The one&#8208;electron reduced forms showed greatly enhanced activities. For the cyclization of 5&#8208;hexynoic acid, the two&#8208;electron reduction of the ligand produced further enhancement of the catalytic activity, therefore showing that the catalyst can switch between three redox species with three distinct catalytic activities.

A highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective cascade reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds with 2&#8208;nitroindoles, 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes was achieved through dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt catalysis. Three types of structurally fused heterocycles were obtained in excellent stereoselectivities. Regioselectivities were determined by the low reaction energy resulting from the initial &#945;&#8208;addition but not &#947;&#8208;addition.







Abstract
Chiral (dihydro)furo&#8208;fused heterocycles are significant structural motifs in numerous natural products, functional materials and pharmaceuticals. Therefore, developing efficient methods for preparing compounds with these privileged scaffolds is an important endeavor in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we develop an effective, modular method by a dipeptide&#8208;phosphonium salt&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereoselective cascade reaction of readily available linear &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones with aromatic alkenes, affording a wide variety of structurally fused heterocyclic molecules in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities. Moreover, mechanistic investigations revealed that the bifunctional phosphonium salt controlled the regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of this cascade reaction, particularly proceeding through the initial ketone &#945;&#8208;addition followed by O&#8208;participated substitution; and the multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between Br&#248;nsted acid moieties of catalyst and nitro group of aromatic alkene were crucial in asymmetric induction. Given the generality, versatility, and high efficiency of this method, we anticipate that it will have broad synthetic utilities.

         <title>Enzymatic Tailoring in Luzopeptin Biosynthesis Involves Cytochrome&#8197;P450&#8208;Mediated Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen Bond Desaturation for Hydrazone Formation</title>

Luzopeptins are potent antitumor and antiviral agents with their biological activities controlled by rare modified tetrahydropyridazine structural subunits. Reconstitution of the tailoring pathway in luzopeptin&#8197;A biosynthesis reveals the molecular basis of this key pharmacophore formation, which involves unusual carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation by multitasking cytochrome&#8197;P450 and extracellular O&#8208;acetylation by integral membrane acyltransferase.







Abstract
Luzopeptins and related decadepsipeptides are bisintercalator nonribosomal peptides featuring rare acyl&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylic acid (Thp) subunits that are critical to their biological activities. Herein, we reconstitute the biosynthetic tailoring pathway in luzopeptin&#8197;A biosynthesis through in vivo genetic and in vitro biochemical approaches. Significantly, we revealed a multitasking cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme that catalyzes four consecutive oxidations including the highly unusual carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation, forming the hydrazone&#8208;bearing 4&#8208;OH&#8208;Thp residues. Moreover, we identified a membrane&#8208;bound acyltransferase that likely mediates the subsequent O&#8208;acetylation extracellularly, as a potential self&#8208;protective strategy for the producer strain. Further genome mining of novel decadepsipeptides and an associated P450 enzyme have provided mechanistic insights into the P450&#8208;mediated carbon&#8211;nitrogen bond desaturation. Our results not only reveal the molecular basis of pharmacophore formation in bisintercalator decadepsipeptides, but also expand the catalytic versatility of P450 family enzymes.

         <title>Resistance&#8208;Chiral Anisotropy of Chiral Mesostructured Half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 Films</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 20036-20041, September 1, 2021. </description>

We report chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films exhibiting the chirality&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity. Below 30&#8197;K, as the half&#8208;metallic Fe3O4 is completely spin polarized and the chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films can act as a spin filter, the transport of spins is chirality&#8208;dependent. Thus, the antipodal chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films exhibited asymmetric responses to the spin transport and resulted in different electrical resistance.







Abstract
Half&#8208;metallic materials are theoretically predicted to be metallic and insulating, which have not been confirmed experimentally, and the predictions are still in doubt. We report the resistance&#8208;chiral anisotropy (R&#8208;ChA), i.e., chirality&#8208;dependent electrical conductivity, in chiral mesostructured Fe3O4 films (CMFFs) grown on the substrates via a hydrothermal method using amino acids as symmetry&#8208;breaking agents. Two levels of chirality exist in the CMFFs: primary distortion of the crystal lattice forms twisted nanoflakes, and secondary helical stacking of nanoflakes forms fan&#8208;shaped nanoplates. At temperatures below 30&#8197;K, the CMFFs exhibited metallic conductivity and insulation for one handedness and the other, respectively. The chirality&#8208;dependent effective magnetic fields were speculated to stabilize the opposite spin in the antipodal chiral frame, which led to the free transport of electrons in one handedness of the chiral structure and immobility for the other handedness.

         <title>Protonated Imine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19797-19803, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonation of imine&#8208;linked COFs yields significant variations of their (opto)electronic properties and results in a largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water. This is attributed to an enhanced light absorption ability, charge separation efficiency, and hydrophilicity of imine&#8208;linked COFs upon protonation.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as an important class of organic semiconductors and photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)from water. To optimize their photocatalytic activity, typically the organic moieties constituting the frameworks are considered and the most suitable combinations of them are searched for. However, the effect of the covalent linkage between these moieties on the photocatalytic performance has rarely been studied. Herein, we demonstrate that donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type imine&#8208;linked COFs can produce hydrogen with a rate as high as 20.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, upon protonation of their imine linkages. A significant red&#8208;shift in light absorbance, largely improved charge separation efficiency, and an increase in hydrophilicity triggered by protonation of the Schiff&#8208;base moieties in the imine&#8208;linked COFs, are responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance.

     alt="Protonated Imine-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protonation of imine-linked COFs yields significant variations of their (opto)electronic properties and results in a largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water. This is attributed to an enhanced light absorption ability, charge separation efficiency, and hydrophilicity of imine-linked COFs upon protonation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as an important class of organic semiconductors and photocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)from water. To optimize their photocatalytic activity, typically the organic moieties constituting the frameworks are considered and the most suitable combinations of them are searched for. However, the effect of the covalent linkage between these moieties on the photocatalytic performance has rarely been studied. Herein, we demonstrate that donor-acceptor (D-A) type imine-linked COFs can produce hydrogen with a rate as high as 20.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under visible light irradiation, upon protonation of their imine linkages. A significant red-shift in light absorbance, largely improved charge separation efficiency, and an increase in hydrophilicity triggered by protonation of the Schiff-base moieties in the imine-linked COFs, are responsible for the improved photocatalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;

A synthesis to control the amount of reacting SO3 and the cation to boron ratio during solvothermal syntheses with oleum is crucial to explore the structural diversity of borosulfates. The novel borosulfate Sr[B3O(SO4)4(HSO4)] was synthesized in phase&#8208;pure form, and the anionic substructure features a triple&#8208;vertex connection of three (BO4) tetrahedra via one oxygen atom. The motif was previously unknown for borosulfates, but is not uncommon for borates. This outperformance of silicate&#8208;untypical behavior of a borosulfate was further investigated by means of DFT calculations, as reported by J&#246;rn Bruns and co&#8208;workers in their Communication on page&#8197;19740.

Large amounts of antibodies can be rapidly delivered into cells from coacervates (liquid droplets) formed by mixing a fluorescently labeled antibody and a delivery peptide, as reported by Shiroh Futaki et&#8197;al. in their Research Article on page&#8197;19804. The mode of delivery is a mysterious phenomenon, which is accompanied by structural changes of the cell membranes as for a drop of ink on a water surface. The cover illustration shows a representation of the intracellular delivery of antibodies by coacervate. This research has realized the first intracellular delivery of antibodies using liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation.

         <title>Skeletal Editing&#8212;Nitrogen Deletion of Secondary Amines by Anomeric Amide Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19522-19524, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for structural modification by skeletal editing of secondary amines employs N&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkoxyamide as a reagent. Single&#8208;atom N&#8208;deletion is a novel approach for constructing C&#8722;C bonds under N2 extrusion and uses widely available secondary amines in late&#8208;stage skeletal modification enabling ring contraction and structure optimization of biologically active compounds.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage modification is highly desirable for the diversification and modification of biologically active compounds. Peripheral editing (e.g., C&#8722;H activation) has been the predominant methodology, whereas skeletal editing is in its infancy. The single&#8208;atom N&#8208;deletion using anomeric amide reagents constitutes a powerful tool to modify the underlying molecular skeletons of secondary amines. N&#8208;pivaloyloxy&#8208;N&#8208;alkoxyamide is easily prepared on a large scale and promotes C&#8722;C bond formation in good yields under the extrusion of N2 for a variety of (cyclic) aliphatic amines. The exploitation of widely available amines allows the use of existing amine synthesis protocols to translate into the construction of new C&#8722;C bonds, enabling ring contraction and the potential for structure optimization of biologically active compounds.

As a result of their unique reactivity in numerous challenging organic transformations, acridinium salts and cyanoarenes have become the organophotocatalysts of choice in organic chemistry. This Minireview discusses the synthesis of these catalysts and their multireactivity, with a special focus on mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
The use of organic photocatalysts has revolutionized the field of photoredox catalysis, as it allows access to reactivities that were traditionally restricted to transition&#8208;metal photocatalysts. This Minireview reports recent developments in the use of acridinium ions and cyanoarene derivatives in organic synthesis. The activation of inert chemical bonds as well as the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biorelevant molecules are discussed, with a special focus on their mechanistic aspects.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Refinery for Sustainable Production of Fuels and Chemicals</title>

The concept of the electrocatalytic refinery (e&#8208;refinery) is an intrinsically sustainable strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources to transportable fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals. This Review describes the concept, fundamentals, and framework of e&#8208;refinery processes with some game&#8208;changing reactions and innovative catalyst design strategies.







Abstract
Compared to modern fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;based refineries, the emerging electrocatalytic refinery (e&#8208;refinery) is a more sustainable and environmentally benign strategy to convert renewable feedstocks and energy sources into transportable fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals. A crucial step in conducting e&#8208;refinery processes is the development of appropriate reactions and optimal electrocatalysts for efficient cleavage and formation of chemical bonds. However, compared to well&#8208;studied primary reactions (e.g., O2 reduction, water splitting), the mechanistic aspects and materials design for emerging complex reactions are yet to be settled. To address this challenge, herein, we first present fundamentals of heterogeneous electrocatalysis and some primary reactions, and then implement these to establish the framework of e&#8208;refinery by coupling in situ generated intermediates (integrated reactions) or products (tandem reactions). We also present a set of materials design principles and strategies to efficiently manipulate the reaction intermediates and pathways.

Three stages of high&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;cost, and energy&#8208;saving electrochemical hydrogen production are described in this Review based on the benefits and electron donation routes (donators) for hydrogen evolution. Future developments in electrocatalytic hydrogen production should benefit from these insights.







Abstract
H2 production via water electrolysis is of great significance in clean energy production, which, however, suffers from the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the anode product, O2, which is of rather low value, may lead to dangerous explosions and the generation of membrane&#8208;degrading reactive oxygen species. Herein, to address these issues of electrocatalytic H2 production, we summarize the most recent advances in three stages based on the benefit increments and various electron donation routes, which are: 1)&#8197;electron donation by traditional OER: developing efficient catalysts for water oxidation to promote H2 production; 2)&#8197;electron donation by the oxidation of sacrificial agents: using sacrificial agents to assist H2 production; 3)&#8197;electron donation by electrosynthesis reaction: achieving electrosynthesis in parallel with cathodic H2 production.

     alt="Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Production Trilogy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three stages of high-efficient, low-cost, and energy-saving electrochemical hydrogen production are described in this Review based on the benefits and electron donation routes (donators) for hydrogen evolution. Future developments in electrocatalytic hydrogen production should benefit from these insights.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production via water electrolysis is of great significance in clean energy production, which, however, suffers from the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the anode product, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is of rather low value, may lead to dangerous explosions and the generation of membrane-degrading reactive oxygen species. Herein, to address these issues of electrocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, we summarize the most recent advances in three stages based on the benefit increments and various electron donation routes, which are: 1)&#8197;electron donation by traditional OER: developing efficient catalysts for water oxidation to promote H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production; 2)&#8197;electron donation by the oxidation of sacrificial agents: using sacrificial agents to assist H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production; 3)&#8197;electron donation by electrosynthesis reaction: achieving electrosynthesis in parallel with cathodic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Present challenges and related prospects will also be discussed, hopefully to benefit the further progress of electrocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Plasma Tuning Local Environment of Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19691-19695, September 1, 2021. </description>

Plasma (N2, O2, H2, Ar) regulated h&#8208;BN with distinct local environment were obtained and employed for ODH of propane: N2 treated BN containing more three&#8208;boron center nitrogen&#8208;defects exhibited remarkable propane conversion of 26.0&#8201;% with olefin selectivity of 89.4&#8201;% at 520&#8201;&#176;C. O2 treated BN showed deactivation due to the sintering effect of &#8220;BOx&#8221;. N&#8208;H and B&#8208;H generated during H2 treatment, may be unable to facilitate the reaction activity.







Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has lately received great attention in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane to propylene for its extraordinary olefin selectivity in contrast to metal oxides. However, high crystallinity of commercial h&#8208;BN and elusive cognition of active sites hindered the enhancement of utilization efficiency. Herein, four kinds of plasmas (N2, O2, H2, Ar) were accordingly employed to regulate the local chemical environment of h&#8208;BN. N2&#8208;treated BN exhibited a remarkable activity, i.e., 26.0&#8201;% propane conversion with 89.4&#8201;% selectivity toward olefins at 520&#8201;&#176;C. Spectroscopy demonstrated that &#8220;three&#8208;boron center&#8221; N&#8208;defects in the catalyst played a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of propane. While the sintering effect of the &#8220;BOx&#8221; species in O2&#8208;treated BN, led to the suppressed catalytic performance (12.4&#8201;% conversion at 520&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Molecular Brush Surfactants: Versatile Emulsifiers for Stabilizing and Structuring Liquids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19626-19630, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of cooperative assembly between hydrophilic molecular brushes and hydrophobic oligomeric ligands, the molecular brush surfactant (MBS) is formed. With MBSs at the oil&#8211;water interface, stable emulsions can be easily prepared in a one&#8208;step process. When jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in highly nonequilibrium shapes, e.g., liquid letters.







Abstract
Using amphiphilic molecular brushes to stabilize emulsions usually requires the synthesis of specific side chains, which can be a time&#8208;consuming and difficult challenge to meet. By taking advantage of the electrostatic interactions between water&#8208;soluble molecular brushes and oil&#8208;soluble oligomeric ligands, the in situ formation, assembly and jamming of molecular brush surfactants (MBSs) at the oil&#8208;water interface is described. With MBSs, stable emulsions including o/w, w/o and o/w/o can be easily prepared by varying the molar ratios of the molecular brushes to the ligands. Moreover, when jammed, the binding energy of MBSs at the interface is sufficiently strong to allow the stabilization of liquids in nonequilibrium shapes, i.e., structuring liquids, producing an elastic film at the interface with exceptional mechanical properties. These structured liquids have numerous potential applications, including chemical biphasic reactions, liquid electronics, and all&#8208;liquid biomimetic system.

Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization reaction of electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes with &#945;&#8208;substituted isocyanoacetate ester through an interrupted Barton&#8211;Zard reaction is reported. A range of optically active pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indole derivatives was obtained in good reactivity (up to 99&#8201;% yield) with high stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, 97&#8201;% ee) in the presence of 2.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ag2O and amino&#8208;phosphine L1.

A range of optically active pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;b]indole derivatives was obtained in good yields (up to 97&#8201;%) with high stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee), using a catalytic system consisting of a cinchona&#8208;derived amino&#8208;phosphine and silver oxide. This reaction features wide substrate scope and mild conditions, and provides a new strategy for developing asymmetric dearomatization reactions.

Photocatalytic C=O bond activation is enabled by exploring the unprecedented photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes formed from &#945;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, which provides a novel diazo&#8208;free access to the Wolff rearrangement. The strategy was successfully applied to the efficient synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl (thio)acetates and valuable &#946;&#8208;lactams.







Abstract
A novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven catalytic activation of C=O bonds by exploiting the photoredox chemistry of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaphospholes, readily accessible from &#945;&#8208;diketones and trialkyl phosphites, is reported. This mild and environmentally friendly strategy provides an unprecedented and efficient access to the Wolff rearrangement reaction which traditionally entails &#945;&#8208;diazoketones as precursors. The resulting ketenes could be precisely trapped by alcohols/thiols to give &#945;&#8208;aryl (thio)acetates and by imines to afford the valuable &#946;&#8208;lactams in up to 99&#8201;% yields.

A building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN) strategy was first presented and resulted in the discovery of three novel Securinega alkaloids. Compound 1 features an unprecedented 8/5/6/5/6/6/6/6&#8208;fused octacyclic scaffold with a unique cage&#8208;shaped 3&#8208;azatricyclo[6.4.0.03,11]dodecane core, which also exhibited remarkable effects on neuronal differentiation and neurite extension.







Abstract
A combined strategy of building blocks recognition and molecular network construction, termed the building blocks&#8208;based molecular network (BBMN), was first presented to facilitate the efficient discovery of novel natural products. By mapping the BBMN of the total alkaloid fraction of Flueggea suffruticosa, three Securinega alkaloids (SEAs) with unusual chemical architectures, suffranidines&#8197;A&#8211;C (1&#8211;3), were discovered and isolated. Compound 1 characterizes an unprecedented 8/5/6/5/6/6/6/6&#8208;fused octacyclic scaffold with a unique cage&#8208;shaped 3&#8208;azatricyclo[6.4.0.03,11]dodecane core. Compounds 2 and 3 are highly modified SEA dimers that incorporate additional C6 motifs. A hypothetical biosynthetic pathway for 1&#8211;3 was proposed. In addition, 1 significantly induced neuronal differentiation and neurite extension by upregulating eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2)&#8208;mediated protein synthesis.

         <title>Enantiospecific Detection of D&#8208;Amino Acid through Synergistic Upconversion Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19648-19652, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoprobe for D&#8208;amino acid enantiospecific detection was proposed based on synergistic upconversion energy transfer, featuring a wide detection range, low detection limit, and in vivo noninvasive detection with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
D&#8208;amino acids (DAAs) are indispensable in regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Selective and sensitive detection of DAAs is crucial for understanding the complexity of metabolic processes and managing associated diseases. However, current DAA detection strategies mainly rely on bulky instrumentation or electrochemical probes, limiting their cellular and animal applications. Here we report an enzyme&#8208;coupled nanoprobe that can detect enantiospecific DAAs through synergistic energy transfer. This nanoprobe offers near&#8208;infrared upconversion capability, a wide dynamic detection range, and a detection limit of 2.2&#8197;&#956;M, providing a versatile platform for in vivo noninvasive detection of DAAs with high enantioselectivity. These results potentially allow real&#8208;time monitoring of biomolecular handedness in living animals, as well as developing antipsychotic treatment strategies.

         <title>Programmable RNA N1&#8208;Methyladenosine Demethylation by a Cas13d&#8208;Directed Demethylase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19592-19597, September 1, 2021. </description>

A tool for targeted m1A demethylation of specific cellular RNA without changing the primary sequence, termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;, was developed via combining the RNA&#8208;targeting capability of dCasRx (the catalytically inactive RNA&#8208;targeting RfxCas13d enzyme) and the RNA m1A demethylation property of ALKBH3. REMOVER enabled m1A demethylation of the specific RNA without obvious off&#8208;target effects.







Abstract
N1&#8208;methyladenosine (m1A) is a prevalent and reversible RNA modification, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of RNA fate and gene expression. However, the lack of tools to precisely manipulate m1A sites in specific transcripts has hindered efforts to clarify the association between a specific m1A&#8208;modified transcript and its phenotypic outcomes. Here we develop a CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d&#8208;based tool called reengineered m1A modification valid eraser (termed &#8220;REMOVER&#8221;) for targeted m1A demethylation of a specific transcript. The catalytically inactive RfxCas13d (dCasRx) is fused to the m1A demethylase ALKBH3, and the dCasRx&#8208;ALKBH3 fusion protein can mediate potent demethylation of m1A&#8208;modified RNAs. We further find that REMOVER can specifically demethylate m1A of MALAT1 and PRUNE1 RNAs, thereby significantly increasing their stability. Our study establishes REMOVER as a tool for targeted RNA demethylation of specific m1A&#8208;modified transcripts, which enables further elucidation of the relationship between m1A modification of specific transcripts and their phenotypic outcomes.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Cesium Manganese Bromides Nanocrystals with Color&#8208;Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19653-19659, September 1, 2021. </description>

We developed a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides nanocrystals, which achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity.







Abstract
For display applications, it is highly desirable to obtain tunable red/green/blue emission. However, lead&#8208;free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) generally exhibit broadband emission with poor color purity. Herein, we developed a unique phase transition strategy to engineer the emission color of lead&#8208;free cesium manganese bromides NCs and we can achieve a tunable red/green/blue emission with high color purity in these NCs. Such phase transition can be triggered by isopropanol: from one dimensional (1D) CsMnBr3 NCs (red&#8208;color emission) to zero dimensional (0D) Cs3MnBr5 NCs (green&#8208;color emission). Furthermore, in a humid environment both 1D CsMnBr3 NCs and 0D Cs3MnBr5 NCs can be transformed into 0D Cs2MnBr4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O NCs (blue&#8208;color emission). Cs2MnBr4&#8901;2&#8201;H2O NCs could inversely transform into the mixture of CsMnBr3 and Cs3MnBr5 phase during the thermal annealing dehydration step. Our work highlights the tunable optical properties in single component NCs via phase engineering and provides a new avenue for future endeavors in light&#8208;emitting devices.

We address the issue of surface segregation of alloy electrocatalysts by conformally depositing the alloy as an ultrathin shell on shape&#8208;controlled nanocrystals. As a result of the optimized Au/Pd ratio in the shell and highly active {100} facets, we obtain Pd@Au0.95Pd0.05 nanocubes with superb performance in electrochemical H2O2 production.







Abstract
We report a simple route based upon seed&#8208;mediated growth to the synthesis of Pd@AuxPd1&#8722;x (0.8&#8804;x&#8804;1) core&#8211;shell nanocubes. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined {100} facets and an optimal Au/Pd ratio for the surface, the nanocubes bearing a shell made of Au0.95Pd0.05 work as an efficient electrocatalyst toward H2O2 production, with high selectivity of 93&#8211;100&#8201;% in the low&#8208;overpotential region of 0.4&#8211;0.7&#8197;V. When the Au0.95Pd0.05 alloy is confined to a shell of only three atomic layers in thickness, the electrocatalyst is able to maintain its surface structure and elemental composition, endowing continuous and stable production of H2O2 during oxygen reduction at a high rate of 1.62&#8197;mol&#8201;g(Pd+Au)&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a versatile route to the rational development of active and durable electrocatalysts based upon alloy nanocrystals.

&lt;p&gt;We address the issue of surface segregation of alloy electrocatalysts by conformally depositing the alloy as an ultrathin shell on shape-controlled nanocrystals. As a result of the optimized Au/Pd ratio in the shell and highly active {100} facets, we obtain Pd@Au&lt;sub&gt;0.95&lt;/sub&gt;Pd&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt; nanocubes with superb performance in electrochemical H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene/Carboxylic Acid Co&#8208;Catalysis Enables Oxidative Esterification of Demanding Aldehydes/Enals, at Low Catalyst Loading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19631-19636, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
While N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed oxidative esterification of aldehydes/enals is synthetically highly attractive, it is plagued by poor conversions/yields for sterically demanding substrates. The triazolium catalyst shown, with benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst, overcomes this deficiency. A variety of hitherto recalcitrant aldehydes/enals are efficiently converted to esters with very low catalyst loadings (down to 50&#8197;ppm).







Abstract
We report the discovery that simple carboxylic acids, such as benzoic acid, boost the activity of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts in the oxidative esterification of aldehydes. A simple and efficient protocol for the transformation of a wide range of sterically hindered &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals, catalyzed by a novel and readily accessible N&#8208;Mes&#8208;/N&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt, and benzoic acid as co&#8208;catalyst, was developed. A whole series of &#945;/&#946;&#8208;substituted aliphatic aldehydes/enals hitherto not amenable to NHC&#8208;catalyzed esterification could be reacted at typical catalyst loadings of 0.02&#8211;1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;%. For benzaldehyde, even 0.005&#8197;mol&#8201;% of NHC catalyst proved sufficient: the lowest value ever achieved in NHC catalysis. Preliminary studies point to carboxylic acid&#8208;induced acceleration of acyl transfer from azolium enolate intermediates as the mechanistic basis of the observed effect.

         <title>Continuous Flow Z&#8208;Stereoselective Olefin Metathesis: Development and Applications in the Synthesis of Pheromones and Macrocyclic Odorant Molecules**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19685-19690, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first continuous flow Z&#8208;stereoselective olefin metathesis was described with a set of Z&#8208;stereoselective Ru&#8208;catalysts. Good productivity and excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%) were obtained in the formation of various internal olefins including highly desirable pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules. A telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors was also reported.







Abstract
The first continuous flow Z&#8208;selective olefin metathesis process is reported. Key to realizing this process was the adequate choice of stereoselective catalysts combined with the design of an appropriate continuous reactor setup. The designed continuous process permits various self&#8208;, cross&#8208; and macro&#8208;ring&#8208;closing&#8208;metathesis reactions, delivering products in high selectivity and short residence times. This technique is exemplified by direct application to the preparation of a range of pheromones and macrocyclic odorant molecules and culminates in a telescoped Z&#8208;selective cross&#8208;metathesis/ Dieckmann cyclisation sequence to access (Z)&#8208;Civetone, incorporating a serial array of continually stirred tank reactors.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of C&#8208;Vinyl Glycosides via Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Glycosylation of Alkenes</title>

A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary.







Abstract
C&#8208;vinyl glycosides are an important class of carbohydrates and pose a unique synthetic challenge. A new strategy has been developed for stereoselective synthesis of C&#8208;vinyl glycosides via Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed C&#8722;H glycosylation of alkenes with glycosyl chloride donors using an easily removable bidentate auxiliary. Both the &#947; C&#8722;H bond of allylamines and the &#948; C&#8722;H bond of homoallyl amine substrates can be glycosylated in high efficiency and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The resulting C&#8208;vinyl glycosides can be further converted to a variety of C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with high stereospecificity. These reactions offer a broadly applicable method to streamline the synthesis of complex C&#8208;vinyl glycosides from easily accessible starting materials.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Vertex Linkage of (BO4)&#8208;Tetrahedra in a Borosulfate: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Investigation of Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19740-19743, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)] was obtained under harsh conditions in a specially designed setup. In contrast to silicates and its substitution variants like alumosilicates, the anionic substructure of Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)] reveals vertex linkage of three (BO4) tetrahedra via a common oxygen atom. DFT calculations help to elucidate the nature of this special bonding situation.







Abstract
Borosulfates are classified as silicate analogue materials. The number of crystallographically characterized compounds is still limited, whereas the structural diversity is already impressive. The anionic substructures of borosulfates exhibit vertex&#8208;connected (BO4)&#8208; and (SO4)&#8208;tetrahedra, whereas bridging between two (SO4)&#8208; or even between two (BO4)&#8208;tetrahedra is scarce. The herein presented compound Sr[B3O(SO4)4(SO4H)] is the first borosulfate with a triple&#8208;vertex linkage of three (BO4) tetrahedra via one common oxygen atom. DFT calculations complement the experimental studies. Bader charges (calculated for all atoms) as well as charge&#8208;density calculations give hint to the electron distribution within the anionic substructure and density&#8208;of&#8208;states calculations support the interpretation of the bonding situation.

The herein presented compound Sr[B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H)] is the first borosulfate with a triple-vertex linkage of three (BO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) tetrahedra via one common oxygen atom. DFT calculations complement the experimental studies. Bader charges (calculated for all atoms) as well as charge-density calculations give hint to the electron distribution within the anionic substructure and density-of-states calculations support the interpretation of the bonding situation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Supramolecular Bioimaging through Signal Amplification by Combining Indicator Displacement Assay with F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer</title>

We present a novel supramolecular strategy for fluorescence imaging via incorporation of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer into indicator displacement assay.







Abstract
Fluorescent chemosensors are powerful imaging tools in the fields of life sciences and engineering. Based on the principle of supramolecular chemistry, indicator displacement assay (IDA) provides an alternative approach for constructing and optimizing chemosensors, which has the advantages of simplicity, tunability, and modularity. However, the application of IDA in bioimaging continues to face a series of challenges, including interfering signals, background noise, and inconsistent spatial location. Accordingly, we herein report a supramolecular bioimaging strategy of F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;assisted IDA by employing macrocyclic amphiphiles as the operating platform. By merging FRET with IDA, the limitations of IDA in bioimaging were addressed. As a proof of concept, the study achieved mitochondria&#8208;targeted imaging of adenosine triphosphate in live cells with signal amplification. This study opens a non&#8208;covalent avenue for bioimaging with advancements in tunability, generality, and simplicity, apart from the covalent approach.

From fibers to flakes&#8212;Modifying the morphology of supramolecular organization through vibrational strong coupling is reported.







Abstract
Strong coupling plays a significant role in influencing chemical reactions and tuning material properties by modifying the energy landscapes of the systems. Here we study the effect of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on supramolecular organization. For this purpose, a rigid&#8208;rod conjugated polymer known to form gels was strongly coupled together with its solvent in a microfluidic IR Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity. Absorption and fluorescence studies indicate a large modification of the self&#8208;assembly under such cooperative VSC. Electron microscopy confirms that in this case, the supramolecular morphology is totally different from that observed in the absence of strong coupling. In addition, the self&#8208;assembly kinetics are altered and depend on the solvent vibration under VSC. The results are compared to kinetic isotope effects on the self&#8208;assembly to help clarify the role of different parameters under strong coupling. These findings indicate that VSC is a valuable new tool for controlling supramolecular assemblies with broad implications for the molecular and material sciences.

         <title>Controlling Polymer Molecular Weight Distribution through a Latent Mediator Strategy with Temporal Programming</title>

A robust method for controlling polymer MWDs in controlled cationic polymerizations by combining a latent mediator strategy and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed living cationic polymerization mediated by cationic RAFT agent is reported. Various shapes and breadths of MWD curves were obtained by simply adjusting the external light source.







Abstract
Polymer molecular weight distribution (MWD) is a key parameter of polymers. Here we present a robust method for controlling polymer MWD in controlled cationic polymerizations. A latent mediator strategy was designed and combined with temporal programming to regenerate mediators at different times during polymerization. Both the breadths and shapes of MWD curves were tuned easily by adjusting an external light source. Bimodal, trimodal, and tetramodal distributions were obtained, and the breadths could be varied from 1.06 to 2.09. Polymers with different MWDs prepared by this method had good chain end fidelity, which was demonstrated with successful chain&#8208;extension experiments. In addition, the introduction of temporal programming with a computer&#8208;controlled single chip for the light source opened an avenue for the use of artificial intelligence in polymer synthesis.

         <title>A Covalent Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Superlattice Covered with Organic Functional Groups for Highly Sensitive and Selective Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19710-19714, September 1, 2021. </description>

A covalent organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid superlattice was designed and synthesized with a facile coordination assembly method. The surface functional groups and interlayer charge transport render the superlattice nanosheets an excellent gas sensing material with the highest sensitivity, the lowest detection limit, and exceptional selectivity towards NO2 at room temperature among all fast&#8208;response gas&#8208;sensing materials without the need of light assistance.







Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid superlattices (OIHSLs) hold attractive physical and chemical properties, while the construction of single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSLs has not been achieved. Herein a coordination assembly strategy was proposed to create a single&#8208;crystal covalent OIHSL PbBDT (BDT=1,4&#8208;benzenedithiolate), where layered [PbS2] sublattice covalently connects with benzene sublattice. The covalent bonding offers better thermo&#8208;/chemi&#8208;stability, inter&#8208;sublattice electron transport, and unique organic&#8208;group&#8208;functionalized surface, which may enable better performances in chemical applications than non&#8208;covalent OIHSL. These features endow PbBDT with the highest sensitivity, the lowest detection limit and excellent selectivity towards NO2 at room temperature among all chemiresistive gas&#8208;sensing materials with reported response time less than 2&#8197;min without the need of light assistance.

         <title>Chemically Stabilized DNA Barcodes for DNA&#8208;Encoded Chemistry</title>

DNA&#8208;encoded compound libraries (DELs) are a widely used screening technology. DNA reactivity limits the reaction scope for library synthesis. Substituting the purines by 7&#8208;deazaadenine yielded functional DNA barcodes with enhanced chemical stability. Controlled pore glass&#8208;coupled barcodes tolerated isocyanide multicomponent reactions, the acid&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction, and YbIII&#8208; and AuI&#8208;mediated pyrazole syntheses for DEL design.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded compound libraries are a widely used small molecule screening technology. One important aim in library design is the coverage of chemical space through structurally diverse molecules. Yet, the chemical reactivity of native DNA barcodes limits the toolbox of reactions for library design. Substituting the chemically vulnerable purines by 7&#8208;deazaadenine, which exhibits tautomerization stability similar to natural adenine with respect to the formation of stable Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, yielded ligation&#8208;competent, amplifiable, and readable DNA barcodes for encoded chemistry with enhanced stability against protic acid&#8208; and metal ion&#8208;promoted depurination. The barcode stability allowed for straightforward translation of 16 exemplary reactions that included isocyanide multicomponent reactions, acid&#8208;promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler and Biginelli reactions, and metal&#8208;promoted pyrazole syntheses on controlled pore glass&#8208;coupled barcodes for diverse DEL design. The Boc protective group of reaction products offered a convenient handle for encoded compound purification.

Substituting the chemically vulnerable purines by 7-deazaadenine, which exhibits tautomerization stability similar to natural adenine with respect to the formation of stable Watson&#8211;Crick pairs, yielded ligation-competent, amplifiable, and readable DNA barcodes for encoded chemistry with enhanced stability against protic acid- and metal ion-promoted depurination. The barcode stability allowed for straightforward translation of 16 exemplary reactions that included isocyanide multicomponent reactions, acid-promoted Pictet&#8211;Spengler and Biginelli reactions, and metal-promoted pyrazole syntheses on controlled pore glass-coupled barcodes for diverse DEL design. The Boc protective group of reaction products offered a convenient handle for encoded compound purification.&lt;/p&gt;

The first enantioselective addition of pyrazoles to 1,3&#8208;dienes is reported. Secondary and tertiary allylic pyrazoles can be generated with excellent regioselectivity.







Abstract
We report the first enantioselective addition of pyrazoles to 1,3&#8208;dienes. Secondary and tertiary allylic pyrazoles can be generated with excellent regioselectivity. Mechanistic studies support a pathway distinct from previous hydroaminations: a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT). This hydroamination tolerates a range of functional groups and advances the field of diene hydrofunctionalization.

         <title>Intracellular Protein&#8211;Drug Interactions Probed by Direct Mass Spectrometry of Cell Lysates</title>

We report a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells, based on our direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. We demonstrate label&#8208;free analysis of protein&#8211;drug binding in human cells and measurement of the binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples.







Abstract
Understanding protein&#8211;ligand interactions in a cellular context is an important goal in molecular biology and biochemistry, and particularly for drug development. Investigators must demonstrate that drugs penetrate cells and specifically bind their targets. Towards that end, we present a native mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based method for analyzing drug uptake and target engagement in eukaryotic cells. This method is based on our previously introduced direct&#8208;MS method for rapid analysis of proteins directly from crude samples. Here, direct&#8208;MS enables label&#8208;free studies of protein&#8211;drug binding in human cells and is used to determine binding affinities of lead compounds in crude samples. We anticipate that this method will enable the application of native MS to a range of problems where cellular context is important, including protein&#8211;protein interactions, drug uptake and binding, and characterization of therapeutic proteins.

         <title>Activating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores via External Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect and Rigidity of Ionic Polymer Matrix**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19735-19739, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping strategy to directly transform commercial fluorescent dyes to pure organic, amorphous phosphorescent materials is developed via a single ionic polymer. The external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates the triplet states, while the rigid ionic bonding matrix inhibits the nonradiative decay. This general strategy provides a method to activate room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and a powerful tool for studying triplet states.







Abstract
Pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted wide attention for their easy preparation, low toxicity, and applications in various fields like bioimaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Developing phosphorescent systems with more universality and less difficulty in synthesis has long been the pursuit of materials scientists. By employing a polymeric quaternary ammonium salt with an ionic bonding matrix and heavy atoms, commercial fluorescent dyes are directly endowed with phosphorescence emission. In a single amorphous polymer, the external heavy&#8208;atom effect generates excited triplet states and the rigid polymer matrix stabilizes them. This study put forward a new general strategy to design and develop pure organic RTP materials starting from existing library of organic dyes without complicated chemical synthesis.

Abstract
An iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive three&#8208;component coupling reaction for the synthesis of medicinally relevant &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazoles from abundant tertiary amides or lactams, carboxylic acids, and (N&#8208;isocyanimino) triphenylphosphorane, is described. Proceeding under mild conditions using (&lt;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%) Vaska's complex (IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2) and tetramethyldisiloxane to access the key reactive iminium ion intermediates, a broad range of &#945;&#8208;amino 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole architectures were accessed from carboxylic acid feedstock coupling partners. Extension to &#945;&#8208;amino heterodiazole synthesis was readily achieved by exchanging the carboxylic acid coupling partner for C&#8208;, S&#8208;, or N&#8208;centered Br&#248;nsted acids, and provided rapid and modular access to these desirable, yet difficult&#8208;to&#8208;access, heterocycles. The high chemoselectivity of the catalytic reductive activation step allowed late&#8208;stage functionalization of 10 drug molecules, including the synthesis of heterodiazole&#8208;fused drug&#8211;drug conjugates.

         <title>Head&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Oligomerization by Silylene&#8208;Tethered Sonogashira Coupling on Ag(111)</title>

A coupling module composed of (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups selectively accelerated sluggish desilylative on&#8208;surface Sonogashira coupling with homocoupling efficiently suppressed. Bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) with a CO&#8208;functionalized tip enabled investigation of this coupling reaction and evaluation of its chemoselectivity (see picture).







Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis is a powerful method for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanomaterials. Herein, we demonstrate chemoselective Sonogashira coupling between (trimethylsilyl)ethynyl and chlorophenyl groups in silylethynyl&#8208; and chloro&#8208;substituted partially fluorinated phenylene ethynylenes (SiCPFPEs) on Ag(111). The desilylative Sonogashira coupling occurred with high chemoselectivity up to 75&#8201;%, while the competing Ullmann and desilylative Glaser homocoupling reactions were suppressed. A combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and DFT calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of intermolecular silylene tethers (&#8208;Me2Si&#8208;) through CH3&#8722;Si bond activation at 130&#8201;&#176;C and subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.

A combination of bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy/atomic force microscopy (STM/AFM) and DFT calculations revealed that the oligomers were obtained by the formation of intermolecular silylene tethers (-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si-) through CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Si bond activation at 130&#8201;&#176;C and subsequent elimination of the tethers at an elevated temperature of 200&#8201;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Configuration Sampling With Five&#8208;Membered Atropisomeric P,N&#8208;Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19604-19608, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of a small series of atropisomeric, C1&#8208;symmetric P,N&#8208;ligands that incrementally change the position of the groups within the chiral pocket is reported. This enables sampling of chiral space without modifying the steric parameters of the substituents. As a demonstration of the utility, using this small series of stack ligands, a P,N ligand was identified for the enantioselective &#946;&#8208;borylation of Michael acceptors.







Abstract
Here we report a strategy for the systematic variation of atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric P,N ligands to incrementally change the position of the groups within the chiral pocket without modifying their steric parameters. More specifically, the effects of systematic modification of the nitrogen heterocycle in atropisomeric C1&#8208;symmetric stack ligands have been investigated in this study. The versatility and applicability of this approach has been demonstrated in mechanistically distinct catalytic enantioselective transformations, resulting in the identification of a P,N&#8208;ligand for a highly enantioselective synthesis of organoboranes.

         <title>Influence of Backbone Curvature on the Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance of Glycolated Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19679-19684, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The targeted design of backbone geometries is shown to influence the p&#8208;type accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) performance of two glycolated donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers, PgBT(F)2gT and PgBT(F)2gTT.







Abstract
Two new glycolated semiconducting polymers PgBT(F)2gT and PgBT(F)2gTT of differing backbone curvatures were designed and synthesised for application as p&#8208;type accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) materials. Both polymers demonstrated stable and reversible oxidation, accessible within the aqueous electrochemical window, to generate polaronic charge carriers. OECTs fabricated from PgBT(F)2gT featuring a curved backbone geometry attained a higher volumetric capacitance of 170&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3. However, PgBT(F)2gTT with a linear backbone displayed overall superior OECT performance with a normalised peak transconductance of 3.00&#215;104&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1, owing to its enhanced order, expediting the charge mobility to 0.931&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.

         <title>Doubly Decorated Platinum&#8211;Gallium Intermetallics as Stable Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19715-19719, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalyst design consisting of the double&#8208;decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra&#8208;stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature. PtGa&#8722;Ca&#8722;Pb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600&#8201;&#176;C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1&#8197;month.







Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. However, the Pt&#8208;based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at &#8805;600&#8201;&#176;C by side reactions and coke formation. Thus, such catalysts possess an insufficient life. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively. Pb is deposited on the three&#8208;fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron&#8208;enriched single&#8208;atom&#8208;like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles. Thus, PtGa&#8722;Ca&#8722;Pb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600&#8201;&#176;C (kd=0.00033&#8197;h&#8722;1, &#964;=3067&#8197;h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1&#8197;month for the first time.

Luminescence from a bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt of gold(I) complex with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based ligand increased rapidly upon application of a needlestick&#8208;stimulus. Upon stimulation under UV&#8208;light irradiation, the weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid state rapidly transformed into an intensively violet&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting state on a timescale of seconds.







Abstract
Luminescence from a gold(I) complex with an N&#8208;heterocycliccarbene&#8208;based ligand, 1+&#8901;NTf2&#8722;, increased rapidly upon the application of one&#8208;shot needlestick&#8208;stimulus. The weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid&#8208;state of 1+&#8901;NTf2&#8722; was prepared by cooling its melted liquid to 90&#8201;&#176;C. Upon applying a weak pinpoint stimulus with a needle, this weakly orange&#8208;emitting solid state transformed into an intensively violet&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting state on a timescale of seconds. The emission after applying the stimulus could be visualized upon UV excitation even under ambient room light. This sequential phase transition from a stable solid to a liquid and then to a metastable solid could occur repeatedly without any measurable degradation of the complex. Various shapes could be prepared by casting the liquid&#8208;state complex into molds of different designs. This rapid response is thought to be triggered by the flexible intermolecular interactions in the kinetically generated aggregates formed upon cooling the liquid state, and by the strong Au&#8211;Au interactions in the thermodynamically stable crystals after applying the needlestick&#8208;stimulus.

         <title>Light&#8208;Harvesting Supramolecular Phosphors: Highly Efficient Room Temperature Phosphorescence in Solution and Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19720-19724, September 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the highest quantum yield ambient solution state (ca. 41.8&#8201;%) and hydrogel (ca. 34&#8201;%) room temperature phosphorescence, by employing an organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy is reported. These soft&#8208;hybrids are further employed as an efficient light&#8208;harvesting scaffold by co&#8208;anchoring acceptor dyes to yield triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer mediated delayed fluorescence.







Abstract
Solution phase room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from organic phosphors is seldom realized. Herein we report one of the highest quantum yield solution state RTP (ca. 41.8&#8201;%) in water, from a structurally simple phthalimide phosphor, by employing an organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular scaffolding strategy. We further use these supramolecular hybrid phosphors as a light&#8208;harvesting scaffold to achieve delayed fluorescence from orthogonally anchored Sulforhodamine acceptor dyes via an efficient triplet to singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET), which is rarely achieved in solution. Electrostatic cross&#8208;linking of the inorganic scaffold at higher concentrations further facilitates the formation of self&#8208;standing hydrogels with efficient RTP and energy&#8208;transfer mediated long&#8208;lived fluorescence.

         <title>Temporal Control over Two&#8208; and Three&#8208;State Living Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization for Modulating the Molecular Weight Distribution Profile of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 60, Issue 36, Page 19671-19678, September 1, 2021. </description>

The design and successful demonstration of a highly versatile new strategy for manipulating the molecular weight distribution profiles of a variety of different polyolefins is reported. It involves temporal control over two&#8208; and three&#8208;state living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) of olefins in a programmable way.







Abstract
A highly versatile new strategy for manipulating the molecular weight profiles, including breadth, asymmetry (skewness) and modal nature (mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and multimodal), of a variety of different polyolefins is reported. It involves temporal control over two&#8208; and three&#8208;state living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) of olefins in a programmable way. By changing the identity of the R&#8242; groups of the chain transfer agent, ER&#8242;n, with time, different populations of chains within a bi&#8208; or multimodal polyolefin product can be selectively tagged with different end&#8208;groups. By changing the nature of the main&#8208;group metal of the CTA, programmed manipulation of the relative magnitudes of the dispersities of the different maxima that make up the final MWD profile can be achieved. This strategy can be implemented with existing LCCTP materials and conventional reactor methods to provide access to scalable and practical quantities of an unlimited array of new polyolefin materials.

         <title>Hydroboration of Terminal Alkenes and trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diboration of Terminal Alkynes Catalyzed by a Mn(I) Alkyl Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Mn(I)&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkenes and a 1,2&#8208;diboration of terminal alkynes with pinacolborane (HBPin) is described. In the case of alkenes anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration takes place, while in the case of alkynes the reaction proceeds with excellent trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;selectivity. The most active pre&#8208;catalyst is the bench&#8208;stable alkyl bisphosphine Mn(I) complex fac&#8208;[Mn(dippe)(CO)3(CH2CH2CH3)]. The catalytic process is initiated by migratory insertion of a CO ligand into the Mn&#8208;alkyl bond to yield an acyl intermediate which undergoes B&#8208;H bond cleavage of HBPin (in the case of alkenes) and rapid C&#8208;H bond cleavage (in the case of alkynes) forming the active Mn(I) boryl and acetylide catalysts [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(BPin)] and [Mn(dippe)(CO)2(C&#8801;CR)], respectively. A broad variety of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes and alkynes was efficiently and selectively borylated. Mechanistic insights are provided based on experimental data and DFT calculations revealing that an acceptorless reaction is operating involving dihydrogen release.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying the Evolution of Se&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Modulated MoSe2 Pre&#8208;Catalyst in Li&#8211;S Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Witnessing compositional evolution and identifying actual catalytically&#8208;active moiety of electrocatalysts is of paramount importance in Li&#8211;S chemistry. Nevertheless, this field remains elusive by far. Herein, we report the scalable salt&#8208;templated synthesis of Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;incorporated MoSe2  architecture (SeVs&#8208;MoSe2  ) and reveal the phase evolution of such defective pre&#8208;catalyst in working Li&#8211;S batteries. The interaction between lithium polysulfides and SeVs&#8208;MoSe2  is probed to induce the transformation from SeVs&#8208;MoSe2  to MoSeS. Furthermore,  operando  Raman spectroscopy/ex&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements in combination with theoretical simulations verify that the effectual MoSeS catalyst could help promote the conversion from Li2S2  to Li2S, thereby boosting the capacity performance. Thus&#8208;derived Li&#8211;S battery accordingly exhibits satisfactory rate and cycling capability even under elevated sulfur loading and lean electrolyte conditions (7.67 mg cm&#8211;2  ; 4.0 &#956;L mg&#8211;1S  ). This work is anticipated to open an avenue for designing efficient electrocatalysts toward boosted sulfur chemistry and deepens the understanding of catalytic mechanisms of defective electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>P&#8208;Atom Transfer from Phosphaethynolate to an Alkylidyne.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A low&#8208;spin and mononuclear vanadium complex, (  Me  nacnac)V(CO)(h  2  &#8211;P&#8801;C  t  Bu) (  2  ) (  Me  nacnac  &#8208;  = [ArNC(CH  3  )]  2  CH, Ar = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ), was prepared upon treatment of the vanadium neopentylidyne complex (  Me  nacnac)V&#8801;C  t  Bu(OTf) (  1  ) with Na(OCP)(diox)  2.5  (diox = 1,4&#8208;dioxane) while the isoelectronic ate&#8208;complex [Na(15&#8211;crown&#8211;5)]{([ArNC(CH  2  )]CH[C(CH  3  )NAr])V(CO)(h  2  &#8211;P&#8801;C  t  Bu)} (  4  ), was obtained  via  the reaction of Na(OCP)(diox)  2.5  and ([ArNC(CH  2  )]CH[C(CH  3  )NAr])V&#8801;C  t  Bu(OEt  2  ) (  3  ) in the presence of crown&#8211;ether. Computational studies suggest the P&#8211;atom transfer to proceed by [2+2]&#8211;cycloaddition of the P&#8801;C bond across the V&#8801;C  t  Bu moiety, followed by a reductive decarbonylation to form V&#8211;C&#8801;O linkage. The nature of the electronic ground state in diamagnetic complexes,  2  and  4  , was further investigated both theoretically and experimentally, using a combination of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry, X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) measurements, and comparison of salient bond metrics derived from X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structural characterization. In combination, these data are consistent with a low&#8208;valent vanadium ion in complexes  2  and  4  . This study represents the first example of a metathesis reaction between the P&#8208;atom of [PCO]  &#8210;  and an alkylidyne ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchically Porous MOF/MoS2 Interface for Selective Photocatalytic Conversion of CO2 with H2O to CH3COOH</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks provide a platform to design new heterogeneous catalysts for catalytic CO2  reduction, but selective formation of C2 valuable liquid fuel products remains a significant challenge of forming the C&#8722;C bond. Herein, we propose a strategy to synthesize composites by integrating MoS2  nanosheets into hierarchically porous defective UiO&#8208;66 (d&#8208;UiO&#8208;66) to form Mo&#8208;O&#8208;Zr bimetallic sites on the interfaces between UiO&#8208;66 and MoS2  . The active interfaces are favourable for the efficient transfer of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers and for promoting the activity, whereas, the synergy of the components at the interfaces achieves selectivity for C2 production. The  d  &#8208;UiO&#8208;66/MoS2  composite facilitates the photo&#8208;catalytic conversion of gas phase CO2  and H2O to CH3COOH under visible light irradiation without any other adducts. The evolution rate and selectivity of CH  3  COOH reached 39.0 &#181;mol&#8226;g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  and 94%, respectively, without any C1 products, suggesting a new approach for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts of CO2  for C2 production. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the charge&#8208;polarized Zr&#8208;O&#8208;Mo obviously facilitated the C&#8722;C coupling process with the largely reduced energy barrier.</dc:description>

         <title>Intragenomic decarboxylation of 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cellular DNA is composed of four canonical nucleosides (dA, dC, dG and T), which form two Watson&#8208;Crick base pairs. In addition, 5&#8208;methylcytosine (mdC) may be present. The methylation of dC to mdC is known to regulate transcriptional activity. Next to these five nucleotides, the genome, particularly of stem cells, contains three further dC derivatives, which are formed by stepwise oxidation of the methyl group of mdC with the help of Tet enzymes. These are 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;dC, (hmdC), 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;dC (fdC) and finally 5&#8208;carboxy&#8208;dC (cadC). It is believed that fdC and cadC are converted back into dC, which establishes an epigenetic control cycle that starts with methylation of dC to mdC, followed by oxidation and removal of fdC and cadC. While fdC was shown to undergo intra&#8208;genomic deformylation to give dC directly, a similar decarboxylation of cadC was postulated but not yet observed on the genomic level. Here, we show using metabolic labelling in several cell types that cadC decarboxylates, which confirms that both fdC and cadC are nucleosides that are directly converted back to dC within the genome by C&#8208;C bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Nanoflower Assisted Separation&#8208;free Nucleic Acid Detection Platform with Commercial Pregnancy Test Strip</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a constant drive for affordable point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT) technologies for the detection of infectious and human diseases. Herein we report a simple platform for DNA detection that takes advantage of four techniques: commercially available pregnancy test strip (PTS), amplicon generation via loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), toehold mediated strand displacement, and noncovalent immobilization of DNA on paper surface with DNA nanoflowers. This simple, separation&#8208;free platform is highly specific, as demonstrated with the detection of rtL180M, a single nucleotide polymorphism observed in hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#160;associated with antiviral drug resistance. It is very sensitive, capable of detecting the targeted mutation at 2 copies/&#956;L. It is able to correctly identify the unmutated and rtL180M genome types of HBV in clinical samples. Given its wide adaptability, we expect this platform can be easily modified for the detection of genetic variations associated with various pathogens and human diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Access to &#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes Enabled by Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Multicomponent Radical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aminosilanes are an important class of organic compounds that show biological activity. In this communication, a new approach to &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes which utilizes photoredox catalysis to enable three&#8208;component coupling of organo(tristrimethylsilyl)silanes with feedstock alkylamines and aldehydes is presented. A wide range of highly functionalized &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes can be obtained in good yields under mild conditions. Both primary amines and secondary amines are compatible with this transformation. Moreover, optically pure &#945;&#8208;aminosilanes are accessible by using chiral amines. Mechanistic studies indicate that reactions proceed through radical/radical cross&#8208;coupling of silyl radicals with &#945;&#8208;amino alkyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Strain Mapping of Late&#8208;Transition Metal High&#8208;Index Facets Nanoparticle for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although high&#8208;index facets (HIF) endows excellent catalytic activity through undercoordinated sites with strain effect, current characterizations techniques still cannot unravel the detailed strain distributions to understand the origins of electroactivity. Nevertheless, theoretical principles to quantify the structural features and their effects to catalytic activity improvements on HIFs are still lacking, which renders the experimental efforts laborious. In this work, we explore the quantification of surface structural features and establish a database of atomic strain distributions for the late&#8208;transition metal HIF nanoparticle models. The surface reactivities of the nanoparticles have been examined by adsorption energy calculations and their correlations with structural features are observed. Our proposed theoretical principles on surface characterization of high&#8208;index facets nanomaterials will promote the design and synthesis of efficient transition metal based electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>UDP&#8208;glucuronosyltransferase1A1 (UGT1A1) is a vital metabolic enzyme responsible for clearance of endogenous substances and drugs. Hitherto, the development of fluorescent probes for UGTs was severely restricted due to the poor isoform selectivity, on&#8208;off or blue&#8208;shifted fluorescence response. Herein, we established a novel &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing strategy&#8221; to construct a highly selective near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe  HHC  for UGT1A1, which exhibited a NIR signal at 720 nm after UGT1A1 metabolism.  HHC  was then successfully used for the real&#8208;time imaging of endogenous UGT1A1 in living cells and animals, and to monitor the bile excretion function. In summary, an isoform&#8208;specific NIR fluorescent probe has been developed for monitoring UGT1A1 activity in living systems, high&#8208;throughput screening of novel UGT1A1 inhibitors and visual evaluation of bile excretion function. This practical &#8220;molecular&#8208;splicing strategy&#8221; is particularly powerful in developing highly selective and enzyme&#8208;activated fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Parent B2N2&#8208;Perylenes with Different BN Orientations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Introducing BN units into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons expands the chemical space of conjugated materials with novel properties. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific BN positions and orientations. Here, three new parent B  2  N  2  &#8208;perylenes with different BN orientations are synthesized with BN&#8208;naphthalene as the building block, providing systematic insight into the effects of BN incorporation with different orientations on the structure, (anti)aromaticity, crystal packing and photophysical properties. The intermolecular dipole&#8208;dipole interaction shortens the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance. The crystal structure, (anti)aromaticity, and photophysical properties vary with the change of BN orientation. The revealed BN doping effects may provide a guideline for the synthesis of BN&#8208;PAHs with specific stacking structures, and the synthetic strategy employed here can be extended toward the synthesis of larger BN&#8208;embedded PAHs with adjustable BN patterns.</dc:description>

         <title>Built&#8208;in Electric Field Triggered Interfacial Accumulation Effect for Efficient Nitrate Removal at Ultra&#8208;Low Concentration and Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate removal from water with low pollution concentration and its subsequent electroreduction to higher&#8208;value ammonia is becoming progressively essential. However, this process still suffers from low selectivity and activity due to slow mass transfer of nitrate and the induced limited reagent supply to reaction interface. Herein, we demonstrate that a built&#8208;in electric field in electrocatalyst can significantly accumulate higher concentration of NO  3  &#8211;  ions near electrocatalyst surface region, thus facilitating mass transfer for efficient nitrate removal at ultra&#8208;low concentration and electroreduction reaction (NO  3  RR). A model electrocatalyst are created by stacking CuCl&#160;(111) and rutile TiO  2  (110) layers together, in which a built&#8208;in electric field induced from the electron transfer from TiO  2  to CuCl (CuCl_BEF) is successfully formed as demonstrated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Molecular dynamics simulation and finite element analysis suggest that this built&#8208;in electric field effectively triggers interfacial accumulation of NO  3  &#8211;  ions around the electrocatalyst. The electric field also rises the energy of key reaction intermediate *NO to lower down energy barrier of the rate determining step. A NH  3  product selectivity of 98.6%, a low NO  2  &#8211;  production of &lt;0.6%, and mass&#8208;specific ammonia production rate of 64.4 h  &#8211;1  is achieved with this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, which are all the best among studies reported at 100 mg L  &#8211;1  of nitrate concentration to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Encoding of Triple&#8208;Bond Raman Scattering of Single Polymer Nanoparticles for Multiplexed Imaging Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform polymer nanoparticles were constructed by green emulsion polymerization, overcoming the disadvantage of large &#960;&#8208;bond conjugation while keeping many triple bonds to realize stimulated Raman scattering imaging. 15 distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations were achieved by Raman shift/intensity encoding in the biological silence region (1800&#8211;2800&#8197;cm&#8722;1), thus providing a tool for high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging.







Abstract
Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy in combination with innovative tagging strategies offers great potential as a universal high&#8208;throughput biomedical imaging tool. Here, we report rationally tailored small molecular monomers containing triple&#8208;bond units with large Raman scattering cross&#8208;sections, which can be polymerized at the nanoscale for enhancement of SRS contrast with smaller but brighter optical nanotags with artificial fingerprint output. From this, a class of triple&#8208;bond rich polymer nanoparticles (NPs) was engineered by regulating the relative dosages of three chemically different triple&#8208;bond monomers in co&#8208;polymerization. The bonding strategy allowed for 15 spectrally distinguishable triple&#8208;bond combinations. These accurately structured nano molecular aggregates, rather than long&#8208;chain macromolecules, could establish a universal method for generating small&#8208;sized biological SRS imaging tags with high sensitivity for high&#8208;throughput multi&#8208;color biomedical imaging.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emissive Carbon Dots Gels for Octopus&#8208;Inspired Shape/Color Synergistically Adjustable Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable symmetric surfaces were used to develop aggregation&#8208;induced emissive CD polymer gels with reversible two&#8208;switch&#8208;mode fluorescence (blue dispersed fluorescence and red AIE), followed by the fabrication of anisotropic swimming robots showing octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and autonomous locomotion on the water surface.







Abstract
Some living organisms such as the octopus have fantastic abilities to simultaneously swim away and alter body color/morphology for disguise and self&#8208;protection, especially when there is a threat perception. However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus&#8208;like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi&#8208;functional bio&#8208;inspired intelligent soft robotics.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Fenton Chemistry Converts Phenol and Phenyl Derivatives into Polyphenols for Engineering Surface Coatings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sono&#8208;Fenton chemistry is used to generate polyphenols from small molecules and biological macromolecules containing phenolic groups, enabling the subsequent coordination of the polyphenols with metal ions to engineer coatings on a variety of substrates.







Abstract
We report a sono&#8208;Fenton strategy to mediate the supramolecular assembly of metal&#8211;phenolic networks (MPNs) as substrate&#8208;independent coatings using phenol and phenyl derivatives as building blocks. The assembly process is initiated from the generation of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) using high&#8208;frequency ultrasound (412&#8197;kHz), while the metal ions synergistically participate in the production of additional .OH for hydroxylation/phenolation of phenol and phenyl derivatives via the Fenton reaction and also coordinate with the phenolic compounds for film formation. The coating strategy is applicable to various phenol and phenyl derivatives and different metal ions including FeII, FeIII, CuII, and CoII. In addition, the sono&#8208;Fenton strategy allows real&#8208;time control over the assembly process by turning the high&#8208;frequency ultrasound on or off. The properties of the building blocks are maintained in the formed films. This work provides an environmentally friendly and controllable method to expand the application of phenolic coatings for surface engineering.

         <title>Direct Detection of Surface Species Formed on Iridium Electrocatalysts during the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to directly examine the oxidation state and surface composition of nanosized Ir electrodes after oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was developed. Atom probe tomography reveals compositional changes in the topmost surface and subsurface on various Ir planes during OER. This approach provides atomic&#8208;scale insights into surface changes during electrochemical reactions.







Abstract
The effect of surface orientations on the formation of iridium oxide species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains yet unknown. Herein, we use a needle&#8208;shaped iridium atom probe specimen as a nanosized working electrode to ascertain the role of the surface orientations in the formation of oxide species during OER. At the beginning of electrolysis, the top 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm of (024), (026), (113), and (115) planes are covered by IrO&#8722;OH, which activates all surfaces towards OER. A thick subsurface oxide layer consisting of sub&#8208;stoichiometric Ir&#8722;O species is formed on the open (024) planes as OER proceeds. Such metastable Ir&#8722;O species are thought to provide an additional contribution to the OER activity. Overall, this study sheds light on the importance of the morphological effects of iridium electrocatalysts for OER. It also provides an innovative approach that can directly reveal surface species on electrocatalysts at atomic scale.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Biaryls by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective amination of amidines has been developed for the synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers. A wide range of benzimidazole derivatives containing N&#8722;C axial chirality can be conveniently constructed in excellent yields and enantioselectivities by intramolecular amination.







Abstract
N&#8722;C Biaryl atropisomers are prevalent in natural products and bioactive drug molecules. However, the enantioselective synthesis of such molecules has not developed significantly. Particularly, the enantioselective synthesis of N&#8722;C biaryl atropisomers by stereoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed aryl amination remains unprecedented. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling strategy is presented for the synthesis of N&#8722;C axially chiral biaryl molecules. A broad spectrum of N&#8722;C axially chiral compounds was obtained with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%&#8197;ee) and good yields (up to 98&#8201;%). The practicality of this reaction was validated in the synthesis of useful biological molecules.

         <title>Picomole&#8208;Scale Synthesis and Screening of Macrocyclic Compound Libraries by Acoustic Liquid Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach has been developed for synthesizing and screening large libraries of macrocyclic compounds at a picomole scale. The macrocycles were synthesized by combinatorially transferring reagents in 2.5&#8197;nL droplets to microwell plates using acoustic waves. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, a library of 2700 macrocyclic compounds was synthesized and potent inhibitors of the protein&#8211;protein interaction p53&#8211;MDM2 were identified.







Abstract
Macrocyclic compounds are an attractive class of therapeutic ligands against challenging targets, such as protein&#8211;protein interactions. However, the development of macrocycles as drugs is hindered by the lack of large combinatorial macrocyclic libraries, which are cumbersome, expensive, and time consuming to make, screen, and deconvolute. Here, we established a strategy for synthesizing and screening combinatorial libraries on a picomolar scale by using acoustic droplet ejection to combine building blocks at nanoliter volumes, which reduced the reaction volumes, reagent consumption, and synthesis time. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we assembled a 2700&#8208;member target&#8208;focused macrocyclic library that we could subsequently assay in the same microtiter synthesis plates, saving the need for additional transfers and deconvolution schemes. We screened the library against the MDM2&#8211;p53 protein&#8211;protein interaction and generated micromolar and sub&#8208;micromolar inhibitors. Our approach based on acoustic liquid transfer provides a general strategy for the development of macrocycle ligands.

         <title>Introducing A New Class of Sulfonyl Fluoride Hubs via Radical Chloro&#8208;Fluorosulfonylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF) is introduced. BCASF can serve as a versatile platform for the synthesis of a wide spectrum of alkenylsulfonyl fluorides.







Abstract
Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many important fields, including ligation chemistry, chemical biology, and drug discovery. Therefore, new methods to increase the synthetic efficiency and expand the available structures of sulfonyl fluorides are highly in demand. Here, we introduce a new and powerful class of sulfonyl fluoride hubs, &#946;&#8208;chloro alkenylsulfonyl fluorides (BCASF), which can be constructed via radical chloro&#8208;fluorosulfonyl difunctionalization of alkynes under photoredox conditions. BCASF molecules exhibit versatile reactivities and well undergo a series of transformations at the chloride site while keeping the sulfonyl fluoride group intact, including reduction, Suzuki coupling, Sonogashira coupling, as well as nucleophilic substitution with various nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur nucleophiles. By using BCASF as a synthetic hub, a wide range of sulfonyl fluorides becomes readily accessible, such as cis alkenylsulfonyl fluorides, dienylsulfonyl fluorides, and ynenylsulfonyl fluorides, which are challenging or even not possible to synthesize before with the known methods. Moreover, further application of BCASF to the late&#8208;stage modification of peptides and drugs is also demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure CO Electroreduction at Silver Produces Ethanol and Propanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is of great interest. Here, CO reduction was studied on silver at high surface coverage, as DFT results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. The results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol, ethylene glycol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.







Abstract
Reducing CO2 to long&#8208;chain carbon products is attractive considering such products are typically more valuable than shorter ones. However, the best electrocatalyst for making such products from CO2, copper, lacks selectivity. By studying alternate C2+ producing catalysts we can increase our mechanistic understanding, which is beneficial for improving catalyst performance. Therefore, we investigate CO reduction on silver, as density functional theory (DFT) results predict it to be good at forming ethanol. To address the current disagreement between DFT and experimental results (ethanol vs. no ethanol), we investigated CO reduction at higher surface coverage (by increasing pressure) to ascertain if desorption effects can explain the discrepancy. In terms of product trends, our results agree with the DFT&#8208;proposed acetaldehyde&#8208;like intermediate, yielding ethanol and propanol as C2+ products&#8212;making the CO2 electrochemistry of silver very similar to that of copper at sufficiently high coverage.

         <title>Template Guiding for the Encapsulation of Uniformly Subnanometric Platinum Clusters in Beta&#8208;Zeolites Enabling High Catalytic Activity and Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A template&#8208;guidance protocol was reported for the synthesis of subnanometric metal clusters that are uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite. The metal ions are guided to the internal channels of the zeolite template through electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Subnanometric metal clusters have attracted extensive attention because of their unique properties as heterogeneous catalysts. However, it is challenging to obtain uniformly distributed metal clusters under synthesis and reaction conditions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;guidance protocol to synthesize subnanometric metal clusters uniformly encapsulated in beta&#8208;zeolite, with the metal ions anchored to the internal channels of the zeolite template via electrostatic interactions. Pt metal clusters with a narrow size range of 0.89 to 1.22&#8197;nm have been obtained on the intersectional sites of beta&#8208;zeolite (Pt@beta) with a broad range of Si/Al molar ratios (15&#8211;200). The uniformly distributed Pt clusters in Pt@H&#8208;beta are subject to strong electron withdrawal by the zeolite, which promotes transfer of active hydrogen, providing excellent activity and stability in hydrodeoxygenation reactions. A general strategy is thus proposed for the encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites with high thermal stability.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show that protonated merocyanines can act as reversible photoacids even when buffered with NaOH, attaining tunable and fully reversible jumps of up to 3 pH units between pH&#8197;7 and 4.







Abstract
A visible light&#8208;switchable buffer system based on a merocyanine photoacid is presented. Para&#8208;substitution of the indolium side with a methoxy group affords a compound suitable for making hydrolytically stable aqueous buffers whose pH can be tuned between 7 and 4 using 500&#8197;nm light.

         <title>Chiral Distorted Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes Bearing a Nonagon&#8208;Embedded Carbohelicene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The larger the ring, the better the chiroptical properties: A new family of highly distorted nanographenes is presented incorporating for the first time a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle. The nonagon&#8208;containing [5]helicene results in an extremely twisted helical moiety and provides to the final chiral PAHs with enhanced chiroptical properties.







Abstract
A new family of chiral saddle&#8208;helix hybrid nanographenes is reported. The first hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronene (HBC) analogues bearing a nine&#8208;membered carbocycle are presented. Furthermore, for the first time, &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[n]helicenes containing a nine&#8208;membered ring as part of the helical moiety have been synthesized. The combination of a [5]helicene moiety and a nonagon ring in a single chiral motif induces a tremendous distortion from planarity into the nanographenic structures compared to other saddle&#8208;helix hybrids such as heptagon&#8208; and octagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes. In fact, the interplanar angle of the two terminal rings reaches the largest angle (134.8&#176;) of a carbohelicene reported to date, thus being by far the most twisted helicene yet prepared. Photophysical properties evaluation showed improved absorption dissymmetry factors (|gabs|=4.2&#215;10&#8722;3) in the new family of nonagon&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended carbo[5]helicenes.

         <title>Diarylethene&#8208;Based Photoswitchable Inhibitors of Serine Proteases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic diarylethene&#8208;containing analogues of the sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1) can modulate activity of serine proteases in the nanomolar&#8211;micromolar range in highly efficient photocontrollable manner.







Abstract
A bicyclic peptide scaffold was chemically adapted to generate diarylethene&#8208;based photoswitchable inhibitors of serine protease Bos taurus trypsin&#8197;1 (T1). Starting from a prototype molecule&#8212;sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 (SFTI&#8208;1)&#8212;we obtained light&#8208;controllable inhibitors of T1 with Ki in the low nanomolar range, whose activity could be modulated over 20&#8208;fold by irradiation. The inhibitory potency as well as resistance to proteolytic degradation were systematically studied on a series of 17&#8197;SFTI&#8208;1 analogues. The hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the structure of inhibitors and possibly the enzyme&#8211;inhibitor binding dynamics were affected by isomerization of the photoswitch. The feasibility of manipulating enzyme activity in time and space was demonstrated by controlled digestion of gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and an antimicrobial peptide BP100&#8208;RW. Finally, our design principles of diarylethene photoswitches are shown to apply also for the development of other serine protease inhibitors.

         <title>The Critical Role of Additive Sulfate for Stable Alkaline Seawater Oxidation on Ni&#8208;based Electrode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a critical technology in marine energy projects; however, the severe anode corrosion caused by the highly concentrated chloride is a key issue should be addressed. In this work, we discover that the addition of sulfate in electrolyte can effectively retard the corrosion of chloride ions to the anode. We take nickel foam as the example and observe that the addition of sulfate can greatly improve the corrosion resistance, resulting in prolonged operating stability. Theoretical simulations and  in situ  experiments both demonstrate that sulfate anions can be preferentially adsorbed on anode surface to form a negative charge layer, which repulses the chloride ions away from the anode by electrostatic repulsion.&#160;The repulsive effect of the adsorbed sulfate is also applicable in highly&#8208;active catalyst (nickel iron layered double hydroxide) on nickel foam, which shows ~5 times stability of that in traditional electrolyte.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Carbochlorocarbonylation of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons via C&#8211;COCl Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a palladium&#8208;catalysed difunctionalisation of unsaturated C&#8211;C bonds with acid chlorides. Formally, the C&#8211;COCl bond of an acid chloride is cleaved and added, with complete atom economy, across either strained alkenes or tethered alkynes to generate new acid chlorides. The transformation does not require exogenous carbon monoxide, operates under mild conditions, shows a good functional group tolerance, and gives the isolated products with excellent stereoselectivity. The intermolecular reaction tolerates both aryl&#8208; and alkenyl&#8208;substituted acid chlorides and is successful when carboxylic acids are transformed to the acid chloride  in situ  . The reaction also shows an example of temperature&#8208;dependent stereodivergence which, together with plausible mechanistic pathways, is investigated by DFT calculations. Moreover, we show that benzofurans can be formed in an intramolecular variant of the reaction. Finally, derivatisation of the products from the intermolecular reaction provides a highly stereoselective approach for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted cyclopentanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Selective Synthesis of Semiconductive Silver Thiolate Coordination Polymer with Segregated Paths for Holes and Electrons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordination polymers (CPs) with infinite metal&#8211;S bond networks have unique electrical conductivities and optical properties, thus drawing attention. However, the development of new (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)  n  &#8208;structured CPs is hindered by their crystallization difficulty. Herein, we use machine learning to optimize the synthesis of trithiocyanuric acid (H  3  ttc)&#8208;based semiconductive CPs with infinite Ag&#8211;S bond networks, report three CP crystal structures, and reveal that isomer selectivity is mainly determined by proton concentration in the reaction medium. One of the CPs, [Ag  2  Httc]  n  , features a 3D extended infinite Ag&#8211;S bond network with 1D columns of stacked triazine rings, which, according to first&#8208;principle calculations, provide separate paths for holes and electrons. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity experiments show that [Ag  2  Httc]  n  is highly photoconductive (  &#966;  &#931;  &#956;  max  = 1.6 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  ). Thus, our method promotes the discovery of novel CPs difficult to crystallize with selective topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Functionalization of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks to Achieve Exceptionally High Iodine Capture Capacity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adsorption&#8208;based iodine (I  2  ) capture is of great potential for the treatment of radioactive nuclear waste. Here we employ a &#8220;multivariate&#8221; synthetic strategy to construct ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) with large surface area, high pore volume, and abundant binding sites for I  2  capture. The optimized material iCOF&#8208;AB&#8208;50 exhibits static I  2  uptake capacity of 10.21 g&#183;g  &#8208;1  at 75 &#176;C, and dynamic uptake capacity of 2.79 g&#183;g  &#8208;1  at ~400 ppm of I  2  and 25 &#176;C, far exceeding the performances of previously reported adsorbents under similar conditions. It also shows fast adsorption kinetics, good moisture tolerance, and full reusability. The promoting effect of ionic groups on I  2  adsorption has been elucidated by experimentally identifying the iodine species adsorbed at different sites and calculating their binding energies. This work demonstrates the essential role of balancing the textural properties and binding sites of the adsorbent in achieving high I  2  capture performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Second&#8208;Sphere Interaction Promoted &#8220;Turn&#8208;on&#8221; Fluorescence for Selective Sensing of Organic Amines in a Tb(III)&#8208;based Macrocyclic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly desirable to develop high&#8208;performance chemical sensors, especially those based on the fluorescence intensity enhancement (also known as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;) sensing. It is the same and more challenging for lanthanide materials, on account of the difficulty to sensitize the metal&#8208;chromophores in a desired way. Herein, guided by a&#160; &#8220; second&#8208;sphere interaction &#8221; strategy, we synthesized a polyamine&#8208;derived hexa&#8208;carboxylate ligand (H  6  L) to fabricate the Tb( &#8546; )&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MMCF&#8208;4) for &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing of methyl amine in aqueous environment with ultra&#8208;low detection limit&#160; and high turn&#8208;on efficiency . MMCF&#8208;4 features lanthanide nodes shielded in a nonacoordinate geometry along with a secondary coordination sphere that is densely populated with H&#8208;bond interacting sites. Through H&#8208;bond interactions on second&#8208;coordination sphere, nonradiative pathways were suppressed as a result of binding&#8208;induced rigidification of the ligand, thereby leading to luminescence enhancement. Such &#8220;remote&#8221; interacting mechanism involved in the &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing event was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the guest@MMCF&#8208;4 and molecular dynamic simulation studies. For the first time, &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing of organic analytes in aqueous media was achieved via the rational design of both primary and secondary coordination spheres of Tb (III) in Ln&#8208;MOFs. Our study contributes a new and promising design strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensing for not only lanthanide MOFs, but also luminescent materials driven by other metal chromophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Identifying Reactive Sites and Surface Traps in Chalcopyrite Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gathering information on the atomic nature of reactive sites and trap states is key to fine tuning catalysis and suppressing deleterious surface voltage losses in photoelectrochemical technologies. Here, spectroelectrochemical and computational methods were combined to investigate a model photocathode from the promising chalcopyrite family: CuIn  0.3  Ga  0.7  S  2  . We found that voltage losses are linked to traps induced by surface Ga and In vacancies, whereas operando Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysis occurred at Ga, In and S sites. This study allows establishing a bridge between the chalcopyrite&#8217;s performance and its surface&#8217;s chemistry, where avoiding formation of Ga and In vacancies is crucial to achieve high activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;activity relationships in nonenzymatic template&#8208;directed RNA synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The template&#8208;directed synthesis of RNA played an important role in the transition from prebiotic chemistry to the beginnings of RNA based life, but the mechanism of RNA copying chemistry is incompletely understood. We measured the kinetics of template copying with a set of primers with modified 3&#8242;&#8208;nucleotides and determined the crystal structures of these modified nucleotides in the context of a primer/template/substrate&#8208;analog complex. pH&#8208;rate profiles and solvent isotope effects show that deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;&#8208;hydroxyl occurs prior to the rate limiting step, the attack of the alkoxide on the activated phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. The analogs with a  3  E ribose conformation show the fastest formation of 3&#8242;&#8208;5&#8242; phosphodiester bonds. Among those derivatives, the reaction rate is strongly correlated with the electronegativity of the 2&#8242;&#8208;substituent. We interpret our results in terms of differences in steric bulk and charge distribution in the ground vs. transition states.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a Ni&#8208;catalyzed regioselective arylbenzylation of alkenylarenes with benzyl halides and arylzinc reagents. The reaction furnishes differently substituted 1,1,3&#8208;triarylpropyl structures that are reminiscent of the cores of oligoresveratrol natural products. The reaction is also compatible for the coupling of internal alkenes, secondary benzyl halides and variously substituted arylzinc reagents. Kinetic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds with a rate&#8208;limiting single electron transfer process and is autocatalyzed by  in situ  &#8208;generated ZnX  2  . The reaction rate is amplified by three&#8208;fold through autocatalysis upon addition of ZnX  2  .</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Bridged Ln4 Metallocene Complexes with Strong Magnetic Coupling and Large Coercive Field</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Programmable Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of DNA Origami with Polynucleotide Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;initiated TdT&#8208;catalyzed polymerization enables the programmable, site&#8208;specific modification of DNA origami nanostructures with polynucleotide brushes of different heights and compositions. The brush layer protects the origami core from nuclease degradation, which enables the application of DNA origami&#8208;based nanostructures for smart drug delivery and other biomedical applications.







Abstract
Combining surface&#8208;initiated, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) catalyzed enzymatic polymerization (SI&#8208;TcEP) with precisely engineered DNA origami nanostructures (DONs) presents an innovative pathway for the generation of stable, polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalized DNA nanostructures. We demonstrate that SI&#8208;TcEP can site&#8208;specifically pattern DONs with brushes containing both natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides. The brush functionalization can be precisely controlled in terms of the location of initiation sites on the origami core and the brush height and composition. Coarse&#8208;grained simulations predict the conformation of the brush&#8208;functionalized DONs that agree well with the experimentally observed morphologies. We find that polynucleotide brush&#8208;functionalization increases the nuclease resistance of DONs significantly, and that this stability can be spatially programmed through the site&#8208;specific growth of polynucleotide brushes. The ability to site&#8208;specifically decorate DONs with brushes of natural and non&#8208;natural nucleotides provides access to a large range of functionalized DON architectures that would allow for further supramolecular assembly, and for potential applications in smart nanoscale delivery systems.

         <title>Schottky Barrier&#8208;Induced Surface Electric Field Boosts Universal Reduction of NOx&#8722; in Water to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable surface electric field induced by Schottky barrier boosts the reduction of NOx&#8722; in water for ammonia production. The tunable amounts of Ni nanoparticles inside a nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon support could gradually enhance the surface electric field for enriching and fixation of NOx&#8722; anions, rendering high Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% for ammonia production from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction.







Abstract
NOx&#8722; reduction acts a pivotal part in sustaining globally balanced nitrogen cycle and restoring ecological environment, ammonia (NH3) is an excellent energy carrier and the most valuable product among all the products of NOx&#8722; reduction reaction, the selectivity of which is far from satisfaction due to the intrinsic complexity of multiple&#8208;electron NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 process. Here, we utilize the Schottky barrier&#8208;induced surface electric field, by the construction of high density of electron&#8208;deficient Ni nanoparticles inside nitrogen&#8208;rich carbons, to facilitate the enrichment and fixation of all NOx&#8722; anions on the electrode surface, including NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, and thus ensure the final selectivity to NH3. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that NOx&#8722; anions were continuously captured by the electrode with largely enhanced surface electric field, providing excellent Faradaic efficiency of 99&#8201;% from both electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722; reduction. Remarkably, the NH3 yield rate could reach the maximum of 25.1&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in electrocatalytic NO2&#8722; reduction reaction, outperforming the maximum in the literature by a factor of 6.3 in neutral solution. With the universality of our electrocatalyst, all sorts of available electrolytes containing NOx&#8722; pollutants, including seawater or wastewater, could be directly used for ammonia production in potential through sustainable electrochemical technology.

         <title>Sustainable Production of Benzylamines from Lignin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy for the conversion of a lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compound into benzylamines through one&#8208;pot C&#8722;O bond cleavage and C&#8722;N bond formation with secondary amines serving as both amine sources and reducing agents was developed. The feasibility for the production of bio&#8208;based benzylamines from lignin in a two&#8208;step process was introduced in these processes.







Abstract
Catalytic conversion of lignin into heteroatom functionalized chemicals is of great importance to bring the biorefinery concept into reality. Herein, a new strategy was designed for direct transformation of lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 model compounds into benzylamines and phenols in moderate to excellent yields in the presence of organic amines. The transformation involves dehydrogenation of C&#945;&#8722;OH, hydrogenolysis of the C&#946;&#8722;O bond and reductive amination in the presence of Pd/C catalyst. Experimental data suggest that the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds over the other two reactions and secondary amines serve as both reducing agents and amine sources in the transformation. Moreover, the concept of &#8220;lignin to benzylamines&#8221; was demonstrated by a two&#8208;step process. This work represents a first example of synthesis of benzylamines from lignin, thus providing a new opportunity for the sustainable synthesis of benzylamines from renewable biomass, and expanding the products pool of biomass conversion to meet future biorefinery demands.

The reaction of propargyl difluorides, R1CF2C&#8801;CR2, with alkylzincs, R3ZnCl, giving axially chiral fluorinated allenes, R1FC=C=CR2R3, with high enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee) was found to be catalyzed by a chiral diene/rhodium complex. A key step in the catalytic cycle is selective elimination of one of the enantiotopic fluorides at the &#946;&#8208;position of an alkenyl&#8208;Rh intermediate, which is generated by regioselective addition of R3&#8208;Rh onto the triple bond of the starting difluorides.

         <title>New Mechanistic and Reaction Pathway Insights for Oxidative Coupling of Methane (OCM) over Supported Na2WO4/SiO2 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the current study, with the aid of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic techniques, transient kinetic analysis, and implementation of robust experimental methodologies, we resolve the nature of catalytic active sites and reaction mechanism for oxidative coupling of methane over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.







Abstract
The complex structure of the catalytic active phase, and surface&#8208;gas reaction networks have hindered understanding of the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction mechanism by supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts. The present study demonstrates, with the aid of in situ Raman spectroscopy and chemical probe (H2&#8208;TPR, TAP and steady&#8208;state kinetics) experiments, that the long speculated crystalline Na2WO4 active phase is unstable and melts under OCM reaction conditions, partially transforming to thermally stable surface Na&#8208;WOx sites. Kinetic analysis via temporal analysis of products (TAP) and steady&#8208;state OCM reaction studies demonstrate that (i) surface Na&#8208;WOx sites are responsible for selectively activating CH4 to C2Hx and over&#8208;oxidizing CHy to CO and (ii) molten Na2WO4 phase is mainly responsible for over&#8208;oxidation of CH4 to CO2 and also assists in oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. These new insights reveal the nature of catalytic active sites and resolve the OCM reaction mechanism over supported Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts.

         <title>A Neutral Beryllium(I) Radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized organoberyllium chloride yields the first neutral beryllium radical, which was characterized by EPR, IR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography. DFT calculations show significant spin density at beryllium and confirm donor&#8211;acceptor bonding between an alkylberyllium radical fragment and a neutral CAAC ligand.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Driven Reversible Free Radical Catalysis for Environment&#8208;Adaptive Cancer Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich BiO2&#8722;X nanosheet is developed as a novel free radical regulator. It shows dual&#8208;modal free radical catalysis adaptive to environment changes, enabling amplified production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions, while scavenging free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells.







Abstract
Amplifying free radical production by chemical dynamic catalysis to cause oxidative damage to cancer cells has received extensive interest for cancer&#8208;specific therapy. The major challenge is inevitable negative modulation on the tumor microenvironment (TME) by these species, hindering durable effectiveness. Here we show for the first time an oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich Bi&#8208;based regulator that allows environment&#8208;adaptive free radical catalysis. Specifically, the regulator catalyzes production of highly toxic O2.&#8722; and .OH in cancer cells via logic enzymatic reactions yet scavenges accumulation of free radicals and immunosuppressive mediators in TME&#8208;associated noncancerous cells. Atomic&#8208;level mechanistic studies reveal that such dual&#8208;modal regulating behavior is dominated by oxygen vacancies that well fit for free radical catalytic kinetics, along with distinguished cellular fates of this regulator. With this smart regulator, a &#8220;two birds with one shot&#8221; cancer dynamic therapy can be expected.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction over a Cadmium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst by Tuning of the Axial Coordination Structure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with an optimized CdN4S1 moiety were designed and prepared. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO reached 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and the TOF of CO production was as high as 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1. Cd SACs are effective for reduction of CO2 to CO. Introduction of an axial coordination structure boosts the activity of CO2RR and also enhances the selectivity of CO2RR by suppressing the adsorption of *H.







Abstract
Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, it was found that Cd single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have excellent performance in activating CO2, and the introduction of axial coordination structure to Cd SACs cannot only further decrease the free energy barrier of CO2 reduction, but also suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on the above discovery, we designed and synthesized a novel Cd SAC that comprises an optimized CdN4S1 moiety incorporated in a carbon matrix. It was shown that the catalyst exhibited outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction to CO. The faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO could reach up to 99.7&#8201;% with a current density of 182.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a H&#8208;type electrolysis cell, and the turnover frequency (TOF) value could achieve 73000&#8197;h&#8722;1, which was much higher than that reported to date. This work shows a successful example of how to design highly efficient catalysts guided by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Carbonyl Hypoiodites as Extremely Strong Halogen Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl hypoiodites possess very strongly polarized iodine atoms, including what is now the largest known &#963;&#8208;hole for a neutral compound, and act as strong halogen bond donors. When strong Lewis bases, for example DMAP, are used as halogen bond acceptors, the iodine atom, for all intents and purposes, transfers from the oxygen to nitrogen atom to give an ion&#8208;pair of the general form [RCOO&#8722;][I&#8722;+N(DMAP)] with an O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N halogen bond.







Abstract
Neutral halogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes were prepared from in situ formed carbonyl hypoiodites and aromatic organic bases. The carbonyl hypoiodites have a strongly polarized iodine atom with larger &#963;&#8208;holes than any known uncharged halogen bond donor. Modulating the Lewis basicity of the selected pyridine derivatives and carboxylates leads to halogen&#8208;bonded complexes where the classical O&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N halogen bond transforms more into a halogen&#8208;bonded COO&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N+ ion&#8208;pair (salt) with an asymmetric O&#8722;I&#8722;N moiety. X&#8208;ray analyses, NMR studies, and calculations reveal the halogen bonding geometries of the carbonyl hypoiodite&#8208;based O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes, confirming that in the solid&#8208;state the iodine atom is much closer to the N&#8208;atom of the pyridine derivatives than its original position at the carboxylate O&#8208;atom.

Modulating the Lewis basicity of the selected pyridine derivatives and carboxylates leads to halogen-bonded complexes where the classical O&#8722;I&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N halogen bond transforms more into a halogen-bonded COO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;I&#8722;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion-pair (salt) with an asymmetric O&#8722;I&#8722;N moiety. X-ray analyses, NMR studies, and calculations reveal the halogen bonding geometries of the carbonyl hypoiodite-based O&#8722;I&#8722;N complexes, confirming that in the solid-state the iodine atom is much closer to the N-atom of the pyridine derivatives than its original position at the carboxylate O-atom.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Antiaromatic 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes (see structure) were synthesized and found to exhibit distinct antiaromaticity as manifested by pronounced bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms.







Abstract
s&#8208;Indacene is a classical non&#8208;alternant hydrocarbon that contains 12 &#960;&#8208;electrons in a cyclic &#960;&#8208;conjugation system. Herein, we report its nitrogen&#8208;doped analogue, 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene. 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes were readily prepared from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dichlorobenzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diamine through a two&#8208;step transformation consisting of a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Larock cyclization with diaryl acetylenes followed by hydrogen abstraction. The thus obtained 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes exhibited distinct antiaromaticity, as manifested in clear bond&#8208;length alternation, a forbidden HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition, and a paratropic ring current. As compared to the parent s&#8208;indacene, the 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacenes showed higher electron&#8208;accepting ability owing to the presence of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene core is effectively conjugated with the peripheral aryl groups, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of the absorption spectra and redox properties. The two possible localized forms of 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene were compared in terms of their energetic aspects.

         <title>Isomerization of a cis&#8208;(2&#8208;Borylalkenyl)Gold Complex via a Retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;Metalate Shift: Cleavage of a C&#8722;C/C&#8722;Si Bond trans to a C&#8722;Au Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpected isomerization of cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complexes, which formed through the first alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond, was observed with structural characterization of intermediates and products. Kinetic analysis for isomerization of isolated intermediate and detailed DFT calculations revealed a new elementary reaction, i.e., a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221; that contains anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination.







Abstract
This manuscript describes the first example of an alkyne insertion to the Au&#8722;B bond of a di(o&#8208;tolyl)borylgold complex to afford a cis&#8208;2&#8208;borylalkenylgold complex, and its isomerization to result in interchanging substituents on the alkenyl carbon atom and the boron atom. The former reaction is the first example of an alkyne insertion to a Au&#8722;B bond. In the latter reaction, the regiochemistry of the isomerized alkenylgold products varied depending on the substituents. DFT calculations revealed the formation of gold alkynylborates as a common intermediate via a &#8220;retro&#8208;1,2&#8208;metalate shift&#8221;, which can be considered as an anti&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbon/silicon elimination, and identified a subsequent 1,2&#8208;metalate shift as the regiochemistry&#8208;determining step. Relative energies of the transition states to each isomer and natural&#8208;bond&#8208;orbital (NBO) analyses were used to clearly rationalize the regiochemistry of the products.

         <title>Monolayer&#8208;to&#8208;Multilayer Dimensionality Reconstruction in a Hybrid Perovskite for Exploring Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Enables Passive X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7 was successfully obtained by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, which enables unprecedented passive X&#8208;ray detection with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Halide hybrid perovskites are attracting considerable attention as highly promising candidates for directly sensing X&#8208;ray radiation, but it is challenging to realize passive X&#8208;ray detection without an external power supply. However, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectrics promotes the independent separation of photoexcited carriers. Herein, by dimensionality reconstruction of a pure&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (P&#8208;2D) monolayered perovskite (CH3OC3H9N)2PbBr4, we obtained a quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) ferroelectric (CH3OC3H9N)2CsPb2Br7. Converting P&#8208;2D into Q&#8208;2D perovskite stimulates a significant BPVE associated with robust ferroelectricity, as well as an enhanced mobility lifetime product. These features show the promise of the fabrication of the first passive X&#8208;ray detector based on ferroelectrics with an impressive sensitivity up to 410&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gy&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at zero bias, which is even superior to the value of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#945;&#8208;Se detector operated at relatively high bias.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Transformations of Nitrogen&#8208;Oxyanions to Ammonia via Oxoammonium Salt</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;assisted transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) in the presence of 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8208;H) lead to a diaryl oxoammonium species [(TMB)2NO]+. In addition to the 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative chemistry of [(TMB)2NO]+ towards oxidizable substrates, this report illustrates water&#8208;promoted decomposition of [(TMB)2NO]+ affording ammonia.







Abstract
Transformations of nitrogen&#8208;oxyanions (NOx&#8722;) to ammonia impart pivotal roles in sustainable biogeochemical processes. While metal&#8208;mediated reductions of NOx&#8722; are relatively well known, this report illustrates proton&#8208;assisted transformations of NOx&#8722; anions in the presence of electron&#8208;rich aromatics such as 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8722;H, 1&#8201;a) leading to the formation of diaryl oxoammonium salt [(TMB)2N+=O][NO3&#8722;] (2&#8201;a) via the intermediacy of nitrosonium cation (NO+). Detailed characterizations including UV/Vis, multinuclear NMR, FT&#8208;IR, HRMS, X&#8208;ray analyses on a set of closely related metastable diaryl oxoammonium [Ar2N+=O] species disclose unambiguous structural and spectroscopic signatures. Oxoammonium salt 2&#8201;a exhibits 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxidative reactivity in the presence of oxidizable substrates such as benzylamine, thiol, and ferrocene. Intriguingly, reaction of 2&#8201;a with water affords ammonia. Perhaps of broader significance, this work reveals a new metal&#8208;free route germane to the conversion of NOx&#8197;to&#8197;NH3.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions in the presence of electron-rich aromatics such as 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB&#8722;H, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) leading to the formation of diaryl oxoammonium salt [(TMB)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=O][NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) via the intermediacy of nitrosonium cation (NO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Detailed characterizations including UV/Vis, multinuclear NMR, FT-IR, HRMS, X-ray analyses on a set of closely related metastable diaryl oxoammonium [Ar&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=O] species disclose unambiguous structural and spectroscopic signatures. Oxoammonium salt &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; exhibits 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxidative reactivity in the presence of oxidizable substrates such as benzylamine, thiol, and ferrocene. Intriguingly, reaction of &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; with water affords ammonia. Perhaps of broader significance, this work reveals a new metal-free route germane to the conversion of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&#8197;to&#8197;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>N&#8208;Atom Deletion in Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;atom deletion from N&#8208;heterocycles via N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation, Curtius&#8208;type rearrangement and rearrangement of 1,2&#8208;diazene intermediates is described. It provides a unique opportunity to achieve ring contraction of (n+1)&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycles to n&#8208;membered cycles.







Abstract
Excising the nitrogen in secondary amines, and coupling the two residual fragments is a skeletal editing strategy that can be used to construct molecules with new skeletons, but which has been largely unexplored. Here we report a versatile method of N&#8208;atom excision from N&#8208;heterocycles. The process uses readily available N&#8208;heterocycles as substrates, and proceeds by N&#8208;sulfonylazidonation followed by the rearrangement of sulfamoyl azide intermediates, providing various cyclic products. Examples are provided of deletion of nitrogen from natural products, synthesis of chiral O&#8208;heterocycles from commercially available chiral &#946;&#8208;amino alcohols, formal inert C&#8722;H functionalization through a sequence of N&#8208;directed C&#8722;H functionalization and N&#8208;atom deletion reactions in which the N&#8208;atom can serve as a traceless directing group.

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Domino Reaction Enables Fully Controlled Non&#8208;Statistical Synthesis of Hexaarylbenzene with Six Different Aryl Groups**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high yielding and scalable metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step linear domino reaction results in functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB) and opens the door for making a broad variety of synthetically challenging hexaarylbenzene (HAB) molecules with six different aryl groups.







Abstract
Hexaarylbenzene (HAB) derivatives are versatile aromatic systems playing a significant role as chromophores, liquid crystalline materials, molecular receptors, molecular&#8208;scale devices, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes and candidates for organic electronics. Statistical synthesis of simple symmetrical HABs is known via cyclotrimerization or Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. By contrast, the synthesis of more complex, asymmetrical systems, and without involvement of statistical steps, remains an unsolved problem. Here we present a generally applicable synthetic strategy to access asymmetrical HAB via an atom&#8208;economical and high&#8208;yielding metal&#8208;free four&#8208;step domino reaction using nitrostyrenes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanoolefins as easily available starting materials. Resulting domino product&#8212;functionalized triarylbenzene (TAB)&#8212;can be used as a key starting compound to furnish asymmetrically substituted hexaarylbenzenes in high overall yield and without involvement of statistical steps. This straightforward domino process represents a distinct approach to create diverse and still unexplored HAB scaffolds, containing six different aromatic rings around central benzene core.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Nanogels for Protein Recognition: Direct Proof of Specific Binding Sites by Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIPs for protein recognition are often synthesized by the epitope approach. The epitope is a short surface&#8208;exposed peptide of the protein. Solution STD and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies were used to prove the evidence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of the peptide epitope in the corresponding MIP nanogel. No binding was observed with a non&#8208;related peptide.







Abstract
Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are tailor&#8208;made synthetic antibodies possessing specific binding cavities designed for a target molecule. Currently, MIPs for protein targets are synthesized by imprinting a short surface&#8208;exposed fragment of the protein, called epitope or antigenic determinant. However, finding the epitope par excellence that will yield a peptide &#8220;synthetic antibody&#8221; cross&#8208;reacting exclusively with the protein from which it is derived, is not easy. We propose a computer&#8208;based rational approach to unambiguously identify the &#8220;best&#8221; epitope candidate. Then, using Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) and WaterLOGSY NMR spectroscopies, we prove the existence of specific binding sites created by the imprinting of this peptide epitope in the MIP nanogel. The optimized MIP nanogel could bind the epitope and cognate protein with a high affinity and selectivity. The study was performed on Hepatitis&#8197;A Virus Cell Receptor&#8208;1 protein, also known as KIM&#8208;1 and TIM&#8208;1, for its ubiquitous implication in numerous pathologies.

         <title>Efficient Hole Trapping in Carbon Dot/Oxygen&#8208;Modified Carbon Nitride Heterojunction Photocatalysts for Enhanced Methanol Production from CO2 under Neutral Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified carbon nitride with O&#8208;containing linkers decorated with carbon dots selectively produces methanol from CO2 and water with the benchmark quantum yield of ca. 6&#8201;%. Transient absorption spectroscopic investigation shows that extraction of holes before trapping by the carbon dots is key for the remarkable performance.







Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis of alcohols from CO2 is still unsatisfactory owing to the rapid charge relaxation compared to the sluggish photoreactions and the oxidation of alcohol products. Here, we demonstrate that CO2 is reduced to methanol with 100&#8201;% selectivity using water as the only electron donor on a carbon nitride&#8208;like polymer (FAT) decorated with carbon dots. The quantum efficiency of 5.9&#8201;% (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) is 300&#8201;% higher than the previously reported carbon nitride junction. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we observed that holes in FAT could be extracted by the carbon dots with nearly 75&#8201;% efficiency before they become unreactive by trapping. Extraction of holes resulted in a greater density of photoelectrons, indicative of reduced recombination of shorter&#8208;lived reactive electrons. This work offers a strategy to promote photocatalysis by increasing the amount of reactive photogenerated charges via structure engineering and extraction before energy losses by deep trapping.

         <title>A New Dioxazolone for the Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Aminoalcohols via Iridium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp3)&#8211;H Amidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vicinal aminoalcohols are widespread structural motifs in bioactive molecules. We report the development of a new dioxazolone reagent containing a p&#8208;nitrophenyldifluoromethyl group, which 1. displays a good safety profile; 2. shows a remarkably high reactivity in the oxime&#8208;directed iridium(III)&#8208;catalyzed amidation of unactivated C(sp  3  )&#8211;H bonds; 3. leads to amide products which can be hydrolyzed under mild conditions. The amidation reaction is mild, general and compatible with both primary C&#8211;H bonds of tertiary and secondary alcohols, as well as secondary C&#8211;H bonds of cyclic secondary alcohols. This method provides an easy access to free 1,2&#8208;aminoalcohols after efficient and mild cleavage of the oxime directing group and activated amide.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent behavior elucidation of disilane&#8208;bridged D&#8210;A&#8210;D triad composed of phenothiazine and thienopyrazine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A s&#8210;p extended aryldisilane, comprising a thienopyrazine group as an acceptor fragment and phenothiazine groups as the donor moiety, has been prepared through the introduction of two Si&#8210;Si bridges (compound 1). X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis determined the crystal structure of 1, and experimental and theoretical approaches investigated its optical properties. Solvatochromic studies revealed the dual emission of 1 in all solvents tested. Compound 1 also exhibited fluorescence in the solid state upon excitation with a hand&#8208;held UV lamp, as well as mechanochromic luminescent properties. The packing mode in the crystal structure, variation of phenothiazine conformation, morphological changes between crystalline and amorphous phases are the major factors showing reversible fluorescence under external stimuli. A theoretical conformer study found that 1 exists in distinct conformational groups differing in Gibbs free energy by less than 3 kcal/mol. The conformer in the crystalline state of 1 can promote the complete separation of the HOMO and LUMO between the phenothiazine donor and the thienopyrazine acceptor, linked by the disilane linker. HOMO&#8210;LUMO energy transition in the crystalline state is forbidden due to the lack of frontier orbital overlap. Crystalline state emission showed LUMO &#8594; HOMO&#8210;1 transition (locally excited (LE) state). In the amorphous state, the partial presence of quasi&#8208;axial conformers allows intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer type emission via energy transfer from dominant quasi&#8208;equatorial conformers. The strategy proposed in this work provides important guidance for developing stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with controlled excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Selective Pyridine Alkylation via Wittig Olefination of Dearomatized Pyridylphosphonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Wittig reaction within a dearomatized pyridine ring system results in 4&#8208;alkylated pyridines, a valuable motif in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical sciences. N&#8208;Triazinyl salts are key to this strategy, and a range of substituted pyridines and aldehydes are amenable. Late&#8208;stage methylation is also feasible using a formaldehyde surrogate.







Abstract
Methods to synthesize alkylated pyridines are valuable because these structures are prevalent in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. We have developed a distinct approach to construct 4&#8208;alkylpyridines using dearomatized pyridylphosphonium ylide intermediates in a Wittig olefination&#8208;rearomatization sequence. Pyridine N&#8208;activation is key to this strategy, and N&#8208;triazinylpyridinium salts enable coupling between a wide variety of substituted pyridines and aldehydes. The alkylation protocol is viable for late&#8208;stage functionalization, including methylation of pyridine&#8208;containing drugs. This approach represents an alternative to metal&#8208;catalyzed sp2&#8208;sp3 cross&#8208;coupling reactions and Minisci&#8208;type processes.

         <title>An Efficient Diazirine&#8208;Based Four&#8208;Armed Cross&#8208;linker for Photo&#8208;patterning of Polymeric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetra&#8208;diazirine based cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) is developed for the universal patterning of p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar conjugated polymers by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. The interchain packing orders, the thin film morphologies and the charge carrier mobilities of four conjugated polymers retain well after patterning.







Abstract
A diazirine&#8208;based four&#8208;armed cross&#8208;linker (4CNN) with a tetrahedron geometry is presented for efficient patterning of polymeric semiconductors by photo&#8208;induced carbene insertion. After blending of 4CNN with no more than 3&#8201;% (w/w), photo&#8208;patterning of p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar semiconducting polymers with side alkyl chains was achieved; regular patterns with size as small as 5&#8197;&#956;m were prepared with appropriate photomasks after 365&#8197;nm irradiation for just 40&#8197;s. The interchain packing order and the thin film morphology were nearly unaltered after the cross&#8208;linking and the semiconducting properties of the patterned thin films were mostly retained. A complementary&#8208;like inverter with a gain value of 112 was constructed easily by two steps of photo&#8208;patterning of the p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers. The results show that 4CNN is a new generation of cross&#8208;linker for the photo&#8208;patterning of polymeric semiconductors for all&#8208;solution&#8208;processible flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Spin Interactions in One&#8208;Dimensional Assemblies of a Cumulene&#8208;Based Singlet Biradical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singlet biradical based on [5]cumulene end&#8208;capped with phenalenyl moieties was synthesized. The strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking tendency of phenalenyl units led to controlled self&#8208;assembly, with the formation of one&#8208;dimensional chain assemblies. Variable&#8208;temperature structural and Raman spectroscopic studies demonstrated that intramolecular spin pairs forming cumulene bonds coupled intermolecularly to form a continuum spin system at low temperatures (see picture).







Abstract
The synthesis of phenalenyl&#8208;endcapped [5]cumulene as a cumulene&#8208;based singlet biradical and the spin correlation changes of one&#8208;dimensional aggregates are described. The high propensity for self&#8208;aggregation of phenalenyl rings and the introduction of bulky substituents into the appropriate positions led to the formation of a one&#8208;dimensional chain assembly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis indicated that the bond length alternation of the cumulene chain increased with decreasing temperature, along with improved overlapping of the phenalenyl rings. Variable&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that a localized spin pair within the molecule decouples at low temperatures, and a continuum spin system involving intra&#8208; and intermolecular spin&#8211;spin interactions emerges in the one&#8208;dimensional chain.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Stabilized Organic Cocrystals for Biological Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic co&#8208;crystals are solid&#8208;state multifunctional materials with intriguing properties whereas the supramolecular interactions within co&#8208;crystals limited their stability in solution and their application in biology. Utilizing metal&#8211;organic framework to stabilize and strengthen the charge&#8208;transfer interaction between electron donor and electron acceptor, a water&#8208;dispersible co&#8208;crystal was obtained and applied in photothermal therapy.







Abstract
Organic self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystals have garnered considerable attention due to their facile synthesis and intriguing properties, but supramolecular interactions restrict their stability in aqueous solution, which is especially important for biological applications. Herein, we report on the first biological application of aqueous dispersible self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystals via the construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) &#8208;stabilized co&#8208;crystals. In particular, we built an electron&#8208;deficient MOF with naphthalene diimide (NDI) as the ligand and biocompatible Ca2+ as the metal nodes. An electron donor molecule, pyrene, was encapsulated to form the host&#8211;guest MOF self&#8208;assembled co&#8208;crystal. We observed that such MOF structure leads to uniquely high&#8208;density ordered arrangement and the close intermolecular distance (3.47&#8197;&#197;) of the charge transfer pairs. Hence, the concomitant superior charge transfer interaction between pyrene/NDI can be attained and the resultant photothermal conversion efficiency of Py@Ca&#8208;NDI in aqueous solution can thus reach up to 41.8&#8201;%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value among the reported organic co&#8208;crystal materials; it is also much higher than that of the FDA approved photothermal agent ICG as well as most of the reported MOFs. Based on this realization, as a proof of concept, we demonstrated that such a self&#8208;assembled organic co&#8208;crystal platform can be used in biological applications that are exemplified via highly effective long wavelength light photothermal therapy.

         <title>Thionitrite and Perthionitrite in NO Signaling at Zinc</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity through formation of HSNO and HSSNO. Zinc complexes of their conjugate bases Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) result in stabilization of these anions at a biologically relevant metal site yet reveal disparate signaling output upon reaction with thiols.







Abstract
NO and H2S serve as signaling molecules in biology with intertwined reactivity. HSNO and HSSNO with their conjugate bases &#8722;SNO and &#8722;SSNO form in the reaction of H2S with NO as well as S&#8208;nitrosothiols (RSNO) and nitrite (NO2&#8722;) that serve as NO reservoirs. While HSNO and HSSNO are elusive, their conjugate bases form isolable zinc complexes Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) supported by tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands. Reaction of Na(15&#8208;C&#8208;5)SSNO with Ph,MeTpZn(ClO4) provides Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) that undergoes S&#8208;atom removal by PEt3 to give Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and S=PEt3. Unexpectedly stable at room temperature, these Zn&#8208;SNO and Zn&#8208;SSNO complexes release NO upon heating. Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) and Ph,MeTpZn(SSNO) quickly react with acidic thiols such as C6F5SH to form N2O and NO, respectively. Increasing the thiol basicity in p&#8208;substituted aromatic thiols 4&#8722;XArSH in the reaction with Ph,MeTpZn(SNO) turns on competing S&#8208;nitrosation to form Ph,MeTpZn&#8208;SH and RSNO, the latter a known precursor for NO.

         <title>Coupling electrocatalytic NO oxidation over carbon cloth with hydrogen evolution reaction for nitrate synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NO is a harmful pollutant to the environment. The traditional removal of NO is hindered by the harsh operating conditions and value&#8208;added chemicals sacrifice. In this work, the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of NO was achieved over plasma&#8208;treated commercial carbon cloth, serving as the promising anode substitution reaction to couple with hydrogen evolution reaction without consumption of hydrogen&#8208;containing resources. The introduction of carboxyl groups onto the carbon cloth boosted the electrocatalytic activity via the enhancement of NO chemisorption. Only potentials of 1.39 V and 1.07 V were applied to reach the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  in neutral and acidic conditions, respectively, superior than that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Energy and environmental concerns on fossil fuel&#8208;derived hydrogen production, ammonia manufacture and nitrate synthesis, are greatly alleviated. This work provides an original strategy to realize the resource utilization of NO, the sustainable nitrate synthesis and hydrogen production in a green and economical way.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Modulation  Caused by&#160;Interfacial Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M (M = Ru, Ir, Pd) Bonding for Accelerating Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing definite metal&#8208;support interfacial bond is an effective strategy for optimizing the intrinsic activity of noble metals, but rather challenging. Herein, a series of quantum&#8208;sized metal nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework nanohybrids (M@Ni&#8208;MOF, M = Ru, Ir, Pd) are rationally developed through a spontaneous redox strategy. The metal&#8208;oxygen bonds between the NPs and Ni&#8208;MOF guarantee structural stability and sufficient exposure of the surface active sites. More importantly, such precise interfacial feature can effectively modulate the electronic structure of hybrids through the charge transfer of the formed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;M bridge and then improves the reaction kinetics.  As a result  , the representative Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity at all pH values, even superior to commercial Pt/C and  recent noble&#8208;metal catalysts.  Furthermore, theoretical calculations deepen the mechanism understanding of the superior HER performance of Ru@Ni&#8208;MOF through the optimized adsorption free energies of water and hydrogen due to the interfacial&#8208;bond&#8208;induced electron redistribution.</dc:description>

         <title>EDTA Lewis basic molecule as a highly active electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The active catalysts in hydrogenation reduction of CO  2  are mainly heterogeneous Cu&#8208;based catalysts. The complex coordination environments and multiple active sites in a heterogeneous catalyst always result in a low selectivity of target product, while molecular catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites and tailorable structures allow mechanism&#8208;based selectivity optimization. Herein, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) moleculars were firstly immobilized on the surface of carbon nanotube as a catalyst for transferring CO  2  to CH  4  with an excellent performance, exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency of 61.6% toward CH  4  and a partial current density of &#8208;16.5 mA cm  &#8208;2  at a potential of &#8208;1.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Lewis basic COO  &#8208;  groups in EDTA molecules are the active sites for CO  2  reduction reaction (CO  2  RR). The energy barrier for the generation of CO from *CO intermediate is as high as 0.52 eV, while the further protonation of *CO to *CHO follows an energetic downhill path (&#8208;1.57 eV), resulting in a high selectivity of CH  4  .</dc:description>

         <title>Capillary&#8208;bound dense micelle brush supports for continuous flow catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Flow reactors are appealing alternatives to conventional batch reactors for heterogeneous catalysis. However, it remains a key challenge to firmly immobilize the catalysts in a facile and flexible manner and to simultaneously maintain a high catalytic efficiency and throughput. Herein, we introduce a dense cylindrical micelle brush support in glass capillary flow reactors through a living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly process initiated by pre&#8208;immobilized short micelle seeds. The active hairy corona of these micellar brushes allows the flexible decoration of a diverse array of nanocatalysts, either through a direct capture process or an in situ growth method. The resulting flow reactors reveal excellent catalytic efficiency for a broad range of frequently utilized transformations, including organic reductions, Suzuki couplings, photolytic degradations, and multistep cascade reactions and the system was both recyclable and durable. Significantly, this approach is readily applicable to long capillaries, which enables the construction of flow reactors with remarkably higher throughput.</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (C&#8208;FRET) for Efficient Chirality Transmission within an Intermolecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The occurrence and transmission of chirality is a fascinating characteristic of nature. However, the intermolecular transmission efficiency of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) remains challenging due to the poor through&#8208;space energy transfer. Here we report a unique CPL transmission from inducing the achiral acceptor to emit CPL within a specific liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based intermolecular system through a circularly polarized fluorescence resonance energy transfer (  C  &#8208;FRET), wherein the luminescent cholesteric LC is employed as the chirality donor, and rationally designed achiral long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) fluorophore act as the well&#8208;assembled acceptor. In contrast to photon&#8208;release&#8208;and&#8208;absorption, the chirality transmission channel of  C  &#8208;FRET is highly dependent upon the energy resonance in the highly intrinsic chiral assembly of cholesteric LC, as verified by deliberately separating the achiral acceptor from the chiral donor to keep far beyond the resonance distance. This  C  &#8208;FRET mode provides a de novo strategy concept for high&#8208;level information processing for applications such as high&#8208;density data storage, combinatorial logic calculation, and multilevel data encryption and decryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium Nanoparticles for the Deuteration and Tritiation of Benzylic Positions on Complex Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium nanoparticles (PdNp) were revealed as an efficient hydrogen isotope exchange catalyst for the deuterium and tritium labeling of benzylic positions of complex molecules. A practical way to obtain small palladium nanoparticles and to apply them as a catalyst for hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is presented. Several model compounds and popular bioactive molecules were submitted to HIE reactions catalyzed by the PdNp. Benzylic positions situated far away from heteroatoms were labeled with high isotopic enrichments. The observed non&#8208;directed HIE gave rise to regioselectivities complementary to those obtained with other methods, which typically require specific directing groups. For this reason, the successful deuteration of a broad variety of benzylic positions created a helpful tool to produce internal LC&#8208;MS standards of complex drugs. Furthermore, this nanocatalyst paved the way for the radiolabeling of drug molecules with high specific activities by using low pressures of tritium gas.</dc:description>

         <title>O&#8208;to&#8208;S Substitution Enables Dovetailing Conflicting Cyclizability, Polymerizability, and Recyclability: Dithiolactone vs Dilactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing chemically recyclable polymers represents a greener alternative to landfill and incineration and offers a closed&#8208;loop strategy toward a circular materials economy. However, the synthesis of chemically recyclable polymers is still plagued with certain fundamental limitations, including trade&#8208;offs between the monomer&#8217;s cyclizability and polymerizability, as well as between polymer&#8217;s depolymerizability and properties. Here we describe the subtle O&#8208;to&#8208;S substitution, dithiolactone monomers derived from abundant feedstock  &#945;  &#8208;amino acids can demonstrate appealing chemical properties different from those of dilactone, including accelerated ring closure, augmented kinetics polymerizability, high depolymerizability and selectivity, and thus constitute a unique class of polythioester materials exhibiting controlled molecular weight (up to 100.5 kDa), atactic yet high crystallinity, structurally diversity, and full chemical recyclability. These polythioesters well addresses the formidable challenges of developing chemically recyclable polymers by having an unusual set of desired properties, including easy&#8208;to&#8208;make monomer from ubiquitous feedstock, and high polymerizability, crystallinity and precise tunability of physicochemical performance, as well as high depolymerizability and selectivity. Computational studies explain why O&#8208;to&#8208;S modification of polymer backbone enables dovetailing desirable, but conflicting, performance into one polymer structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Red&#8208; and Far&#8208;Red&#8208;Emitting Zinc Probes with Minimal Phototoxicity for Multiplexed Recording of Orchestrated Insulin Secretion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zinc biology, featuring intertwining signaling networks and of critical importance to human health, witnesses exciting opportunities in the big data era of physiology. Here, we report a class of red&#8208; and far&#8208;red&#8208;emitting Zn  2+  probes with K  d  values ranging from 190 nM to 74 &#956;M, which are particularly suitable for real&#8208;time monitoring the high concentration of Zn  2+  /insulin co&#8208;released during vesicular secretory events. Compared to the prototypical rhodamine&#8208;based Zn  2+  probes, the new class exploits morpholino auxochromes which eliminates phototoxicity during long&#8208;term live recording from isolated islets. A Si&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based Zn  2+  probe with high turn&#8208;on ratio (&gt; 100), whose synthesis was enabled by a new route featuring late&#8208;stage N&#8208;alkylation, allowed simultaneous recording of Ca  2+  influx, mitochondrial signal, and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets.&#160;The time&#8208;lapse multicolor fluorescence movies and their analysis, enabled by red&#8208;shifted Zn&#160;  2+  and other orthogonal physiological probes, highlight the potential impact of biocompatible fluorophores on the fields of islet endocrinology and system biology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Copper(I) Complex with Two Unpaired Electrons, Synthesised by Oxidation of a Copper(II) Complex with Two Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two homoleptic copper(II) complexes [Cu(L1)  2  ] and [Cu(L2)  2  ] with anionic redox&#8208;active ligands were synthesised, one with urea azine (L1) and the other with thio&#8208;urea azine (L2) ligands. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes initiates an unprecedented redox&#8208;induced electron transfer process, leading to monocationic copper(I) complexes [Cu(L1)  2  ]  +  and [Cu(L2)  2  ]  +  with two oxidised ligands. While [Cu(L1)  2  ]  +  is best described as a Cu  I  complex with two neutral radical ligands that couple antiferromagnetically, [Cu(L2)  2  ]  +  is a Cu  I  complex with two clearly different ligand units in the solid state and with a magnetic susceptibility close to a diamagnetic compound. Further one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complex with L1 ligands results in a dication [Cu(L1)  2  ]  2+  , best described as a Cu  I  complex with a twofold oxidised, monocationic ligand and a neutral radical ligand. The stability in at least three redox states, the accumulation of spin density at the ligands and the facile metal&#8208;ligand electron transfer makes these complexes highly attractive for a variety of applications; here the catalytic aerobic oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes is tested.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Reference Electrodes for Aqueous and Non&#8208;Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While numerous reference electrodes suitable for aqueous electrolytes exist, there is no well&#8208;defined standard for non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, reference electrodes are often large and do not meet the size requirements for small cells. In this work, we present a simple method for fabricating stable 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;reference electrodes. The prints are made from polyvinylidene fluoride, which is chemically inert in strong acids, bases, and commonly used non&#8208;aqueous solvents. We chose six different reference systems based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na, including three aqueous and three non&#8208;aqueous systems to demonstrate the versatility of the approach. Subsequently, we conducted cyclic voltammetry experiments and measured the potential difference between the aqueous home&#8208;made reference electrodes and a commercial Ag/AgCl&#8208;electrode.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While numerous reference electrodes suitable for aqueous electrolytes exist, there is no well-defined standard for non-aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, reference electrodes are often large and do not meet the size requirements for small cells. In this work, we present a simple method for fabricating stable 3D-printed micro-reference electrodes. The prints are made from polyvinylidene fluoride, which is chemically inert in strong acids, bases, and commonly used non-aqueous solvents. We chose six different reference systems based on Ag, Cu, Zn, and Na, including three aqueous and three non-aqueous systems to demonstrate the versatility of the approach. Subsequently, we conducted cyclic voltammetry experiments and measured the potential difference between the aqueous home-made reference electrodes and a commercial Ag/AgCl-electrode. For the non-aqueous reference electrodes, we chose the ferrocene redox couple as an internal standard. From these measurements, we deduced that this new class of micro-reference electrodes is leak-tight and shows a stable electrode potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte through multispectral characterizations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QPE) composed of Li salts, polymer matrix and solvent, is beneficial for improving the security and energy density of batteries. However, the ionic conduction mechanism, existential form of solvent molecules, and interactions among different components of QPE are still unclear. Here we develop a multispectral characterization strategy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations to unravel aforesaid mysteries. The results indicate that the existential state of solvent in QPE is quite different from that in liquid electrolyte. Partial solvent molecules create the spatial isolation in QPE between polymer matrix and Li salts, while other part of solvent work for dissolving Li salts to form a local high concentration of Li  +  . As a result, the solvation structure and conduction mechanism of Li  +  are similar to those in high&#8208;concentrated liquid electrolyte. This work provides a new insight into the ionic conduction mechanism of QPE and would promote its application for safe and high&#8208;energy batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Lactonization by &#960;&#8208;Acid Catalyzed Allylic Substitution: A Complement to &#960;&#8208;Allylmetal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric allylic alkylation (AAA) is a powerful method for the formation of highly useful, non&#8208;racemic allylic compounds. Here we present a complementary enantioselective process that generates allylic lactones via &#960;&#8208;acid catalysis. More specifically, a catalytic enantioselective dehydrative lactonization of allylic alcohols using a novel Pd(II)&#8208;catalyst containing the imidazole&#8208;based  P,N  &#8208;ligand (  S  )&#8208;StackPhos is reported. The high&#8208;yielding reactions are operationally simple to perform with enantioselectivities up to 99% ee. This strategy facilitates the replacement of a poor leaving group with what would ostensibly be a better leaving group in the product avoiding complications arising from racemization by equilibration.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly&#8208;Efficient Spin&#8208;Filtering Transport in Chiral Hybrid Copper Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) in non&#8208;centrosymmetric chiral structures creates a new platform for spintronics in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems. Chiral Pb(Sn)&#8208;I hybrid perovskites exhibit outstanding spin&#8208;dependent charge transport performance, but the nontoxic lead&#8208;free hybrid materials with high stability are still greatly desired for spin&#8208;filtering applications.

(MBA)  2  CuBr  4  experiences a phase transition from orthorhombic to monoclinic after spin&#8208;coating and annealing during the thin film preparation, while (MBA)  2  CuCl  4  keeps invariant monoclinic structure. Despite similar structural and electronic features, (  R/S  &#8208;MBA)  2  CuBr  4  shows much smaller chiroptical activity than the chloride counterpart. Magnetic&#8208;conductive atomic force microscopy measurements display a typical spin&#8208;filtering transport property with high efficiency up to 90% for both copper halides. Our work expands spin&#8208;polarized charge transport in eco&#8208;friendly and stable metal&#8208;organic halides, which is promising to be applied in spintronics based on transition&#8208;metal hybrid systems.</dc:description>

         <title>18.77% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Promoted by Aqueous Solution Processed Cobalt(II) Acetate Hole Transporting Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust hole transporting layer (HTL), using the cost&#8208;effective Cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O) as the precursor, was simply processed from its aqueous solution followed by thermal annealing (TA) and UV&#8208;ozone (UVO) treatments. The TA treatment induced the loss of crystal water followed by oxidization of Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O precursor, which increased the work function. However, TA treatment differently realize a high work function and ideal morphology for charge extraction. The resulting problems could be circumvented easily by additional UVO treatment, which also enhanced the conductivity and lowered the resistance for charge transport. The optimal condition was found to be a low temperature TA (150  o  C) followed by simple UVO, where the crystal water in Co(OAc)  2  &#183;4H  2  O was removed fully and the HTL surface was anchored by substantial hydroxy groups. Using PM6 as the polymer donor and L8&#8208;BO as the electron acceptor, a record high PCE of 18.77% was achieved, higher than the common PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based solar cell devices (18.02%).</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution of Molecularly Imprinted Enzyme Inhibitors: From Simple Activity Inhibition to Pathological Cell Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular imprinting represents one of the most promising strategies to design artificial enzyme inhibitors. However, the study of molecularly imprinted enzyme inhibitors (MIEIs) remains at a primary stage. Advanced applications of MIEIs for cell regulation have rarely been explored. Using a solid&#8208;phase oriented imprinting strategy so as to leave the active site of the enzymes accessible, we synthesized two MIEIs which exhibit high specificity and potent inhibitory effects (inhibition constant at low nM range) towards trypsin and angiogenin. The trypsin MIEI inhibits trypsin activity, tryptic digestion&#8208;induced extracellular matrix lysis and cell membrane destruction, indicating its utility in the treatment of active trypsin&#8208;dependent cell injury. The angiogenin MIEI blocks cancer cell proliferation by suppressing the ribonuclease activity of angiogenin and decreasing angiogenin level inside and outside HeLa cells. Our work demonstrates the versatility of MIEIs for both enzyme inhibition and cell fate manipulation, showing their great potential as therapeutic drugs in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Inside a Shell &#8211; Organometallic Catalysis Inside Encapsulin Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compartmentalization of chemical reactions inside cells are a fundamental requirement for life. Encapsulins are self&#8208;assembling protein&#8208;based nanocompartments from the prokaryotic repertoire that present a highly attractive platform for intracellular compartmentalization of chemical reactions by design. Using smFRET and 3D&#8208;MINFLUX analysis, we analyze fluorescently&#8208;labeled encapsulins on a single molecule basis. Furthermore, by equipping these capsules with a synthetic ruthenium catalyst  via  covalent attachment to a non&#8208;native host protein, we are able to perform  in vitro  catalysis and go on to show that engineered encapsulins can be used as hosts for transition metal catalysis inside living cells in confined space.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery and Characterisation of Highly Cooperative FAK&#8208;Degrading PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key mediator of tumour progression and metastasis. To date, clinical trials of FAK inhibitors have reported disappointing efficacy for oncology indications. We report the design and characterisation of GSK215, a potent, selective, FAK&#8208;degrading Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) based on a binder for the VHL E3 ligase and the known FAK inhibitor VS&#8208;4718. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed the molecular basis of the highly cooperative FAK&#8208;GSK215&#8208;VHL ternary complex, and GSK215 showed differentiated in vitro pharmacology compared to VS&#8208;4718. In mice, a single dose of GSK215 induced rapid and prolonged FAK degradation, giving a long&#8208;lasting effect on FAK levels (~96 h) and a marked PK/PD disconnect. This tool PROTAC molecule is expected to be useful for the study of FAK degradation biology in vivo, and our results indicate that FAK degradation may be a differentiated clinical strategy versus FAK inhibition for the treatment of cancer.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Dithiane/Iodofluorobenzene Mixtures: A New Class of Hydrophobic Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While research into deep eutectic solvents (DESs) has expanded over the previous two decades, the focus has remained on the utilization of hydrogen bond donors in these systems. Additionally, the majority of the known DESs rely on at least one ionic component. Through the combination of 1,3&#8208;dithiane and 1,2&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzene (1,2&#8208;F4DIB), we report the first known DES based on halogen bonding. This mixture remains a liquid, with a eutectic melting temperature of 13.7&#176;C over a range of 1,3&#8208;dithiane mole fraction (0.35 to 0.75). Additionally, cocrystals of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;dithiane with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, and 1,4&#8208;F4DIB, as well as 1,3,5&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triiodobenzene were studied via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. These data reveal a wide range of halogen bonding strengths (0.85 &lt; RXB &lt; 0.99; Rxb = normalized halogen bond distance parameter) and geometries about the sulfur atom. By including intermolecular interactions beyond hydrogen bonding, the scope of possible DES systems can be greatly expanded.</dc:description>
