         <title>Ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;based Small Molecular Donor with Multiple Conformation Locks for Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.3%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ternary organic solar cells (T&#8208;OSCs) represent an efficient strategy for enhancing the performance of OSCs. Presently, the majority of high&#8208;performance T&#8208;OSCs incorporates well&#8208;established Y&#8208;acceptors or donor polymers as the third component. In this study, a novel class of conjugated small molecules has been introduced as the third component, demonstrating exceptional photovoltaic performance in T&#8208;OSCs. This innovative molecule comprises ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) bridge and 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine as the end group, with the EDOT unit facilitating the creation of multiple conformation locks. Consequently, the EDOT&#8208;based molecule exhibits two&#8208;dimensional charge transport, distinguishing it from the thiophene&#8208;bridged small molecule, which displays fewer conformation locks and provides one&#8208;dimensional charge transport. Furthermore, the robust electron&#8208;donating nature of EDOT imparts the small molecule with cascade energy levels relative to the electron donor and acceptor. As a result, OSCs incorporating the EDOT&#8208;based small molecule as the third component demonstrate enhanced mobilities, yielding a remarkable efficiency of 19.3%, surpassing the efficiency of 18.7% observed for OSCs incorporating thiophene&#8208;based small molecule as the third component. The investigations in this study underscore the excellence of EDOT as a building block for constructing conjugated materials with multiple conformation locks and high charge carrier mobilities, thereby contributing to elevated photovoltaic performance in OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering for Modulating Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have recently shown great potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Currently almost all reports are focused on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) COFs, while the 3D counterparts are rarely explored due to their non&#8208;conjugated frameworks derived from the sp3 carbon based tetrahedral building blocks. Here, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of fully conjugated 3D COFs by using the saddle&#8208;shaped cyclooctatetrathiophene derivative as the building block. Through molecular engineering strategies, we thoroughly discussed the influences of key factors including the donor&#8208;acceptor structure, hydrophilicity, specific surface areas, as well as the conjugated/non&#8208;conjugated structures on their photocatalytic hydrogen evolution properties. The as&#8208;synthesized fully conjugated 3D COFs could generate the hydrogen up to 40.36 mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1. This is the first report on intrinsic metal&#8208;free 3D COFs in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution application. Our work provides insight on the structure design of 3D COFs for highly&#8208;efficient photocatalysis, and also reveals that the semiconducting fully conjugated 3D COFs could be a useful platform in clear energy&#8208;related fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Umbrella&#8208;Shaped Amphiphiles: Internal Alkylation of an Aromatic Micelle and Its Impact on Cavity Features</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To develop new hybrid micelles with alkyl/polyaromatic core&#8208;shell structures, we synthesized umbrella&#8208;shaped amphiphiles bearing a bent anthracene dimer with a linear alkyl chain (i.e., octyl and hexadecyl groups). The amphiphiles quantitatively assemble into spherical micelles (~2&#8208;3 nm in core diameter), possessing an alkylated cavity surrounded by a polyaromatic framework, in water. The alkylation significantly enhances the stability of the micellar structures against dilution (up to 9 &#956;M) and heat (up to &gt;120 &#186;C). The highly condensed hexadecyl core of the hybrid micelle, as indicated by solvatochromic guest probes, displays increased uptake ability toward large alkylated metallodyes. Interestingly, efficient uptake of aromatic macrocycles (i.e., [n]cycloparaphenylenes) by the present micelle provides pseudorotaxane&#8208;shaped host&#8208;guest composites with high emissivity (&#1060;F&#160;= up to 35%). Internal multi&#8208;alkylation of an aromatic micelle can thus successfully enhance its assembly stability/guest uptake functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Large&#8208;area Multi&#8208;stimulus Responsive Thin Films via Interfacially Confined Irreversible Katritzky Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabrication of large&#8208;area thin films through irreversible reactions remains a formidable task. This study reports a breakthrough strategy for in situ synthesis of large&#8208;area, free&#8208;standing, robust and multi&#8208;stimulus responsive thin films through a catalyst&#8208;free and irreversible Katritzky reaction&#160;at a liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The as resulted films are featured with adjustable thickness of 1&#8211;3 &#956;m and an area up to 50 cm&#178;. The thin films exhibit fast photo&#8208;mechanical motions (a response time of ca 0.1 s), vapor&#8208;mechanical motions, as well as photo&#8208;chromic and solvato&#8208;chromic behaviors. It was revealed that the reason behind the observable motions is proton transfer from the imine groups to the carbonyl structures within the film induced by photo&#8208; and/or dimethyl sulfoxide&#8208;stimulus. In addition, the films can harvest anionic radicals and the radicals as captured can be efficiently degraded under UV light illumination. This study provides a new strategy for fabricating smart thin films via interfacially confined irreversible Katritzky reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking Highly Ordered PtPbBi Intermetallic with Disordered Amorphous Phase for Boosting Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Alcohol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing amorphous/intermetallic (A/IMC) heterophase structures by breaking the highly ordered IMC phase with disordered amorphous phase is an effective way to improve the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal&#8208;based IMC electrocatalysts because of the optimized electronic structure and abundant heterophase boundaries as active sites. In this study, we report the synthesis of ultrathin A/IMC PtPbBi nanosheets (NSs) for boosting hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alcohol oxidation reactions. The resulting A/IMC PtPbBi NSs exhibit a remarkably low overpotential of only 25 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for the HER in an acidic electrolyte, together with outstanding stability for 100 h. In addition, the PtPbBi NSs show high mass activities for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), which are 13.2 and 14.5 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of amorphous/intermetallic components and multimetallic composition facilitate the electron transfer from the catalyst to key intermediates, thus improving the catalytic activity of MOR. This work establishes a novel pathway for the synthesis of heterophase two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with high electrocatalytic performance across a wide range of electrochemical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching Reagent for Super&#8208;resolution Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has revolutionized optical microscopy by exceeding the diffraction limit and revealing previously unattainable nanoscale details of cellular structures and molecular dynamics. This super&#8208;resolution imaging capability relies on fluorophore photoswitching, which is crucial for optimizing the imaging conditions and accurately determining the fluorophore positions. To understand the general on and off photoswitching mechanisms of single dye molecules, various photoswitching reagents were evaluated. Systematic measurement of the single&#8208;molecule&#8208;level fluorescence on and off rates (kon and koff) in the presence of various photoswitching reagents and theoretical calculation of the structure of the photoswitching reagent&#8208;fluorophore pair indicated that the switch&#8208;off mechanism is mainly determined by the nucleophilicity of the photoswitching reagent, and the switch&#8208;on mechanism is a two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced dissociation process, which is related to the power of the illuminating laser and bond dissociation energy of this pair. This study contributes to a broader understanding of the molecular photoswitching mechanism in SMLM imaging and provides a basis for designing improved photoswitching reagents with potential applications extending to materials science and chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics by Coupling Photocatalysis for High&#8208;Performance Photo&#8208;Assisted Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Challenges such as shuttle effect have hindered the commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs), despite their potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage devices. To address these issues, we explore the integration of solar energy into LSBs, creating a photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (PA&#8208;LSB). The PA&#8208;LSB provides a novel and sustainable solution by coupling the photocatalytic effect to accelerate sulfur redox reactions. Herein, a perovskite quantum dot&#8208;loaded MOF material serves as a cathode for the PA&#8208;LSB, creating built&#8208;in electric fields at the micro&#8208;interface to extend the lifetime of photo&#8208;generated charge carriers. The band structure of the composite material aligns well with the electrochemical reaction potential of lithium&#8208;sulfur, enabling precise regulation of polysulfides in the cathode of the PA&#8208;LSB system. This is attributed to the selective catalysis of the liquid&#8208;solid reaction stage in the lithium&#8208;sulfur electrochemical process by photocatalysis. These contribute to the outstanding performance of PA&#8208;LSBs, particularly demonstrating a remarkably high reversible capacity of 679 mAh g&#8208;1 at 5 C, maintaining stable cycling for 1500 cycles with the capacity decay rate of 0.022% per cycle. Additionally, the photo&#8208;charging capability of the PA&#8208;LSB holds the potential to compensate for non&#8208;electric energy losses during the energy storage process, contributing to the development of lossless energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Alveoli&#8208;Inspired Carbon Cathodes with Interconnected Porous Structure and Asymmetric Coordinated Vanadium Sites for Superior Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Accelerating sulfur conversion catalysis to alleviate the shuttle effect has become a novel paradigm for effective Li&#8208;S batteries. Although nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single&#8208;atom (M&#8208;N4) catalysts have been investigated, further optimizing its utilization rate and catalytic activities is urgently needed for practical applications. Inspired by the natural alveoli tissue with interconnected structure and well&#8208;distributed enzyme catalytic sites on the wall for the simultaneously fast diffusion and in&#8208;situ catalytic conversion of substrates, here, we proposed the controllable synthesis of bioinspired carbon cathode with interconnected porous structure and asymmetric coordinated V&#8208;S1N3 sites for efficient and stable Li&#8208;S batteries. The enzyme&#8208;mimetic V&#8208;S1N3 shows asymmetric electronic distribution and high tunability, therefore enhancing in&#8208;situ polysulfide conversion activities. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the high charge asymmetry degree and large atom radius of S in V&#8208;S1N3 result in sloping adsorption for polysulfide, thereby exhibiting low thermodynamic energy barriers and long&#8208;range stability (0.076% decay over 600 cycles).</dc:description>

         <title>Development of an FeII Complex Exhibiting Intermolecular Proton Shifting Coupled Spin Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we investigated reversible intermolecular proton shifting (IPS) coupled with spin transition (ST) in a novel FeII complex. The host FeII complex and the guest carboxylic acid anion were connected by intermolecular hydrogen bonds (IHBs). We extended the intramolecular proton transfer coupled ST phenomenon to the intermolecular system. The dynamic phenomenon was confirmed by variable&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron crystallography, and infrared spectroscopy. The mechanism of IPS was further validated using density functional theory calculations. The discovery of IPS&#8208;coupled ST in crystalline molecular materials provides good insights into fundamental processes and promotes the design of novel multifunctional materials with tunable properties for various applications, such as optoelectronics, information storage, and molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Ionic Liquid&#8208;based Molecule Drives Strong Adhesives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature has inspired scientists to fabricate adhesive materials for applications in many burgeoning areas. However, it is still a significant challenge to develop small&#8208;molecule adhesives with high&#8208;strength, low&#8208;temperature and recyclable properties, although these merits are of great interest in various aspects. Herein, we report a series of strong adhesives based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight molecular solids driven by the terminal modification of ionic liquids (ILs) and subsequent supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The emergence of high strength and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for these supramolecular aggregates relies on modifying IL with a high melting point motif and enriching the types of noncovalent interactions in the original ILs. Using this strategy, we demonstrate that our IL&#8208;based molecular solids can efficiently obtain a high adhesion strength (up to 8.95 MPa). Importantly, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the reversible and strong adhesion enabled by monomer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer transitions. These fundamental findings provide guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance supramolecular adhesive materials..</dc:description>

         <title>Indocyanine Green&#8208;based Nanoprobe for In Vivo Detection of Cellular Senescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is an urgent need to improve conventional cancer&#8208;treatments by preventing detrimental side effects, cancer recurrence and metastases. Recent studies have shown that presence of senescent cells in tissues treated with chemo&#8208; or radiotherapy can be used to predict the effectiveness of cancer treatment. However, although the accumulation of senescent cells is one of the hallmarks of cancer, surprisingly little progress has been made in development of strategies for their detection in vivo. To address a lack of detection tools, we developed a biocompatible, injectable organic nanoprobe (NanoJagg), which is selectively taken up by senescent cells and accumulates in the lysosomes. The NanoJagg probe is obtained by self&#8208;assembly of indocyanine green (ICG) dimers using a scalable manufacturing process and characterized by a unique spectral signature suitable for both photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and fluorescence imaging. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies all indicate that NanoJaggs are a clinically translatable probe for detection of senescence and their PAT signal makes them suitable for longitudinal monitoring of the senescence burden in solid tumors after chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinyl&#8208;Group&#8208;Anchored Covalent Organic Framework for Promoting the Photocatalytic Generation of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vinyl&#8208;anchored covalent organic frameworks were designed to enhance interlayer forces, broaden the light&#8208;absorption range, and improve charge&#8208;separation and &#8208;transfer efficiency. This strategy promotes the photocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction to produce hydrogen peroxide.







Abstract
The artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen using semiconductor photocatalysts is attracting increasing levels of attention owing to its green, environmentally friendly, and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising materials for promoting photocatalytic H2O2 production owing to their structural and functional diversity, they typically suffer from low charge&#8208;generation and &#8208;transfer efficiencies as well as rapid charge recombination, which restricts their use as catalysts for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Herein, we report a strategy for anchoring vinyl moieties to a COF skeleton to facilitate charge separation and migration, thereby promoting photocatalytic H2O2 generation. This vinyl&#8208;group&#8208;bearing COF photocatalyst exhibits a H2O2&#8208;production rate of 84.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1 (per 10&#8197;mg), which is ten&#8208;times higher than that of the analog devoid of vinyl functionality and superior to most reported COF photocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical studies provide deep insight into the origin of the improved photocatalytic performance. These findings are expected to facilitate the rational design and modification of organic semiconductors for use in photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Completely Non&#8208;Fused Low&#8208;Cost Acceptor Enables Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 17&#8201;% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By successive changes in molecular configuration and branching position of alkoxy side chains, we designed and synthesized a completely non&#8208;fused acceptor, TBT&#8208;26, with a narrow band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV and excellent stability. TBT&#8208;26 has a significantly low raw material cost of about 12&#8197;$/g. The TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based device gives outstanding power conversion efficiency of 17.0&#8201;% for small area device and 14.3&#8201;% for large area module with an area of 28.8&#8197;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
To meet the industrial requirements of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, it is imperative to accelerate the development of cost&#8208;effective materials. Thiophene&#8208;benzene&#8208;thiophene central unit&#8208;based acceptors possess the advantage of low synthetic cost, while their power conversion efficiency (PCE) is relatively low. Here, by incorporating a para&#8208;substituted benzene unit and 1st&#8208;position branched alkoxy chains with large steric hindrance, a completely non&#8208;fused non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, TBT&#8208;26, was designed and synthesized. The narrow band gap of 1.38&#8197;eV ensures the effective utilization of sunlight. The favorable phase separation morphology of TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based blend film facilitates the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport in corresponding OPV cell. Therefore, the TBT&#8208;26&#8208;based small&#8208;area cell achieves an impressive PCE of 17.0&#8201;%, which is the highest value of completely non&#8208;fused OPV cells. Additionally, we successfully demonstrated the scalability of this design by fabricating a 28.8&#8197;cm2 module with a high PCE of 14.3&#8201;%. Overall, our work provides a practical molecular design strategy for developing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost acceptors, paving the way for industrial applications of OPV technology.

         <title>Na2C3O2: The First Crystalline Compound with the Elusive &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double deprotonation of propiolic acid yielded the &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; anion, which coordinates to the sodium cation in crystalline Na2C3O2 both via its carboxylate group and via its acetylide unit in a Janus&#8208;faced manner.







Abstract
By reaction of sodium electride or NaC2H with the anhydrous sodium salt of propiolic acid, Na(OOC&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;H), in liquid ammonia crystalline powders of Na2C3O2 were obtained. The structure analysis based on synchrotron powder diffraction data revealed that Na2C3O2 crystallizes in a monoclinic unit cell (I2/a, Z=4) exhibiting the elusive Y&#8208;shaped &#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;COO&#8722; anion, which is unprecedented in a crystalline compound up to now. IR/Raman and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopic investigations with assignments supported by DFT&#8208;based ab initio calculations confirm this finding. Reaction with sodium electride led to a higher crystallinity of the product, but additionally a by&#8208;product apparently due to decomposition and polymerization of Na2C3O2 was formed. No such by&#8208;product was observed in the reaction with NaC2H, which turned out to be a milder metalation route. However, the product of the latter reaction is less crystalline.

         <dc:description>
A remarkably simple silver&#8208;enabled strategy to access polysubstituted 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single operation from readily accessible bicyclobutanes and isocyanides has been developed. This novel protocol allows for rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials, and the products can be subjected to diverse downstream transformations, offering opportunities for the exploration of new sp3&#8208;rich chemical space.







Abstract
Synthesis of bicyclic scaffolds has emerged as an important research topic in modern drug development because they can serve as saturated bioisosters to enhance the physicochemical properties and metabolic profiles of drug candidates. Here we report a remarkably simple silver&#8208;enabled strategy to access polysubstituted 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptanes in a single operation from readily accessible bicyclobutanes (BCBs) and isocyanides. The process is proposed to involve a formal (3+3)/(3+2)/retro&#8208;(3+2) cycloaddition sequence. This novel protocol allows for rapid generation of molecular complexity from simple starting materials, and the products can be easily derivatized, further enriching the BCB cycloaddition chemistry and the growing set of valuable sp3&#8208;rich bicyclic building blocks.

         <title>Weakly Coordinating Diluent Modulated Solvation Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel diluent&#8208;participated solvation electrolyte is designed to afford a new path to advanced electrolyte engineering. By introducing the weak solvation diluent to incorporate into the Na+ solvation structure, the electrolyte exhibits improved ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy, excellent oxidation resistance, high safety, and highly robust and conductive EEI films with superior electrochemical performances.







Abstract
Diluents have been extensively employed to overcome the disadvantages of high viscosity and sluggish kinetics of high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, but generally do not change the pristine solvation structure. Herein, a weakly coordinating diluent, hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (HFME), is applied to regulate the coordination of Na+ with diglyme and anion and form a diluent&#8208;participated solvate. This unique solvation structure promotes the accelerated decomposition of anions and diluents, with the construction of robust inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. In addition, the introduction of HFME reduces the desolvation energy of Na+, improves ionic conductivity, strengthens the antioxidant, and enhances the safety of the electrolyte. As a result, the assembled Na||Na symmetric cell achieves a stable cycle of over 1800&#8197;h. The cell of Na||P&#8217;2&#8208;Na0.67MnO2 delivers a high capacity retention of 87.3&#8201;% with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7&#8201;% after 350&#8197;cycles. This work provides valuable insights into solvation chemistry for advanced electrolyte engineering.

         <title>Dimerized Acceptors with Conjugate&#8208;Break Linker Enable Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling connecting sites and halogen substitutions, four dimerized acceptors were designed and synthesized. Thanks to the modification of molecular structure, a champion efficiency of 18.07&#8201;% was achieved in FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid devices. Importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based intrinsically stretchable devices achieved high performance (power conversion efficiency=14.29&#8201;%) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain=18.23&#8201;%).







Abstract
Designing new acceptors is critical for intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) with high efficiency and mechanical robustness. However, nearly all stretchable polymer acceptors exhibit limited efficiency and high&#8208;performance small molecular acceptors are very brittle. In this regard, we select thienylene&#8208;alkane&#8208;thienylene (TAT) as the conjugate&#8208;break linker and synthesize four dimerized acceptors by the regulation of connecting sites and halogen substitutions. It is found that the connecting sites and halogen substitutions considerably impact the overall electronic structures, aggregation behaviors, and charge transport properties. Benefiting from the optimization of the molecular structure, the dimerized acceptor exhibits rational phase separation within the blend films, which significantly facilitates exciton dissociation while effectively suppressing charge recombination processes. Consequently, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based rigid OSCs render the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.07&#8201;% among reported acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linker. Most importantly, FDY&#8208;m&#8208;TAT&#8208;based IS&#8208;OSCs achieve high PCE (14.29&#8201;%) and remarkable stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain [COS]=18.23&#8201;%), significantly surpassing Y6&#8208;based counterpart (PCE=12.80&#8201;% and COS=8.50&#8201;%). To sum up, these findings demonstrate that dimerized acceptors containing conjugate&#8208;break linkers have immense potential in developing highly efficient and mechanically robust OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;By controlling connecting sites and halogen substitutions, four dimerized acceptors were designed and synthesized. Thanks to the modification of molecular structure, a champion efficiency of 18.07&#8201;% was achieved in FDY-m-TAT-based rigid devices. Importantly, FDY-m-TAT-based intrinsically stretchable devices achieved high performance (power conversion efficiency=14.29&#8201;%) and excellent stretchability (crack-onset strain=18.23&#8201;%).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing new acceptors is critical for intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS-OSCs) with high efficiency and mechanical robustness. However, nearly all stretchable polymer acceptors exhibit limited efficiency and high-performance small molecular acceptors are very brittle. In this regard, we select thienylene-alkane-thienylene (TAT) as the conjugate-break linker and synthesize four dimerized acceptors by the regulation of connecting sites and halogen substitutions. It is found that the connecting sites and halogen substitutions considerably impact the overall electronic structures, aggregation behaviors, and charge transport properties. Benefiting from the optimization of the molecular structure, the dimerized acceptor exhibits rational phase separation within the blend films, which significantly facilitates exciton dissociation while effectively suppressing charge recombination processes. Consequently, FDY-m-TAT-based rigid OSCs render the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.07&#8201;% among reported acceptors containing conjugate-break linker. Most importantly, FDY-m-TAT-based IS-OSCs achieve high PCE (14.29&#8201;%) and remarkable stretchability (crack-onset strain [COS]=18.23&#8201;%), significantly surpassing Y6-based counterpart (PCE=12.80&#8201;% and COS=8.50&#8201;%). To sum up, these findings demonstrate that dimerized acceptors containing conjugate-break linkers have immense potential in developing highly efficient and mechanically robust OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks: Linkage Chemistry and Its Critical Role in The Evolution of &#960; Electronic Structures and Functions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of non&#8208;conjugated, partially &#960;&#8208;conjugated, and fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkages was explored to integrate typical &#960; units into 2D polymeric lattices, which led to the creation of 2D layer frameworks. The linkage plays a pivotal role in growing 2D electronic structures and determines electronic functions, unveiling a full picture of linkage chemistry and offering a general yet transformative guidance for designing electronic framework materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a molecular platform for designing a novel class of functional materials with well&#8208;defined structures. A crucial structural parameter is the linkage, which dictates how knot and linker units are connected to form two&#8208;dimensional polymers and layer frameworks, shaping ordered &#960;&#8208;array and porous architectures. However, the roles of linkage in the development of ordered &#960; electronic structures and functions remain fundamental yet unresolved issues. Here we report the designed synthesis of COFs featuring four representative linkages: hydrazone, imine, azine, and C=C bonds, to elucidate their impacts on the evolution of &#960; electronic structures and functions. Our observations revealed that the hydrazone linkage provides a non&#8208;conjugated connection, while imine and azine allow partial &#960; conjugation, and the C=C bond permits full &#960;&#8208;conjugation. Importantly, the linkage profoundly influences the control of &#960; electronic structures and functions, unraveling its pivotal role in determining key electronic properties such as band gap, frontier energy levels, light absorption, luminescence, carrier density and mobility, and magnetic permeability. These findings highlight the significance of linkage chemistry in COFs and offer a general and transformative guidance for designing framework materials to achieve electronic functions.

         <title>A Fast&#8208;Charge Graphite Anode with a Li&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conductive, Electron/Solvent&#8208;Repelling Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of a MoOx&#8722;MoNx (MoON) layer onto the conventional graphite (Gr) surface enables formation of a Li+&#8208;permeable, solvent&#8208;/electron&#8208;repelled anode&#8208;electrolyte interface in a rechargeable Li&#8208;ion battery, which is beneficial for achieving &#8220;kinetically stable&#8221; mass and charge transfer across the interface during fast Li&#8208;ion (de)intercalation and building of a 10&#8208;min&#8208;rechargeable battery with a long cycle life.







Abstract
Graphite has been serving as the key anode material of rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet is difficultly charged within a quarter hour while maintaining stable electrochemistry. In addition to a defective edge structure that prevents fast Li&#8208;ion entry, the high&#8208;rate performance of graphite could be hampered by co&#8208;intercalation and parasitic reduction of solvent molecules at anode/electrolyte interface. Conventional surface modification by pitch&#8208;derived carbon barely isolates the solvent and electrons, and usually lead to inadequate rate capability to meet practical fast&#8208;charge requirements. Here we show that, by applying a MoOx&#8722;MoNx layer onto graphite surface, the interface allows fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion yet blocks solvent access and electron leakage. By regulating interfacial mass and charge transfer, the modified graphite anode delivers a reversible capacity of 340.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000&#8197;cycles at 6&#8197;C, showing promises in building 10&#8208;min&#8208;rechargeable batteries with a long operation life.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of High&#8208;capacity Sulfur Cathodes via In&#8208;situ Polymerization of a Porous Imine&#8208;based Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries, essential for electronics and electric vehicles, predominantly use cathodes made from critical materials like cobalt. Sulfur&#8208;based cathodes, offering a high theoretical capacity of 1675&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 and environmental advantages due to sulfur's abundance and lower toxicity, present a more sustainable alternative. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art sulfur&#8208;based electrodes do not reach the theoretical capacities, mainly because conventional electrode production relies on mixing of components into weakly coordinated slurries. Consequently, sulfur's mobility leads to battery degradation &#8211; an effect known as the &#8220;sulfur&#8208;shuttle&#8221;. This study introduces a solution by developing a microporous, covalently&#8208;bonded, imine&#8208;based polymer network grown in&#8208;situ around sulfur particles on the current collector. The polymer network (i) enables selective transport of electrolyte and Li&#8208;ions through pores of defined size, and (ii) acts as a robust host to retain the active component of the electrode (sulfur species). The resulting cathode has superior rate performance from 0.1&#160;C (1360&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1) to 3&#160;C (807&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1). Demonstrating a high&#8208;performance, sustainable sulfur cathode produced via a simple one&#8208;pot process, our research underlines the potential of microporous polymers in addressing sulfur diffusion issues, paving the way for sulfur electrodes as viable alternatives to traditional metal&#8208;based cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>An n&#8208;Type Open&#8208;Shell Conjugated Polymer with High&#8208;Spin Ground&#8208;State and High Intrinsic Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers with a high intrinsic conductivity and high&#8208;spin ground state hold considerable promise for applications in organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, two novel acceptor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;A) conjugated polymers based on a highly electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal benzodifurandione unit have been developed, namely DPP&#8208;BFDO&#8208;Th and DPP&#8208;BFDO. The incorporation of the quinoidal moiety into the polymers backbones enables deeply aligned lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of below &#8722;4.0 eV. Notably, DPP&#8208;BFDO exhibits an exceptionally low LUMO (&#8722;4.63 eV) and a high&#8208;spin ground state characterized by strong diradical characters. Moreover, a self&#8208;doping through intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer is observed for DPP&#8208;BFDO, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. The high carrier concentration in combination with a planar and linear conjugated backbone yields a remarkable electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 1.04 S cm&#8722;1 in the &#8220;undoped&#8221; native form, ranking among the highest values reported for n&#8208;type radical&#8208;based conjugated polymers. When employed as an n&#8208;type thermoelectric material, DPP&#8208;BFDO achieves a power factor of 12.59 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2. Furthermore, upon n&#8208;doping, the &#963; could be improved to 65.68 S cm&#8208;1. This study underscores the great potential of electron&#8208;deficient quinoidal units in constructing dopant&#8208;free n&#8208;type conductive polymers with a high&#8208;spin ground state and exceptional intrinsic conductivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Unified Approach to Deamination and Deoxygenation Through Isonitrile Hydrodecyanation: A Combined Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a general hydrodefunctionalization protocol of alcohols and amines through a common isonitrile intermediate. To cleave the relatively inert C&#8211;NC bond, we leveraged dual hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and photoredox catalysis to generate a nucleophilic boryl radical, which readily forms an imidoyl radical intermediate from the isonitrile. Rapid &#946;&#8208;scission then accomplishes defunctionalization. This method has been applied to the hydrodefunctionalization of both amine and alcohol&#8208;containing pharmaceuticals, natural products, and biomolecules. We extended this approach to the reduction of carbonyls and olefins to their saturated counterparts, as well as the hydrodecyanation of alkyl nitriles. Both experimental and computational studies demonstrate a facile &#946;&#8208;scission of the imidoyl radical, and reconcile differences in reactivity between nitriles and isonitriles within our protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Divalent Titanium via Reductive N&#8208;C Coupling of a TiIV Nitrido with &#960;&#8208;Acids.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitrido&#8208;ate complex [(PN)2Ti(N){&#956;2&#8208;K(OEt2)}]2 (1) reductively couples CO and isocyanides in the presence of DME or cryptand, to form rare, five&#8208;coordinate TiII complexes having a linear cumulene motif, [K(L)][(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E = O, L = Kryptofix222, (2); E = NAd, L = 3 DME, (3); E = NtBu, L = 3 DME, (4); E = NAd, L = Kryptofix222, (5)). Oxidation of 2&#8208;5 with [Fc][OTf] afforded an isostructural TiIII center containing a neutral cumulene [(PN)2Ti(NCE)] (E = O, (6); E = NAd (7), NtBu (8)). Moreover, 1e&#8208; reduction of 6 and 7 in the presence of cryptand cleanly reformed corresponding discrete TiII complexes 2 and 5, which were further characterized by solution magnetization measurements and high&#8208; frequency and &#8208;field EPR (HFEPR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, oxidation of 7 with [Fc*][B(C6F5)4] resulted in a ligand disproportionated TiIV complex having transoid carbodiimides, [(PN)2Ti(NCNAd)2] (9). Comparison of spectroscopic, structural, and computational data for the divalent, trivalent, and tetravalent systems, including their 15N enriched isotopomers demonstrate these cumulenes to decrease in order of backbonding as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV and increasing order of p&#8208;donation as TiII&#8594;TiIII&#8594;TiIV, thus displaying more covalency in TiIII species. Lastly, we show a synthetic cycle whereby complex 1 can deliver an N&#8208;atom to &#960;&#8208;acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Unprecedented POSS&#8208;linked 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks with scu or sqc Topology Regulated by Porphyrin Center for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of porphyrin center regulated three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks with 2&#8208;fold interpenetrated scu or sqc topology have been investigated. These COFs exhibit unique structural features and properties, making them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications in CO2 reduction and artemisinin synthesis. The porphyrin center serves as an anchor for metal ions, allowing precise control over structures and functions of the frameworks. Furthermore, the metal coordination within the framework imparts desirable catalytic properties, enabling their potential use in photocatalytic reactions. Overall, these porphyrin center regulated metal&#8208;controlled COFs offer exciting opportunities for the development of advanced materials with tailored functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer Enabled Catalytic Enantioselective Coupling to Chiral Trifluoromethylated Alkynes via Dual Nickel and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With halogen&#8208;atom transfer as an effective tool, a novel catalytic enantioselective protocol to generate chiral trifluoromethylated alkynes has been established by a cooperative photoredox and nickel catalysis system, providing a straightforward and modular route to access this type of product in good yields and enantioselectivities. The halogen&#8208;atom transfer process is essential for the reaction and this novel strategy offers another promising way to utilize alkyl halides with highly negative reduction potentials. It firstly expands nickel&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reductive cross&#8208;couplings of organohalides from the traditional single&#8208;electron transfer to halogen&#8208;atom transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>An Expedient Radical Approach for the Decarboxylative Synthesis of Stereodefined All&#8208;Carbon Tetrasubstituted Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a user&#8208;friendly approach for the decarboxylative formation of stereodefined and complex tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted olefins from vinyl cyclic carbonates and amines as radical precursors. The protocol relies on easy photo&#8208;initiated &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;radical formation followed by addition onto the double bond of the substrate resulting in a sequence involving carbonate ring&#8208;opening, double bond relay, CO2 extrusion and finally O&#8208;protonation. The developed protocol is efficient for both mismatched and matched polarity substrate combinations, and the scope of elaborate stereodefined olefins that can be forged including drug&#8208;functionalized derivatives is wide, diverse and further extendable to other types of heterocyclic and radical precursors. Mechanistic control reactions show that the decarboxylation step is a key driving force towards product formation, with the initial radical addition under steric control.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Inward Isomerization Hydroaminocarbonylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the kinetically favored outward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes, the disfavored inward isomerization&#8208;hydrocarbonylation of alkenes remains an important challenge. Herein, we have developed a novel and effective palladium&#8208;catalyzed inward isomerization&#8208;hydroaminocarbonylation of unactivated alkenes and aniline hydrochlorides for the formation of synthetically valuable &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic amides in high yields and high site&#8208;selectivities. The high efficiency of the reaction is attributed to a relay catalysis strategy, in which the Markovnikov&#8208;favored [PdH]&#8208;PtBu3 catalyst is responsible for inward isomerization, while the [PdH]&#8208;Ruphos catalyst is responsible for hydroaminocarbonylation of the resulting conjugated aryl alkenes. The reaction exhibits highly functional group tolerance and provides a new method for formal carbonylation of remote C(sp3)&#8208;H bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Pivotal Role of dx2&#8208;y2&#160;Electronic States in Nickel&#8208;based Hydroxide Electrocatalysts for&#160;Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) plays a crucial role in coupling with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enables the sustainable production of the high&#8208;valued formate. Nickel&#8208;based hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as MOR electrocatalyst has attracted enormous attention. However, the key factor determining the intrinsic catalytic activity remains unknown, which significantly hinders the further development of Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst. Here, we found that the dx2&#8208;y2&#160;electronic state within antibonding bands plays a decisive role in the whole MOR process. The onset potential depends on the deprotonation ability (Ni2+ to Ni3+), which was closely related to the band center of dx2&#8208;y2&#160;orbital. The closer of&#160;dx2&#8208;y2 orbital to the Fermi level showed the stronger the deprotonation ability. Meanwhile, in the high potential region, the broadening of dx2&#8208;y2&#160;orbital would facilitate the electron transfer from methanol to catalysts (Ni3+ to Ni2+), further enhancing the catalytic properties. Our work for the first time clarifies the intrinsic relationship between dx2&#8208;y2&#160;electronic state and the MOR activities, which adds a new layer of understanding to the methanol electrooxidation research scene.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanically Adaptive Polymers Constructed from Dynamic Coordination Equilibria</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel strategy with reversible coordination equilibria for fabricating rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsive mechanically adaptive materials. Based on dynamic coordination interactions, the developed polymers demonstrate excellent energy dissipation, damping, self&#8208;healing and 3D printing properties, providing potential applications in durable and customizable impact protection fields.







Abstract
Designing materials capable of adapting their mechanical properties in response to external stimuli is the key to preventing failure and extending their service life. However, existing mechanically adaptive polymers are hindered by limitations such as inadequate load&#8208;bearing capacity, difficulty in achieving reversible changes, high cost, and a lack of multiple responsiveness. Herein, we address these challenges using dynamic coordination bonds. A new type of mechanically adaptive material with both rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;responsiveness was developed. Owing to the stimuli&#8208;responsiveness of the coordination equilibria, the prepared polymers, PBMBD&#8208;Fe and PBMBD&#8208;Co, exhibit mechanically adaptive properties, including temperature&#8208;sensitive strength modulation and rate&#8208;dependent impact hardening. Benefitting from the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, the polymers exhibited impressive energy dissipation, damping capacity (loss factors of 1.15 and 2.09 at 1.0&#8197;Hz), self&#8208;healing, and 3D printing abilities, offering durable and customizable impact resistance and protective performance. The development of impact&#8208;resistant materials with comprehensive properties has potential applications in the sustainable and intelligent protection fields.

         <title>(111) Facet&#8208;oriented Cu2Mg Intermetallic Compound with Cu3&#8208;Mg Sites for CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with Industrial Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The (111) facet&#8208;oriented Cu2Mg intermetallic compound with high&#8208;density ordered Cu3&#8208;Mg sites can stabilize oxygen&#8208;containing ethanol intermediates (*CHCHOH) at adjacent Cu catalytic sites during CO2 electroreduction, thus promoting the ethanol production with high selectivity.







Abstract
The efficient ethanol electrosynthesis from CO2 is challenging with low selectivity at high CO2 electrolysis rates, due to the competition with H2 and other reduction products. Copper&#8208;based bimetallic electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion, but the secondary metal has mainly been focused on active components (such as Ag, Sn) for CO2 electroreduction, which also promote selectivity of ethylene or other reduction products rather than ethanol. Limited attention has been given to alkali&#8208;earth metals due to their inherently active chemical property. Herein, we rationally synthesized a (111) facet&#8208;oriented nano Cu2Mg (designated as Cu2Mg(111)) intermetallic compound with high&#8208;density ordered Cu3&#8208;Mg sites. The in situ Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculations revealed that the Cu3&#8722;
&#8722;&#8208;Mg&#8722;
+ active sites allowed to increase *CO surface coverage, decrease reaction energy for *CO&#8722;CO coupling, and stabilize *CHCHOH intermediates, thus promoting the ethanol formation pathway. The Cu2Mg(111) catalyst exhibited a high FEC2H5OH of 76.2&#177;4.8&#8201;% at 600&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, and a peak value of |jC2H5OH| of 720&#177;34&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2, almost 4 times of that using conventional Cu2Mg with (311) facets, comparable to the best reported values for the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electroreduction.

         <title>Colloidal Zeta Potential Modulation as a Handle to Control the Crystallization Kinetics of Tin Halide Perovskites for Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We provided a new method for accurately controlling the nucleation kinetics of tin halide perovskite films through modulating zeta potential of tin halide perovskite colloids. A fast nucleation rate was achieved by adding 3&#8208;aminopyrrolidine dihydroiodate (APDI2) in the precursor solution to change the zeta potential of the FASnI3 colloids. The high&#8208;quality tin halide perovskite film with APDI2 yields a high photovoltaic efficiency of 15.13&#8201;%.







Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (THPs) have demonstrated exceptional potential for various applications owing to their low toxicity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the crystallization kinetics of THPs are less controllable than its lead counterpart because of the higher Lewis acidity of Sn2+, leading to THP films with poor morphology and rampant defects. Here, a colloidal zeta potential modulation approach is developed to improve the crystallization kinetics of THP films inspired by the classical Derjaguin&#8208;Landau&#8208;Verwey&#8208;Overbeek (DLVO) theory. After adding 3&#8208;aminopyrrolidine dihydro iodate (APDI2) in the precursor solution to change the zeta potential of the pristine colloids, the total interaction potential energy between colloidal particles with APDI2 could be controllably reduced, resulting in a higher coagulation probability and a lower critical nuclei concentration. In situ laser light scattering measurements confirmed the increased nucleation rate of the THP colloids with APDI2. The resulting film with APDI2 shows a pinhole&#8208;free morphology with fewer defects, achieving an impressive efficiency of 15.13&#8201;%.

         <title>Discovery of Selective and Potent ATR Degrader for Exploration its Kinase&#8208;Independent Functions in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the present work, a selective and potent ATR degrader was identified which was used as probe for explore the kinase&#8208;independent function of ATR. The results showed that ATR kinase inhibitor induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited the growth of AML&#8197;cells. The ATR degrader was inclined to trigger immediate apoptosis in AML&#8197;cells. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that ATR deletion induced nuclear envelope rupture, leading to genome instability, irreparable DNA damage. It causes to upregulate the level of p53 and subsequently triggers p53&#8208;mediated cell apoptosis.







Abstract
ATR has emerged as a promising target for anti&#8208;cancer drug development. Several potent ATR inhibitors are currently undergoing various stages of clinical trials, but none have yet received FDA approval due to unclear regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we discovered a potent and selective ATR degrader. Its kinase&#8208;independent regulatory functions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were elucidated using this proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule as a probe. The ATR degrader, 8&#8201;i, exhibited significantly different cellular phenotypes compared to the ATR kinase inhibitor 1. Mechanistic studies revealed that ATR deletion led to breakdown in the nuclear envelope, causing genome instability and extensive DNA damage. This would increase the expression of p53 and triggered immediately p53&#8208;mediated apoptosis signaling pathway, which was earlier and more effective than ATR kinase inhibition. Based on these findings, the in vivo anti&#8208;proliferative effects of ATR degrader 8&#8201;i were assessed using xenograft models. The degrader significantly inhibited the growth of AML&#8197;cells in vivo, unlike the ATR inhibitor. These results suggest that the marked anti&#8208;AML activity is regulated by the kinase&#8208;independent functions of the ATR protein. Consequently, developing potent and selective ATR degraders could be a promising strategy for treating AML.

         <title>Direct Activation of Nucleobases with Small Molecules for the Conditional Control of Antisense Function</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of azidomethylene (Azm)&#8208;caged nucleobases into morpholino oligonucleotides via solid phase synthesis, enabled by the unique compatibility of azides with P(V) chemistry, allowed for conditional control of antisense function. The developed Azm&#8208;caged MOs (azMOs) were readily activated by a small molecule phosphine trigger through a Staudinger reduction and exhibited robust knockdown of exogenous and endogenous genes in cells and aquatic embryos. Furthermore, orthogonal knockdown of two genes in zebrafish embryos were enabled through use of azMO in combination with a photoactivatable MO.







Abstract
Conditionally controlled antisense oligonucleotides provide precise interrogation of gene function at different developmental stages in animal models. Only one example of small molecule&#8208;induced activation of antisense function exist. This has been restricted to cyclic caged morpholinos that, based on sequence, can have significant background activity in the absence of the trigger. Here, we provide a new approach using azido&#8208;caged nucleobases that are site&#8208;specifically introduced into antisense morpholinos. The caging group design is a simple azidomethylene (Azm) group that, despite its very small size, efficiently blocks Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing in a programmable fashion. Furthermore, it undergoes facile decaging via Staudinger reduction when exposed to a small molecule phosphine, generating the native antisense oligonucleotide under conditions compatible with biological environments. We demonstrated small molecule&#8208;induced gene knockdown in mammalian cells, zebrafish embryos, and frog embryos. We validated the general applicability of this approach by targeting three different genes.

         <title>Organic Fluorophores with Large Stokes Shift for the Visualization of Rapid Protein and Nucleic Acid Assays</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By assembling organic modules like building blocks, we explored design strategies for large Stokes shift fluorophores. A series of wavelength&#8208;tunable fluorophores have been synthesized, which exhibit large Stokes shift and satisfactory brightness. Furthermore, these dyes were applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, direct visualization of protein assays with 100&#8208;fold sensitivity improvement over colloidal gold based LFA was achieved.







Abstract
Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores, characterized by flexible chemical structure and adjustable optical performance, have shown tremendous potential in biosensing. However, classical organic fluorophore motifs feature large overlap between excitation and emission spectra, leading to the requirement of advanced optical set up to filter desired signal, which limits their application in scenarios with simple settings. Here, a series of wavelength&#8208;tunable small&#8208;molecule fluorescent dyes (PTs) bearing simple organic moieties have been developed, which exhibit Stokes shift up to 262&#8197;nm, molar extinction coefficients ranged 30,000&#8211;100,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, with quantum yields up to 54.8&#8201;%. Furthermore, these dyes were formulated into fluorescent nanoparticles (PT&#8208;NPs), and applied in lateral flow assay (LFA). Consequently, limit of detection for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein reached 20&#8197;fM with naked eye, a 100&#8208;fold improvement in sensitivity compared to the pM detection level for colloidal gold&#8208;based LFA. Besides, combined with loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the LFA system achieved the visualization of single copy level nucleic acid detection for monkeypox (Mpox).

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Driven Evolution of Adaptive Artificial Ion Channels or Nanopores with Specific Anticancer Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We constructed a novel class of artificial channels, showing an intriguing adaptive ability to form chloride ion channels at low concentrations while transforming into nanopores at high concentrations. The triphenylphosphonium (TPP) groups endow the channel&#8208;forming units with mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties, enabling them to drill holes on the mitochondrial membrane which subsequently induce targeted apoptosis of cancer cells.







Abstract
In nature, ceramides are a class of sphingolipids possessing a unique ability to self&#8208;assemble into protein&#8208;permeable channels with intriguing concentration&#8208;dependent adaptive channel cavities. However, within the realm of artificial ion channels, this interesting phenomenon is scarcely represented. Herein, we report on a novel class of adaptive artificial channels, Pn&#8208;TPPs, based on PEGylated cholic acids bearing triphenylphosphonium (TPP) groups as anion binding motifs. Interestingly, the molecules self&#8208;assemble into chloride ion channels at low concentrations while transforming into small molecule&#8208;permeable nanopores at high concentrations. Moreover, the TPP groups endow the molecules with mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties, enabling them to selectively drill holes on the mitochondrial membrane of cancer cells and subsequently trigger the caspase&#8197;9 apoptotic pathway. The anticancer efficacies of Pn&#8208;TPPs correlate with their abilities to form nanopores. Significantly, the most active ensembles formed by P5&#8208;TPP exhibits impressive anticancer activity against human liver cancer cells, with an IC50 value of 3.8&#8197;&#956;M. While demonstrating similar anticancer performance to doxorubicin, P5&#8208;TPP exhibits a selectivity index surpassing that of doxorubicin by a factor of 16.8.

         <title>Asymmetric, Remote C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation via Sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merger of hydrogen atom transfer and Sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement enables the asymmetric arylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds in remote position to the double bond under photoredox conditions. Various chiral &#945;&#8208;arylated amides are obtained with up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 er where the sulfinamido groups dictates the stereochemical outcome.







Abstract
An efficient asymmetric remote arylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds under photoredox conditions is described here. The reaction features the addition radicals to a double bond followed by a site&#8208;selective radical translocation (1,n&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer) as well as a stereocontrolled aryl migration via sulfinyl&#8208;Smiles rearrangement furnishing a wide range of chiral &#945;&#8208;arylated amides with up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;er. Mechanistic studies indicate that the sulfinamide group governs the stereochemistry of the product with the aryl migration being the rate determining step preceded by a kinetically favored 1,n&#8208;HAT process.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis for Electrochemical Chlorination and Nitration of Arenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique biphasic electrochemical reaction, wherein tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts play a dual role as both electrolyte and phase transfer catalysts, was developed to furnish chlorination and nitration of aromatic compounds using cheap inorganic salts with up to 98&#8201;% yield, shorter reaction time and higher Faradaic efficiency.







Abstract
A biphasic anodic oxidation method for aromatic halogenation process was developed, where aqueous metal salts were directly used as halogen source. Ammonium salts serve as both electrolytes and phase transfer catalysis to facilitate anion transport and oxidative transformation. This design allows for chlorination or nitration of multiple types of arenes using NaCl or KNO2.

         <title>Synthetic Genes For Dynamic Regulation Of DNA&#8208;Based Receptors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a general strategy that uses synthetic genes encoding for RNA effector strands that, by binding to a synthetic DNA ligand&#8208;binding receptor can induce the release or the loading of a molecular ligand.







Abstract
We present a strategy to control dynamically the loading and release of molecular ligands from synthetic nucleic acid receptors using in vitro transcription. We demonstrate this by engineering three model synthetic DNA&#8208;based receptors: a triplex&#8208;forming DNA complex, an ATP&#8208;binding aptamer, and a hairpin strand, whose ability to bind their specific ligands can be cotranscriptionally regulated (activated or inhibited) through specific RNA molecules produced by rationally designed synthetic genes. The kinetics of our DNA sensors and their genetically generated inputs can be captured using differential equation models, corroborating the predictability of the approach used. This approach shows that highly programmable nucleic acid receptors can be controlled with molecular instructions provided by dynamic transcriptional systems, illustrating their promise in the context of coupling DNA nanotechnology with biological signaling.

         <title>Reconstructing Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Efficient Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed reconstructing connected hydrogen&#8208;bond networks on the spinel surface by coupling hydrophilic units to defuse the trade&#8208;off of free water migration and deprotonation. The designed Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN as a non&#8208;precious OER catalyst demonstrated a low overpotential of 395&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an acidic medium and even surpasses RuO2 activity at high current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ ~538&#8197;mV).







Abstract
Developing highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in acidic conditions is a pressing demand for proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis. Manipulating proton character at the electrified interface, as the crux of all proton&#8208;coupled electrochemical reactions, is highly desirable but elusive. Herein we present a promising protocol, which reconstructs a connected hydrogen&#8208;bond network between the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface by coupling hydrophilic units to boost acidic OER activity. Modelling on N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;layer clothed Mn&#8208;doped&#8208;Co3O4 (Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN), we unravel that the hydrogen&#8208;bond interaction between CN units and H2O molecule not only drags the free water to enrich the surface of Mn&#8722;Co3O4 but also serves as a channel to promote the dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the modulated local charge of the Co sites from CN units/Mn dopant lowers the OER barrier. Therefore, Mn&#8722;Co3O4@CN surpasses RuO2 at high current density (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 @ ~538&#8197;mV).

         <title>Light Enables the Cathodic Interface Reaction Reversibility in Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Granulate&#8208;like discharge products are randomly stacked on solid&#8208;state cathodes (SSCs), facilitating their accommodation and ensuring the effective triple&#8208;phase boundaries (TPBs) of SSLOBs, thereby improving the battery reversibility of light irradiation.







Abstract
Limited triple&#8208;phase boundaries arising from the accumulation of solid discharge product(s) in solid&#8208;state cathodes (SSCs) pose a challenge to high&#8208;property solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;oxygen batteries (SSLOBs). Light&#8208;assisted SSLOBs have been gradually explored as an ingenious system; however, the fundamental mechanisms of the SSCs interface behavior remain unclear. Here, we discovered that light assistance can enhance the fast inner&#8208;sphere charge transfer in SSCs and regulate the discharge products with spherical particles generated via the surface growth model. Moreover, the high photoelectron excitation and transportation capabilities of SSCs can retard cathodic catalytic decay by avoiding structural degradation of the cathode with a reduced charge voltage. The light&#8208;induced SSLOBs exhibited excellent stability (170&#8197;cycles) with a low discharge&#8211;charge polarization overpotential (0.27&#8197;V). Furthermore, transparent SSLOBs with exceptional flexibility, mechanical stability, and multiform shapes were fabricated for theory&#8208;to&#8208;practical applications in sunlight&#8208;induced batteries. Our study opens new opportunities for the introduction of solar energy into energy storage systems.

         <title>Chloride and Hydride Transfer as Keys to Catalytic Upcycling of Polyethylene into Liquid Alkanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient LDPE deconstruction into liquid alkanes is feasible at near&#8208;room temperature with anhydrous aluminum chloride and gallium chloride. Carbenium ion initiation and hydride transfer govern the rates, conversion, and selectivity of cracking and alkylation reactions. The polar environment created by Lewis acids stabilizes carbenium ions and catalyzes hydride transfer, facilitating C&#8722;C bond cleavage in LDPE during cracking and promoting C&#8722;C bond formation during alkylation.







Abstract
Transforming polyolefin waste into liquid alkanes through tandem cracking&#8208;alkylation reactions catalyzed by Lewis&#8208;acid chlorides offers an efficient route for single&#8208;step plastic upcycling. Lewis acids in dichloromethane establish a polar environment that stabilizes carbenium ion intermediates and catalyzes hydride transfer, enabling breaking of polyethylene C&#8722;C bonds and forming C&#8722;C bonds in alkylation. Here, we show that efficient and selective deconstruction of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) to liquid alkanes is achieved with anhydrous aluminum chloride (AlCl3) and gallium chloride (GaCl3). Already at 60&#8201;&#176;C, complete LDPE conversion was achieved, while maintaining the selectivity for gasoline&#8208;range liquid alkanes over 70&#8201;%. AlCl3 showed an exceptional conversion rate of 5000 
, surpassing other Lewis acid catalysts by two orders of magnitude. Through kinetic and mechanistic studies, we show that the rates of LDPE conversion do not correlate directly with the intrinsic strength of the Lewis acids or steric constraints that may limit the polymer to access the Lewis acid sites. Instead, the rates for the tandem processes of cracking and alkylation are primarily governed by the rates of initiation of carbenium ions and the subsequent intermolecular hydride transfer. Both jointly control the relative rates of cracking and alkylation, thereby determining the overall conversion and selectivity.

         <title>Functionalized Phenanthrene Imide&#8208;Based Polymers for n&#8208;Type Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenanthrene (PhA)&#8208;based electron&#8208;deficient moieties were developed and dual functionalization strategy was utilized to fine&#8208;tune the molecular lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The synergetic effects from imide and carbonyl or cyano (CN) groups give these moieties suitable solubility and stabilized LUMOs. The CN&#8208;containing imide obtains a stronger electron&#8208;deficiency and its derivative polymer can achieve higher electron mobility under a lower voltage in transistors.







Abstract
High&#8208;performing n&#8208;type polymers are crucial for the advance of organic electronics field, however strong electron&#8208;deficient building blocks with optimized physicochemical properties for constructing them are still limited. The imide&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework, high electron deficiency and good solubility serve as promising candidates for developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers. Among the PAHs, phenanthrene (PhA) features a well&#8208;delocalized aromatic &#960;&#8208;system with multiple modifiable active sites . However, the PhA&#8208;based imides are seldom studied, mainly attributed to the synthetic challenge. Herein, we report two functionalized PhAs, CPOI and CPCNI, by simultaneously incorporating imide with carbonyl or dicyanomethylene onto PhA. Notably, the dicyanomethylene&#8208;modified CPCNI exhibits a well stabilized LUMO energy level (&#8722;3.84&#8197;eV), attributed to the synergetic inductive effect from imide and cyano groups. Subsequently, based on CPOI and CPCNI, two polymers PCPOI&#8208;Tz and PCPCNI&#8208;Tz were developed. Applied to organic thin&#8208;film transistors, owing to the strong electron&#8208;deficiency of CPCNI, polymer PCPCNI&#8208;Tz shows an improved electron mobility and largely decreased threshold voltage compared with PCPOI&#8208;Tz. This work affords two structurally novel electron&#8208;deficient building blocks and highlights the effectiveness of dual functionalization of PhAs with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups for devising n&#8208;type polymers.

&lt;p&gt;Two phenanthrene (&lt;b&gt;PhA&lt;/b&gt;)-based electron-deficient moieties were developed and dual functionalization strategy was utilized to fine-tune the molecular lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. The synergetic effects from imide and carbonyl or cyano (CN) groups give these moieties suitable solubility and stabilized LUMOs. The CN-containing imide obtains a stronger electron-deficiency and its derivative polymer can achieve higher electron mobility under a lower voltage in transistors.

         <title>PAM&#8208;Engineered Toehold Switches as Input&#8208;Responsive Activators of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Toehold Switch DNA presenting a locked anti&#8208;PAM in the loop are designed to control Cas12a activity in response to different molecular inputs. The hairpin to duplex reconfiguration triggered by co&#8208;localization&#8208;based displacement reactions provides a means to control the accessibility of the PAM and Cas12a activity. We demonstrate the rapid, one&#8208;pot detection of antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity.







Abstract
The RNA&#8208;programmed CRISPR effector protein Cas12a has emerged as a powerful tool for gene editing and molecular diagnostics. However, additional bio&#8208;engineering strategies are required to achieve control over Cas12a activity. Here, we show that Toehold Switch DNA hairpins, presenting a rationally designed locked protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) in the loop, can be used to control Cas12a in response to molecular inputs. Reconfiguring the Toehold Switch DNA from a hairpin to a duplex conformation through a strand displacement reaction provides an effective means to modulate the accessibility of the PAM, thereby controlling the binding and cleavage activities of Cas12a. Through this approach, we showcase the potential to trigger downstream Cas12a activity by leveraging proximity&#8208;based strand displacement reactions in response to target binding. By utilizing the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a as a signal transduction method, we demonstrate the versatility of our approach for sensing applications. Our system enables rapid, one&#8208;pot detection of IgG antibodies and small molecules with high sensitivity and specificity even within complex matrices. Besides the bioanalytical applications, the switchable PAM&#8208;engineered Toehold Switches serve as programmable tools capable of regulating Cas12a&#8208;based targeting and DNA processing in response to molecular inputs and hold promise for a wide array of biotechnological applications.

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening Terpolymerisation of Elemental Sulfur Waste with Propylene Oxide and Carbon Disulfide via Lithium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>

Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, cannot form a copolymer with industrially relevant propylene oxide unless a mechanistic trick is employed, wherein thiolate intermediates are formed in situ to combine the two incompatible monomers.







Abstract
Elemental sulfur, a waste product of the oil refinement process, represents a promising raw material for the synthesis of degradable polymers. We show that simple lithium alkoxides facilitate the polymerisation of elemental sulfur S8 with industrially relevant propylene oxide (PO) and CS2 (a base chemical sourced from waste S8 itself) to give poly(monothiocarbonate&#8208;alt&#8208;Sx) in which x can be controlled by the amount of supplied sulfur. The in situ generation of thiolate intermediates obtained by a rearrangement, which follows CS2 and PO incorporation, allows to combine S8 and epoxides into one polymer sequence that would otherwise not be possible. Mechanistic investigations reveal that alkyl oligosulfide intermediates from S8 ring opening and sulfur chain length equilibration represent the better nucleophiles for inserting the next PO if compared to the trithiocarbonates obtained from the competing CS2 addition, which causes the sequence selectivity. The polymers can be crosslinked in situ with multifunctional thiols to yield reprocessable and degradable networks. Our report demonstrates how mechanistic understanding allows to combine intrinsically incompatible building blocks for sulfur waste utilisation.

A selenium&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely BBSeE, is designed and synthesized for constructing ambipolar polymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, featuring narrower band gap, high planarity, and low&#8208;lying LUMO. pN&#8208;BBSeE demonstrates ideally balanced ambipolar TFT performances with hole and electron mobility values up to 10.65 and 10.72&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, which is among the best ambipolar polymers reported so far.







Abstract
The lack of ambipolar polymers with balanced hole (&#956;h) and electron mobilities (&#956;e) &gt;10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 is the main bottleneck for developing organic integrated circuits. Herein, we show the design and synthesis of a &#960;&#8208;extended selenium&#8208;containing acceptor&#8208;dimeric unit, namely benzo[c][1,2,5]selenadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethane (BBSeE), to address this dilemma. In comparison to its sulfur&#8208;counterpart, BBSeE demonstrates enlarged co&#8208;planarity, selective noncovalent interactions, polarized Se&#8722;N bond, and higher electron affinity. The successful stannylation of BBSeE offers a great opportunity to access acceptor&#8208;acceptor copolymer pN&#8208;BBSeE, which shows a narrower band gap, lower&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (&#8722;4.05&#8197;eV), and a higher degree of backbone planarity. Consequently, the pN&#8208;BBSeE&#8208;based organic transistors display an ideally balanced ambipolar transporting property with &#956;h and &#956;e of 10.65 and 10.72&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the simultaneous &#956;h/&#956;e values &gt;10.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 are the best performances ever reported for ambipolar polymers. In addition, pN&#8208;BBSeE shows an excellent shelf&#8208;storage stability, retaining over 85&#8201;% of the initial mobility values after two months storage. Our study demonstrates the &#960;&#8208;extended acceptor&#8208;dimeric BBSeE is a promising acceptor building block for constructing high&#8208;performance ambipolar polymers applied in next&#8208;generation organic integrated circuit.

The &#8220;trinity&#8221; strategy provides a new perspective for the development of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries. The addition of a soluble mediator, TEM RM, was used to modulate the three&#8208;phase interface and facilitate the conversion of CO2 to Li2C2O4. This strategy avoids a series of issues associated with the Li2CO3 product, contributing to excellent cycling performance for Li&#8722;CO2 battery.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries have received significant attention owing to their advantages of combining greenhouse gas utilization and energy storage. However, the high kinetic barrier between gaseous CO2 and the Li2CO3 product leads to a low operating voltage (&lt;2.5&#8197;V) and poor energy efficiency. In addition, the reversibility of Li2CO3 has always been questioned owing to the introduction of more decomposition paths caused by its higher charging plateau. Here, a novel &#8220;trinity&#8221; Li&#8722;CO2 battery system was developed by synergizing CO2, soluble redox mediator (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidoxyl, as TEM RM), and reduced graphene oxide electrode to enable selective conversion of CO2 to Li2C2O4. The designed Li&#8722;CO2 battery exhibited an output plateau reaching up to 2.97&#8197;V, higher than the equilibrium potential of 2.80&#8197;V for Li2CO3, and an ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 97.1&#8201;%. The superior performance of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries is attributed to the TEM RM&#8208;mediated preferential growth mechanism of Li2C2O4, which enhances the reaction kinetics and rechargeability. Such a unique design enables batteries to cope with sudden CO2&#8208;deficient environments, which provides an avenue for the rationally design of CO2 conversion reactions and a feasible guide for next&#8208;generation Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Sustainable Polymers with High Performance and Infinite Scalability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time report the polyaddition of COS, diamines, and diacrylates, which is highly efficient, atom&#8208;economical, quantitatively yield, catalyst&#8208;free, and affords 46&#8197;polymers covering high&#8208;Tm crystalline plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and amorphous plastics. The in&#8208;chain ester and thiourethane groups contribute to the enzyme&#8208;degradability and enhanced thermal/mechanical properties of the obtained polymers.







Abstract
Our society has been pursuing high&#8208;performance biodegradable polymers made from facile methods and readily available monomers. Here, we demonstrate a library of enzyme&#8208;degradable polymers with desirable properties from the first reported step polyaddition of diamines, COS, and diacrylates. The polymers contain in&#8208;chain ester and thiourethane groups, which can serve as lipase&#8208;degradation and hydrogen&#8208;bonding physical crosslinking points, respectively, resulting in possible biodegradability as well as upgraded mechanical and thermal properties. Also, the properties of the polymers are scalable due to the versatile method and the wide variety of monomers. We obtain 46&#8197;polymers with tunable performance covering high&#8208;Tm crystalline plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, and amorphous plastics by regulating polymer structure. Additionally, the polymerization method is highly efficient, atom&#8208;economical, quantitatively yield, metal&#8208; and even catalyst&#8208;free. Overall, the polymers are promising green materials given their degradability, simple and modular synthesis, remarkable and tunable properties, and readily available monomers.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Free Preparation for Efficient and Photostable Pure&#8208;Iodide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free (ASF) technique is devised to fabricate photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Compared with wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs made from anti&#8208;solvent process, the ASF method significantly improves the device performance and reproducibility. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride is applied to enhance the crystallinity. Consequently, the ASF&#8208;based PSCs deliver a highest PCE of 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability.







Abstract
The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell (TSC) has attracted tremendous attention due to its potential to breakthrough the theoretical efficiency set for single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the perovskite solar cell (PSC) designed as its top component cell suffers from severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation owing to its mixed&#8208;halide strategy for achieving desirable wide&#8208;bandgap (1.68&#8197;eV). Developing pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites is a promising route to fabricate photostable perovskite/silicon TSCs. Here, we report efficient and photostable pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs made from an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;free (ASF) technique. The ASF process is achieved by mixing two precursor solutions, both of which are capable of depositing corresponding perovskite films without involving anti&#8208;solvent. The mixed solution finally forms Cs0.3DMA0.2MA0.5PbI3 perovskite film with a bandgap of 1.68&#8197;eV. Furthermore, methylammonium chloride additive is applied to enhance the crystallinity and reduce the trap density of perovskite films. As a result, the pure&#8208;iodide wide&#8208;bandgap PSC delivers efficiency as high as 21.30&#8201;% with excellent photostability, the highest for this type of solar cells. The ASF method significantly improves the device reproducibility as compared with devices made from other anti&#8208;solvent methods. Our findings provide a novel recipe to prepare efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.

         <title>Visualizing and Regulating Dynamic Evolution of Interfacial Electrolyte Configuration during De&#8208;solvation Process on Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ FTIR and in situ MRI are employed to reveal the interfacial electrolyte configuration dynamic variation on Li&#8208;metal anode. During Li plating (de&#8208;solvation process), an anion&#8208;lean solvent&#8208;rich interface is revealed, which determines the SEI architecture.







Abstract
Acting as a passive protective layer, solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the Li&#8208;metal anode. Derived from the reductive decomposition of electrolytes (e.g., anion and solvent), the SEI construction presents as an interfacial process accompanied by the dynamic de&#8208;solvation process during Li&#8208;metal plating. However, typical electrolyte engineering and related SEI modification strategies always ignore the dynamic evolution of electrolyte configuration at the Li/electrolyte interface, which essentially determines the SEI architecture. Herein, by employing advanced electrochemical in situ FT&#8208;IR and MRI technologies, we directly visualize the dynamic variations of solvation environments involving Li+&#8208;solvent/anion. Remarkably, a weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interaction and anion&#8208;lean interfacial electrolyte configuration have been synchronously revealed, which is difficult for the fabrication of anion&#8208;derived SEI layer. Moreover, as a simple electrochemical regulation strategy, pulse protocol was introduced to effectively restore the interfacial anion concentration, resulting in an enhanced LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer and improved Li&#8208;metal plating/stripping reversibility.

         <title>MoS2 Hollow Multishelled Nanospheres Doped Fe Single Atoms Capable of Fast Phase Transformation for Fast&#8208;charging Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

An original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time, which promotes the electron transfer and Na+ diffusion kinetic, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. Besides, the strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S, combining buffering effect of HoMS to improve the cyclic stability.







Abstract
Low Na+ and electron diffusion kinetics severely restrain the rate capability of MoS2 as anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Slow phase transitions between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S as well as the volume change during cycling, induce a poor cycling stability. Herein, an original Fe single atom doped MoS2 hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is designed for the first time to address the above challenges. The Fe single atom in MoS2 promotes the electron transfer, companying with shortened charge diffusion path from unique HoMS, thereby achieving excellent rate capability. The strong adsorption with Na+ and self&#8208;catalysis of Fe single atom facilitates the reversible conversion between 2H and 1T, and from NaxMoS2 to Mo and Na2S. Moreover, the buffering effect of HoMS on volume change during cycling improves the cyclic stability. Consequently, the Fe single atom doped MoS2 quadruple&#8208;shelled sphere exhibits a high specific capacity of 213.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at an ultrahigh current density of 30&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is superior to previously&#8208;reported results. Even at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, 259.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (83.68&#8201;%) was reserved after 500 cycles. Such elaborate catalytic site decorated HoMS is also promising to realize other &#8220;fast&#8208;charging&#8221; high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Long&#8208;cycling and High&#8208;voltage Solid State Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by Fluorinated and Crosslinked Polyether Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated and crosslinked polyether electrolyte (FGPE) exhibiting excellent oxidation stability was developed, which enabled the polymer electrolyte&#8208;based Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries to achieve the longest cycling of 1000 cycles and high operating voltage of 4.7&#8197;V. Notably, solid&#8208;state industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical cells were first reported with an outstanding stability (500 cycles).







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LMBs), constructed through the in situ fabrication of polymer electrolytes, are considered a critical strategy for the next&#8208;generation battery systems with high energy density and enhanced safety. However, the constrained oxidation stability of polymers, such as the extensively utilized polyethers, limits their applications in high&#8208;voltage batteries and further energy density improvements. Herein, an in situ fabricated fluorinated and crosslinked polyether&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte, FGPE, is presented, exhibiting a high oxidation potential (5.1&#8197;V). The fluorinated polyether significantly improves compatibility with both lithium metal and high&#8208;voltage cathode, attributed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#8722;CF3 group and the generated LiF&#8208;rich electrolyte/electrode interphase. Consequently, the solid&#8208;state Li||LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 batteries employing FGPE demonstrate exceptional cycling performances of 1000 cycles with 78&#8201;% retention, representing one of the best results ever reported for polymer electrolytes. Moreover, FGPE enables batteries to operate at 4.7&#8197;V, realizing the highest operating voltage of polyether&#8208;based batteries to date. Notably, our designed in situ FGPE provides the solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling stability even at practical conditions, including high cathode loading (21&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and industry&#8208;level 18650&#8208;type cylindrical cells (1.3&#8197;Ah, 500 cycles). This work provides critical insights into the development of oxidation&#8208;stable polymer electrolytes and the advancement of practical high&#8208;voltage LMBs.

         <title>Fused Azulenyl Squaraine Derivatives Improve Phototheranostics in the Second Near&#8208;Infrared Window by Concentrating Excited State Energy on Non&#8208;Radiative Decay Pathways</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PS&#8208;1 nanoparticles based on fused azulenyl squaraine derivatives exhibit remarkable second near&#8208;infrared phototheranostic performance by allowing almost all excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways. Additionally, long&#8208;wavelength light harvesting capability also increases due to J aggregation. Finally, the potential of PS&#8208;1 nanoparticles for treating deep&#8208;seated cancer and root canal infection were demonstrated.







Abstract
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) theranostics offer new opportunities for precise disease phototheranostic due to the enhanced tissue penetration and higher maximum permissible exposure of NIR&#8208;II light. However, traditional regimens lacking effective NIR&#8208;II absorption and uncontrollable excited&#8208;state energy decay pathways often result in insufficient theranostic outcomes. Herein a phototheranostic nano&#8208;agent (PS&#8208;1 NPs) based on azulenyl squaraine derivatives with a strong NIR&#8208;II absorption band centered at 1092&#8197;nm is reported, allowing almost all absorbed excitation energy to dissipate through non&#8208;radiative decay pathways, leading to high photothermal conversion efficiency (90.98&#8201;%) and strong photoacoustic response. Both in vitro and in vivo photoacoustic/photothermal therapy results demonstrate enhanced deep tissue cancer theranostic performance of PS&#8208;1 NPs. Even in the 5&#8197;mm deep&#8208;seated tumor model, PS&#8208;1 NPs demonstrated a satisfactory anti&#8208;tumor effect in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy. Moreover, for the human extracted tooth root canal infection model, the synergistic outcomes of the photothermal effect of PS&#8208;1 NPs and 0.5&#8201;% NaClO solution resulted in therapeutic efficacy comparable to the clinical gold standard irrigation agent 5.25&#8201;% NaClO, opening up possibilities for the expansion of NIR&#8208;II theranostic agents in oral medicine.

         <title>Halide Superionic Conductors with Non&#8208;Close&#8208;Packed Anion Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>

A novel design of non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion frameworks for halide superionic conductors is reported to show great potential for achieving superionic conductivity due to the significantly more distorted site and larger diffusion channel compared to its close&#8208;packed counterparts.







Abstract
Halide superionic conductors (SICs) are drawing significant research attention for their potential applications in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A key challenge in developing such SICs is to explore and design halide structural frameworks that enable rapid ion movement. In this work, we show that the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks shared by traditional halide ionic conductors face intrinsic limitations in fast ion conduction, regardless of structural regulation. Beyond the close&#8208;packed anion frameworks, we identify that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion frameworks have great potential to achieve superionic conductivity. Notably, we unravel that the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed UCl3&#8208;type framework exhibit superionic conductivity for a diverse range of carrier ions, including Li+, Na+, K+, and Ag+, which are validated through both ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and experimental measurements. We elucidate that the remarkable ionic conductivity observed in the UCl3&#8208;type framework structure stems from its significantly more distorted site and larger diffusion channel than its close&#8208;packed counterparts. By employing the non&#8208;close&#8208;packed anion framework as the key feature for high&#8208;throughput computational screening, we also identify LiGaCl3 as a promising candidate for halide SICs. These discoveries provide crucial insights for the exploration and design of novel halide SICs.

         <title>Bipolar Polymeric Protective Layer for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Corrosion&#8208;Resistant Lithium Metal Anode in Ethylene Carbonate Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar polymeric protective layer (BPPL) is developed using cyanoethyl (&#8722;CH2CH2C&#8801;N) and hydroxyl (&#8722;OH) polar groups, aiming to prevent EC&#8208;induced corrosion and facilitating rapid, uniform Li+ ion transport, where the polar hydroxyl group provides hydrogen bonding interactions between bipolar polymer and carbonate solvent, which effectively facilitates the Li+ desolvation, and traps free solvent molecules to block side reactions. The polar cyanoethyl group anchors anions to polymer chains through ion&#8208;dipole interactions, improving Li+ migration and restraining Li dendrite growth.







Abstract
The unstable interface between Li metal and ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based electrolytes triggers continuous side reactions and uncontrolled dendrite growth, significantly impacting the lifespan of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a bipolar polymeric protective layer (BPPL) is developed using cyanoethyl (&#8722;CH2CH2C&#8801;N) and hydroxyl (&#8722;OH) polar groups, aiming to prevent EC&#8208;induced corrosion and facilitating rapid, uniform Li+ ion transport. Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between &#8722;OH and EC facilitates the Li+ desolvation process and effectively traps free EC molecules, thereby eliminating parasitic reactions. Meanwhile, the &#8722;CH2CH2C&#8801;N group anchors TFSI&#8722; anions through ion&#8208;dipole interactions, enhancing Li+ transport and eliminating concentration polarization, ultimately suppressing the growth of Li dendrite. This BPPL enabling Li|Li cell stable cycling over 750 cycles at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for 2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The Li|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and Li|LiFePO4 full cells display superior electrochemical performance. The BPPL provides a practical strategy to enhanced stability and performance in LMBs application.

         <title>Regulating Charge Transport Dynamics at the Buried Interface and Bulk of Perovskites by Tailored&#8208;phase Two&#8208;dimensional Crystal Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored&#8208;phase two&#8208;dimensional crystal seed layer has been developed to optimize the charge transport dynamics at the buried interface and crystallization kinetics of perovskite films. The corresponding solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of 24.58&#8201;%. The devices exhibit an improved photostability with 88.4&#8201;% of initial efficiency being retained after aging under continuous 0.8&#8208;sun illumination for 2000&#8197;h in air.







Abstract
Targeting the trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and photochemical degradation occurring at the interface and bulk of perovskite, especially the overlooked buried bottom interface, a strategy of tailored&#8208;phase two&#8208;dimensional (TP&#8208;2D) crystal seed layer has been developed to improve the charge transport dynamics at the buried interface and bulk of perovskite films. Using this approach, TP&#8208;2D layer constructed by TP&#8208;2D crystal seeds at the buried interface can induce the formation of homogeneous interface electric field, which effectively suppress the accumulation of charge carriers at the buried interface. Additionally, the presence of TP&#8208;2D crystal seed has a positive effect on the crystallization process of the upper perovskite film, leading to optimized crystal quality and thus promoted charge transport inside bulk perovskites. Ultimately, the best performing PSCs based on TP&#8208;2D layer deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.58&#8201;%. The devices exhibit an improved photostability with 88.4&#8201;% of their initial PCEs being retained after aging under continuous 0.8&#8208;sun illumination for 2000&#8197;h in air. Our findings reveal how to regulate the charge transport dynamics of perovskite bulk and interface by introducing homogeneous components.

         <title>Polymer Dots with Delayed Fluorescence and Tunable Cellular Uptake for Photodynamic Therapy and Time&#8208;Gated Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic block copolymers capable of self&#8208;assembling into polymer dots (Pdots) with both delayed emission and singlet oxygen generation were prepared. The hydrophobic core shields an emitter with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) to allow for time&#8208;gated spectroscopy. Simultaneously, the hydrophilic corona exposes a photosensitizer to allow for photodynamic therapy (PDT) through a theranostic approach. In vitro studies with HeLa cells show that the nature of the hydrophilic corona can alter uptake while maintaining PDT efficiency.







Abstract
By combining bioimaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT), it is possible to treat cancer through a theranostic approach with targeted action for minimum invasiveness and side effects. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) probes have gained recent interest in theranostics due to their ability to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) while providing delayed emission that can be used in time&#8208;gated imaging. However, it is still challenging to design systems that simultaneously show (1) high contrast for imaging, (2) low dark toxicity but high phototoxicity and (3) tunable biological uptake. Here, we circumvent shortcomings of TADF systems by designing block copolymers and their corresponding semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) that encapsulate a TADF dye in the core and expose an additional boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) oxygen sensitizer in the corona. This architecture provides orange&#8208;red luminescent particles (&#934;PL up to 18&#8201;%) that can efficiently promote PDT (1O2 QY=42&#8201;%) of HeLa cells with very low photosensitizer loading (IC50 ~0.05&#8211;0.13&#8197;&#956;g/mL after 30&#8197;min). Additionally, we design Pdots with tunable cellular uptake but similar PDT efficiencies using either polyethylene glycol or guanidinium&#8208;based coronas. Finally, we demonstrate that these Pdots can be used for time&#8208;gated imaging to effectively filter out background fluorescence from biological samples and improve image contrast.

         <title>Catalytic and Base&#8208;free Suzuki&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;Arylation of Cyclic 1,3&#8208;Dicarbonyls via a Cyclic Iodonium Ylide Strategy</title>

         <dc:description>
A general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls have been developed, providing expedient access toward a wide range of high&#8208;value 2&#8208;aryl (hetero)cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls. The key to success is through a cyclic iodonium ylide strategy. Our approach is base&#8208;free and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples). Importantly, our approach allows late&#8208;stage modification and significantly simplifying previous synthesis.







Abstract
To date, it remains challenging to achieve a general and catalytic &#945;&#8208;arylation of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls, particularly ubiquitous heteroaromatic ones. In most cases, the preparation of their medically significant arylated derivatives requires multistep synthetic sequences. Herein, we introduce a new, convenient strategy involving the conversion of cyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls to cyclic iodonium ylides (CIYs), followed by rhodium&#8208;catalyzed &#945;&#8208;arylation with arylboronic reagents via carbene coupling. This approach is mild, operationally simple, base&#8208;free, biocompatible, and exhibits broad substrate scope (&gt;100&#8197;examples), especially with respect to various heteroaromatic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyls and ortho&#8208;substituted or base&#8208;sensitive arylboronic acids. Importantly, owing to the excellent compatibility with various arylboronic acids or boronate esters (ArBpin, ArBneop, or ArBF3K), this method allows the late&#8208;stage installation of heterocyclic 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl motifs in highly complex settings. The utility of this transformation is further demonstrated through significantly simplifying the synthesis of several bioactive molecules and natural products.

         <title>A Universal and Programmable Platform based on Fluorescent Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Probes for Detection of Proteins in Organelles of Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal detection platform based on the peptide&#8208;conjugated probes (PCPs, name as TP&#8208;TPE&#8208;TO) by integrating protein recognition units, signal units, and particularly introducing organelle targeting units. The universal detection platform can achieve six protein analysis in three different organelles through simple transformation of recognition units and targeting units.







Abstract
Realizing protein analysis in organelles of living cells is of great significance for developing diagnostic and therapeutic methods of diseases. Fluorescent&#8208;labeled antibodies with well imaging performance and high affinity are classical biochemical tools for protein analysis, while due to the inability to effectively enter into cells, not to mention organelles and the uncontrollable reaction sites that might cause antibodies inactivation when chemically modification, they are hard to apply to living cells. Inspired by the structure of fluorescent&#8208;labeled antibodies, we designed as a universal detection platform that was based on the peptide&#8208;conjugated probes (PCPs) and consisted of three parts: a)&#8197;a rotor type fluorescent molecular scaffold for conjugation and signal output; b)&#8197;the cell penetration protein recognition unit; c)&#8197;the subcellular organelle targeting unit. In living cells, PCPs could firstly localize at organelles and then proceed protein specific recognition, thus jointly leading to the restriction of twisted intramolecular charge transfer and activation of fluorescence signal. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, six different proteins in three typical intracellular organelles could be detected by our platform through simply replacing the recognition sequence of proteins and matching organelle targeting units. The position and intensity of fluorescence signals demonstrated specificity of PCPs and universality of the platform.

         <title>Breaking Global Diatropic Current to Tame Diradicaloid Character: Thiele's Hydrocarbon Under Macrocyclic Constraints</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two p&#8208;phenylene units with dissimilar resonance character (benzene and quinone) are embedded in a macrocyclic system. Their mutual orientation, in terms of the dihedral angle between the carbocyclic units, can stabilize the diradicaloid character of the system. Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical analysis confirmed a presence of open&#8208;shell singlet state with a low &#916;EST of &#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.







Abstract
A diradical/biradical character of organic derivatives is one of the key aspects of contemporary research focusing on the fundamental studies followed by potential applicability relying on the unique optical, electronic, or magnetic properties assigned to unpaired electrons. A precise involvement of two p&#8208;phenylenes into a cyclophane&#8208;like conjugated, diatropic system creates a flexible molecule with the two different characters of both subunits (benzene and quinone) imprinting into the structure a Kekul&#233; delocalized system. A dynamic of both carbocyclic subunits, and their mutual interaction generates a singlet open&#8208;shell state (J=&#8722;1.25&#8197;kcal/mol) as documented spectroscopically (NMR and EPR). The extended theoretical analysis has proved a correlation between dihedral angle and the diradicaloid character that shifts from a closed&#8208;shell singlet to an open&#8208;shell state, eventually showing the y0=0.86 for 78&#8197;degrees and &#916;EST=&#8722;0.34&#8197;kcal/mol.

         <title>A P2/P3 Biphasic Layered Oxide Composite as a High&#8208;Energy and Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Cathode for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biphasic P2/P3&#8208;K0.7Mn0.67Ni0.33O2 composite is proposed for potassium&#8208;ion batteries with large energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability and characterized by XRD refinement, HAADF and ABF&#8208;STEM, and Fourier transformation. This P2/P3 intergrown layered composite can manifest a high energy density of 321&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and also exhibit excellent capacity preservation during 600&#8197;cycles of K+ uptake/release.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides are extensively considered as appealing cathode candidates for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their abundant raw materials and low cost, but their further implementations are limited by slow dynamics and impoverished structural stability. Herein, a layered composite having a P2 and P3 symbiotic structure is designed and synthesized to realize PIBs with large energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability. The unique intergrowth of P2 and P3 phases in the obtained layered oxide is plainly characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction refinement, high&#8208;angle annular dark field and annular bright field&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy at atomic resolution, and Fourier transformation images. The synergistic effect of the two phases of this layered P2/P3 composite is well demonstrated in K+ intercalation/extraction process. The as&#8208;prepared layered composite can present a large discharge capacity with the remarkable energy density of 321&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and also manifest excellent capacity preservation after 600&#8197;cycles of K+ uptake/removal.

         <title>Modulation by Co (II) Ion of Optical Activities of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified Chiral Copper Nanoclusters for Sensitive Adenosine Triphosphate Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the regulation ability of Co2+ toward the chiral and fluorescent optical activities of chiral Cu NCs is discovered, which produces strong chiral optical activity (the asymmetry factor of chirality is enhanced by a factor of 223), and its distribution is modulated from the UV region to the visible region. More importantly, the chirality effect on the detection sensitivity of chiral biological targets is well illustrated, providing helpful guidance for constructing chiral nanoprobes with better detection performances for chiral biotargets.







Abstract
Chiral nanoscale enantiomers exhibit different biological effects in living systems. However, their chirality effect on the detection sensitivity for chiral biological targets still needs to be explored. Here, we discovered that Co2+ can modulate the luminescence performance of L/D&#8208;glutathione (GSH)&#8208;modified copper nanoclusters (L/D&#8722;Cu NCs) and induce strong chiroptical activities as the asymmetric factor was enhanced 223&#8208;fold with their distribution regulating from the ultraviolet to visible region. One Co2+ coordinated with two GSH molecules that modified on the surface of Cu NCs in the way of CoN2O2. On this basis, dual&#8208;modal chiral and luminescent signals of Co2+ coordinated L/D&#8722;Cu NCs (L/D&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs) were used to detect the chiral adenosine triphosphate (ATP) based on the competitive interaction between surficial GSH and ATP molecules with Co2+. The limits of detection of ATP obtained with fluorescence and circular dichroism intensity were 9.15&#8197;&#956;M and 15.75&#8197;nM for L&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs, and 5.35&#8197;&#956;M and 4.69&#8197;nM for D&#8722;Co&#8722;Cu NCs. This demonstrated that selecting suitable chiral configurations of nanoprobes effectively enhances detection sensitivity. This study presents not only a novel method to modulate and enhance the chiroptical activity of nanomaterials but also a unique perspective of chirality effects on the detection performances for bio&#8208;targets.

         <title>Achieving High Fill Factor in Organic Photovoltaic Cells by Tuning Molecular Electrostatic Potential Fluctuation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We designed and synthesized an outstanding acceptor material, namely ITOC6&#8208;4F, characterized by a considerably low amplitude of electrostatic potential fluctuation (0.8&#8197;kcal/mol). The ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell exhibits an extremely low bimolecular recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1. Consequently, this has led to the attainment of a new record fill factor of 0.816 in binary organic photovoltaic cells.







Abstract
In the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs), significant progress has been made in tailoring molecular structures to enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage and the short&#8208;circuit current density. However, there remains a crucial gap in the development of coordinated material design strategies focused on improving the fill factor (FF). Here, we introduce a molecular design strategy that incorporates electrostatic potential fluctuation to design organic photovoltaic materials. By reducing the fluctuation amplitude of IT&#8208;4F, we synthesized a new acceptor named ITOC6&#8208;4F. When using PBQx&#8208;TF as a donor, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell shows a markedly low recombination rate constant of 0.66&#215;10&#8722;14&#8197;cm3&#8201;s&#8722;1 and demonstrates an outstanding FF of 0.816, both of which are new records for binary OPV cells. Also, we find that a small fluctuation amplitude could decrease the energetic disorder of OPV cells, reducing energy loss. Finally, the ITOC6&#8208;4F&#8208;based cell creates the highest efficiency of 16.0&#8201;% among medium&#8208;gap OPV cells. Our work holds a vital implication for guiding the design of high&#8208;performance OPV materials.

         <title>Precise Modulation of Circularly Polarized Luminescence via Polymer Chiral Co&#8208;assembly and Contactless Dynamic Chiral Communication</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise modulation of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) including formulated color coordinates and handedness is realized by quantitative supramolecular co&#8208;assembly of three similar fluorene&#8208;based polymers with distinct fluorescence, directed by the addition principle. Furthermore, a contactless chiral communication with azobenzene&#8208;containing polymer (PAzo), which is a reverse subtraction principle, is used to achieve dynamic switch of CPL.







Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) plays a pivotal role in cutting&#8208;edge display and information technologies. Currently achieving precise color control and dynamic signal regulation in CPL still remains challenging due to the elusory relationship between fluorescence and chirality. Inspired by the natural mechanisms governing color formation and chiral interaction, we proposed an addition&#8208;subtraction principle theory to address this issue. Three fluorene&#8208;based polymers synthesized by Suzuki polycondensation with different electron&#8208;deficient monomers exhibit similar structures and UV/Vis absorption, but distinct fluorescence emissions due to intramolecular charge transfer. Based on this, precise&#8208;color CPL&#8208;active films are obtained through quantitative supramolecular co&#8208;assembly directed by addition principle. Particularly, an ideal white&#8208;emitting CPL film (CIE coordinates: (0.33, 0.33)) is facilely fabricated with a high quantum yield of 80.8&#8201;% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;2. Structural analysis reveals that the ordered stacking orientation favors higher glum. Furthermore, to address the dynamically regulated challenge, the comparable subtraction principle is proposed, involving a contactless chiral communication between excited and ground states. The representative system consisting of as&#8208;prepared fluorene&#8208;based polymers and chirality&#8208;selective absorption azobenzene (Azo)&#8208;containing polymers is constructed, achieving CPL weakening, reversal, and enhancement. Finally, a switchable quick response code is realized based on trans&#8208;cis isomerization of Azo moiety.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Directed Attachment of Hydroxylamines to Specific Lysines of IgG Antibodies for Bioconjugations with Acylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic peptide directs the covalent attachment of a hydroxylamine to specific lysine residues of the fragment crystallizable region of antibodies, and is cleaved upon potassium acyltrifluoroborate (KAT) ligation under physiological conditions in a traceless fashion. This convenient approach to the direct conjugation of commercial IgG antibodies is suitable for the formation of antibody&#8211;drug, antibody&#8211;protein, and antibody&#8211;DNA conjugates.







Abstract
The role of monoclonal antibodies as vehicles to deliver payloads has evolved as a powerful tool in cancer therapy in recent years. The clinical development of therapeutic antibody conjugates with precise payloads holds great promise for targeted therapeutic interventions. The use of affinity&#8208;peptide mediated functionalization of native off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf antibodies offers an effective approach to selectively modify IgG antibodies with a drug&#8211;antibody ratio (DAR) of 2. Here, we report the traceless, peptide&#8208;directed attachment of two hydroxylamines to native IgGs followed by chemoselective potassium acyltrifluoroborate (KAT) ligation with quinolinium acyltrifluoroborates (QATs), which provide enhanced ligation rates with hydroxylamines under physiological conditions. By applying KAT ligation to the modified antibodies, conjugation of small molecules, proteins, and oligonucleotides to off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf IgGs proceeds efficiently, in good yields, and with simultaneous cleavage of the affinity peptide&#8208;directing moiety.

         <title>Predicting Lewis Acidity: Machine Learning the Fluoride Ion Affinity of p&#8208;Block&#8208;Atom&#8208;Based Molecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluoride ion affinity (FIA) is among the most prominent descriptors for Lewis acidity. This paper presents FIA&#8208;GNN, a machine learning model that predicts FIA values in gas and solution (CH2Cl2) phase within a fraction of a second on a standard personal laptop. This is several orders of magnitude faster compared to the conventional quantum chemical approach. FIA&#8208;GNN is applied in four different case studies including catalysis research.







Abstract
&#8220;How strong is this Lewis acid?&#8221; is a question researchers often approach by calculating its fluoride ion affinity (FIA) with quantum chemistry. Here, we present FIA49k, an extensive FIA dataset with 48,986 data points calculated at the RI&#8208;DSD&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPP//PBEh&#8208;3c level of theory, including 13 different p&#8208;block atoms as the fluoride accepting site. The FIA49k dataset was used to train FIA&#8208;GNN, two message&#8208;passing graph neural networks, which predict gas and solution phase FIA values of molecules excluded from training with a mean absolute error of 14&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 (r2=0.93) from the SMILES string of the Lewis acid as the only input. The level of accuracy is notable, given the wide energetic range of 750&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 spanned by FIA49k. The model's value was demonstrated with four case studies, including predictions for molecules extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database and by reproducing results from catalysis research available in the literature. Weaknesses of the model are evaluated and interpreted chemically. FIA&#8208;GNN and the FIA49k dataset can be reached via a free web app (grebgroup.de/fia&#8208;gnn).

The first rare&#8208;earth complexes featuring diborataanthracene ligands are showcased. These are not only the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker compounds featuring a six&#8208;membered ring as a deck but also the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere.







Abstract
Herein, we present the first report on the synthesis of rare&#8208;earth complexes featuring a 9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene ligand. This 14&#8208;&#960;&#8208;electron ligand is highly reductive and was previously used in small&#8208;molecule activation. Salt elimination reactions between dipotassium 9,10&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] (CotTIPS=1,4&#8208;(iPr3Si)2C8H6) in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio yielded heteroleptic sandwich complexes [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). These compounds form Lewis&#8208;base&#8208;free one&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers when crystallised from toluene. In contrast, reaction of [K2(DEDBA)] and [LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)(BH4)(thf)x] in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio led to the formation of heteroleptic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln=Y, Dy, Er). Notably, these are not only the first lanthanide triple&#8208;decker compounds featuring a six&#8208;membered ring as a deck but also the first trivalent lanthanide triple&#8208;decker featuring a heterocycle in the coordination sphere. Magnetic investigations reveal that [K(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)] (Ln=Dy, Er) and [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)ErIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)ErIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] exhibit Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour. In the case of [(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)LnIII(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;DEDBA)LnIII(&#951;8&#8208;CotTIPS)] (Ln=Dy, Er), the introduction of a second near lanthanide ion results in strong antiferromagnetic interactions, allowing the enhancement of the magnetic characteristic of the system, compared to the quasi isolated counterpart. This research renews the overlooked coordination chemistry of the DBA ligand and expands it to encompass rare&#8208;earth elements.

         <title>The Fundamental Disorder Unit in (Si, P)&#8722;(O, N) Networks</title>

In this study, the new compound class of oxonitridosilicate phosphates is presented with the three representatives Sr3SiP3O2N7, Sr5Si2P4ON12, and Sr16Si9P9O7N33. All compounds feature a vierer single chain of disordered (Si,P)(O,N)4 tetrahedra, which is named the fundamental disorder unit. Investigations of luminescence on Eu2+&#8208;doped compounds showed a quenching behavior that makes them interesting model systems for theoretical calculations.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of oxonitridosilicate phosphates Sr3SiP3O2N7, Sr5Si2P4ON12, and Sr16Si9P9O7N33 as the first of their kind. These compounds were synthesized under high&#8208;temperature (1400&#8201;&#176;C) and high&#8208;pressure (3&#8197;GPa) conditions. A unique structural feature is their common fundamental building unit, a vierer single chain of (Si, P)(O, N)4 tetrahedra. All tetrahedra comprise substitutional disorder which is why we refer to it as the fundamental disorder unit (FDU). We classified four different FDU motifs, revealing systematic bonding patterns. Including literature known Sr5Si2P6N16, three of the four patterns were found in the presented compounds. Common techniques like single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD), elemental analyses, and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were utilized for structural analysis. Additionally, low&#8208;cost crystallographic calculations (LCC) provided insights into the structure of Sr16Si9P9O7N33 where NMR data were unavailable due to the lack of bulk samples. The optical properties of these compounds, when doped with Eu2+, were investigated using photoluminescence excitation (PLE), photoluminescence (PL) measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Factors influencing the emission properties, including thermal quenching mechanisms, were discussed. This research reveals the new class of oxonitridosilicate phosphates with unique systematic structural features that offer potential for theoretical studies of luminescence and band gap tuning in insulators.

         <title>Conformer&#8208;Selective Photoelectron Circular Dichroism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformer selective Photoelectron Circular Dichroism of chiral 1&#8208;indanol is obtained via a resonance&#8208;enhanced two&#8208;photon ionization Scheme, thanks to the selectivity due to the S1&#8592;S0 transition. The equatorial and axial conformers of 1&#8208;indanol display PECD that dramatically differ in both amplitude and sign.







Abstract
Conformational flexibility and chirality both play a key role in molecular recognition. It is therefore very useful to develop spectroscopic methods that simultaneously probe both properties. It has been theoretically predicted that photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) should be very sensitive to conformational isomerism. However, experimental proof has been less forthcoming and only exists for a very few favorable cases. Here, we present a new PECD scheme based on resonance&#8208;enhanced two&#8208;photon ionization (RE2PI) using UV/Vis nanosecond laser excitations. The spectral resolution obtained thereby guarantees conformer&#8208;selectivity by inducing resonant conformer&#8208;specific &#960;&#960;* S1&#8592;S0 transitions. We apply this experimental scheme to the study of chiral 1&#8208;indanol, which exists in two conformers linked by a ring inversion and defined by the position of the hydroxyl group, namely axial and equatorial. We show that the PECD of the equatorial and axial forms considerably differ in sign, magnitude and shape. We also discuss the influence of the total ionization energy, vibronic excitation of intermediate and final states, and relative polarization of the excitation and ionization lasers. Conformer&#8208;specificity adds a new dimension to the applications of PECD in analytical chemistry addressing now the general case of floppy systems.

         <title>Efficient Homolytic Cleavage of H2O2 on Hydroxyl&#8208;Enriched Spinel CuFe2O4 with Dual Lewis Acid Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic electron transfer (MET) is indispensable during the traditional H2O2 cleavage process. We demonstrate a non&#8208;redox hydroxyl&#8208;enriched spinel CuFe2O4 with dual Lewis acid sites to realize the homolytic cleavage of H2O2 without MET, which truly promotes H2O2 utilization and the catalyst stability, thereby expanding the applicability of heterogeneous catalysts in environmental remediation and organic synthesis.







Abstract
Traditional H2O2 cleavage mediated by macroscopic electron transfer (MET) not only has low utilization of H2O2, but also sacrifices the stability of catalysts. We present a non&#8208;redox hydroxyl&#8208;enriched spinel (CuFe2O4) catalyst with dual Lewis acid sites to realize the homolytic cleavage of H2O2. The results of systematic experiments, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations confirm that tetrahedral Cu sites with optimal Lewis acidity and strong electron delocalization can synergistically elongate the O&#8722;O bonds (1.47&#8197;&#197; &#8594; 1.87&#8197;&#197;) in collaboration with adjacent bridging hydroxyl (another Lewis acid site). As a result, the free energy of H2O2 homolytic cleavage is decreased (1.28&#8197;eV &#8594; 0.98&#8197;eV). H2O2 can be efficiently split into &#8901;OH induced by hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 without MET, which greatly improves the catalyst stability and the H2O2 utilization (65.2&#8201;%, nearly 2 times than traditional catalysts). The system assembled with hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 and H2O2 affords exceptional performance for organic pollutant elimination. The scale&#8208;up experiment using a continuous flow reactor realizes long&#8208;term stability (up to 600&#8197;mL), confirming the tremendous potential of hydroxyl&#8208;enriched CuFe2O4 for practical applications.

     alt="Efficient Homolytic Cleavage of H2O2 on Hydroxyl-Enriched Spinel CuFe2O4 with Dual Lewis Acid Sites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic electron transfer (MET) is indispensable during the traditional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleavage process. We demonstrate a non-redox hydroxyl-enriched spinel CuFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with dual Lewis acid sites to realize the homolytic cleavage of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without MET, which truly promotes H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization and the catalyst stability, thereby expanding the applicability of heterogeneous catalysts in environmental remediation and organic synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cleavage mediated by macroscopic electron transfer (MET) not only has low utilization of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but also sacrifices the stability of catalysts. We present a non-redox hydroxyl-enriched spinel (CuFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) catalyst with dual Lewis acid sites to realize the homolytic cleavage of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The results of systematic experiments, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; characterizations, and theoretical calculations confirm that tetrahedral Cu sites with optimal Lewis acidity and strong electron delocalization can synergistically elongate the O&#8722;O bonds (1.47&#8197;&#197; &#8594; 1.87&#8197;&#197;) in collaboration with adjacent bridging hydroxyl (another Lewis acid site). As a result, the free energy of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; homolytic cleavage is decreased (1.28&#8197;eV &#8594; 0.98&#8197;eV). H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be efficiently split into &#8901;OH induced by hydroxyl-enriched CuFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; without MET, which greatly improves the catalyst stability and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization (65.2&#8201;%, nearly 2 times than traditional catalysts).

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Ag25 Nanoclusters Encapsulated in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Encapsulation of MAg24 (M=Ag, Pd, Pt, and Au) NCs into a metal&#8208;organic framework, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affords MAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 composites. The AuAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibits the best activity, surpassing all other counterparts, and demonstrates excellent recyclability in photocatalytic hydrogen production. The formation of Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction promotes charge separation, in conjunction with optimized Ag electronic state, which are responsible for the enhanced photocatalysis.







Abstract
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) with unique optical properties and abundant catalytic sites are promising in photocatalysis. However, their light&#8208;induced instability and the difficulty of utilizing the photogenerated carriers for photocatalysis pose significant challenges. Here, MAg24 (M=Ag, Pd, Pt, and Au) NCs doped with diverse single heteroatoms have been encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, affording MAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Strikingly, compared with Ag25@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the MAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 doped with heteroatom exhibits much enhanced activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production, among which AuAg24@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 presents the best activity up to 3.6&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, far superior to all other counterparts. Moreover, they display excellent photocatalytic recyclability and stability. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that MAg24 NCs encapsulated into the MOF create a favorable charge transfer pathway, similar to a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, when exposed to visible light. This promotes charge separation, along with optimized Ag electronic state, which are responsible for the superior activity in photocatalytic hydrogen production.

         <title>Activating and Identifying the Active Site of RuS2 for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is applied to activate pyrite&#8208;type RuS2 for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction by introducing sulfur vacancies. The introduction of S vacancies can regulate the p orbital of S atoms, leading to enhanced binding strength between the S site of RuS2&#8722;x and H. The S&#8722;H bond is also observed through the in&#8197;situ Raman, directly proving the S atom as the HOR catalytic active site.







Abstract
Searching for highly efficient and economical electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the development of alkaline polymer membrane fuel cells. Here, we report a valid strategy to active pyrite&#8208;type RuS2 for alkaline HOR electrocatalysis by introducing sulfur vacancies. The obtained S&#8208;vacancies modified RuS2&#8722;x exhibits outperformed HOR activity with a current density of 0.676&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and mass activity of 1.43&#8197;mA&#8201;&#956;g&#8722;1, which are 15&#8208;fold and 40&#8208;fold improvement than those of Ru catalyst. In situ Raman spectra demonstrate the formation of S&#8722;H bond during the HOR process, identifying the S atom of RuS2&#8722;x is the real active site for HOR catalysis. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results including in&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy suggest the introduction of S vacancies can rationally modify the p orbital of S atoms, leading to enhanced binding strength between the S sites and H atoms on the surface of RuS2&#8722;x, together with the promoted connectivity of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and lowered water formation energy, contributes to the enhanced HOR performance.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Two&#8208;dimensional Nanofluidic Ionic Transistor for Neuromorphic Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by voltage&#8208;gated ion channels in neurons, a two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic ionic transistor was fabricated, which operates based on the response to transmembrane potential. The device demonstrates a high on/off ratio of ~2000 and can transition from ambipolar to unipolar behavior with a low subthreshold swing of 560&#8197;mV/decade. The successful implementation of ionic logic gate circuits, including &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, and &#8220;NOR&#8221; gates, paves a promising pathway towards ion&#8208;based brain&#8208;like computing.







Abstract
Voltage&#8208;gated ion channels prevalent in neurons play important roles in generating action potential and information transmission by responding to transmembrane potential. Fabricating bio&#8208;inspired ionic transistors with ions as charge carriers will be crucial for realizing neuro&#8208;inspired devices and brain&#8208;liking computing. Here, we reported a two&#8208;dimensional nanofluidic ionic transistor based on a MXene membrane with sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm interlayer channels. By applying a gating voltage on the MXene nanofluidic, a transmembrane potential will be generated to active the ionic transistor, which is similar to the transmembrane potential of neuron cells and can be effectively regulated by changing membrane parameters, e.g., thickness, composition, and interlayer spacing. For the symmetric MXene nanofluidic, a high on/off ratio of ~2000 can be achieved by forming an ionic depletion or accumulation zone, contingent on the sign of the gating potential. An asymmetric PET/MXene&#8208;composited nanofluidic transitioned the ionic transistor from ambipolar to unipolar, resulting in a more sensitive gate voltage characteristic with a low subthreshold swing of 560&#8197;mV/decade. Furthermore, ionic logic gate circuits, including the &#8220;NOT&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, and &#8220;NOR&#8221; gate, were implemented for neuromorphic signal processing successfully, which provides a promising pathway towards highly parallel, low energy consumption, and ion&#8208;based brain&#8208;like computing.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Sodium Metal Battery Based on a NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 Composite Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte</title>

A novel NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 composite electrolyte, composed of the disordered NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3 and the ordered NaB3H8, was rapidly synthesized from the sticky NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NH3 after the partial removal of NH3 at room temperature and successfully used at rates above 1&#8197;C in a solid&#8208;state sodium metal battery. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial stability for high&#8208;rate sodium metal batteries.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications owing to their intrinsic safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, they generally suffer from sodium dendrite growth or rapid capacity fading, especially at high rates, mainly due to poor wettability, sluggish ionic transport, or low interfacial stability of the solid electrolytes. Herein, we report a novel composite, NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 (x&lt;1), as a new class of solid electrolyte for high&#8208;rate batteries. NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xNH3@NaB3H8 is obtained from the sticky NaB3H8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NH3 after removal of NH3 partially at room temperature. It delivers an ionic conductivity of 0.84&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C and reaches 20.64&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 45&#8201;&#176;C after an order&#8208;disorder phase transformation. It also reveals a good capability of dendrite suppression and remarkable stability against sodium metal. These performances enable the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na//TiS2 battery with a high capacity of 232.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (97.2&#8201;% of theoretical capacity) and long&#8208;term cycling stability at 1&#8197;C. Notably, this battery shows superior long&#8208;life cycling stability even at 5 and 10&#8197;C, which has been rarely reported in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries. This work opens a new group of solid electrolytes, contributing to fast&#8208;charging or high&#8208;power&#8208;density sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Converting Commercial Zn Foils into Single (002)&#8208;Textured Zn with Millimeter&#8208;Sized Grains for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and fast melting&#8208;solidification approach was developed to effectively convert commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zinc with millimeter&#8208;sized (eye&#8208;visible) grains. The single (002) texture and huge grain features ensure large&#8208;scale epitaxial Zn deposition and significantly minimize the intergranular reactions, resulting in impressive reversibility of Zn metal anode in both Zn||Zn symmetric cells and full cells.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are promising but hindered by unfavorable dendrite growth and side reactions on zinc anodes. In this study, we demonstrate a fast melting&#8208;solidification approach for effectively converting commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zn featuring millimeter&#8208;sized grains. The melting process eliminates initial texture, residual stress, and grain size variations in diverse commercial Zn foils, guaranteeing the uniformity of commercial Zn foils into single (002)&#8208;textured Zn. The single (002)&#8208;texture ensures large&#8208;scale epitaxial and dense Zn deposition, while the reduction in grain boundaries significantly minimizes intergranular reactions. These features enable large grain single (002)&#8208;textured Zn shows planar and dense Zn deposition under harsh conditions (100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), impressive reversibility in Zn||Zn symmetric cell (3280&#8197;h under 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 830&#8197;h under 10&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and long cycling stability over 180&#8197;h with a high depth of discharge value of 75&#8201;%. This study successfully addresses the issue of uncontrollable texture formation in Zn foils following routine annealing treatments with temperatures below the Zn melting point. The findings of this study establish a highly efficient strategy for fabricating highly reversible single (002)&#8208;textured Zn anodes.

         <title>Water&#8208;Tolerant Superbase Polyoxometalate [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722; for Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a lowly&#8208;protonated hexaniobate cluster with Lindqvist structure by a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis. The proton abstraction from substrates with pKa&gt;26 and from a base indicator with pKa=26.5 revealed the superbase property of [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722;. The catalytic activity for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions maintained even in the presence of water. We reported for the first time TBA6[H2(Nb6O19)] as a water&#8208;tolerant superbase catalyst among the basic metal oxide catalysts.







Abstract
Here, doubly protonated Lindqvist&#8208;type niobium oxide cluster [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8211;, fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis, exhibited superbase catalysis for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions accompanied by activating C&#8722;H bond with pKa &gt;26 and proton abstraction from a base indicator with pKa=26.5. Surprisingly, [H2(Nb6O19)]6&#8722; exhibited water&#8208;tolerant superbase properties for Knoevenagel and crossed aldol condensation reactions in the presence of water, although it is well known that the strong basicity of metal oxides and organic superbase is typically lost by the adsorption of water. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the basic surface oxygens that share the corner of NbO6 units in [H2(Nb6O19)]8&#8722; maintained the negative charges even after proton adsorption. This proton capacity and the presence of un&#8208;protonated basic sites led to the water tolerance of the superbase catalysis.

         <title>Deciphering the Chemical Language of the Immunomodulatory Properties of Veillonella parvula Lipopolysaccharide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gut microbes might tip the delicate balance towards tolerance or inflammation. By analyzing the chemistry of LPS from two strains of the pathobiont Veillonella parvula, key and unprecedented structural differences were uncovered, which were reflected in diverse immunoactivities. Attempts were made to identify the molecular determinants governing this phenomenon.







Abstract
Veillonella parvula, prototypical member of the oral and gut microbiota, is at times commensal yet also potentially pathogenic. The definition of the molecular basis tailoring this contrasting behavior is key for broadening our understanding of the microbiota&#8208;driven pathogenic and/or tolerogenic mechanisms that take place within our body. In this study, we focused on the chemistry of the main constituent of the outer membrane of V. parvula, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS molecules indeed elicit pro&#8208;inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses depending on their chemical structures. Herein we report the structural elucidation of the LPS from two strains of V. parvula and show important and unprecedented differences in both the lipid and carbohydrate moieties, including the identification of a novel galactofuranose and mannitol&#8208;containing O&#8208;antigen repeating unit for one of the two strains. Furthermore, by harnessing computational studies, in vitro human cell models, as well as lectin binding solid&#8208;phase assays, we discovered that the two chemically diverse LPS immunologically behave differently and have attempted to identify the molecular determinant(s) governing this phenomenon.

&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from gut microbes might tip the delicate balance towards tolerance or inflammation. By analyzing the chemistry of LPS from two strains of the pathobiont &lt;i&gt;Veillonella parvula&lt;/i&gt;, key and unprecedented structural differences were uncovered, which were reflected in diverse immunoactivities. Attempts were made to identify the molecular determinants governing this phenomenon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Veillonella parvula&lt;/i&gt;, prototypical member of the oral and gut microbiota, is at times commensal yet also potentially pathogenic. The definition of the molecular basis tailoring this contrasting behavior is key for broadening our understanding of the microbiota-driven pathogenic and/or tolerogenic mechanisms that take place within our body. In this study, we focused on the chemistry of the main constituent of the outer membrane of &lt;i&gt;V. parvula&lt;/i&gt;, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS molecules indeed elicit pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses depending on their chemical structures. Herein we report the structural elucidation of the LPS from two strains of &lt;i&gt;V. parvula&lt;/i&gt; and show important and unprecedented differences in both the lipid and carbohydrate moieties, including the identification of a novel galactofuranose and mannitol-containing O-antigen repeating unit for one of the two strains. Furthermore, by harnessing computational studies, in vitro human cell models, as well as lectin binding solid-phase assays, we discovered that the two chemically diverse LPS immunologically behave differently and have attempted to identify the molecular determinant(s) governing this phenomenon. Whereas pro-inflammatory potential has been evidenced for the lipid A moiety, by contrast a plausible &#8220;immune modulating&#8221; action has been proposed for the peculiar O-antigen portion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discriminating the Active Ru Species Towards the Selective Generation of Singlet Oxygen from Peroxymonosulfate: Nanoparticles Surpass Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to the single&#8208;atom structure, ruthenium nanoparticles with adjacent surface sites exhibit enhanced activation of O&#8722;O bonds in peroxymonosulfate. This promoted activation facilitates the selective production of singlet oxygen, resulting in a high degradation efficiency for electron&#8208;rich pollutants.







Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) is an exceptional reactive oxygen species in advanced oxidation processes for environmental remediation. Despite single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) representing the promising candidate for the selective generation of 1O2 from peroxymonosulfate (PMS), the necessity to meticulously regulate the coordination environment of metal centers poses a significant challenge in the precisely&#8208;controlled synthetic method. Another dilemma to SACs is their high surface free energy, which results in an inherent tendency for the surface migration and aggregation of metal atoms. We here for the first time reported that Ru nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by the facile pyrolysis method behave as robust Fenton&#8208;like catalysts, outperforming Ru SACs, towards efficient activation of PMS to produce 1O2 with nearly 100&#8201;% selectivity, remarkably improving the degradation efficiency for target pollutants. Density functional theory calculations have unveiled that the boosted PMS activation can be attributed to two aspects: (i) enhanced adsorption of PMS molecules onto Ru NPs, and (ii) decreased energy barriers by offering adjacent sites for promoted dimerization of *O intermediates into adsorbed 1O2. This study deepens the current understanding of PMS chemistry, and sheds light on the design and optimization of Fenton&#8208;like catalysts.

         <title>Deoxygenative Transformation of Alcohols via Phosphoranyl Radical from Exogenous Radical Addition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to the direct deoxygenative transformation of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols has been developed. It proceeds through phosphoranyl radical intermediates generated by the addition of exogenous iodine radical to trivalent alkoxylphosphanes. Since these alkoxylphosphanes are readily in situ obtained from alcohols and commercially available, inexpensive chlorodiphenylphosphine, a diverse range of alcohols with various functional groups can be utilized to undergo deoxygenative cross&#8208;couplings with alkenes or aryl iodides. The selective transformation of polyhydroxy substrates and the rapid synthesis of complex organic molecules are also demonstrated with this method.

         <title>Electrokinetic Analyses Uncover the Rate&#8208;Determining Step of Biomass&#8208;Derived Monosaccharide Electroreduction on Copper</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical DHA conversion undergoes an initial dehydration and the subsequent hydrogenation to the acetol product. The electrokinetic analysis reveals that the rate&#8208;determining step follows an Eley&#8211;Rideal mechanism, that is, increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone will promote the activity. At alkaline (local) pH, DHA conversion is a homogeneous chemical reaction.







Abstract
Electrochemical biomass conversion holds promise to upcycle carbon sources and produce valuable products while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, deep insight into the interfacial mechanism is essential for the rational design of an efficient electrocatalytic route, which is still an area of active research and development. Herein, we report the reduction of dihydroxyacetone (DHA)&#8212;the simplest monosaccharide derived from glycerol feedstock&#8212;to acetol, the vital chemical intermediate in industries, with faradaic efficiency of 85&#177;5&#8201;% on a polycrystalline Cu electrode. DHA reduction follows preceding dehydration by coordination with the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups and the subsequent hydrogenation. The electrokinetic profile indicates that the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) includes a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) to the dehydrated intermediate, revealed by coverage&#8208;dependent Tafel slope and isotopic labeling experiments. An approximate zero&#8208;order dependence of H+ suggests that water acts as the proton donor for the interfacial PCET process. Leveraging these insights, we formulate microkinetic models to illustrate its origin that Eley&#8211;Rideal (E&#8722;R) dominates over Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood (L&#8722;H) in governing Cu&#8208;mediated DHA reduction, offering rational guidance that increasing the concentration of the adsorbed reactant alone would be sufficient to promote the activity in designing practical catalysts.

A robust shield emerges on perovskite, crafted through the dance of nucleophilic addition, coordination, and polymerization with triphenylmethane triisocyanate. A high&#8208;melting&#8208;point organic promoter for air&#8208;doping bars ion diffusion in the transport layer.

Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide serves as the optimal light&#8208;absorbing layer in single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells. However, achieving operational stability of high&#8208;efficiency n&#8208;i&#8208;p type devices at elevated temperatures remains challenging. In this work, we implemented effective surface modifications on microcrystalline perovskite films. This involved the nucleophilic addition of formamidinium cations and coordination of residual PbI2 with triphenylmethane triisocyanate as well as subsequent polymerization. The in situ growth of a cross&#8208;linking network chemically anchored on the perovskite film in this approach effectively reduced trap densities, favorably altered surface work function, suppressing interface charge recombination and thus enhancing cell efficiency. Coupled with a high&#8208;melting&#8208;point air&#8208;doping promoter, we fabricated n&#8208;i&#8208;p type perovskite solar cells surpassing 25&#8201;% efficiency, demonstrating excellent operational stability at 65&#8201;&#176;C.

BAB composite film has maximum &#955;&#8741; of 10.36&#8197;W/(m&#8901;K), excellent electrical insulation (breakdown strength and volume resistivity of 41.5&#8197;kV/mm and 1.21&#215;1015&#8197;&#937;&#8901;cm, respectively) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 170.9&#8197;MPa), also boasts adaptive visible light/infrared dual camouflage properties, as well as the function of fast encryption of QR code information within 24 seconds.







Abstract
The development of highly thermally conductive composites that combine visible light/infrared camouflage and information encryption has been endowed with great significance in facilitating the application of 5G communication technology in military fields. This work uses aramid nanofibers (ANF) as the matrix, hetero&#8208;structured silver nanowires@boron nitride nanosheets (AgNWs@BNNS) prepared by in situ growth as fillers, which are combined to fabricate sandwich structured thermally conductive and electrically insulating (BNNS/ANF)&#8208;(AgNWs@BNNS)&#8208;(BNNS/ANF) (denoted as BAB) composite films by &#8220;filtration self&#8208;assembly, air spraying, and hot&#8208;pressing&#8221; method. When the mass ratio of AgNWs@BNNS to BNNS is 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and the total mass fraction is 50&#8197;wt&#8201;%, BAB composite film has the maximum in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity coefficient (&#955;&#8741; of 10.36&#8197;W/(m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K)), excellent electrical insulation (breakdown strength and volume resistivity of 41.5&#8197;kV/mm and 1.21&#215;1015&#8197;&#937;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm, respectively) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 170.9&#8197;MPa). 50&#8197;wt&#8201;% BAB composite film could efficiently reduce the equilibrium temperature of the central processing unit (CPU) working at full power, resulting in 7.0&#8201;&#176;C lower than that of the CPU solely integrated with ANF directly. In addition, BAB composite film boasts adaptive visible light/infrared dual camouflage properties on cement roads and jungle environments, as well as the function of fast encryption of QR code information within 24 seconds.

An erbium triple&#8208;decker complex featuring a 9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene middle deck and two substituted cyclooctatetraene outer decks is depicted on the cover. The magnetic interaction between the two erbium ions is highlighted, since the title compound allows the evaluation of the 9,10&#8208;diborataanthracene ligand for possible exchange interactions. In addition, the two ligands that compose the triple&#8208;decker complexes are displayed. The title compound represents the first triple&#8208;decker complexes of lanthanides with a six&#8208;membered ring, as illustrated by Eufemio Moreno&#8208;Pineda, Peter&#8197;W. Roesky et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202401372).

The RNA&#8208;programmed CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a activity requires two factors: complementarity between the guide RNA and the dsDNA, and a short Palindromic Adjacent Motif (PAM) flanking the target. In their Research Article (e202319677), Alessandro Porchetta et&#8197;al. rationally designed PAM&#8208;engineered DNA hairpins as input&#8208;responsive activators of Cas12a. By utilizing the trans&#8208;cleavage activity of Cas12a as a signal transduction method, the authors demonstrated the rapid, one&#8208;pot detection of IgG antibodies and small molecules.

This Minireview summarizes the latest advances in data processing techniques for single&#8208;entity electrochemistry towards achieving automation, real&#8208;time monitoring, increased sensitivity, as well as improved temporal and current resolution.







Abstract
Single&#8208;entity electrochemistry is a powerful tool that enables the study of electrochemical processes at interfaces and provides insights into the intrinsic chemical and structural heterogeneities of individual entities. Signal processing is a critical aspect of single&#8208;entity electrochemical measurements and can be used for data recognition, classification, and interpretation. In this review, we summarize the recent five&#8208;year advances in signal processing techniques for single&#8208;entity electrochemistry and highlight their importance in obtaining high&#8208;quality data and extracting effective features from electrochemical signals, which are generally applicable in single&#8208;entity electrochemistry. Moreover, we shed light on electrochemical noise analysis to obtain single&#8208;molecule frequency fingerprint spectra that can provide rich information about the ion networks at the interface. By incorporating advanced data analysis tools and artificial intelligence algorithms, single&#8208;entity electrochemical measurements would revolutionize the field of single&#8208;entity analysis, leading to new fundamental discoveries.

         <title>Crystallization Kinetics of Hybrid Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are outstanding photovoltaic materials. Nonetheless, despite significant progress, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still face challenges. It is crucial to adjust the crystallization process during solution crystallization and film formation to overcome this challenge. We primarily discuss the relevant aspects of MHP crystallization kinetics, systematically summarize theoretical methods, and outline modulation techniques for MHP crystallization, including solution engineering, additive engineering, and component engineering.







Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are considered ideal photovoltaic materials due to their variable crystal material composition and excellent photoelectric properties. However, this variability in composition leads to complex crystallization processes in the manufacturing of Metal halide perovskite (MHP) thin films, resulting in reduced crystallinity and subsequent performance loss in the final device. Thus, understanding and controlling the crystallization dynamics of perovskite materials are essential for improving the stability and performance of PSCs (Perovskite Solar Cells). To investigate the impact of crystallization characteristics on the properties of MHP films and identify corresponding modulation strategies, we primarily discuss the relevant aspects of MHP crystallization kinetics, systematically summarize theoretical methods, and outline modulation techniques for MHP crystallization, including solution engineering, additive engineering, and component engineering, which helps highlight the prospects and current challenges in perovskite crystallization kinetics

         <title>Development and Applications of D&#8208;Amino Acid Derivatives&#8208;based Metabolic Labeling of Bacterial Peptidoglycan</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The promiscuity of the PG synthesis machinery allows for D&#8208;amino acid derivatives to selectively label PG within bacterial cell surface, while sparing host mammalian cells. This metabolic labeling strategy is selective, biocompatible, and broadly applicable, which has been utilized in various fields. In this review, we introduce the labeling approaches for PG using D&#8208;amino acid derivatives and the applications of this metabolic labeling strategy.







Abstract
Peptidoglycan, an essential component within the cell walls of virtually all bacteria, is composed of glycan strands linked by stem peptides that contain D&#8208;amino acids. The peptidoglycan biosynthesis machinery exhibits high tolerance to various D&#8208;amino acid derivatives. D&#8208;amino acid derivatives with different functionalities can thus be specifically incorporated into and label the peptidoglycan of bacteria, but not the host mammalian cells. This metabolic labeling strategy is highly selective, highly biocompatible, and broadly applicable, which has been utilized in various fields. This review introduces the metabolic labeling strategies of peptidoglycan by using D&#8208;amino acid derivatives, including one&#8208;step and two&#8208;step strategies. In addition, we emphasize the various applications of D&#8208;amino acid derivative&#8208;based metabolic labeling, including bacterial peptidoglycan visualization (existence, biosynthesis, and dynamics, etc.), bacterial visualization (including bacterial imaging and visualization of growth and division, metabolic activity, antibiotic susceptibility, etc.), pathogenic bacteria&#8208;targeted diagnostics and treatment (positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, gas therapy, immunotherapy, etc.), and live bacteria&#8208;based therapy. Finally, a summary of this metabolic labeling and an outlook is provided.

         <title>Zinc ion Batteries: Bridging the Gap from Academia to Industry for Grid&#8208;Scale Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>

Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) hold great promise for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the practical capability of ZIBs is ambiguous due to technical gaps between small scale laboratory coin cells and large commercial energy storage systems. This Minireview explores limiting factors for ZIBs practicality, using formulations to estimate practical energy density and predict battery lifespan in lab research activities.







Abstract
Zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) exhibit significant promise in the next generation of grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their safety, relatively high volumetric energy density, and low production cost. Despite substantial advancements in ZIBs, a comprehensive evaluation of critical parameters impacting their practical energy density (Epractical) and calendar life is lacking. Hence, we suggest using formulation&#8208;based study as a scientific tool to accurately calculate the cell&#8208;level energy density and predict the cycling life of ZIBs. By combining all key battery parameters, such as the capacity ratio of negative to positive electrode (N/P), into one formula, we assess their impact on Epractical. When all parameters are optimized, we urge to achieve the theoretical capacity for a high Epractical. Furthermore, we propose a formulation that correlates the N/P and Coulombic efficiency of ZIBs for predicting their calendar life. Finally, we offer a comprehensive overview of current advancements in ZIBs, covering cathode and anode, along with practical evaluations. This Minireview outlines specific goals, suggests future research directions, and sketches prospects for designing efficient and high&#8208;performing ZIBs. It aims at bridging the gap from academia to industry for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Spontaneous Oxidation in Aqueous Microdroplets: Water Radical Cation as Primary Oxidizing Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous oxidation in aqueous microdroplets has led to controversy as to the identity of the oxidants. This minireview summarizes unique features of microdroplets, proposing water radical cation&#8208;driven reactions that reconcile different interpretations of the experimental results.







Abstract
Exploration of the unique chemical properties of interfaces can unlock new understanding. A striking example is the finding of accelerated reactions, particularly spontaneous oxidation reactions, that occur without assistance of catalysts or external oxidants at the air interface of both aqueous and organic solutions (provided they contain some water). This finding opened a new area of interfacial chemistry but also caused heated debate regarding the primary chemical species responsible for the observed oxidation. An overview of the literature covering oxidation in microdroplets with air interfaces is provided, together with a critical examination of previous findings and hypotheses. The water radical cation/radical anion pair, formed spontaneously and responsible for the electric field at or near the droplet/air interface, is suggested to constitute the primary redox species. Mechanisms of accelerated microdroplet reactions are critically discussed and it is shown that hydroxyl radical/hydrogen peroxide formation in microdroplets does not require that these species be the primary oxidant. Instead, we suggest that hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide are the products of water radical cation decay in water. The importance of microdroplet chemistry in the prebiotic environment is sketched briefly and the role of partial solvation in reaction acceleration is noted.

         <title>Integrating Olefin Carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag Reaction by Radical Deconstruction of Hydrazonyl N&#8722;N Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel conversion mode for hydrazone by the division use of N2&#8208;moiety is developed by the photocatalytic redox neutral reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl&#8208;N&#8208;mesitylenesulfonyl (Mts)&#8208;hydrazones with ICF2CO2Et. The reaction merges olefin carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag (HLF) reaction by radical addition/crucial distal N and H transfer sequences to yield &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters under tandem C&#8722;C and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.







Abstract
As a type of elementary organic compounds containing N&#8722;N single bond, hydrazone involved chemical conversions are extremely extensive, but they are mainly limited to N2&#8208;retention and N2&#8208;removal modes. We report herein an unprecedented protocol for the realization of division utilization of the N2&#8208;moiety of hydrazone by a radical facilitated N&#8722;N bond deconstruction strategy. This new conversion mode enables the successful combination of alkene carboamination and Hofmann&#8208;L&#246;ffler&#8208;Freytag reaction by the reaction of N&#8208;homoallyl mesitylenesulfonyl hydrazones with ethyl difluoroiodoacetate under photocatalytic redox neutral conditions. Mechanism studies reveal that the reaction undergoes a radical relay involving addition, crucial remote imino&#8208;N migration and H&#8208;atom transfer. Consequently, a series of structurally significant &#1013;&#8208;N&#8208;sulphonamide&#8208;&#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoro&#8208;&#947;&#8208;amino acid esters are efficiently produced via continuous C&#8722;C bond and dual C&#8722;N bonds forging.

         <title>Tapcin, an In Vivo Active Dual Topoisomerase I/II Inhibitor Discovered by Synthetic Bioinformatic Natural Product (Syn&#8208;BNP)&#8208;Coupled Metagenomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coupling sequence&#8208;tag&#8208;based metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and total chemical synthesis we discovered the synthetic bioinformatic natural product tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid&#8208;thiazole with a rare tri&#8208;thiazole substructure. It has topoisomerase&#8197;I and II activity and exhibits potent in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity.







Abstract
DNA topoisomerases are attractive targets for anticancer agents. Dual topoisomerase&#8197;I/II inhibitors are particularly appealing due to their reduced rates of resistance. A number of therapeutically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors are bacterial natural products. Mining the untapped chemical diversity encoded by soil microbiomes presents an opportunity to identify additional natural topoisomerase inhibitors. Here we couple metagenome mining, bioinformatic structure prediction algorithms, and chemical synthesis to produce the dual topoisomerase inhibitor tapcin. Tapcin is a mixed p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA)&#8208;thiazole with a rare tri&#8208;thiazole substructure and picomolar antiproliferative activity. Tapcin reduced colorectal adenocarcinoma HT&#8208;29&#8197;cell proliferation and tumor volume in mouse hollow fiber and xenograft models, respectively. In both studies it showed similar activity to the clinically used topoisomerase&#8197;I inhibitor irinotecan. The study suggests that the interrogation of soil microbiomes using synthetic bioinformatic natural product methods has the potential to be a rewarding strategy for identifying potent, biomedically relevant, antiproliferative agents.

         <title>A Terrylene Bisimide based Universal Host for Aromatic Guests to Derive Contact Surface&#8208;Dependent Dispersion Energies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large &#960;&#8208;surface provided by terrylene bisimide affords a cyclophane that can accommodate a large variety of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guests with binding constants up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1. A linear relationship between the Gibbs binding energy and the surface area of the guest could be used to derive the interaction parameter of 0.31&#8197;kJ/mol&#197;2.







Abstract
&#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are among the most important intermolecular interactions in supramolecular systems. Here we determine experimentally a universal parameter for their strength that is simply based on the size of the interacting contact surfaces. Toward this goal we designed a new cyclophane based on terrylene bisimide (TBI) &#960;&#8208;walls connected by para&#8208;xylylene spacer units. With its extended &#960;&#8208;surface this cyclophane proved to be an excellent and universal host for the complexation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated guests, including small and large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as dye molecules. The observed binding constants range up to 108&#8197;M&#8722;1 and show a linear dependence on the 2D area size of the guest molecules. This correlation can be used for the prediction of binding constants and for the design of new host&#8211;guest systems based on the herewith derived universal Gibbs interaction energy parameter of 0.31&#8197;kJ/mol&#197;2 in chloroform.

         <title>Evolved Readers of 5&#8208;Carboxylcytosine CpG Dyads Reveal a High Versatility of the Methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;Binding Domain for Recognition of Noncanonical Epigenetic Marks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cytosine 5&#8208;modifications&#8211;occurring in different combinations in the two DNA strands of CpG dyads&#8211;are central to human chromatin regulation, but the customized recognition of such combinatorial marks is challenging. By re&#8208;evolving MBDs, the readers of canonical 5&#8208;methylated CpGs, we identify strong and selective readers of noncanonical 5&#8208;carboxylcytosine&#8208;containing CpGs that have fully abandoned the conserved recognition of methylated CpGs.







Abstract
Mammalian genomes are regulated by epigenetic cytosine (C) modifications in palindromic CpG dyads. Including canonical cytosine 5&#8208;methylation (mC), a total of four different 5&#8208;modifications can theoretically co&#8208;exist in the two strands of a CpG, giving rise to a complex array of combinatorial marks with unique regulatory potentials. While tailored readers for individual marks could serve as versatile tools to study their functions, it has been unclear whether a natural protein scaffold would allow selective recognition of marks that vastly differ from canonical, symmetrically methylated CpGs. We conduct directed evolution experiments to generate readers of 5&#8208;carboxylcytosine (caC) dyads based on the methyl&#8208;CpG&#8208;binding domain (MBD), the widely conserved natural reader of mC. Despite the stark steric and chemical differences to mC, we discover highly selective, low nanomolar binders of symmetric and asymmetric caC&#8208;dyads. Together with mutational and modelling studies, our findings reveal a striking evolutionary flexibility of the MBD scaffold, allowing it to completely abandon its conserved mC recognition mode in favour of noncanonical dyad recognition, highlighting its potential for epigenetic reader design.

         <title>Ostwald ripening for designing time&#8208;dependent crystal hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable fibrous crystal networks form within hydrogels via a growing process involving polymer&#8208;induced mismatching nucleation, stiffening the hydrogels. These fibrous crystals would undergo Ostwald ripening and convert into stable bulk crystals. A remarkable reduction in material stiffness and interfacial adhesion is observed in this process, suggesting a time&#8208;dependent mechanism to program hydrogel properties.







Abstract
Ostwald ripening (OR), a classic solution theory describing molecular transfer from metastable crystal to stable one, is applied to design time&#8208;dependent crystal hydrogels that can automatically change their mechanical properties. Using a system made from crosslinked polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium acetate (NaAc), we demonstrate that metastable fibrous crystal networks of NaAc preferably form in PAM hydrogels via a polymer&#8208;involving mismatch nucleation. These fibrous crystals would undergo OR and evolve into isolated bulk crystals, leading to a significant reduction in material rigidity (179&#8197;folds) and interfacial adhesion (20&#8197;folds). This transformation can be applied to program time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;recovery in shape and self&#8208;delamination. Since OR is a ubiquitous, robust feature of various crystals, the approach reported here represents a new direction for designing advanced transient soft materials.

         <title>Redesigned Nylon 6 Variants with Enhanced Recyclability, Ductility, and Transparency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>

Geminal disubstitution on &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam (nylon&#8197;6&#8217;s monomer) at different positions greatly modulates lactam monomer's reactivity and gem&#8208;nylon's performance properties, with dimethylation at the &#947; position yielding the most intriguing nylon that exhibits a combination of desired properties including enhanced chemical recyclability, mechanical ductility, and optical clarity, compared to commercial nylon&#8197;6.







Abstract
Geminal (gem&#8722;) disubstitution in heterocyclic monomers is an effective strategy to enhance polymer chemical recyclability by lowering their ceiling temperatures. However, the effects of specific substitution patterns on the monomer's reactivity and the resulting polymer's properties are largely unexplored. Here we show that, by systematically installing gem&#8208;dimethyl groups onto &#1013;&#8208;caprolactam (monomer of nylon&#8197;6) from the &#945; to &#1013; positions, both the redesigned lactam monomer's reactivity and the resulting gem&#8208;nylon&#8197;6&#8217;s properties are highly sensitive to the substitution position, with the monomers ranging from non&#8208;polymerizable to polymerizable and the gem&#8208;nylon properties ranging from inferior to far superior to the parent nylon&#8197;6. Remarkably, the nylon&#8197;6 with the gem&#8208;dimethyls substituted at the &#947; position is amorphous and optically transparent, with a higher Tg (by 30&#8201;&#176;C), yield stress (by 1.5&#8197;MPa), ductility (by 3&#215;), and lower depolymerization temperature (by 60&#8201;&#176;C) than conventional nylon&#8197;6.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Principinol B</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective total synthesis of principinol B was achieved by convergent and modular synthetic strategies. Two enantioenriched fragments were assembled by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction/carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis sequence. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] core structure was introduced by the Williamson ether synthesis.







Abstract
We have accomplished the first and asymmetric total synthesis of principinol B, a grayanoid possessing an oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture. A functionalized 5/7/6/5 tetracyclic intermediate was assembled in a convergent manner by a diastereoselective intermolecular aldol reaction and subsequent carbonyl&#8211;olefin metathesis of two enantiomerically enriched fragments. The oxabicyclo[3.2.1] architecture containing a 6,10&#8208;ether bridge was constructed by the Williamson ether synthesis.

         <title>CO Cofeeding Affects Product Distribution in CH3Cl Coupling over ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite: Pressure Twists the Plot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of oxygenate co&#8208;feeding presents intriguing prospects to manipulate reactivity patterns and catalyst stability in the conversion of methyl chloride to hydrocarbons over zeolite catalysts. CO&#8208;cofeeding induces a Koch carbonylation path as revealed through detection of the reactive intermediate ketene via operando PEPICO spectroscopy, boosting olefin selectivity at low pressure. Extrapolation to more easily activated CH3OH extends the catalyst lifetime under ambient pressure conditions.







Abstract
C1 coupling reactions over zeolite catalysts are central to sustainable chemical production strategies. However, questions persist regarding the involvement of CO in ketene formation, and the impact of this elusive oxygenate intermediate on reactivity patterns. Using operando photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy (PEPICO), we investigate the role of CO in methyl chloride conversion to hydrocarbons (MCTH), a prospective process for methane valorization with a reaction network akin to methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) but without oxygenate intermediates. Our findings reveal the transformative role of CO in MCTH at the low pressures, inducing ketene formation in MCTH and boosting olefin production, confirming the Koch carbonylation step in the initial stages of C1 coupling. We uncover pressure&#8208;dependent product distributions driven by CO&#8208;induced ketene formation, and its subsequent desorption from the zeolite surface, which is enhanced at low pressure. Inspired by the above results, extension of the co&#8208;feeding approach to CH3OH as another simple oxygenate showcases the additional potential for improved catalyst stability in MCTH at ambient pressure.

         <title>Selective Ring&#8208;Opening Amination of Isochromans and Tetrahydroisoquinolines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel selective ring&#8208;opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines have been developed by employing molecular editing strategy. This chemistry offers a practical method to access various valuable compounds from easily available starting materials.







Abstract
The molecular structure&#8208;editing through selective C&#8722;C bond cleavage allows for the precise modification of molecular structures and opens up new possibilities in chemical synthesis. By strategically cleaving C&#8722;C bonds and editing the molecular structure, more efficient and versatile pathways for the synthesis of complex compounds could be designed, which brings significant implications for drug development and materials science. o&#8208;Aminophenethyl alcohols and amines are the essential key motifs in bioactive and functional material molecules. The traditional synthesis of these compounds usually requires multiple steps which could generate inseparable isomers and induce low efficiencies. By leveraging a molecular editing strategy, we herein reported a selective ring&#8208;opening amination of isochromans and tetrahydroisoquinolines for the efficient synthesis of o&#8208;aminophenethyl alcohols and amines. This innovative chemistry allows for the precise cleavage of C&#8722;C bonds under mild transition metal&#8208;free conditions. Notably, further synthetic application demonstrated that our method could provide an efficient approach to essential components of diverse bioactive molecules.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An investigation of the new 18&#8208; and 19&#8208;vertex macropolyhedral heteroborane clusters reported here containing sulphur and selenium cluster vertices and a subsequent reinvestigation of analogous known species has revealed that the property of luminescence in this wide range of structural types is much more extensive than previously recognised, where it has been restricted to those of the binary borane anti&#8208;B18H22 and its derivatives.







Abstract
Luminescence is observed in three novel macropolyhedral nineteen&#8208; and eighteen&#8208;vertex chalcogenaboranes: Se2B17H17 (1), SeB17H19 (3) and SeB18H20 (4). This led us to the recognition that previously published macropolyhedral heteroborane species might also exhibit luminescence. Thus, the known nineteen&#8208; and eighteen&#8208;vertex dithiaboranes S2B17H17 (2), n&#8208;S2B16H16 (5) and i&#8208;S2B16H16 (6) were synthesised and also found to exhibit a range of luminescent properties. These macropolyhedral species are very different from the previously unique fluorescent binary borane B18H22 in terms of their structural architectures, by the presence of borane cluster hetero atoms, and, as in the cases of 5 and 6, that their synthetic origins are not derived simply through the modification of B18H22 itself. They consequently greatly expand the possibilities of finding new luminescent inorganic borane species.

         <title>Photoelectron Migration Boosted by Hollow Double&#8208;Shell Dyads Based on Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow double&#8208;shell dyads have been constructed using covalent organic frameworks and transition metal sulfides, the double&#8208;shell architecture broadens light absorption, improves hydrogen evolution kinetics and reduces the photogenerated electron transfer resistance, resulting in high performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen production based on noble metal&#8208;free systems is a promising technology for the conversion of solar energy into green hydrogen, it is pivotal and challenging to tailor&#8208;make photocatalysts for achieving high photocatalytic efficiency. Herein, we reported a hollow double&#8208;shell dyad through uniformly coating covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on the surface of hollow Co9S8. The double shell architecture enhances the scattering and refraction efficiency of incident light, shortens the transmission distance of the photogenerated charge carriers, and exposes more active sites for photocatalytic conversion. The hydrogen evolution rate is as high as 23.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which is significantly enhanced when compared with that of their physical mixture (0.30&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1) and Pt&#8208;based counterpart (11.84&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). This work provides a rational approach to the construction of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free photocatalytic systems based on COFs to enhance hydrogen evolution performance.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, a co&#8208;insertion/extraction of Zn2+ and H+ is demonstrated accompanying with manganese and oxygen double redox reactions in Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 cathode. As a result, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability in the electrolyte of 2&#8197;M ZnSO4.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) show wide application as the cathode of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) in the future owning to their high porosity, diverse structures, abundant species, and controllable morphology. However, the low energy density and poor cycling stability hinder the feasibility in practical application. Herein, an innovative strategy of organic/inorganic double electroactive sites is proposed and demonstrated to obtain extra capacity and enhance the energy density in a manganese&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74). Simultaneously, its energy storage mechanism is systematically investigated. Moreover, profiting from the coordination effect, the Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 features with stable structure in ZnSO4 electrolyte. Therefore, the Zn/Mn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 batteries exhibit a high energy density and superior cycling stability. This work aids in the future development of MOFs in AZIBs.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Atroposelective Ring&#8208;Opening of 1H&#8208;Benzo[4,5]oxazolopyridinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective and stereoselective C&#8722;O activation was achieved for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;arylisoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones. This method set up a new synthetic strategy for C&#8722;N atropisomer synthesis via an enantioselective ring&#8208;opening dynamic kinetic resolution process.







Abstract
The development of new methods for regio&#8208; and stereoselective activation of C&#8722;O bonds in ethers holds significant promise for synthetic chemistry, offering advantages in terms of environmental sustainability and economic efficiency. Moreover, the C&#8722;N atropisomers represent a fascinating and crucial chiral system, extensively found in natural products, pharmaceutical leads, and the frameworks of advanced materials. In this work, we have introduced a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective carbon&#8208;oxygen arylation reaction for atroposelective synthesis of N&#8208;arylisoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones. The high regioselectivity of C&#8722;O cleavage benefits from the high stability of the in&#8197;situ formed (amido)ethenolate via oxidative addition. Additionally, the self&#8208;activation of the aryl C&#8722;O bond facilitates the reaction under mild conditions, leading to outstanding enantioselectivities. The diverse post&#8208;functionalizations of the axially chiral isoquinoline&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones further highlighted the utility of this protocol in preparing valuable C&#8722;N atropisomers, including the chiral phosphine ligands.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Lobatamides A and C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lobatamides are the most complex salicylate enamide natural products known and are expected to be a new class of antitumor agents through V&#8208;ATPase inhibition. The instability of the &#946;&#8208;salicyloxy ester has prevented the late&#8208;stage installation of the enamide side chains, which play a crucial role in the biological activity. Now a common bislactone intermediate has been used for the total synthesis of lobatamides A and C.







Abstract
The total synthesis of lobatamides A (1&#8201;a) and C (1&#8201;c) via a common bislactone intermediate is reported. The allylic aryl moiety including a trisubstituted Z&#8208;olefin was constructed by hydroboration of a 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allene and subsequent Migita&#8208;Kosugi&#8208;Stille coupling. Although the seco acid proved to be highly unstable even in the presence of weak bases, Zhao macrolactonization under acidic conditions via the &#945;&#8208;acyloxyenamide successfully provided the common bislactone intermediate. Hydrozirconation&#8208;iodination of the terminal alkyne and subsequent copper&#8208;mediated coupling with primary amides proceeded successfully in the presence of the sensitive bislactone framework. The developed synthetic route enables the late&#8208;stage installation of enamide side chains, which are crucial structures for V&#8208;ATPase inhibition.

     alt="Total Synthesis of Lobatamides A and C"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobatamides are the most complex salicylate enamide natural products known and are expected to be a new class of antitumor agents through V-ATPase inhibition. The instability of the &#946;-salicyloxy ester has prevented the late-stage installation of the enamide side chains, which play a crucial role in the biological activity. Now a common bislactone intermediate has been used for the total synthesis of lobatamides A and C.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total synthesis of lobatamides A (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;) and C (&lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;) via a common bislactone intermediate is reported. The allylic aryl moiety including a trisubstituted &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-olefin was constructed by hydroboration of a 1,1-disubstituted allene and subsequent Migita-Kosugi-Stille coupling. Although the seco acid proved to be highly unstable even in the presence of weak bases, Zhao macrolactonization under acidic conditions via the &#945;-acyloxyenamide successfully provided the common bislactone intermediate. Hydrozirconation-iodination of the terminal alkyne and subsequent copper-mediated coupling with primary amides proceeded successfully in the presence of the sensitive bislactone framework.

         <title>Bimodal Oxidation Electrochemiluminescence Mechanism of Coreactant&#8208;Embedded Covalent Organic Frameworks via Postsynthetic Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitter (C&#8211;COF) is obtained by covalently linking a covalent organic framework (COF) with a coreactant via a postsynthetic modification strategy, resulting in a 1008&#8208;fold increase in electrochemiluminescence (ECL) intensity compared to the COF with an equivalent external coreactant. Notably, a bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism emerges from the oxidation of the coreactant in the framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) efficiency is determined by charge transfer between coreactants and emitters in coreactant systems, which are usually limited by their slow intermolecular charge transfer. In this study, a covalent organic framework (COF) with aldehyde residue was synthesized, and then coreactants were covalently integrated into the skeleton through the postsynthetic modification strategy, resulting in a crystalline coreactant&#8208;embedded COF nanoemitter (C&#8211;COF). Compared to the pristine COF with an equivalent external coreactant, C&#8211;COF exhibited an extraordinary 1008&#8208;fold enhancement of ECL intensity due to the rapid intrareticular charge transfer. Significantly, with the pH increase, C&#8211;COF shows protonation&#8208;induced ECL enhancement for the first ECL peaked at +1.1&#8197;V and an opposite trend for the second ECL at +1.4&#8197;V, which were attributed to the antedating oxidation of coreactant in framework and COF self&#8208;oxidation, respectively. The resulting bimodal oxidation ECL mechanism was rationalized by spectral characterization and density functional theory calculations. The postsynthetic coreactant&#8208;embedded nanoemitters present innovative and universal avenues for advancing ECL systems.

         <title>Photocatalytic O&#8208; to S&#8208;Rearrangement of Tertiary Cyclopropanols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangement, the development of a photocatalyzed O&#8208; to S&#8208;rearrangement of tertiary thiocarbonyl&#8208;activated cyclopropanol derivatives to access cyclopropanethiols is disclosed. Mechanistic findings enabled a preliminary extension toward other aliphatic alcohol classes. This work is anticipated to inspire new radical approaches to other valuable C(sp3)&#8722;S derivatives from abundant aliphatic feedstocks.







Abstract
Despite the importance of heteroatom&#8208;substituted cyclopropane derivatives in drug design and organic synthesis, cyclopropanethiols remain critically underexplored. Inspired by the wide use of the Newman&#8208;Kwart rearrangement to access valuable thiophenols from phenol feedstocks, we report the development of a photocatalytic approach for efficient ambient temperature aliphatic O&#8208; to S&#8208;rearrangement on tertiary cyclopropanol derivatives. After demonstrating that a range of cyclopropanethiols&#8212;that are difficult to access by other methods&#8212;can be obtained with this strategy, we show that these rearranged products can be easily hydrolyzed and further derivatized. We conclude this study with mechanistic findings that enabled an initial extension of this approach toward other classes of aliphatic alcohols.

         <title>Exfoliation of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks to Give 2D MOF Nanosheets for the Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to synthesize ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets is developed by selective thermal decomposition and liquid nitrogen exfoliation. This method advances the precise control of chemical bonds to give materials that are shown to be active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.







Abstract
The structure and properties of materials are determined by a diverse range of chemical bond formation and breaking mechanisms, which greatly motivates the development of selectively controlling the chemical bonds in order to achieve materials with specific characteristics. Here, an orientational intervening bond&#8208;breaking strategy is demonstrated for synthesizing ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets through balancing the process of thermal decomposition and liquid nitrogen exfoliation. In such approach, proper thermal treatment can weaken the interlayer bond while maintaining the stability of the intralayer bond in the layered MOFs. And the following liquid nitrogen treatment results in significant deformation and stress in the layered MOFs&#8217; structure due to the instant temperature drop and drastic expansion of liquid N2, leading to the curling, detachment, and separation of the MOF layers. The produced MOF nanosheets with five cycles of treatment are primarily composed of nanosheets that are less than 10&#8197;nm in thickness. The MOF nanosheets exhibit enhanced catalytic performance in oxygen evolution reactions owing to the ultrathin thickness without capping agents which provide improved charge transfer efficiency and dense exposed active sites. This strategy underscores the significance of orientational intervention in chemical bonds to engineer innovative materials.

         <title>Fabrication of Self&#8208;Expanding Metal&#8211;Organic Cages Using a Ring&#8208;Openable Ligand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 17, April 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The framework of a metal&#8211;organic cage can be expanded drastically with its topology retained (self&#8208;expansion). A rigid RhII6 cage with an oligomer&#8208;functionalized, stilbene&#8208;type dicarboxylic ligand transformed into a flexible cage upon cleavage of C=C double bond and simultaneous ring&#8208;opening. The dramatic increase in the cavity size enabled the effective trapping of multidentate N&#8208;donor guest molecules.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs), which are formed via coordination&#8208;driven assembly, are being extensively developed for various applications owing to the utility of their accessible molecular&#8208;sized cavity. While MOC structures are uniquely and precisely predetermined by the metal coordination number and ligand configuration, tailoring MOCs to further modulate the size, shape, and chemical environment of the cavities has become intensively studied for a more efficient and adaptive molecular binding. Herein, we report self&#8208;expanding MOCs that exhibit remarkable structural variations in cage size and flexibility while maintaining their topology. A cyclic ligand with an oligomeric chain tethering the two benzene rings of stilbene was designed and mixed with RhII ions to obtain the parent MOCs. These MOCs were successfully transformed into expanded MOCs via the selective cleavage of the double bond in stilbene. The expanded MOCs could effectively trap multidentate N&#8208;donor molecules in their enlarged cavity, in contrast to the original MOCs with a narrow cavity. As the direct synthesis of expanded MOCs is impractical because of the entropically disfavored structures, self&#8208;expansion using ring&#8208;openable ligands is a promising approach that allows precision engineering and the production of functional MOCs that would otherwise be inaccessible.

         <title>Tuning Electron Delocalization of Redox&#8208;Active Porous Aromatic Framework for Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zn&#8211;K Hybrid Batteries with Air Self&#8208;Chargeability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Air self&#8208;charging aqueous batteries promise to integrate energy harvesting technology and battery systems, potentially overcoming a heavy reliance on energy and the spatiotemporal environment. However, the exploitation of multifunctional air self&#8208;charging battery systems using promising cathode materials and suitable charge carriers remains challenging. Herein, for the first time, we developed low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8208;K hybrid ion batteries (AZKHBs) using a fully conjugated hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based porous aromatic framework as the cathode material, exhibiting redox chemistry using K+ as charge carriers, and regulating Zn&#8208;ion solvation chemistry to guide uniform Zn plating/stripping. The unique AZKHBs exhibit the exceptional electrochemical properties in all&#8208;climate. Most importantly, the large potential difference causes the AZKHBs discharged cathode to be oxidized using oxygen, thereby initiating a self&#8208;charging process in the absence of an external power source. Impressively, the air self&#8208;charging AZKHBs can achieve a maximum voltage of 1.15 V, an impressive discharge capacity (466.3 mA h g&#8208;1), and exceptional self&#8208;charging performance even at &#8211;40 &#176;C. Therefore, the development of self&#8208;charging AZKHBs offers a solution to the limitations imposed by the absence of a power grid in harsh environments or remote areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Detergent Chemistry Modulates the Transgression of Planetary Boundaries including Antimicrobial Resistance and Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detergent chemistry enables applications in the world today while harming safe operating spaces that humanity needs for survival. Aim of this review is to support a holistic thought process in the design of detergent chemistry. We harness the planetary boundary concept as a framework for literature survey to identify progresses and knowledge gaps in context with detergent chemistry and five planetary boundaries that are currently transgressed, i.e., climate, freshwater, land system, novel entities, biosphere integrity. Our survey unveils the status of three critical challenges to be addressed in the years to come, including (i) the implementation of a holistically, climate&#8208;friendly detergent industry; (ii) the alignment of materialistic and social aspects in creating technical solutions by means of sustainable chemistry; (iii) the development of detergents that serve the purpose of applications but do not harm the biosphere in their role as novel entities. Specifically, medically relevant case reports revealed that even the most sophisticated detergent design cannot sufficiently accelerate drug discovery to outperform the antibiotic resistance development that detergents simultaneously promote as novel entities. Safe operating spaces that humanity needs for its survival may be secured by directing future efforts beyond sustainable chemistry, resource efficiency, and net zero emission targets.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The late&#8208;stage functionalization of active pharmaceutical ingredients is a key challenge in medicinal chemistry. Furthermore, N&#8208;aryl triazoles and tetrazoles are important structural motifs with the potential to boost the activity of diverse drug molecules. Using easily accessible dibenzothiophenium salts for the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H arylation, these scaffolds were introduced into a variety of bioactive compounds. Our methodology uses cost&#8208;efficient ruthenium, KOAc as a mild base and gives access to a plethora of highly decorated triazole and tetrazole containing drug derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Symmetry and Art: Visualizing the Near&#8208;Symmetry of Molecules in Piet Mondrian&#8217;s De Stijl</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Symmetry and shape are essential aspects of molecular structure and how we interpret molecules and their properties. We, as chemists, are comfortable with pictorial representations of structure, in which some nuance is lost &#8211; investigating molecular shape numerically by looking at how closely it fits a reference, such as a plane, or a set of vectors or coordinates, is informative, though far from engaging. Often relationships between chemical structure and derived values are obscured. Taking our inspiration from Piet Mondrian&#8217;s Compositions, we have depicted the symmetry information encoded within 3D data as blocks of color, to show clearly how chemical arguments and resultant molecular distortion may contribute to symmetry. Great art gives us a new perspective on the world; as a pastiche, this art may allow us to look at familiar molecules, such as porphyrins, in a new light, understanding how their shape and properties are intertwined.</dc:description>

         <title>Construct Phenylethanoid&#160;Glycosides Harnessing Biosynthetic Networks, Protein Engineering and One&#8208;Pot Multienzyme Cascades</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) exhibit a multitude of structural variations linked to diverse pharmacological activities. Assembling various PhGs via multienzyme cascades represents a concise strategy over traditional synthetic methods. However, the challenge lies in identifying a comprehensive set of catalytic enzymes. This study explores biosynthetic PhG reconstruction from natural precursors, aiming to replicate and amplify their structural diversity. We discovered 12 catalytic enzymes, including four novel 6'&#8208;OH glycosyltransferases and three new polyphenol oxidases, revealing the intricate network in PhG biosynthesis. Subsequently, the crystal structure of CmGT3 (2.62 &#197;) was obtained, guiding the identification of conserved residue 144# as a critical determinant for sugar donor specificity. Engineering this residue in PhG glycosyltransferases (FsGT61, CmGT3, and FsGT6) altered their sugar donor recognition. Finally, a one&#8208;pot multienzyme cascade was established, where the combined action of glycosyltransferases and acyltransferases boosted conversion rates by up to 12.6&#8208;fold. This cascade facilitated the reconstruction of 26 PhGs with conversion rates ranging from 5&#8208;100%, and 20 additional PhGs detectable by mass spectrometry. PhGs with extra glycosyl and hydroxyl modules demonstrated notable liver cell protection. This work not only provides catalytic tools for PhGs biosynthesis, but also serves as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for cell&#8208;free enzymatic construction of diverse natural products.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Printing of Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Systems with Linear and Bottlebrush Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We formed core&#8208;shell&#8208;like polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) from an anionic bottlebrush polymer with poly (acrylic acid) side chains with a cationic linear poly (allylamine hydrochloride). By varying the pH, the number of side chains of the polyanionic BB polymers (Nbb), the charge density of the polyelectrolytes, and the salt concentration, the phase separation behavior and salt resistance of the complexes could be tuned by the conformation of the BBs. By combining the linear/bottlebrush polyelectrolyte complexation with all&#8208;liquid 3D printing, flow&#8208;through tubular constructs were produced that showed selective transport across the PEC membrane comprising the walls of the tubules. These tubular constructs afford a new platform for flow&#8208;through delivery systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Unity Red Light Photoluminescence in Antimony Halide Crystals via Polyhedron Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploration of efficient red emitting antimony hybrid halide with large Stokes shift and zero self&#8208;absorption is highly desirable due to its enormous potential for applications in solid light emitting, and active optical waveguides. However, it is still challenging and rarely reported. Herein, a series of (TMS)2SbCl5 (TMS = triphenylsulfonium cation) crystals have been prepared with diverse [SbCl5]2&#8208; configurations and distinctive emission color. Among them, cubic&#8208;phase (TMS)2SbCl5 shows bright red emission with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 90% and a large Stokes shift of 312 nm. In contrast, monoclinic and orthorhombic (TMS)2SbCl5 crystals deliver efficient yellow and orange emission, respectively. Comprehensive structural investigations reveal that larger Stokes shift and longer&#8208;wavelength emission of cubic (TMS)2SbCl5 can be attributed to the larger lattice volume and longer Sb&#183;&#183;&#183;Sb distance, which favor sufficient structural aberration freedom at excited states. Together with robust stability, (TMS)2SbCl5 crystal family has been applied as optical waveguide with ultralow loss coefficient of 3.67&#183;10&#8208;4 dB &#956;m&#8208;1, and shows superior performance in white&#8208;light emission and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. In short, our study provides a novel and fundamental perspective to structure&#8208;property&#8208;application relationship of antimony hybrid halides, which will contribute to future rational design of high&#8208;performance emissive metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the Influence of Electron Migration Inside Polymer Electrolyte on Li+ Transport and Interphase Reconfiguration for Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of highly producible and interfacial compatible in&#8208;situ polymerized electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) have been plagued by insufficient transport kinetics and uncontrollable dendrite propagation. Herein, we seek to explore a rationally designed nanofiber architecture to balance all the criteria of SSLMBs, in which La0.6Sr0.4CoO3&#8208;&#948; (LSC) enriched with high valence&#8208;state Co species and oxygen vacancies is developed as electronically conductive nanofillers embedded within ZnO/Zn3N2&#8208;functionalized polyimide (Zn&#8208;PI) nanofiber framework for the first time, to establish Li+ transport highways for poly vinylene carbonate (PVC) electrolyte and eliminate nonuniform Li deposits. Revealed by characterization and theoretical calculation under electric field, the positive&#8208;negative electrical dipole layer in LSC derived from electron migration between Co and O atoms aids in accelerating Li+ diffusion kinetics through densified electric field around filler particle, featuring a remarkable ionic conductivity of 1.50 mS cm&#8208;1 at 25&#8451; and a high Li+ transference number of 0.91 without the risk of electron leakage. Integrating with the preferential sacrifice of ZnO/Zn3N2 on PI nanofiber upon immediate detection of dendritic Li, which takes part in reconfiguring hierarchical SEI chemistry dominated by LixNy/Li&#8208;Zn alloy inner layer and LiF outer layer, SSLMBs are further endowed with prolonged cycling lifespan and exceptional rate capability.</dc:description>

         <title>Similarities and Differences in Benzene Reduction with Ca, Sr, Yb and Sm: 

Strong Evidence for Tetra&#8208;Anionic Benzene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inverse sandwich complexes of Yb and Sm stabilized by a bulky b&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) ligand have been prepared: (BDI)Ln(h6,h6&#8208;C6H6)Ln(BDI); Ln = lanthanide. Coordinated benzene ligands can be neutral, di&#8208;anionic or, often controversially discussed, even tetra&#8208;anionic. The formal charge on benzene is correlated to assignment of the metal oxidation state which generally poses a problem. Herein, we take advantage of the structural similarities found when comparing CaII with YbII, and SrII with SmII complexes. In this work, we found an excellent overlap of the Ca/Yb inverse sandwich structures but a striking difference for the Sr/Sm pair. The much shorter Sm&#8208;N and Sm&#8208;C6H6 distances are strong evidence for a SmIII&#8208;benzene&#713;4&#8208;SmIII assignment. This was further supported by NMR spectrometry, magnetic susceptibility, reactivity and comprehensive computational investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>Multidimensional electrochemistry decodes the operando mechanism of hydrogen oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Being an efficient approach to the utilization of hydrogen energy, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of particular significance in the current carbon&#8208;neutrality time. Yet the mechanistic picture of the HOR is still blurred, mostly because the elemental steps of this reaction are rapid and highly entangled, especially when deviating from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Here we report a strategy for decoding the HOR mechanism under operando conditions. In addition to the wide&#8208;potential&#8208;range I&#8208;V curves obtained using gas diffusion electrodes, we have applied the AC impedance spectroscopy to provide independent and complementary kinetic information. Combining multidimensional data sources has enabled us to fit, in mathematical rigor, the core kinetic parameter set in a 5&#8208;D data space. The reaction rate of the three elemental steps (Tafel, Heyrovsky, and Volmer reactions), as a function of the overpotential, can thus be distilled individually. Such an undocumented kinetic picture unravels, in detail, how the HOR is controlled by the elemental steps on polarization. Our findings not only offer a better understanding of the HOR mechanism, but also lay the foundation for the development of improved hydrogen energy utilization systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dielectric MXene&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Built Electric Field in Polymer Electrolyte Triggering Fast Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport and High&#8208;Voltage Cycling Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QPE) lithium (Li)&#8208;metal battery holds significant promise in the application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, yet it suffers from low ionic conductivity and poor oxidation stability. Herein, a novel self&#8208;built electric field (SBEF) strategy is proposed to enhance Li+ transportation and accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon&#8208;fluorine bond cleavage in LiTFSI by optimizing the termination of MXene. Among them, the SBEF induced by dielectric Nb4C3F2 MXene effectively constructs highly conductive LiF&#8208;enriched SEI and CEI stable interfaces, moreover, enhances the electrochemical performance of the QPE. The related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism and dual&#8208;reinforced stable interface are thoroughly investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics, COMSOL, XPS depth profiling, and ToF&#8208;SIMS. This comprehensive approach results in a high conductivity of 1.34 mS cm&#8208;1, leading to a small polarization of approximately 25 mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 6000 h. Furthermore, it enables a prolonged cycle life at a high voltage of up to 4.6 V. Overall, this work not only broadens the application of MXene for QPE but also inspires the great potential of the self&#8208;built electric field in QPE&#8208;based high&#8208;voltage batteries.</dc:description>

Despite many reports of the stimuli&#8208;responsive self&#8208;inclusion complex formation, study of the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation has been unexplored. Herein, we report that an electron&#8208;donating host and an electron&#8208;accepting guest conjugate exhibits the structural relaxation from out&#8208;state to in&#8208;state by photoexcitation. Formation of the in&#8208;state in the excited state resulted in exciplex emission along with the locally excited emission from the out&#8208;state. Moreover, this structural relaxation by photoexcitation was suppressed not only by temperature, but also by the presence of guest molecules, resulting in changes in the ratio of the dual emission intensities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stapled Peptide Inhibitor Targeting the Binding Interface of N6&#8208;Adenosine&#8208;Methyltransferase Subunits METTL3 and METTL14 for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>METTL3, a primary methyltransferase catalyzing RNA N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modification, has been identified as an oncogene in several cancer types and thus nominated as a potentially effective target for therapeutic inhibition, although current options using this strategy are limited. In this study, we targeted protein&#8208;protein interactions at the METTL3&#8208;METTL14 binding interface to inhibit complex formation and subsequent catalysis of RNA m6A modification. Among candidate peptides, RM3 exhibited the highest anti&#8208;cancer potency, inhibiting METTL3 activity while also facilitating its proteasomal degradation. We then designed a stapled peptide inhibitor (RSM3) with enhanced peptide stability and formation of the &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure required for METTL3 interaction. Functional and transcriptomic analysis in vivo indicated that RSM3 induced upregulation of programmed cell death&#8208;related genes while inhibiting cancer&#8208;promoting signals. Furthermore, tumor growth was significantly suppressed while apoptosis was enhanced upon RSM3 treatment, accompanied by in&#8208;creased METTL3 degradation, and reduced global RNA methylation levels in two in vivo tumor models. This peptide inhibitor thus exploits a mechanism distinct from other competitive&#8208;binding small molecules to inhibit oncogenic METTL3 activity. Our findings collectively highlight the potential of targeting METTL3 in cancer therapies through peptide&#8208;based inhibition of complex formation and proteolytic degradation.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Topology of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall H2O2 Photogeneration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic oxygen reduction reactions and water oxidation reactions are extremely promising green approaches for massive H2O2 production. Nonetheless, constructing effective photocatalysts for H2O2 generation is critical and still challenging. Since the network topology has significant impacts on the electronic properties of two dimensional (2D) polymers, herein, for the first time, we regulated the H2O2 photosynthetic activity of 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) by topology. Through designing the linking sites of the monomers, we synthesized a pair of novel COFs with similar chemical components on the backbones but distinct topologies. Without sacrificial agents, TBD&#8208;COF with cpt topology exhibited superior H2O2 photoproduction performance (6085 and 5448 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 in O2 and air) than TBC&#8208;COF with hcb topology through the O2&#8208;O2&#8226;&#8208;&#8208;H2O2, O2&#8208;O2&#8226;&#8208;&#8208;O21&#8208;H2O2, and H2O&#8208;H2O2 three paths. Further experimental and theoretical investigations confirmed that during the H2O2 photosynthetic process, the charge carrier separation efficiency, O2&#8226;&#8208; generation and conversion, and the energy barrier of the rate determination steps in the three channels, related to the formation of *OOH, *O21, and *OH, can be well tuned by the topology of COFs. The current study enlightens the fabrication of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for H2O2 production by topological structure modulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Induced Chirality in Canthaxanthin Aggregates Reveals Multiple Levels of Supramolecular Organization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixing chiral polysaccharides with the achiral carotenoid canthaxanthin (CAX) leads to a unique chirality induction, with strong optical activity visible in the electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and resonance Raman optical activity (RROA) spectra. Interpretation of the data using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) modelling suggests an intricate supramolecular structure with multiple carotenoid&#8211;carotenoid interactions.







Abstract
Carotenoids tend to form supramolecular aggregates via non&#8208;covalent interactions where the chirality of individual molecules is amplified to the macroscopic level. We show that this can also be achieved for non&#8208;chiral carotenoid monomers interacting with polysaccharides. The chirality induction in canthaxanthin (CAX), caused by heparin (HP) and hyaluronic acid (HA), was monitored by chiroptical spectroscopy. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectra indicated the presence of multiple carotenoid formations, such as H&#8208; and J&#8208;type aggregates. This is consistent with molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations of the supramolecular structures and their spectroscopic response.

Time&#8208;resolved tandem catalysis: Palladium catalyzes the regioselective Heck reaction between A and B, while triflic acid mediates the skeleton rearrangement of the resulting Heck products D to dihydrofurans C.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 1&#8208;vinylcyclobutanols, the reactivity of 3&#8208;vinylazetidin&#8208;3&#8208;ols 1 and 3&#8208;vinyloxetan&#8208;3&#8208;ols 2 under transition metal catalysis remains largely unexplored. We report herein their unique reactivity under dual palladium and acid catalysis. In the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2(PPh3)2, AgTFA and triflic acid, the reaction of 1 or 2 with aryl iodides affords 2,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydrofurans, which are valuable heterocycles in organic synthesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that this arylative ring&#8208;expansion reaction proceeds via a domino process involving Heck arylation of alkene, acid&#8208;catalyzed transposition of allylic alcohol and ring opening of the azetidine/oxetane by an internal hydroxyl group.

         <title>Cascade Reaction in Organic Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed a new doping strategy by constructing a cascade reaction in organic hole transport layer (HTL) to achieve high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Owing to the dual functions of cascade reaction that is rapid and efficient oxidation and inhibition of sustained erosion from 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine to perovskite, the PSCs with Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.76&#8201;% (certificated of 25.38&#8201;%) with good reproducibility and stability.







Abstract
The doped organic hole transport layer (HTL) is crucial for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the traditional doping strategy undergoes a time&#8208;consuming and environment&#8208;dependent oxidation process, which hinders the technology upgrades and commercialization of PSCs. Here, we reported a new strategy by introducing a cascade reaction in traditional doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, which can simultaneously achieve rapid oxidation and overcome the erosion of perovskite by 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyridine (tBP) in organic HTL. The ideal dopant iodobenzene diacetate was utilized as the initiator that can react with Spiro to generate Spiro&#8901;+ radicals quickly and efficiently without the participation of ambient air, with the byproduct of iodobenzene (DB). Then, the DB can coordinate with tBP through a halogen bond to form a tBP&#8208;DB complex, minimizing the sustained erosion from tBP to perovskite. Based on the above cascade reaction, the resulting Spiro&#8208;based PSCs have a champion PCE of 25.76&#8201;% (certificated of 25.38&#8201;%). This new oxidation process of HTL is less environment&#8208;dependent and produces PSCs with higher reproducibility. Moreover, the PTAA&#8208;based PSCs obtain a PCE of 23.76&#8201;%, demonstrating the excellent applicability of this doping strategy on organic HTL.

Moreover, the PTAA-based PSCs obtain a PCE of 23.76&#8201;%, demonstrating the excellent applicability of this doping strategy on organic HTL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Validating &#916;&#916;G Selectivity Descriptor for Electrosynthesis of H2O2 from Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While descriptor&#8208;based analysis has effectively delineated activity trends, addressing selectivity trends has proven to be a challenging hurdle in the quest to develop innovative catalysts for electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide via 2e&#8208;ORR. This contribution validates the efficacy of a novel selectivity descriptor, &#916;&#916;G, using an extensive library of binary alloys. We demonstrate &#916;&#916;G as the ultimate selectivity descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR.







Abstract
Understanding selectivity trends is a crucial hurdle in the developing innovative catalysts for generating hydrogen peroxide through the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR). The identification of selectivity patterns has been made more accessible through the introduction of a newly developed selectivity descriptor derived from thermodynamics, denoted as &#916;&#916;G introduced in Chem Catal. 2023, 3(3), 100568. To validate the suitability of this parameter as a descriptor for 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity, we utilize an extensive library of 155&#8197;binary alloys. We validate that &#916;&#916;G reliably depicts the selectivity trends in binary alloys reported for their high activity in the 2e&#8208;ORR. This analysis also enables the identification of nine selective 2e&#8208;ORR catalysts underscoring the efficacy of &#916;&#916;G as 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity descriptor. This work highlights the significance of concurrently considering both selectivity and activity trends. This holistic approach is crucial for obtaining a comprehensive understanding in the identification of high&#8208;performance catalyst materials for optimal efficiency in various applications.

         <title>Discovery of Terminal Oxazole&#8208;Bearing Natural Products by a Targeted Metabologenomic Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metabologenomic discovery method for terminal oxazole&#8208;bearing natural products was devised by integrating genomic screening utilizing a PCR primer set for oxazole cyclase genes with spectroscopic detection of oxazole based on the unique 1JCH values and chemical shifts. This metabologenomic method enables the logical and efficient discovery of new microbial natural products with a target structural motif without isotopic labeling.







Abstract
A targeted metabologenomic method was developed to selectively discover terminal oxazole&#8208;bearing natural products from bacteria. For this, genes encoding oxazole cyclase, a key enzyme in terminal oxazole biosynthesis, were chosen as the genomic signature to screen bacterial strains that may produce oxazole&#8208;bearing compounds. Sixteen strains were identified from the screening of a bacterial DNA library (1,000&#8197;strains) using oxazole cyclase gene&#8208;targeting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers. The PCR amplicon sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and classified into nine clades. 1H&#8722;13C coupled&#8208;HSQC NMR spectra obtained from the culture extracts of the hit strains enabled the unequivocal detection of the target compounds, including five new oxazole compounds, based on the unique 1JCH values and chemical shifts of oxazole: lenzioxazole (1) possessing an unprecedented cyclopentane, permafroxazole (2) bearing a tetraene conjugated with carboxylic acid, tenebriazine (3) incorporating two modified amino acids, and methyl&#8208;oxazolomycins A and B (4 and 5). Tenebriazine displayed inhibitory activity against pathogenic fungi, whereas methyl&#8208;oxazolomycins A and B (4 and 5) selectively showed anti&#8208;proliferative activity against estrogen receptor&#8208;positive breast cancer cells. This metabologenomic method enables the logical and efficient discovery of new microbial natural products with a target structural motif without the need for isotopic labeling.

         <title>A Cytochrome P450 Catalyzes Oxidative Coupling Formation of Insecticidal Dimeric Indole Piperazine Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fungal cytochrome P450 (CpsD) and its associated cps cluster were discovered from 37208 CYP450s by genome mining. CpsD catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to give a group of unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight&#8208;ring&#8208;scaffold heterodimeric compounds through the formation of one C&#8722;C and two C&#8722;N bonds. Dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the pest Galleria mellonella.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)&#8208;catalyzed oxidative coupling is an efficient strategy for using simple building blocks to construct complex structural scaffolds of natural products. Among them, heterodimeric coupling between two different monomers is relatively scarce, and the corresponding CYP450s are largely undiscovered. In this study, we discovered a fungal CYP450 (CpsD) and its associated cps cluster from 37208 CYP450s of Pfam PF00067 family member database and subsequently identified a group of new skeleton indole piperazine alkaloids (campesines A&#8722;G) by combination of genome mining and heterologous synthesis. Importantly, CYP450 CpsD mainly catalyzes intermolecular oxidative heterocoupling of two different indole piperazine monomers to generate an unexpected 6/5/6/6/6/6/5/6 eight&#8208;ring scaffold through the formation of one C&#8722;C bond and two C&#8722;N bonds, illuminating its first dimerase role in this family of natural products. The proposed catalytic mechanism of CpsD was deeply investigated by diversified substrate derivatization. Moreover, dimeric campesine G shows good insecticidal activity against the global honeybee pest Galleria mellonella. Our study shows a representative example of discovering new skeleton monomeric and dimeric indole piperazine alkaloids from microbial resources, expands our knowledge of bond formation by CYP450s and supports further development of the newly discovered and engineered campesine family compounds as potential biopesticides.

A fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (FP&#8208;GPE) has been designed and fabricated for high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries (LMBs). The FP&#8208;GPE&#8208;based batteries display excellent electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously even at practical conditions. Moreover, the first reported solid&#8208;state 18650 cylindrical LMBs have been successfully fabricated and demonstrate exceptional safety under mechanical abuse.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) has been hindered by limited cycle&#8208;life and safety concerns. To solve these problems, we develop a novel fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linker for gel polymer electrolyte in high&#8208;voltage LMBs, achieving superior electrochemical performance and high safety simultaneously. The fluorinated phosphate cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (FP&#8208;GPE) by in&#8208;situ polymerization method not only demonstrates high oxidation stability but also exhibits excellent compatibility with lithium metal anode. LMBs utilizing FP&#8208;GPE realize stable cycling even at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#8197;V (vs Li/Li+) with various high&#8208;voltage cathode materials. The LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2|FP&#8208;GPE|Li battery exhibits an ultralong cycle&#8208;life of 1200 cycles with an impressive capacity retention of 80.1&#8201;%. Furthermore, the FP&#8208;GPE&#8208;based batteries display excellent electrochemical performance even at practical conditions, such as high cathode mass loading (20.84&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), ultrathin Li (20&#8197;&#956;m), and a wide temperature range of &#8722;25 to 80&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the first reported solid&#8208;state 18650 cylindrical LMBs have been successfully fabricated and demonstrate exceptional safety under mechanical abuse. Additionally, the industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical LiMn2O4|FP&#8208;GPE|Li4Ti5O12 cells demonstrate a remarkable cycle&#8208;life of 1400 cycles. Therefore, the impressive electrochemical performance and high safety in practical batteries demonstrate a substantial potential of well&#8208;designed FP&#8208;GPE for large&#8208;scale industrial applications.

         <title>Steric&#8208;hindrance Effect Tuned Ion Solvation Enabling High Performance Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of versatile low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety steric&#8208;hindrance electrolytes are fabricated by dissolving large&#8208;sized sucrose biomolecule in aqueous electrolyte for aqueous zinc ion batteries, which possess the uniformly&#8208;distributed and enlarged Zn2+ solvation structure due to the steric&#8208;hindrance effect of sucrose and effectively induce in situ formation of organic and inorganic hybrid SEI, thus affording high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc ion batteries working at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~+40&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Despite many additives have been reported for aqueous zinc ion batteries, steric&#8208;hindrance effect of additives and its correlation with Zn2+ solvation structure have been rarely reported. Herein, large&#8208;sized sucrose biomolecule is selected as a paradigm additive, and steric&#8208;hindrance electrolytes (STEs) are developed to investigate the steric&#8208;hindrance effect for solvation structure regulation. Sucrose molecules do not participate in Zn2+ solvation shell, but significantly homogenize the distribution of solvated Zn2+ and enlarge Zn2+ solvation shell with weakened Zn2+&#8722;H2O interaction due to the steric&#8208;hindrance effect. More importantly, STEs afford the water&#8208;shielding electric double layer and in situ construct the organic and inorganic hybrid solid electrolyte interface, which effectively boost Zn anode reversibility. Remarkably, Zn//NVO battery presents high capacity of 3.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with long cycling stability for over 650&#8197;cycles at lean electrolyte of 4.5&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mg&#8722;1 and low N/P ratio of 1.5, and the stable operation at wide temperature (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C~+40&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Postsynthetically Modified Alkoxide&#8208;Exchanged Ni2(OR)2BTDD: Synergistic Interactions of CO2 with Open Metal Sites and Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through fine&#8208;tuned post&#8208;synthetic modifications, the bridging ligands of Ni2Cl2BTDD were selectively replaced by various alkoxide groups while retaining open metal sites. Alkoxide&#8208;exchanged MOFs showed synergistic CO2 uptake aided by multiple interactions with open metal sites and ligands.







Abstract
Postsynthetic modifications (PSMs) of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) play a crucial role in enhancing material performance through open metal site (OMS) functionalization or ligand exchange. However, a significant challenge persists in preserving open metal sites during ligand exchange, as these sites are inherently bound by incoming ligands. In this study, for the first time, we introduced alkoxides by exchanging bridging chloride in Ni2Cl2BTDD (BTDD=bis (1H&#8208;1,2,3,&#8211;triazolo [4,5&#8208;b],&#8211;[4&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;i]) dibenzo[1,4]dioxin) through PSM. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction data indicated that the alkoxide oxygen atom bridges Ni(II) centers while the OMSs of the MOF are preserved. Due to the synergy of the existing OMS and introduced functional group, the alkoxide&#8208;exchanged MOFs showed CO2 uptakes superior to the pristine MOF. Remarkably, the tert&#8208;butoxide&#8208;substituted Ni_T exhibited a nearly threefold and twofold increase in CO2 uptake compared to Ni2Cl2BTDD at 0.15 and 1&#8197;bar, respectively, as well as high water stability relative to the other exchanged frameworks. Furthermore, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations for Ni_T suggested that CO2 interacts with the OMS and the surrounding methyl groups of tert&#8208;butoxide groups, which is responsible for the enhanced CO2 capacity. This work provides a facile and unique synthetic strategy for realizing a desirable OMS&#8208;incorporating MOF platform through bridging ligand exchange.

         <title>Investigating the Therapeutic Effects of Ferroptosis on Myocardial Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Using a Dual&#8208;Locking Mitochondrial Targeting Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;lock mitochondrial targeting strategy for probe CBS, which incorporates electrostatic forces and probe&#8208;protein docking principles, was firstly proposed and demonstrated. Our work achieved stable and precise visualization of mitochondrial viscosity in triggered and medicated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) and confirmed the therapeutic value of ferroptosis in MIRI







Abstract
Research on ferroptosis in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) using mitochondrial viscosity as a nexus holds great promise for MIRI therapy. However, high&#8208;precision visualisation of mitochondrial viscosity remains a formidable task owing to the debilitating electrostatic interactions caused by damaged mitochondrial membrane potential. Herein, we propose a dual&#8208;locking mitochondria&#8208;targeting strategy that incorporates electrostatic forces and probe&#8208;protein molecular docking. Even in damaged mitochondria, stable and precise visualisation of mitochondrial viscosity in triggered and medicated MIRI was achieved owing to the sustained driving forces (e.g., pi&#8208;cation, pi&#8208;alkyl interactions, etc.) between the developed probe, CBS, and the mitochondrial membrane protein. Moreover, complemented by a western blot, we confirmed that ferrostatin&#8208;1 exerts its therapeutic effect on MIRI by improving the system xc&#8722;/GSH/GPX4 antioxidant system, confirming the therapeutic value of ferroptosis in MIRI. This study presents a novel strategy for developing robust mitochondrial probes, thereby advancing MIRI treatment.

         <title>Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer: A Simple Strategy for an Efficient Visible Light&#8208;Induced Photoclick Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient triplet&#8208;sensitized photoclick reactions of 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone with electron&#8208;rich alkenes is introduced. Photocycloadditions are achieved at low concentrations of triplet photosensitizers under green or orange light, exhibiting a significant bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm compared to conventional systems. This method enables precise control of product distribution using orthogonal blue and green light&#8208;induced photoclick reactions.







Abstract
Photoclick reactions combine the advantages offered by light&#8208;driven processes and classical click chemistry and have found applications ranging from surface functionalization, polymer conjugation, photo&#8208;crosslinking, and protein labeling. Despite these advances, the dependency of most of the photoclick reactions on UV light poses a severe obstacle for their general implementation, as this light can be absorbed by other molecules in the system resulting in their degradation or unwanted reactivity. However, the development of a simple and efficient system to achieve bathochromically shifted photoclick transformations remains challenging. Here, we introduce triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer as a fast and selective way to enable visible light&#8208;induced photoclick reactions. Specifically, we show that 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinones (PQs) can efficiently react with electron&#8208;rich alkenes (ERAs) in the presence of a catalytic amount (as little as 5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) of photosensitizers. The photocycloaddition reaction can be achieved under green (530&#8197;nm) or orange (590&#8197;nm) light irradiation, representing a bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm as compared to the classical PQ&#8208;ERAs system. Furthermore, by combining appropriate reactants, we establish an orthogonal, blue and green light&#8208;induced photoclick reaction system in which the product distribution can be precisely controlled by the choice of the color of light.

         <title>Novel Stereo&#8208;Induction Pattern in Pudovik Addition/Phospha&#8208;Brook Rearrangement Towards Chiral Trisubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and practical methodology has been developed to synthesize axially chiral phosphorus allenes through a PPS&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric Pudovik addition followed by phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement. Mechanistic experiments have demonstrated that the enantio&#8208;determining step is the 1,2&#8208;addition, with the subsequent rearrangement undergoing a central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer.







Abstract
Despite the significance of chiral allene skeletons in catalysis, organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry et&#8197;al., there is a scarcity of reports on axially chiral allenyl phosphorus compounds. Here, we disclosed an efficient and straightforward cascade reaction between ethynyl ketones and phosphine oxides, resulting in a broad array of trisubstituted allenes incorporating a phosphorus moiety in high yields with excellent stereoselectivities facilitated by peptide&#8208;mimic phosphonium salt (PPS) catalysis, Additionally, comprehensive series of mechanistic experiments have been conducted to elucidate that this cascade reaction proceeds via an asymmetric Pudovik addition reaction followed by a subsequent phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement that occurs concomitantly with kinetic resolution, representing a stereospecific rearrangement and protonation process facilitating central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality transfer in a cascade manner. We anticipate that our research will pave the way for a promising exploration of novel stereo&#8208;induction pattern in the Pudovik addition/phospha&#8208;Brook rearrangement cascade reaction.

         <title>Confined&#8208;Coordination Induced Intergrowth of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework into Precise Molecular Sieving Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes with rich functionality and tunable pore system are promising for precise molecular separation; however, it remains a challenge to develop defect&#8208;free high&#8208;connectivity MOF membrane with high water stability owing to uncontrollable nucleation and growth rate during fabrication process. Herein, we report on a confined&#8208;coordination induced intergrowth strategy to fabricate lattice&#8208;defect&#8208;free Zr&#8208;MOF membrane towards precise molecular separation. The confined&#8208;coordination space properties (size and shape) and environment (water or DMF) were regulated to slow down the coordination reaction rate via controlling the counter&#8208;diffusion of MOF precursors (metal cluster and ligand), thereby inter&#8208;growing MOF crystals into integrated membrane. The resulting Zr&#8208;MOF membrane with angstrom&#8208;sized lattice apertures exhibits excellent separation performance both for gas separation and water desalination process. It was achieved H2 permeance of ~1200 GPU and H2/CO2 selectivity of ~67; water permeance of ~8 L&#183;m&#8208;2&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;bar&#8208;1 and MgCl2 rejection of ~95%, which are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes. The molecular transport mechanism related to size&#8208;sieving effect and transition energy barrier differential of molecules and ions was revealed by density functional theory calculations. Our work provides a facile approach and fundamental insights towards developing precise molecular sieving membranes.</dc:description>

         <title>A&#160;2D Acridine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Selective Detection and Efficient Extraction of Gold from Complex Aqueous&#8208;Based Matrices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing candidate materials which possess the ability of both selective detection and efficient capture of precious metal gold is highly desirable for environment and economy. However, most of reported materials only focus on single function, which seriously restricts their practical application as probes or adsorbents. Herein, a two dimensional (2D) acridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TpDa&#8208;COF) is prepared via the linkage of imine bonds for gold detection and adsorption. The synthesized COF can achieve both fluorescence and colorimetric dual sensing for Au3+ in a low concentration range (0.1 &#8211; 1.5 ppm) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.036 ppm. Impressively, the selectivity of TpDa&#8208;COF for the detection of Au3+ is admirable (Fe3+, Fe2+ and Cu2+ for negligible influence on its fluorescence). In addition, TpDa&#8208;COF exhibits ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 982.5 mg&#183;g&#8208;1 for gold at pH = 4, which is attributed the synergistic effect of both selective coordination and reductive process of Au(III) to Au(0). Meanwhile, both positive entropy change (&#916;S = 76.07 J&#183;mol&#8208;1&#183;K&#8208;1) and high distribution coefficient (Kd = 12484.8 mL&#183;g&#8208;1) confirm the good affinity between TpDa&#8208;COF framework and gold. This work gives us a new insight to prepare COF with pyridine nitrogen sites for gold detection and adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Mechanisms of Hypohalous Acid Formation and Electrophilic Halogenation by Non&#8208;Native Halogenases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymatic electrophilic halogenation is a mild tool for functionalization of diverse organic compounds. Only a few groups of native halogenases are capable of catalyzing such a reaction. Here, we used a mechanism&#8208;guided strategy to discover the electrophilic halogenation activity catalyzed by non&#8208;native halogenases. As the ability to form a hypohalous acid (HOX) is key for halogenation, flavin&#8208;dependent monooxygenases/oxidases capable of forming C4a&#8208;hydroperoxyflavin (FlC4a&#8208;OOH) such as dehalogenase, hydroxylases, luciferase and pyranose&#8208;2&#8208;oxidase (P2O), and flavin reductase capable of forming H2O2 were explored for their abilities to generate HOX in situ. Transient kinetic analyses using stopped&#8208;flow spectrophotometry/ fluorometry and product analysis indicate that FlC4a&#8208;OOH in dehalogenases, selected hydroxylases and luciferases, but not in P2O can form HOX; however, the HOX generated from FlC4a&#8208;OOH cannot halogenate their substrates. Remarkably, in situ H2O2 generated by P2O can form HOI and also iodinate various compounds. Because not all enzymes capable of forming FlC4a&#8208;OOH canreact with halides to form HOX, QM/MM calculations, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and structural analysis were carried out to elucidate the mechanism underlying the HOX formation and characterize the active site environment. Our findings shed light on identifying new halogenase scaffolds besides the currently known enzymes and have invoked a new mode of chemoenzymatic halogenations</dc:description>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence Induced by Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Networks in a One&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Manganese(II)&#160;Chloride</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral hybrid metal halides hold great potential as the circularly polarized luminescence light sources. Herein, we have obtained two enantiomeric pairs of one&#8208;dimensional hybrid chiral&#8208;manganese(II) chloride single crystals, R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;methyl piperidine)MnCl3&#160;(R/S&#8208;1) and&#160;R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine)MnCl3 (R/S&#8208;2), crystallizing in non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group P212121. In comparison to&#160;R/S&#8208;1,&#160;R/S&#8208;2&#160;single crystals not only show red emission with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high resistance to thermal quenching but also exhibit circularly polarized luminescence with an asymmetry factor (glum) of 2.5&#215;10&#8722;3, which are attributed to the enhanced crystal rigidity resulting from the hydrogen bonding networks between R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine) cations and [MnCl6]4&#8208; chains. The circularly polarized luminescence activities originate from the asymmetric [MnCl6]4&#8208; luminophores induced by the N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl hydrogen bonding with R/S&#8208;(3&#8208;hydroxy piperidine). Moreover, these samples demonstrate great application potential in circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes and X&#8208;ray scintillators. This work shows a highly efficient photoluminescent Mn&#8208;based halide and offers a strategy for designing multifunctional chiral metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Pd0 by Cu Alloying: Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Pd3Cu Electrocatalyst for Anodic Methanol Carbonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbonylation of CO and CH3OH to dimethyl carbonate (DMC) on metallic palladium (Pd) electrode offers a promising strategy for C1 valorization at the anode. However, its broader application is limited by the high working potential and the low DMC selectivity accompanied with severe methanol self&#8208;oxidation. Herein, our theoretical analysis of the intermediate adsorption interactions on both Pd0&#160;and Pd4+&#160;surfaces revealed that inevitable reconstruction of Pd surface under strongly oxidative potential diminishes its CO adsorption capacity, thus damaging the DMC formation. Further theoretical modeling indicates that doping Pd with Cu not only stabilizes low&#8208;valence Pd in oxidative environments but also lowers the overall energy barrier for DMC formation. Guided by this insight, we developed a facile two&#8208;step thermal shock method to prepare PdCu alloy electrocatalysts for DMC. Remarkably, the predicted Pd3Cu demonstrated the highest DMC selectivity among existing Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts, reaching a peaked DMC selectivity of 93% at 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. (Quasi) in&#8208;situ spectra investigations further confirmed the predicted dual role of Cu dopant in promoting Pd&#8208;catalyzed DMC formation.</dc:description>

         <title>DOTA&#8208;based plectin&#8208;1 targeted contrast agent enables detection of pancreatic cancer in human tissue</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy with extremely poor patient survival rates. A key reason for the poor prognosis is the lack of effective diagnostic tools to detect the disease at curable, premetastatic stages. Tumor surgical resection is PDAC first&#8208;line treatment, however distinguishing between cancerous and healthy tissue with current imaging tools remains a challenge. In this work, we report a DOTA&#8208;based fluorescent probe targeting plectin&#8208;1 for imaging PDAC with high specificity. To enable heterogeneous functionalization of the DOTA&#8208;core with multiple targeting peptide units and the fluorophore, a novel, fully clickable synthetic route that proceeds in one&#8208;pot was developed. Extensive validation of the probe set the stage for PDAC detection in mice and human tissue. Altogether, these findings may pave the way for improved clinical understanding and early detection of PDAC progression as well as more accurate resection criteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Disaggregation&#8208;Activated pan&#8208;COX Imaging Agents for Human Soft Tissue Sarcoma</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cancer stem cells are pivotal players in tumors initiation, growth, and metastasis. While several markers have been identified, there remain challenges particularly in heterogeneous malignancies like adult soft tissue sarcomas, where conventional markers are inherently overexpressed. Here, we designed BODIPY scaffold fluorescence probes (BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1,&#160;BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2) that activate via disaggregation targeting for cyclooxygenase (COX), a potential marker for CSCs in sarcoma in clinical pathology.&#160; Based on their structures,&#160;BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1&#160;showcased higher susceptibility to disaggregation compared to&#160;BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;2, consistent with their selective interaction with COX.&#160;Notably, the&#160;BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1&#160;revealed positive cooperativity binding to COX&#8208;2 at sub&#8208;micromolar ranges. Both probes showed significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on upon LPS or PMA triggered COX&#8208;2 upregulation in live RAW264.7, HeLa, and human sarcoma cell line (Saos&#8208;LM2) up to 2&#8208;fold increase with negligible toxicity. More importantly, the&#160;BD&#8208;IMC&#8208;1&#160;demonstrated their practical imaging for COX&#8208;2 positive cells in paraffin&#8208;fixed human sarcoma tissue. Considering the fixed tissues are most practiced pathological sample, our finding suggests a potential of disaggregation activated chemosensor for clinical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The CF3 Group as a Synthon of the CF+ Unit in Palladium&#160;Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The homoleptic trifluoromethyl&#8208;palladium(II) complex [Pd(CF3)4]2&#8722; (1) is shown to be highly active towards amines. Thus, when treated with primary amines RNH2, it readily undergoes aminolysis of one of the CF3 ligands affording the isocyanide complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CNR)]&#8722; (R = aryl). In this process the original CF3 group undergoes total defluorination. Interestingly, the reaction of 1 with secondary amines R2NH proceeds with loss of just two F&#8208;substituents, whereby the Fischer&#8208;type fluoroaminocarbene complexes [(CF3)3Pd(CFNR2)]&#8722; are formed (R = Et, Ph). The reaction of 1 with diamines affords different [(CF3)3Pd(NHC)]&#8722; complexes containing sterically non&#8208;demanding NHC ligands. Representative examples of various topologies are reported based on the common imidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene or benzimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene rings as well as the expanded&#8208;ring perimidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene. This metal&#8208;tailored synthetic route, where a CF3 group acts as a pre&#8208;carbenic unit, is unprecedented in the vast NHC&#8208;chemistry. It takes place under very mild conditions and is envisaged to be extensible to other non&#8208;isolable NHC ligands. The key difluorocarbene intermediate [(CF3)3Pd(CF2)]&#8722; is experimentally detected.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering Anion&#8208;Modulated Solvation Structure for Calcium Intercalation into Graphite for Ca&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Co&#8208;intercalation reactions make graphite a feasible anode in Ca ion batteries, yet the correlation between Ca ion intercalation behaviors and electrolyte structure remains unclear. This study, for the first time, elucidates the pivotal role of anions in modulating the Ca ion solvation structures and their subsequent intercalation into graphite. Specifically, the electrostatic interactions between Ca ion and anions govern the configurations of solvated&#8208;Ca&#8208;ion in dimethylacetamide&#8208;based electrolytes and graphite intercalation compounds. Among the anions considered (BH4&#8211;, ClO4&#8211;, TFSI&#8211; and [B(hfip)4]&#8211;), the coordination of four solvent molecules per Ca ion (CN=4) leads to the highest reversible capacities and the fastest reaction kinetics in graphite. Our study illuminates the origins of the distinct Ca ion intercalation behaviors across various anion&#8208;modulated electrolytes, employing a blend of experimental and theoretical approaches. Importantly, the practical viability of graphite anodes in Ca&#8208;ion full cells is confirmed, showing significant promise for advanced energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Tandem Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Click Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Sugar&#8208;Modified Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nucleic acids in the form of siRNA, antisense oligonucleotides or mRNA are currently explored as new promising modalities in the pharmaceutical industry. Particularly, the success of mRNA&#8208;vaccines against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, along with the successful development of the first sugar&#8208;modified siRNA therapeutics has inspired the field. The development of nucleic acid therapeutics requires efficient chemistry to link oligonucleotides to chemical structures that can improve stability, boost cellular uptake, or enable specific targeting. For the siRNA therapeutics currently in use, modification of the 3&#8217;&#8208;end of the oligonucleotides with triple&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)3 was shown to be of significance. This modification is currently achieved via a cumbersome multi&#8208;step synthesis and subsequent loading onto the solid support material. Here, we report the development of a bifunctional click&#8208;reactive linker that allows the modification of oligonucleotides in a tandem click reaction with multiple sugars, regardless of the position within the oligonucleotide, with remarkable efficiency and in a one&#8208;pot reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Kinetic Resolution of Monohydrosilanes via Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intramolecular Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic access of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes remains a big challenge, and largely depends on the desymmetrization of the symmetric precursors with two identical substitutes attached to the silicon atom. Here we report the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic organosilanes via catalytic kinetic resolution of racemic monohydrosilanes with good to excellent selectivity factors. Both Si&#8208;stereogenic dihydrobenzosiloles and Si&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes could be efficiently accessed in one single operation via Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective intramolecular hydrosilylation, employing (R,R)&#8208;Et&#8208;DuPhos as the optimal ligand. This catalytic protocol features mild conditions, low catalyst loading (0.1 mol% [Rh(cod)Cl]2), high stereoinduction (S factor up to 152), and excellent scalability. Moreover, further derivatizations led to the efficient synthesis of uncommon middle&#8208;size (7&#8208; and 8&#8208;membered) Si&#8208;stereogenic silacycles. Preliminary mechanistic study indicates this reaction might undergo a modified Chalk&#8208;Harrod mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Al&#8208;Al Dual&#8208;Atomic Site for Efficient Artificial Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of ammonia by electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising alternative to the Haber&#8208;Bosch process. However, it is commonly obstructed by the high activation energy. Here, we report the design and synthesis of an Al&#8208;Al bonded dual atomic catalyst stabilized within an amorphous nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon matrix (Al2NC) with high NRR performance. The dual atomic Al2&#8208;sites act synergistically to catalyze the complex multiple steps of NRR through adsorption and activation, enhancing the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This Al2NC catalyst exhibits a high Faradic efficiency of 16.56&#177;0.3% with a yield rate of 29.22&#177;1.2 &#181;g.h&#8208;1.mgcat&#8208;1. The dual atomic Al2NC catalyst shows long&#8208;term repeatable, and stable NRR performance. This work presents an insight into the identification of synergistic dual atomic catalytic site and mechanistic pathway for the electrochemical conversion of N2 to NH3.</dc:description>

         <title>Unraveling the Dynamic Molecular Motions of a Twin&#8208;Cavity Cage with Slow Configurational but Rapid Conformational Interconversions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Featuring diverse structural motions/changes, dynamic molecular systems hold promise for executing complex tasks. However, their structural complexity presents formidable challenge in elucidating their kinetics, especially when multiple structural motions are intercorrelated. We herein introduce a twin&#8208;cavity cage that features interconvertible C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;configurations, each configuration exhibiting interchangeable P&#8208; and M&#8208;conformations. This molecule is therefore composed of four interconnected chiral species (P)&#8208;C3, (M)&#8208;C3, (P)&#8208;C1, (M)&#8208;C1. We showcase an effective methodology to decouple these sophisticated structural changes into two kinetically distinct pathways. Utilizing time&#8208;dependent 1H NMR spectroscopy at various temperatures, which disregards the transition between mirror&#8208;image conformations, we first determine the rate constant (kc) for C3&#8208; to C1&#8208;configuration interconversion; while time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism spectroscopy at different temperatures quantifies the observed rate constant (kobs) of ensemble of all structural changes. As kobs &gt;&gt; kc, it allows us to decouple the overall molecular motions into a slow configurational transformation and rapid conformational interconversions, the latter further dissected into two independent conformational interchanges, namely (P)&#8208;C3 &#8644; (M)&#8208;C3 and (P)&#8208;C1 &#8644; (M)&#8208;C1. This work therefore sheds light on comprehensive kinetic study of complex molecular dynamics, offering valuable insights for the rational design of smart dynamic materials for applications of sensing, separation, catalysis, molecular machinery, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Commercializable Naphthalene Diimide Anolytes for Neutral Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Neutral aqueous organic redox flow batteries (AORFBs) hold the potential to facilitate the transition of renewable energy sources from auxiliary to primary energy, the commercial production of anolyte materials still suffers from insufficient performance of high&#8208;concentration and the high cost of the preparation problem. To overcome these challenges, this study provides a hydrothermal synthesis methodology and introduces the charged functional groups into hydrophobic naphthalene diimide cores, and prepares a series of high&#8208;performance naphthalene diimide anolytes. Under the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and H&#8208;bonding networks, the naphthalene diimide exhibits excellent structural stability and the highest water solubility (1.85 M for dex&#8208;NDI) reported to date. By employing the hydrothermal method, low&#8208;cost naphthalene diimides are successfully synthesized on a hundred&#8208;gram scale&#160;of $0.16 g&#8208;1 ($2.43 Ah&#8208;1), which is also the lowest price reported to date. The constructed full battery achieves a high electron concentration of 2.4 M, a high capacity of 54.4 Ah L&#8208;1, and a power density of 318 mW cm&#8208;2 with no significant capacity decay observed during long&#8208;duration cycling. These findings provide crucial support for the commercialization of AORFBs and pave the way for revolutionary developments in neutral AORFBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Ice Microstructures and Hydration States of Acridinium Iodide Studied by Phosphorescence Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ice has been suggested to have played a significant role in the origin of life partly owing to its ability to concentrate organic molecules and promote reaction efficiency. However, the techniques for studying organic molecules in ice are absorption&#8208;based, which limits the sensitivity of measurements. Here we introduce an emission&#8208;based method to study organic molecules in water ice: the phosphorescence displays high sensitivity depending on the hydration state of an organic salt probe, acridinium iodide (ADI). The designed ADI aqueous system exhibits phosphorescence that can be severely perturbed when the temperature is higher than 110 K at a concentration of the order of 10&#8208;5M, indicating changes in hydration for ADI. Using the ADI phosphorescent probe, it is found that the microstructures of water ice, i.e., crystalline vs. glassy, can be strongly dictated by a trace amount (as low as 10&#8208;5M) of water&#8208;soluble organic molecules. Consistent with cryoSEM images and temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectral data, the ADI is dehydrated in more crystalline ice and hydrated in more glassy ice. The current investigation serves as a starting point for using more sensitive spectroscopic techniques for studying water&#8208;organics interactions at a much lower concentration and wider temperature range.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Evolution in Neutral Media by Differential Intermediate Binding at Charge&#8208;Modulated Sites of a Bimetallic Alloy Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential binding of H* and OH* on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of amorphous Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam, resulting in an ultralow overpotential of 50&#177;9&#8197;mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The energy barrier to dissociate neutral water has been lowered by the differential intermediate binding on the charge&#8208;modulated metal centers of Co85Mo15 sheets supported on Ni&#8208;foam (NF), where the overpotential for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1&#8197;M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) is only 50&#177;9&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. It has a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.18&#8197;s&#8722;1, mass activity of 13.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;200&#8197;mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and produces 16&#8197;ml H2 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;300&#8197;mV vs. RHE, more than double that of 20&#8201;% Pt/C. The Mo&#948;+ and Co&#948;&#8722; sites adsorb OH*, and H*, respectively, and the electron injection from Co to H&#8722;O&#8722;H cleaves the O&#8722;H bond to form the Mo&#8722;OH* intermediate. Operando spectral analyses indicate a weak H&#8208;bonded network for facilitating the H2O*/OH* transport, and a potential&#8208;induced reversal of the charge density from Co to the more electronegative Mo, because of the electron withdrawing Co&#8722;H* and Mo&#8722;OH* species. Co85Mo15/NF can also drive the complete electrolysis of neutral water at only 1.73&#8197;V (10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). In alkaline, and acidic media, it demonstrates a Pt&#8208;like HER activity, accomplishing &#8722;1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 161&#177;7, and 175&#177;22&#8197;mV, respectively.

         <title>Directed Electron Delivery from a Pb&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite to a Co(II) Molecular Catalyst Boosts CO2 Photoreduction Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal halide photocatalyst immobilized with a molecular catalyst achieves an optimal performance for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation to O2, which mainly benefits from the rapid directional electron transfer from the metal halide to the catalyst via its carboxyl anchors.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction is appealing to address energy and environmental issues, while it is challenging to avoid using toxic metals and organic sacrificial reagents. We here immobilize a family of cobalt phthalocyanine catalysts on Pb&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets with delicate control on the anchors of the cobalt catalysts. Among them, the molecular hybrid photocatalyst assembled by carboxyl anchors achieves the optimal performance with an electron consumption rate of 300&#177;13&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation to O2, over 8&#8197;times of the unmodified Cs2AgBiBr6 (36&#177;8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1), also far surpassing the documented systems (&lt;150&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Besides the improved intrinsic activity, electrochemical, computational, ex&#8208;/in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopic results indicate that the electrons photogenerated at the Bi atoms of Cs2AgBiBr6 can be directionally transferred to the cobalt catalyst via the carboxyl anchors which strongly bind to the Bi atoms, substantially facilitating the interfacial electron transfer kinetics and thereby the photocatalysis.

         <title>Bypassing Ammonia: From N2 to Nitrogen Heterocycles without N1 Intermediates or Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new heterocyclic species are prepared from diboradiazene compounds, thus completing two&#8208;step routes to complex N&#8208;heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.







Abstract
Diboradiazene compounds, derived in one step from the boron&#8208;mediated reduction of dinitrogen (N2), were treated separately with sulfur and acetic anhydride, providing heterocyclic compounds that are BN isosteres of thiophene and 1,3&#8208;oxazole, respectively. These simple reactions represent the final steps in two&#8208;step routes to complex heterocycles from N2 that both circumvent the need for transition metal reagents and completely bypass the traditional intermediate ammonia.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Metabolic Glycosylation Reporters Enable Detection of Protein O&#8722;GlcNAcylation in Living Cells without S&#8208;Glyco Modification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Norbornene&#8208;modified glycosyl phosphates with suitable protecting groups enable labeling of O&#8722;GlcNAcylated proteins by metabolic glycoengineering without artificial modification of cysteine residues. A subsequent inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction is used to introduce a fluorescent tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) label at O&#8722;GlcNAc sites allowing the imaging of protein&#8208;specific O&#8722;GlcNAcylation within living cells.







Abstract
Protein O&#8722;GlcNAcylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification of cytosolic and nuclear proteins involved in numerous fundamental regulation processes. Investigation of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation by metabolic glycoengineering (MGE) has been carried out for two decades with peracetylated N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine derivatives modified with varying reporter groups. Recently, it has been shown that these derivatives can result in non&#8208;specific protein labeling termed S&#8208;glyco modification. Here, we report norbornene&#8208;modified GlcNAc derivatives with a protected phosphate at the anomeric position and their application in MGE. These derivatives overcome two limitations of previously used O&#8722;GlcNAc reporters. They do not lead to detectable S&#8208;glyco modification, and they efficiently react in the inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reaction, which can be carried out even within living cells. Using a derivative with an S&#8208;acetyl&#8208;2&#8208;thioethyl&#8208;protected phosphate, we demonstrate the protein&#8208;specific detection of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation of several proteins and the protein&#8208;specific imaging of O&#8722;GlcNAcylation inside living cells by F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) visualized by confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM).

         <title>Electrochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An economical and efficient electrochemical Ni&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrogenation is described. The reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. Notably, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides can be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation of alkene and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection.







Abstract
Olefin hydrogenation is one of the most important transformations in organic synthesis. Electrochemical transition metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation is an attractive approach to replace the dangerous hydrogen gas with electrons and protons. However, this reaction poses major challenges due to rapid hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of metal&#8208;hydride species that outcompetes alkene hydrogenation step, and facile deposition of the metal catalyst at the electrode that stalls reaction. Here we report an economical and efficient strategy to achieve high selectivity for hydrogenation reactivity over the well&#8208;established HER. Using an inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable nickel salt as the catalyst, this mild reaction features outstanding substrate generality and functional group compatibility, and distinct chemoselectivity. In addition, hydrodebromination of alkyl and aryl bromides could be realized using the same reaction system with a different ligand, and high chemoselectivity between hydrogenation and hydrodebromination could be achieved through ligand selection. The practicability of our method has been demonstrated by the success of large&#8208;scale synthesis using catalytic amount of electrolyte and a minimal amount of solvent. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic studies were performed, which support a NiII/0 catalytic cycle and the pre&#8208;coordination of the substrate to the nickel center.

         <title>Heterodyne&#8208;Detected Sum&#8208;Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy Reveals Aqueous Molecular Structure at the Suspended Graphene/Water Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using surface&#8208;specific HD&#8208;SFG vibrational spectroscopy, we examine water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface, finding that the SFG response mainly arises from the topmost 1&#8211;2&#8197;water layers, with minimal contribution from the graphene itself. Graphene weakly interacts with the interfacial water by lowering the vibrational frequency of the dangling O&#8722;H group, with a very slight impact on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;H group.







Abstract
Graphene, a transparent two&#8208;dimensional conductive material, has brought extensive new perspectives and prospects to various aqueous technological systems, such as desalination membranes, chemical sensors, energy storage, and energy conversion devices. Yet, the molecular&#8208;level details of graphene in contact with aqueous electrolytes, such as water orientation and hydrogen bond structure, remain elusive or controversial. Here, we employ surface&#8208;specific heterodyne&#8208;detected sum&#8208;frequency generation (HD&#8208;SFG) vibrational spectroscopy to re&#8208;examine the water molecular structure at a freely suspended graphene/water interface. We compare the response from the air/graphene/water system to that from the air/water interface. Our results indicate that the 
 spectrum recorded from the air/graphene/water system arises from the topmost 1&#8211;2&#8197;water layers in contact with the graphene, with the graphene itself not generating a significant SFG response. Compared to the air/water interface response, the presence of monolayer graphene weakly affects the interfacial water. Graphene weakly affects the dangling O&#8722;H group, lowering its frequency through its interaction with the graphene sheet, and has a very small effect on the hydrogen&#8208;bonded O&#8722;H group. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm our experimental observation. Our work provides molecular insight into the interfacial structure at a suspended graphene/water interface, relevant to various technological applications of graphene.

Graphene weakly affects the dangling O&#8722;H group, lowering its frequency through its interaction with the graphene sheet, and has a very small effect on the hydrogen-bonded O&#8722;H group. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm our experimental observation. Our work provides molecular insight into the interfacial structure at a suspended graphene/water interface, relevant to various technological applications of graphene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Switchable Peroxidase/Catalase&#8208;Like Activity of Carbon Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) are synthesized using polyaniline as a precursor. O/N&#8208;CQDs possess photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity that can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity dynamically. Using such an artificial &#8220;light switch&#8221;, it is feasible to autonomously manipulate the ROS level that is adaptive to the development of diseases, providing an intelligent therapeutic strategy for precise medicine.







Abstract
Nanozymes possess multi&#8208;enzyme activities over the natural enzymes, which produce multi&#8208;pathway synergistic effects for varies of biomedical applications. Unfortunately, their multi&#8208;enzyme activities are in fighting, significantly reducing the synergistic effects. Dynamic regulation of their multi&#8208;enzyme activities is the bottleneck for intelligent therapies. Herein, we construct a novel oxygen&#8208;nitrogen functionalized carbon quantum dots (O/N&#8208;CQDs) with peroxidase&#8208;like (Reactive oxygen species (ROS) producer) activity. Interestingly, the peroxidase&#8208;like activity can be reversibly converted to catalase&#8208;like (ROS scavenger) activity under visible light irradiation. It is found that both the peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs can be precisely manipulated by the light intensity. The mechanism of switchable enzyme activities is attributed to the polarization of quinoid nitrogen in polyaniline (PANI) precursor retained on O/N&#8208;CQDs under visible light, which consumes the ROS to produce O2 and H2O. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, we are able to non&#8208;intrusively up and down regulate the ROS level in cells successfully by simply switching off and on the light respectively, potentially facilitating the precise medicine based on the development of the disease. Indeed, the photo&#8208;switchable peroxidase/catalase&#8208;like activity of O/N&#8208;CQDs opens a non&#8208;invasive strategy for better manipulations of the multi&#8208;activity of nanozymes, promising their wider and more intelligent biomedical applications.

         <title>Optimizing Molecular Crystallinity and Suppressing Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling in Completely Non&#8208;Fused Ring Electron Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) can enhance dipole moment and induce more positive surface electrostatic potential, contributing to the compact and diverse molecular stacking, thus promoting exciton delocalization for efficient charge generation. Besides, AHS suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination loss and enabling PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 to yield the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V.







Abstract
High open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) organic solar cells (OSCs) have received increasing attention because of their promising application in tandem devices and indoor photovoltaics. However, the lack of a precise correlation between molecular structure and stacking behaviors of wide band gap electron acceptors has greatly limited its development. Here, we adopted an asymmetric halogenation strategy (AHS) and synthesized two completely non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), HF&#8208;BTA33 and HCl&#8208;BTA33. The results show that AHS significantly enhances the molecular dipoles and suppresses electron&#8208;phonon coupling, resulting in enhanced intramolecular/intermolecular interactions and decreased nonradiative decay. As a result, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HF&#8208;BTA33 realizes a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.42&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.232&#8197;V, higher than that of symmetric analogue F&#8208;BTA33 (PCE=10.02&#8201;%, Voc=1.197&#8197;V). Notably, PTQ10&#8201;:&#8201;HCl&#8208;BTA33 achieves the highest PCE of 12.54&#8201;% with a Voc of 1.201&#8197;V due to the long&#8208;range ordered &#960;&#8211;&#960; packing and enhanced surface electrostatic interactions thereby facilitating exciton dissociation and charge transport. This work not only proves that asymmetric halogenation of completely NFREAs is a simple and effective strategy for achieving both high PCE and Voc, but also provides deeper insights for the precise molecular design of low cost completely NFREAs.

         <title>Enantioselective Hydrofunctionalization of Cyclobutenones: Total Synthesis of gem&#8208;Dimethylcyclobutane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sequential enantioselective reduction/trapping/cross&#8208;coupling reaction of cyclobutenones furnished an array of chiral trans&#8208;2,3&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;4,4&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanones. The developed strategy was applied in the syntheses of several gem&#8208;dimethylcyclobutane&#8208;containing natural products, including (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, (&#8722;)&#8208;rumphellanones A&#8722;C, (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#946;,9&#945;H&#8208;5&#8208;linoleoyloxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;secocaryophyllen&#8208;4&#8208;one, and (&#8722;)&#8208;raikovenal.







Abstract
Cyclobutanes with a gem&#8208;dimethyl group are common motifs in natural products. However, strategies for constructing enantioenriched gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutanes are still underdeveloped. Herein, we report an enantioselective approach to synthesize a broad group of chiral 2,3&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutanones through sequential 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition/trapping/cross&#8208;coupling of readily available cyclobutenones. The intermediate 2&#8208;bromocyclobutanone provides a valuable synthetic handle for further coupling transformations. In addition, this strategy was successfully utilized to synthesize gem&#8208;dimethyl cyclobutane&#8208;containing natural products, including (+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;caryophyllene, (&#8722;)&#8208;raikovenal, (&#8722;)&#8208;1&#946;,9&#945;H&#8208;5&#8208;linoleoyloxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;secocaryophyllen&#8208;4&#8208;one, and (&#8722;)&#8208;rumphellanones A&#8722;C.

         <title>Responsive Anionophores with AND Logic Multi&#8208;Stimuli Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular platform for accessing stimuli&#8208;responsive anionophores, triggered by multiple stimuli of biological relevance including light, redox, and an esterase, is reported, and accessed via post&#8208;synthetic modification of a dynamic hydrogen bonding anionophore. By utilizing two different cages, a responsive anionophore with AND logic activation, requiring two different stimuli, was achieved.







Abstract
Artificial ion transport systems have emerged as an important class of compounds that promise applications in chemotherapeutics as anticancer agents or to treat channelopathies. Stimulus&#8208;responsive systems that offer spatiotemporally controlled activity for targeted applications remain rare. Here we utilize dynamic hydrogen bonding interactions of a 4,6&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;isophthalamide core to generate a modular platform enabling access to stimuli&#8208;responsive ion transporters that can be activated in response to a wide variety of external stimuli, including light, redox, and enzymes, with excellent OFF&#8208;ON activation profiles. Alkylation of the two free hydroxyl groups with stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties locks the amide bonds through intramolecular hydrogen bonding and hence makes them unavailable for anion binding and transport. Triggering using a particular stimulus to cleave both cages reverses the hydrogen bonding arrangement, to generate a highly preorganized anion binding cavity for efficient transmembrane transport. Integration of two cages that are responsive to orthogonal stimuli enables multi&#8208;stimuli activation, where both stimuli are required to trigger transport in an AND logic process. Importantly, the strategy provides a facile method to post&#8208;functionalize the highly active transporter core with a variety of stimulus&#8208;responsive moieties for targeted activation with multiple triggers.

         <title>Acoustic Levitation Synthesis of Ultrahigh&#8208;Density Spherical Nucleic Acid Architectures for Specific SERS Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an acoustic levitation reactor for universal, green, and container&#8208;free synthesis of SNAs with ultra&#8208;high DNA density. In addition to the dehydration effect, we reveal for the first time that ultra&#8208;high density DNA grafting derived from acoustic waves reconfigures the ligands on the colloidal surface. Such architectures enable the in situ untargeted SERS tracking of cell events and targeted biomarker diagnosis, facilitated by the DNA shell's ability to construct a 3D SERS hotspot matrix with tunable and controllable nanogaps.







Abstract
Controllably regulating the electrostatic bilayer of nanogold colloids is a significant premise for synthesizing spherical nucleic acid (SNA) and building ordered plasmonic architectures. We develop a facile acoustic levitation reactor to universally synthesize SNAs with an ultra&#8208;high density of DNA strands, which is even higher than those of various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods. Results reveal a new mechanism of DNA grafting via acoustic wave that can reconfigure the ligands on colloidal surfaces. The acoustic levitation reactor enables substrate&#8208;free three&#8208;dimentional (3D) spatial assembly of SNAs with controllable interparticle nanogaps through regulating DNA lengths. This kind of architecture may overcome the plasmonic enhancement limits by blocking electron tunneling and breaking electrostatic shielding in dried aggregations. Finite element simulations support the architecture with 3D spatial plasmonic hotspot matrix, and its ultrahigh surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) capability is evidenced by in situ untargeted tracking of biomolecular events during photothermal stimulation (PTS)&#8208;induced cell death process. For biomarker diagnosis, the conjugation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer onto SNAs enables in situ targeted tracking of ATP during PTS&#8208;induced cell death process. Particularly, the CD71 receptor and integrin &#945;3&#946;1 protein on PL45&#8197;cell membrance could be well distinguished by label&#8208;free SERS fingerprints when using specific XQ&#8208;2d and DML&#8208;7 aptamers, respectively, to synthesize SNA architectures. Our current acoustic levitation reactor offers a new method for synthesizing SNAs and enables both targeted and untargeted SERS analysis for tracking molecular events in living systems. It promises great potentials in biochemical synthesis and sensing in future.

         <title>Boosting Cathode Activity and Anode Stability of Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Vigorous Iodic Species Triggered by Nitrate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;nitrate (I2&#8722;LiNO3)&#8208;containing ether&#8208;based electrolyte has been applied to Li&#8722;S battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode. The I&#8722;/HI&#8208;induced polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is inhibited in the presence of nitrate. The nitrate can chemically oxidize I&#8722;/HI to I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722;, which play a crucial role to accelerate cathode conversion reaction and rejuvenate anode dead Li simultaneously. With the modified electrolyte, Li&#8722;S battery demonstrates long calendar life, high energy density and power efficiency.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery with a sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode is a promising alternative to Li&#8208;ion systems. However, the sluggish charge transfer of cathode and accumulation of inactive Li on anode remain persistent challenges. An advanced electrolyte additive with function towards both cathode and anode holds great promise to address these issues. Herein, we present a new strategy to boost sulfur activity and rejuvenate dead Li simultaneously. In the polar electrolyte containing I2&#8722;LiNO3 additives, I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are triggered significantly by the reaction between NO3&#8722; and I&#8722; ions. The I3&#8722;/IO3&#8722; are reactive to insulated Li2S product of cathode and inactive Li on anode, thus accelerating the conversion reaction of sulfur and recovering Li sources back to battery cycling. The in situ/ex situ spectroscopic and morphologic monitoring reveal the crucial role of iodine in promoting Li2S dissociation and inhibiting dendritic Li growth. With the modified electrolyte, the symmetric Li||Li cells deliver a lifespan of 4000&#8197;h with an overpotential less than 12&#8197;mV at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. For Li&#8722;S cells, 100&#8201;% capacity retention up to thousands of cycles and enhanced rate capability are available. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy on electrolyte engineering for practical applications of Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;Driven Toughening of Interpenetrated Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive networks are synthesized with distinct polymer arrangements of the polymers. The structure of the network impacts the materials properties in both the resting state, and in the presence of carbodiimide fuels which transiently form anhydride crosslinks. Interpenetrated materials in the fueled state have superior fracture and compressive properties.







Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated that temporary crosslinks in polymer networks generated by chemical &#8220;fuels&#8221; afford materials with large, transient changes in their mechanical properties. This can be accomplished in carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polymer hydrogels using carbodiimides, which generate anhydride crosslinks with lifetimes on the order of minutes to hours. Here, the impact of the polymer network architecture on the mechanical properties of transiently crosslinked materials was explored. Single networks (SNs) were compared to interpenetrated networks (IPNs). Notably, semi&#8208;IPN precursors that give IPNs on treatment with carbodiimide give much higher fracture energies (i.e., resistance to fracture) and superior resistance to compressive strain compared to other network architectures. A precursor semi&#8208;IPN material featuring acrylic acid in only the free polymer chains yields, on treatment with carbodiimide, an IPN with a fracture energy of 2400&#8197;J/m2, a fourfold increase compared to an analogous semi&#8208;IPN precursor that yields a SN. This resistance to fracture enables the formation of macroscopic complex cut patterns, even at high strain, underscoring the pivotal role of polymer architecture in mechanical performance.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering for Oriented Crystal Growth toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Anode for Aqueous Zinc Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar nucleation and oriented growth of (002) crystal plane is visualized by in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy on an Ag&#8208;modified surface. The high solubility of Ag in Zn metal enables formation of solid solution buffer layer with greatly decreased nucleation barrier. The preferential orientation of deposition exhibits dendrite&#8208;free morphology with suppressed side reactions, meriting the high Zn utilization and improved electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Zn deposition with a surface&#8208;preferred (002) crystal plane has attracted extensive attention due to its inhibited dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the nucleation and growth of the Zn(002) crystal plane are closely related to the interfacial properties. Herein, oriented growth of Zn(002) crystal plane is realized on Ag&#8208;modified surface that is directly visualized by in situ atomic force microscopy. A solid solution HCP&#8208;Zn (~1.10&#8197;at.&#8201;% solubility of Ag, 30&#8201;&#176;C) is formed on the Ag coated Zn foil (Zn@Ag) and possesses the same crystal structure as Zn to reduce its nucleation barrier caused by their lattice mismatch. It merits oriented Zn deposition and corrosion&#8208;resistant surface, and presents long cycling stability in symmetric cells and full cells coupled with V2O5 cathode. This work provides insights into interfacial regulation of Zn anodes for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc metal batteries.

         <title>Experimental Evidence for Non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;Contact J Coupling Across Chalcogen Bonds in Ionic Salt Cocrystal Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental evidence for non&#8208;Fermi&#8208;contact contributions to J couplings across chalcogen bonds is presented for a pair of newly discovered ionic cocrystal polymorphs. Large and anisotropic J(125Te, 79/81Br) coupling and 79/81Br quadrupolar coupling tensor magnitudes measured via 125Te and 79/81Br solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provide new experimental insight into the nature of the chalcogen bond.







Abstract
A pair of novel polymorphic ionic cocrystals of 3,4&#8208;dicyanotelluradiazole and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are synthesized and are characterized by single&#8208;crystal XRD. Strong and directional non&#8208;covalent chalcogen bonds (ChB) between Te and Br are analyzed via solid&#8208;state NMR to reveal large and anisotropic J(125Te,79/81Br) coupling tensors, providing unequivocal evidence for non&#8208;Fermi contact contributions across ChBs. Along with large 79/81Br quadrupolar couplings for the Br&#8722; anions, these data provide new tools to characterize chalcogen bonds and to differentiate between ChB polymorphs.

Large and anisotropic &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te, &lt;sup&gt;79/81&lt;/sup&gt;Br) coupling and &lt;sup&gt;79/81&lt;/sup&gt;Br quadrupolar coupling tensor magnitudes measured via &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te and &lt;sup&gt;79/81&lt;/sup&gt;Br solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provide new experimental insight into the nature of the chalcogen bond.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of novel polymorphic ionic cocrystals of 3,4-dicyanotelluradiazole and tetraphenylphosphonium bromide are synthesized and are characterized by single-crystal XRD. Strong and directional non-covalent chalcogen bonds (ChB) between Te and Br are analyzed via solid-state NMR to reveal large and anisotropic &lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te,&lt;sup&gt;79/81&lt;/sup&gt;Br) coupling tensors, providing unequivocal evidence for non-Fermi contact contributions across ChBs. Along with large &lt;sup&gt;79/81&lt;/sup&gt;Br quadrupolar couplings for the Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, these data provide new tools to characterize chalcogen bonds and to differentiate between ChB polymorphs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imidazole&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Hydroxide Enabling the Li+ Desolvation/Diffusion Reaction and Flame Retardant Catalytic Dynamics for Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;ion batteries have found extensive applications due to their high energy density and low self&#8208;discharge rates, spanning from compact consumer electronics to large&#8208;scale energy storage facilities. Despite their widespread use, challenges such as inherent capacity degradation and the potential for thermal runaway hinder sustainable development. In this study, we introduce a unique approach to synthesize anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, specifically imidazole&#8208;intercalated cobalt hydroxide. This innovative material significantly enhances the Li+ desolvation/diffusion reaction and flame&#8208;retardant dynamics through complexing and catalytic synergetic effects. The lithium&#8208;ion batteries incorporating these materials demonstrate exceptional performance, boasting an impressive capacity retention of 997.91 mAh g&#8208;1 after 500 cycles. This achievement can be attributed to the optimization of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interface engineering, effectively mitigating anode degradation and minimizing electrolyte consumption. Experimental and theoretical calculations validate these improvements. Importantly, imidazole intercalated Co(OH)2 (MI&#8208; Co(OH)2) exhibits a remarkable catalytic effect on electrolyte carbonization and the conversion of CO to CO2. This dual action suppresses smoke and reduces toxicity significantly. The presented work introduces a novel approach to realizing high&#8208;performance and safe lithium&#8208;ion batteries, addressing key challenges in the pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Libraries of Structurally Diverse Macrocycles Suitable for Membrane Permeation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocycles offer an attractive format for drug development due to their good binding properties and potential to cross cell membranes. To efficiently identify macrocyclic ligands for new targets, methods for the synthesis and screening of large combinatorial libraries of small cyclic peptides were developed, many of them using thiol groups for efficient peptide macrocyclization. However, a weakness of these libraries is that invariant thiol&#8208;containing building blocks such as cysteine are used, resulting in a region that does not contribute to library diversity but increases molecule size. Herein, we synthesized a series of structurally diverse thiol&#8208;containing elements and used them for the combinatorial synthesis of a 2,688&#8208;member library of small, structurally diverse peptidic macrocycles with unprecedented skeletal complexity. We then used this library to discover potent thrombin and plasma kallikrein inhibitors, some also demonstrating favorable membrane permeability. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of macrocycle&#8208;target complexes showed that the size and shape of the newly developed thiol elements are key for binding. The strategy and library format presented in this work significantly enhance structural diversity by allowing combinatorial modifications to a previously invariant region of peptide macrocycles, which may be broadly applied in the development of membrane permeable therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ Formation of Platinum&#8208;Carbon Catalysts in Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The catalytic production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction in the chemical industry. By combining operando transmission electron microscopy with density functional theory analysis, we show that the intercalation and ordering of carbon on Pt interstitials to form Pt&#8208;C solid solutions is relevant for increasing propylene production. More specifically, we found that at the point of enhanced propylene formation, the structure of platinum nanoparticles is transformed into a transient caesium chloride&#8208;type Pt&#8208;C polymorph. At more elevated temperatures, the zincblende and rock salt polymorphs seemingly coexist. When propylene production was highest, multiple crystal structures consisting of Pt and carbon were occasionally found to coexist in one individual nanoparticle, distorting the Pt lattice. Catalyst coking was detected at all stages of the reaction, but did initially not affect all particles. These findings could lead to the development of novel synthesis strategies towards tailoring highly efficient PDH catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We disclose a Ni&#8208;catalyzed cyclization/alkylmetal interception reaction in which products are readily linearized to permit regiodefined alkene dicarbofunctionalization. This method offers a convenient route to access 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles, 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes and 4&#8208;arylalkanols with the formation of C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp3) bonds at primary and secondary alkyl carbon centers. In this reaction, a silicon&#8208;oxygen (Si&#8208;O) bond functions as a detachable linker that can be delinked with several hydride, alkyl, aryl and vinyl nucleophiles to create profusely functionalized 3&#8208;hydroxysilanes. A silicon motif in the cyclic C(sp3)&#8208;Si&#8208;O construct in 1,2&#8208;oxasilolane heterocycles can also be selectively deleted by Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrodesilylation affording Si&#8208;ablated linear alcohol products reminiscent of vicinal ethylene dicarbofunctionalization with C(sp3) and C(sp2) carbon sources.</dc:description>

         <title>PolyBorylated Alkenes as Energy&#8208;Transfer Reactive Groups: Access to Multi&#8208;Borylated Cyclobutanes Combined with Hydrogen Atom Transfer Event</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While polyborylated alkenes are being recognized for their elevated status as highly valuable reagents in modern organic synthesis, allowing efficient access to a diverse array of transformations, including the formation of C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatom bonds, their potential as energy&#8208;transfer reactive groups has remained unexplored. Yet, this potential holds the key to generating elusive polyborylated biradical species, which can be captured by olefins, thereby leading to the construction of new highly&#8208;borylated scaffolds. Herein, we report a designed energy&#8208;transfer strategy for photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloadditions of poly&#8208;borylated alkenes with various olefins enabling the regioselective synthesis of diverse poly&#8208;borylated cyclobutane motifs, including the 1,1&#8208;di&#8208;, 1,1,2&#8208;tri&#8208;, and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra&#8208;borylated cyclobutanes. In fact, these compounds belong to a family that presently lacks efficient synthetic pathways. Interestingly, when &#945;&#8208;methylstyrene was used, the reaction involves an interesting 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer. Mechanistic deuterium&#8208;labeling studies have provided insight into the outcome of 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer process. In addition, the polyborylated cyclobutanes are then demonstrated to be useful in selective oxidation processes resulting in the formation of cyclobutanones and &#947;&#8208;lactones.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;selective Deoxygenative Coupling of Aliphatic Alcohols: Installation of Methyl Groups including Isotopic Labels by Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling reactions of two aliphatic alcohol derivatives remain a challenge. Herein, we report a nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive methylation reaction of aliphatic mesylates with methyl tosylate. This reaction provides straightforward access to compounds bearing aliphatic methyl groups from alkyl alcohol derivatives. Isotopically labelled substrates and reagents can be employed in the reaction to provide perdeuterated and 13C&#8208;labelled products. This transformation can be achieved by employing stoichiometric Mn reductant or electrochemically. Additionally, mechanistic experiments show that alkyl iodides are key intermediates in the transformation which undergo a stereoablative reaction via radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>In situ/Operando Synchrotron Analytical Techniques for CO2/CO Reduction Reaction: From Atomic Scales to Mesoscales</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhancing the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro&#8208;environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable. Synchrotron radiation has been recognized as a versatile characterization platform, garnering widespread attention owing to its high brightness, elevated flux, excellent directivity, strong polarization and exceptional stability. This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron analytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fourth&#8208;generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron analytical techniques is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Polymerized Spiro&#8208;Type Interfacial Molecule toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;polymerized spiro&#8208;type interfacial molecule, v&#8208;spiro is designed and exhibit superior intermolecular interactions and intrinsic hole mobility compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. The resulting polymeric protective layer successfully mitigated moisture degradation and ion migration in perovskite film. Poly&#8208;v&#8208;spiro&#8208;treated PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 24.54&#8201;% with voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, accompanied by improved stability.







Abstract
In the pursuit of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, spiro&#8208;OMeTAD has demonstrated recorded power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), however, the stability issue remains one of the bottlenecks constraining its commercial development. In this study, we successfully synthesize a novel self&#8208;polymerized spiro&#8208;type interfacial molecule, termed v&#8208;spiro. The linearly arranged molecule exhibits stronger intermolecular interactions and higher intrinsic hole mobility compared to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Importantly, the vinyl groups in v&#8208;spiro enable in situ polymerization, forming a polymeric protective layer on the perovskite film surface, which proves highly effective in suppressing moisture degradation and ion migration. Utilizing these advantages, poly&#8208;v&#8208;spiro&#8208;based device achieves an outstanding efficiency of 24.54&#8201;%, with an enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.173&#8197;V and a fill factor of 81.11&#8201;%, owing to the reduced defect density, energy level alignment and efficient interfacial hole extraction. Furthermore, the operational stability of unencapsulated devices is significantly enhanced, maintaining initial efficiencies above 90&#8201;% even after 2000&#8197;hours under approximately 60&#8201;% humidity or 1250&#8197;hours under continuous AM&#8197;1.5G sunlight exposure. This work presents a comprehensive approach to achieving both high efficiency and long&#8208;term stability in PSCs through innovative interfacial design.

         <title>A Vitrimer Acts as a Compatibilizer for Polyethylene and Polypropylene Blends</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer can compatibilize a polymer blend. By adding a relatively small amount of a vitrimer made of siloxane&#8208;crosslinked high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), we successfully compatibilized unmodified HDPE and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend exhibited enhanced elongation at break (120&#8201;%) and smaller iPP domain sizes (0.4&#8197;&#956;m) compared to the control blend (22&#8201;% elongation at break, 0.9&#8197;&#956;m iPP droplet size).







Abstract
Polymer compatibilization plays a critical role in achieving polymer blends with favorable mechanical properties and enabling efficient recycling of mixed plastic wastes. Nonetheless, traditional compatibilization methods often require tailored designs based on the specific chemical compositions of the blends. In this study, we propose a new approach for compatibilizing polymer blends using a dynamically crosslinked polymer network, known as vitrimers. By adding a relatively small amount (1&#8211;5&#8197;w/w%) of a vitrimer made of siloxane&#8208;crosslinked high&#8208;density polyethylene (HDPE), we successfully compatibilized unmodified HDPE and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend exhibited enhanced elongation at break (120&#8201;%) and smaller iPP domain sizes (0.4&#8197;&#956;m) compared to the control blend (22&#8201;% elongation at break, 0.9&#8197;&#956;m iPP droplet size). Moreover, the vitrimer&#8208;compatibilized blend showed significantly improved microphase stability during annealing at 180&#8201;&#176;C. This straightforward method shows promise for applications across various polymer blend systems.

         <title>Single&#8208;Particle and Single&#8208;Molecule Characterization of Immobilized Enzymes: A Multiscale Path toward Optimizing Heterogeneous Biocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the operando characterization of immobilized enzymes at the single&#8208;particle (SP) and single&#8208;molecule (SM) levels reveal valuable information about their functional properties, thus unlocking the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysis for biotechnological applications.







Abstract
Heterogeneous biocatalysis is highly relevant in biotechnology as it offers several benefits and practical uses. To leverage the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysts, the establishment of well&#8208;crafted protocols, and a deeper comprehension of enzyme immobilization on solid substrates are essential. These endeavors seek to optimize immobilized biocatalysts, ensuring maximal enzyme performance within confined spaces. For this aim, multidimensional characterization of heterogeneous biocatalysts is required. In this context, spectroscopic and microscopic methodologies conducted at different space and temporal scales can inform about the intraparticle enzyme kinetics, the enzyme spatial distribution, and the mass transport issues. In this Minireview, we identify enzyme immobilization, enzyme catalysis, and enzyme inactivation as the three main processes for which advanced characterization tools unveil fundamental information. Recent advances in operando characterization of immobilized enzymes at the single&#8208;particle (SP) and single&#8208;molecule (SM) levels inform about their functional properties, unlocking the full potential of heterogeneous biocatalysis toward biotechnological applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Multilevel Memristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique structural and electronic properties of two one&#8208;dimensional (1D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely COF&#8208;MDA and COF&#8208;ODA, were rationally designed to assess their capabilities in multilevel memory devices. This study further explored the potential of these COF&#8208;based memristors in realizing energy&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;density memory devices, and also showcased their potential for neuromorphic applications for the first time.







Abstract
Memristors are essential components of neuromorphic systems that mimic the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neurons. In this study, a novel approach employing one&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (1D COF) films was explored to enhance the performance of memristors. The unique structural and electronic properties of two 1D COF films (COF&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenedianiline (MDA) and COF&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxydianiline (ODA)) offer advantages for multilevel resistive switching, which is a key feature in neuromorphic computing applications. By further introducing a TiO2 layer on the COF&#8208;ODA film, a built&#8208;in electric field between the COF&#8208;TiO2 interfaces could be generated, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing COFs as a platform for constructing memristors with tunable resistive states.

     alt="One-Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework-Based Multilevel Memristors for Neuromorphic Computing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique structural and electronic properties of two one-dimensional (1D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), namely COF-MDA and COF-ODA, were rationally designed to assess their capabilities in multilevel memory devices. This study further explored the potential of these COF-based memristors in realizing energy-efficient and high-density memory devices, and also showcased their potential for neuromorphic applications for the first time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memristors are essential components of neuromorphic systems that mimic the synaptic plasticity observed in biological neurons. In this study, a novel approach employing one-dimensional covalent organic framework (1D COF) films was explored to enhance the performance of memristors. The unique structural and electronic properties of two 1D COF films (COF-4,4&#8242;-methylenedianiline (MDA) and COF-4,4&#8242;-oxydianiline (ODA)) offer advantages for multilevel resistive switching, which is a key feature in neuromorphic computing applications. By further introducing a TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer on the COF-ODA film, a built-in electric field between the COF-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces could be generated, demonstrating the feasibility of utilizing COFs as a platform for constructing memristors with tunable resistive states. The 1D nanochannels of these COF structures contributed to the efficient modulation of electrical conductance, enabling precise control over synaptic weights in neuromorphic circuits. This study also investigated the potential of these COF-based memristors to achieve energy-efficient and high-density memory devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Canoe&#8208;Like Pd0 or Pt0 Alloyed Copper Alkynyl Nanoclusters Display Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six racemic copper nanoclusters (NCs) alloyed with Pd0 or Pt0 were synthesized, showing a distorted hexagonal antiprism Pd0/Pt0@Cu12 cage. Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; can replace one or two alkynyl ligands through ligand exchange. All the NCs exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence with emission peaks (705&#8211;755&#8197;nm), lifetimes (6.630&#8211;9.662&#8197;&#956;s), and absolute quantum yields (1.75&#8201;%&#8211;2.52&#8201;%) in their crystalline state.







Abstract
Alloying nanoclusters (NCs) has emerged as a widely explored and versatile strategy for tailoring tunable properties, facilitating in&#8208;depth atomic&#8208;level investigations of structure&#8208;property correlations. In this study, we have successfully synthesized six atomically precise copper NCs alloyed with Group 10 metals (Pd or Pt). Notably, the Pd0 or Pt0 atom situated at the center of the distorted hexagonal antiprism Pd0/Pt0@Cu12 cage, coordinated with twelve Cu+ and two tBuC&#8801;C&#8722; ligands. Moreover, ligand exchange strategies demonstrated the potential for Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722; to replace one or two alkynyl ligands positioned at the top or side of the NCs. The chirality exhibited by these racemic NCs is primarily attributed to the involvement of halogens and a chiral (Pd/Pt)@Cu18 skeleton. Furthermore, all the NCs exhibit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence, characterized by emission peaks at 705&#8211;755&#8197;nm, lifetimes ranging from 6.630 to 9.662&#8197;&#956;s, and absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 1.75&#8201;%&#8211;2.52&#8201;% in their crystalline state. The experimental optical properties of these NCs are found to be in excellent agreement with the results of theoretical calculations. These alloy NCs not only offer valuable insights into the synthesis of Pd0/Pt0&#8208;Cu alloy NCs, but also bridge the gap in understanding the structure&#8208;luminescence relationships of Pd0/Pt0&#8208;Cu molecules.

         <title>Synthetic Peptides with Genetic&#8208;Codon&#8208;Tailored Affinity for Assembling Tetraspanin CD81 at Cell Interfaces and Inhibiting Cancer Metastasis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first peptidyl ligand targeting the intrinsically disordered region of tetraspanin CD81 has been identified. By forming steric complementarity with CD81, the peptide enables in situ tracking of the dynamic distribution of CD81 at cell&#8208;contact interfaces. Further blockage of cell migration highlights the key role of the target motif of CD81 in cell communication, which presents the peptide as a functional inhibitor against cancer growth and metastasis.







Abstract
Probing biomolecular interactions at cellular interfaces is crucial for understanding and interfering with life processes. Although affinity binders with site specificity for membrane proteins are unparalleled molecular tools, a high demand remains for novel multi&#8208;functional ligands. In this study, a synthetic peptide (APQQ) with tight and specific binding to the untargeted extracellular loop of CD81 evolved from a genetically encoded peptide pool. With tailored affinity, APQQ flexibly accesses, site&#8208;specifically binds, and forms a complex with CD81, enabling in&#8208;situ tracking of the dynamics and activity of this protein in living cells, which has rarely been explored because of the lack of ligands. Furthermore, APQQ triggers the relocalization of CD81 from diffuse to densely clustered at cell junctions and modulates the interplay of membrane proteins at cellular interfaces. Motivated by these, efficient suppression of cancer cell migration, and inhibition of breast cancer metastasis were achieved in vivo.

         <title>Boosting Electrocatalytic Ethylene Epoxidation by Single Atom Modulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse single atom Ru&#8208;doped KIr4O8 nanowire catalyst, with electronic structures of adjacent Ir sites being modulated by single Ru atoms, is developed for electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation to ethylene oxide (EO). It achieves an EO partial current density up to 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of ethylene oxide (EO) using ethylene and water under ambient conditions presents a low&#8208;carbon alternative to existing industrial production process. Yet, the electrocatalytic ethylene epoxidation route is currently hindered by largely insufficient activity, EO selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Here we report a single atom Ru&#8208;doped hollandite structure KIr4O8 (KIrRuO) nanowire catalyst for efficient EO production via a chloride&#8208;mediated ethylene epoxidation process. The KIrRuO catalyst exhibits an EO partial current density up to 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and an EO yield as high as 92.0&#8201;%. The impressive electrocatalytic performance towards ethylene epoxidation is ascribed to the modulation of electronic structures of adjacent Ir sites by single Ru atoms, which stabilizes the *CH2CH2OH intermediate and facilitates the formation of active Cl2 species during the generation of 2&#8208;chloroethanol, the precursor of EO. This work provides a single atom modulation strategy for improving the reactivity of adjacent metal sites in heterogeneous electrocatalysts.

         <title>Exploring Pyroelectricity, Thermal and Photochemical Switching in a Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Crystal by In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials based on known molecular photoswitches show great potential for the rational design of new pyro&#8208; and ferroelectric photoswitches. This article shows how in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction using thermal, photochemical and electrical stimuli can explore structure&#8211;property relationships in the novel pyroelectric (FA)[NaFe(CN)6(NO]).H2O, enabling a deeper understanding of its complex energy landscape via structural&#8208;dynamics calculations.







Abstract
The switching behavior of the novel hybrid material (FA)Na[Fe(CN)5(NO)].H2O (1) in response to temperature (T), light irradiation and electric field (E) is studied using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). Crystals of 1 display piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, second and third harmonic generation. XRD shows that the FA+ are disordered at room&#8208;temperature, but stepwise cooling from 273&#8211;100&#8197;K induces gradual ordering, while cooling under an applied field (E=+40&#8197;kVcm&#8722;1) induces a sudden phase change at 140&#8197;K. Structural&#8208;dynamics calculations suggest the field pushes the system into a region of the structural potential&#8208;energy surface that is otherwise inaccessible, demonstrating that application of T and E offers an effective route to manipulating the crystal chemistry of these materials. Photocrystallography also reveals photoinduced linkage isomerism, which coexists with but is not correlated to other switching behaviors. These experiments highlight a new approach to in situ studies of hybrid materials, providing insight into the structure&#8211;property relationships that underpin their functionality.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Modification and Degradation of Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presented within is a selective electrochemical decarboxylative route to synthesize olefin&#8208;acrylate copolymers by post&#8208;polymerization modification, which are difficult to synthesize by direct polymerization. In addition, the electrochemical decarboxylative methodology provides a targeted approach to the degradation of polymethacrylates. This approach provides an attractive route to the modification and chemical recyclability of polymers.







Abstract
We demonstrate that electrochemical&#8208;induced decarboxylation enables reliable post&#8208;polymerization modification and degradation of polymers. Polymers containing N&#8208;(acryloxy)phthalimides were subjected to electrochemical decarboxylation under mild conditions, which led to the formation of transient alkyl radicals. By installing these redox&#8208;active units, we systematically modified the pendent groups and chain ends of polyacrylates. This approach enabled the production of poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) and poly(propylene&#8208;co&#8208;methyl acrylate) copolymers, which are difficult to synthesize by direct polymerization. Spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques reveal these transformations are near&#8208;quantitative on several polymer systems. Electrochemical decarboxylation also enables the degradation of all&#8208;methacrylate poly(N&#8208;(methacryloxy)phthalimide&#8208;co&#8208;methyl methacrylate) copolymers with a degradation efficiency of &gt;95&#8201;%. Chain cleavage is achieved through the decarboxylation of the N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide ester and subsequent &#946;&#8208;scission of the backbone radical. Electrochemistry is thus shown to be a powerful tool in selective polymer transformations and controlled macromolecular degradation.

         <title>An Isolable One&#8208;Coordinate Lead(I) Radical with Strong g&#8208;Factor Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first lead&#8208;centered radical containing a one&#8208;coordinate Pb atom was isolated and fully characterized. It possesses two&#8208;fold orbital pseudo&#8208;degeneracy and hence substantial unquenched orbital angular momentum, as manifested by hitherto strongest g&#8208;factor anisotropy amongst main group radicals.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;based radicals in the oxidation state of +1 are elusive species and are highly challenging to isolate in the condensed phase. In this study, we present the synthesis and characterization of the first isolable free plumbylyne radical 2 bearing a one&#8208;coordinate Pb(I) atom. It reacts with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to afford a two&#8208;coordinate NHC&#8208;ligated Pb(I) radical 3. 2 and 3 represent the first isolable Pb(I)&#8208;based radicals. Theoretical calculations and electron paramagnetic resonance analysis revealed that the unpaired electron mainly resides at the Pb 6p orbital in both radicals. Owing to the unique one&#8208;coordinate nature of the Pb atom in 2, it possesses two&#8208;fold orbital pseudo&#8208;degeneracy and substantial unquenched orbital angular momentum, and exhibits hitherto strongest g&#8208;factor anisotropy (gx,y,z=1.496, 1.166, 0.683) amongst main group radicals. Preliminary investigations into the reactivity of 2 unveiled its Pb&#8208;centered radical nature, and plumbylenes were isolated as products.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Strategy Tailoring Molecular Structures of Dopant&#8208;Free Hole Transport Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DTTP&#8208;ThSO is designed by dual&#8208;strategy method combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering, which can construct six&#8208;membered ring through S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent conformation lock. DTTP&#8208;ThSO exhibits high hole mobility, good energy level matching, and strong defect passivation ability. The dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs achieve an impressive PCE of 23.3&#8201;% with an FF of 82.3&#8201;%, among the highest performance n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs with dopant&#8208;free HTMs.







Abstract
Dopant&#8208;free hole transport materials (HTMs) are ideal materials for highly efficient and stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but most current design strategies for tailoring the molecular structures of HTMs are limited to single strategy. Herein, four HTMs based on dithienothiophenepyrrole (DTTP) core are devised through dual&#8208;strategy methods combining conjugate engineering and side chain engineering. DTTP&#8208;ThSO with ester alkyl chain that can form six&#8208;membered ring by the S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O noncovalent conformation lock with thiophene in the backbone shows good planarity, high&#8208;quality film, matching energy level and high hole mobility, as well as strong defect passivation ability. Consequently, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.3&#8201;% with a nice long&#8208;term stability is achieved by dopant&#8208;free DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based PSCs, representing one of the highest values for un&#8208;doped organic HTMs based PSCs. Especially, the fill factor (FF) of 82.3&#8201;% is the highest value for dopant&#8208;free small molecular HTMs&#8208;based n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs to date. Moreover, DTTP&#8208;ThSO&#8208;based devices have achieved an excellent PCE of 20.9&#8201;% in large&#8208;area (1.01&#8197;cm2) devices. This work clearly elucidates the structure&#8208;performance relationships of HTMs and offers a practical dual&#8208;strategy approach to designing dopant&#8208;free HTMs for high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Cancer Cell&#8208;Selective PD&#8208;L1 Inhibition via a DNA Safety Catch to Enhance Immunotherapy Specificity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, a duplex DNA strand, was assembled on PD&#8722;L1 to control its accessibility by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) reagent. ICB reagent was a retractable DNA nanostring (DNS), whose contraction drove PD&#8722;L1 clustering and corresponding degradation. 4T1&#8197;cell membrane protein c&#8208;Met controlled ICB reagent binding and achieved cancer cell selective PD&#8722;L1 inhibition. This strategy enhanced immunotherapeutic specificity.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint protein blockade (ICB) has emerged as a powerful immunotherapy approach, but suppressing immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) for noncancerous cells and normal tissues remains challenging. Activatable ICB has been developed with tumor microenvironment highly&#8208;expressed molecules as stimuli, but they still lack precision and efficiency considering the diffusion of stimuli molecules in whole tumor tissue. Here we assemble PD&#8722;L1 with a duplex DNA strand, termed as &#8220;safety catch&#8221;, to regulate its accessibility for ICB. The safety catch remains at &#8220;on&#8221; status for noncancerous cells to prevent ICB binding to PD&#8722;L1. Cancer cell membrane protein c&#8208;Met acts as a trigger protein to react with safety catch, which selectively exposes its hybridization region for ICB reagent. The ICB reagent is a retractable DNA nanostring with repeating hairpin&#8208;structural units, whose contraction drives PD&#8722;L1 clustering with endocytosis&#8208;guided degradation. The safety catch, even remained at &#8220;safety on&#8221; status, is removed from the cell membrane via a DNA strand displacement reaction to minimize its influence on noncancerous cells. This strategy demonstrates selective and potent immunotherapeutic capabilities only against cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and shows effective suppression of irAEs in normal tissues, therefore would become a promising approach for precise immunotherapy in mice.

         <title>Alkoxycarbonyl Groups in Metalloesters Showing Oxocarbenium&#8208;like Structure and Alkylating Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first series of Co/Ni bimetallic metalloesters bearing the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups are synthesized and characterized. As triggered by the long O&#8722;Calkyl bonds (1.522(11)~1.607(15)&#8197;&#197;), the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups toward a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism was examined at ambient conditions.







Abstract
In contrast to the well&#8208;documented acylating reactivity, the alkylating reactivity of the alkoxycarbonyl group, as signified by its oxocarbenium&#8208;like resonance structure, remains almost unexplored. Herein, the first series of Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters exhibiting the novel oxocarbenium&#8208;like alkoxycarbonyl groups were synthesized and characterized. In these deformed alkoxycarbonyl groups, the Ccarbonyl&#8722;Oalkoxyl bonds were contracted to 1.177(11)~1.191(9)&#8197;&#197; with the elongations of the Ccarbonyl=Ocarbonyl bonds to 1.368(13)~1.441(9)&#8197;&#197;. Meanwhile, the O&#8722;Calkyl bonds were also elongated to 1.522(11) ~1.607(15)&#8197;&#197;, and were by far the longest O&#8722;Calkyl bonds reported for alkoxycarbonyl groups. As triggered by the long O&#8722;Calkyl distances, the alkylating reactivity of the oxocarbenium&#8208;like methoxycarbonyl group towards a series of C/N/O&#8208;nucleophiles via the rare BAL2 mechanism at ambient conditions was examined. Furthermore, the homo&#8208;etherifications of alcohols mediated by the Co/Ni dinuclear metalloesters were investigated.

         <title>Activating and Stabilizing a Reversible four Electron Redox Reaction of I&#8722;/I+ for Aqueous Zn&#8208;Iodine Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an efficient inter&#8208;halogen activation strategy together with an interlayer confinement design, which successfully triggers and stabilizes a highly reversible four&#8208;electron redox reaction from I&#8722; to I+ for Zn&#8208;Iodine batteries. As a result, the specific capacity, output voltage and cycling performance of zinc&#8208;iodide battery are greatly improved.







Abstract
Low capacity and poor cycle stability greatly inhibit the development of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. Herein, a high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;iodine battery has been reached by designing and optimizing both electrode and electrolyte. The Br&#8722; is introduced as the activator to trigger I+, and coupled with I+ forming interhalogen to stabilize I+ to achieve a four&#8208;electron reaction, which greatly promotes the capacity. And the Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH nanoflowers serve as the confinement host to enable the reactions of I&#8722;/I+ occurring in the layer due to the spacious and stable interlayer spacing of Ni&#8722;Fe&#8722;I LDH, which effectively suppresses the iodine&#8208;species shuttle ensuring high cycling stability. As a result, the electrochemical performance is greatly enhanced, especially in specific capacity (as high as 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 far higher than two&#8208;electron transfer Zn&#8208;iodine batteries) and cycling performance (94.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000&#8197;cycles). This strategy provides a new way to realize high capacity and long&#8208;term stability of Zn&#8208;iodine batteries.

         <title>Intrinsic RNA Targeting Triggers Indiscriminate DNase Activity of CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the intrinsic RNA&#8208;activated cleavage activity of Cas12a and developed the &#8220;Universal Nuclease for Identification of Virus Empowered by RNA&#8208;Sensing&#8221; (UNIVERSE) assay for protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)&#8208;free nucleic acid testing with improved specificity. We validated its clinical utility by detecting both HIV RNA and HPV 16 DNA in clinical samples, achieving comparable performance with the PCR/RT&#8208;PCR method.







Abstract
The CRISPR&#8208;Cas12a system has emerged as a powerful tool for next&#8208;generation nucleic acid&#8208;based molecular diagnostics. However, it has long been believed to be effective only on DNA targets. Here, we investigate the intrinsic RNA&#8208;enabled trans&#8208;cleavage activity of AsCas12a and LbCas12a and discover that they can be directly activated by full&#8208;size RNA targets, although LbCas12a exhibits weaker trans&#8208;cleavage activity than AsCas12a on both single&#8208;stranded DNA and RNA substrates. Remarkably, we find that the RNA&#8208;activated Cas12a possesses higher specificity in recognizing mutated target sequences compared to DNA activation. Based on these findings, we develop the &#8220;Universal Nuclease for Identification of Virus Empowered by RNA&#8208;Sensing&#8221; (UNIVERSE) assay for nucleic acid testing. We incorporate a T7 transcription step into this assay, thereby eliminating the requirement for a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in the target. Additionally, we successfully detect multiple PAM&#8208;less targets in HIV clinical samples that are undetectable by the conventional Cas12a assay based on double&#8208;stranded DNA activation, demonstrating unrestricted target selection with the UNIVERSE assay. We further validate the clinical utility of the UNIVERSE assay by testing both HIV RNA and HPV 16 DNA in clinical samples. We envision that the intrinsic RNA targeting capability may bring a paradigm shift in Cas12a&#8208;based nucleic acid detection and further enhance the understanding of CRISPR&#8208;Cas biochemistry.

         <title>Rim&#8208;Based Binding of Perfluorinated Acids to Pillararenes Purifies Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8722;P5s) show unprecedent binding towards perfluoroalkyl acids with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 ratio and K&#8805;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment shows that DAF&#8722;P5s immobilized on silica can purify perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) polluted water down to 13&#8197;ng/L.







Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose a rapidly increasing global problem as their widespread use and high stability lead worldwide to water contamination, with significant detrimental health effects.[1] Supramolecular chemistry has been invoked to develop materials geared towards the specific capture of PFAS from water,[2] to reduce the concentration below advisory safety limits (e.g., 70&#8197;ng/L for the sum of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA). Scale&#8208;up and use in natural waters with high PFAS concentrations has hitherto posed a problem. Here we report a new type of host&#8211;guest interaction between deca&#8208;ammonium&#8208;functionalized pillar[5]arenes (DAF&#8722;P5s) and perfluoroalkyl acids. DAF&#8722;P5 complexes show an unprecedented 1&#8201;:&#8201;10 stoichiometry, as confirmed by isothermal calorimetry and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies, and high binding constants (up to 106&#8197;M&#8722;1) to various polyfluoroalkyl acids. In addition, non&#8208;fluorinated acids do not hamper this process significantly. Immobilization of DAF&#8722;P5s allows a simple single&#8208;time filtration of PFAS&#8208;contaminated water to reduce the PFOS/PFOA concentration 106&#8197;times to 15&#8211;50&#8197;ng/L level. The effective and fast (&lt;5&#8197;min) orthogonal binding to organic molecules without involvement of fluorinated supramolecular hosts, high breakthrough capacity (90&#8197;mg/g), and robust performance (&gt;10&#8197;regeneration cycles without decrease in performance) set a new benchmark in PFAS&#8208;absorbing materials.

         <title>A High&#8208;Yielding Active Template Click Reaction (AT&#8722;CuAAC) for the Synthesis of Mechanically Interlocked Nanohoops</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precursor to a 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine embedded [9]cycloparaphenylene (bipy[9]CPP) has been used to generate mechanically interlocked [2]rotaxane molecules in high yield through an active template azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8722;CuAAC) reaction. These [2]rotaxanes then serve as key intermediates to nanohoop[2]catenane structures.







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) represent an exciting yet underexplored area of research in the context of carbon nanoscience. Recently, work from our group and others has shown that small carbon nanotube fragments&#8212;[n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and related nanohoop macrocycles&#8212;may be integrated into mechanically interlocked architectures by leveraging supramolecular interactions, covalent tethers, or metal&#8208;ion templates. Still, available synthetic methods are typically difficult and low yielding, and general methods that allow for the creation of a wide variety of these structures are limited. Here we report an efficient route to interlocked nanohoop structures via the active template Cu&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (AT&#8722;CuAAC) reaction. With the appropriate choice of substituents, a macrocyclic precursor to 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl embedded [9]CPP (bipy[9]CPP) participates in the AT&#8722;CuAAC reaction to provide [2]rotaxanes in near&#8208;quantitative yield, which can then be converted into the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated catenane structures. Through this approach, two nanohoop[2]catenanes are synthesized which consist of a bipy[9]CPP catenated with either Tz[10]CPP or Tz[12]CPP (where Tz denotes a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole moiety replacing one phenylene ring in the [n]CPP backbone).

         <title>Simultaneous Inside and Outside Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with positively charged disulfide macrocycles has led to a unique material, in which the SWCNTs are decorated from the outside with macrocycles and on the inside contain polyiodide chains. The wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of such SWCNT peapod materials is an important step toward uses that require macroscopic amounts.







Abstract
Functionalizing single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a robust way that does not affect the sp2 carbon framework is a considerable research challenge. Here we describe how triiodide salts of positively charged macrocycles can be used not only to functionalize SWCNTs from the outside, but simultaneously from the inside. We employed disulfide exchange in aqueous solvent to maximize the solvophobic effect and therefore achieve a high degree of macrocycle immobilization. Characterization by Raman spectroscopy, EDX&#8208;STEM and HR&#8208;TEM clearly showed that serendipitously this wet&#8208;chemical functionalization procedure also led to the encapsulation of polyiodide chains inside the nanotubes. The resulting three&#8208;shell composite materials are redox&#8208;active and experience an intriguing interplay of electrostatic, solvophobic and mechanical effects that could be of interest for applications in energy storage.

         <title>Alkyl&#8211;&#960; Functional Molecular Gels: Control of Elastic Modulus and Improvement of Electret Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the development of alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gels (FMGs), in which the addition of a 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator can increase the elastic modulus of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Furthermore, gelation improved the performance of mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices compared to liquid&#8208;based ones.







Abstract
The development of optoelectronically&#8208;active soft materials is drawing attention to the application of soft electronics. A room&#8208;temperature solvent&#8208;free liquid obtained by modifying a &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with flexible yet bulky alkyl chains is a promising functional soft material. Tuning the elastic modulus (G&#8242;) is essential for employing optoelectronically&#8208;active alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids in deformable devices. However, the range of G&#8242; achieved through the molecular design of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids is limited. We report herein a method for controlling G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by gelation. Adding 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator formed the alkyl&#8211;&#960; functional molecular gel (FMG) and increased G&#8242; of alkyl&#8211;&#960; liquids by up to seven orders of magnitude while retaining the optical properties. Because alkyl&#8211;&#960; FMGs have functional &#960;&#8208;moieties in the gel medium, this new class of gels has a much higher content of &#960;&#8208;moieties of up to 59&#8197;wt&#8201;% compared to conventional &#960;&#8208;gels of only a few wt&#8201;%. More importantly, the gel state has a 23&#8201;% higher charge&#8208;retention capacity than the liquid, providing better performance in deformable mechanoelectric generator&#8208;electret devices. The strategy used in this study is a novel approach for developing next&#8208;generation optoelectronically&#8208;active FMG materials.

         <title>An H2O2 Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery with Ultrafast Power Generation and Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;charging power systems are considered as promising alternatives for off&#8208;grid energy devices to provide sustained electricity supply. However, the conventional self&#8208;charging systems are severely restricted by the energy availability and time&#8208;consuming charging process as well as insufficient capacity. Herein, we developed an ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging aqueous Zn/NaFeFe(CN)6 battery, which simultaneously integrates the H2O2 power generation and energy storage into a battery configuration. In such battery, the chemical energy conversion of H2O2 can generate electrical energy to self&#8208;charge the battery to 1.7 V through the redox reaction between H2O2 and NaFeFe(CN)6 cathode. The thermodynamically and kinetically favorable redox reaction contributes to the ultrafast H2O2 self&#8208;charging rate and the extremely short self&#8208;charging time within 60 seconds. Moreover, the rapid H2O2 power generation can promptly compensate the energy consumption of battery to provide continuous electricity supply. Impressively, this self&#8208;charging battery shows excellent scalability of device architecture and can be designed to a H2O2 single&#8208;flow battery of 7.06 Ah to extend the long&#8208;term energy supply. This work not only provides a route to design self&#8208;charging batteries with fast charging rate and high capacity, but also pushes forward the development of self&#8208;charging power systems for advanced large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization to Prepare Recylable Micro&#8208;Adjuvants for Dendritic Cell Vaccine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the development of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, the maturation of DCs is a critical stage. Adjuvants play a pivotal role in the maturation of DCs, with a major concern being to ensure both efficacy and safety. This study introduces an innovative approach that combines high efficacy with safety through the synthesis of micro&#8208;adjuvants grafted with copolymers of 2&#8208;(methacrylamido) glucopyranose (MAG) and methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC). The utilization of metal&#8208;free surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization enables the production of safe and recyclable adjuvants. These micrometer&#8208;sized adjuvants surpass the optimal size range for cellular endocytosis, enabling the retrieval and reuse of them during the ex vivo maturation process, mitigating potential toxicity concerns associated with the endocytosis of non&#8208;metabolized nanoparticles. Additionally, the adjuvants exhibit a &#8220;micro&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated maturation enhancement&#8221; effect for DC maturation. This effect is influenced by the shape of the particle, as evidenced by the distinct promotion effects of rod&#8208;like and spherical micro&#8208;adjuvants with comparable sizes. Furthermore, the porous structure of the adjuvants enables them to function as cargo&#8208;carrying &#8220;micro&#8208;shuttles&#8221;, releasing antigens upon binding to DCs to facilitate efficient antigen delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced C(sp3)&#8208;H Bicyclopentylation Enabled by an Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Complex&#8208;Mediated Chemoselective Three&#8208;Component Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photoredox electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated radical coupling reaction has gained prominence in the field of organic synthesis, finding widespread application in two&#8208;component coupling reactions. However, EDA complex&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component reactions are not well developed with only a limited number of examples have been reported. Herein, we report a photoinduced and EDA complex&#8208;promoted highly chemoselective three&#8208;component radical arylalkylation of [1.1.1]propellane, which allows the direct functionalization of C(sp3)&#8211;H with bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCP)&#8208;aryl groups under mild conditions. A variety of unnatural &#945;&#8208;amino acids, featuring structurally diversified 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP moieties, were synthesized in a single&#8208;step process. Notably, leveraging the high tension release of [1.1.1]propellane, the highly unstable transient aryl radical undergoes rapid conversion into a relatively stable tertiary alkyl transient radical, and consequently, the competing side&#8208;reaction of two&#8208;component coupling was entirely suppressed. The strategic use of this transient radical conversion approach would be useful for the design of diverse EDA complex&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;component reactions. It is noteworthy that the highly chemoselective late&#8208;stage incorporation of the 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCP pharmacophores into peptides was achieved both in liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase reactions. This advancement is anticipated to have significant application potential in the future development of peptide drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Elaborate Modulating Binding Strength of Intermediates via Three&#8208;component Covalent Organic Frameworks for CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;component covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed with electron&#8208;rich diarylamine unit and electron&#8208;deficient benzothiazole and Co&#8208;porphyrin units, thus overcoming the weak or strong interactions between COFs and intermediates, improving the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance.







Abstract
The catalytic performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) depends on the binding strength of the reactants and intermediates. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been adopted to catalyze CO2RR, and their binding abilities are tuned via constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (DA) systems. However, most DA COFs have single donor and acceptor units, which caused wide&#8208;range but lacking accuracy in modulating the binding strength of intermediates. More elaborate regulation of the interactions with intermediates are necessary and challenge to construct high&#8208;efficiency catalysts. Herein, the three&#8208;component COF with D&#8208;A&#8208;A units was first constructed by introducing electron&#8208;rich diarylamine unit, electron&#8208;deficient benzothiazole and Co&#8208;porphyrin units. Compared with two&#8208;component COFs, the designed COF exhibit elevated electronic conductivity, enhanced reducibility, high efficiency charge transfer, further improving the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance with the faradic efficiency of 97.2&#8201;% at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V and high activity with the partial current density of 27.85&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.0&#8197;V which exceed other two&#8208;component COFs. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that catalytic sites in three&#8208;component COF have suitable binding ability of the intermediates, which are benefit for formation of *COOH and desorption of *CO. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of multi&#8208;component COFs, enabling modulated charge transfer to improve the CO2RR activity.

         <title>The Influence of Light&#8208;Generated Radicals for Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Thermal Conversion in an Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D Metal&#8208;Organic Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable two&#8208;dimensional cobalt(II)&#8208;organic assembly NKU&#8208;123 for efficient photothermal conversion is reported. Under 808&#8197;nm light, the temperature of NKU&#8208;123 rapidly increases from 25.5 to 215.1&#8201;&#176;C in 6&#8197;seconds. NKU&#8208;123 exhibits a solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation rate of 1.442 and 1.299&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation with a water evaporation efficiency of 97.8 and 87.9&#8201;% for pure water and seawater, respectively. The role of light&#8208;generated radicals to the photothermal conversion was revealed.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation is a promising strategy for clean water production, which needs the development of solar&#8208;thermal conversion materials with both high efficiency and high stability. Herein, we reported an ultra&#8208;stable cobalt(II)&#8208;organic assembly NKU&#8208;123 with light&#8208;generated radicals, exhibiting superior photothermal conversion efficiency and high stability. Under the irradiation of 808&#8197;nm light, the temperature of NKU&#8208;123 rapidly increases from 25.5 to 215.1&#8201;&#176;C in 6&#8197;seconds. The solar water evaporator based on NKU&#8208;123 achieves a high solar&#8208;thermal water evaporation rate of 1.442 and 1.299&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun irradiation with a water evaporation efficiency of 97.8 and 87.9&#8201;% for pure water and seawater, respectively. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the formation of light&#8208;generated radicals leads to an increase of spin density of NKU&#8208;123 for enhancing the photothermal effect, which provides insights into the design of highly efficient photothermal materials.

         <title>Enhancing Ni/Co Activity by Neighboring Pt Atoms in NiCoP/MXene Electrocatalyst for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Ni/Co can be improved by neighboring Pt atoms in alkaline electrolyte, which can increase water adsorption and decrease dramatically water dissociation energy barrier by interface electron transfer, and even change catalytic route from Heyrovsky to faster Tafel step.







Abstract
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate neighboring Pt atoms can enhance the metal activity of NiCoP for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, it remains a great challenge to link Pt and NiCoP. Herein, we introduced curvature of bowl&#8208;like structure to construct Pt/NiCoP interface by adding a minimal 1&#8201;&#8240;&#8208;molar&#8208;ratio Pt. The as&#8208;prepared sample only requires an overpotential of 26.5 and 181.6&#8197;mV to accordingly achieve the current density of 10 and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#8197;M KOH. The water dissociation energy barrier (Ea) has a ~43&#8201;% decrease compared with NiCoP counterpart. It also shows an ultrahigh stability with a small degradation rate of 10.6&#8197;&#956;V&#8201;h&#8722;1 at harsh conditions (500&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 50&#8201;&#176;C) after 3000&#8197;hrs. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) verify the interface electron transfer lowers the valence state of Co/Ni and activates them. DFT calculations also confirm the catalytic transition step of NiCoP can change from Heyrovsky (2.71&#8197;eV) to Tafel step (0.51&#8197;eV) in the neighborhood of Pt, in accord with the result of the improved Hads at the interface disclosed by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) tests.

         <dc:description>
Based on a computer&#8208;aided ligand design, the first chiral Os(II)/Salox catalytic system is realized to address the appealing yet challenging asymmetric &#947;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation of dioxazolones with precise site&#8208;/enantioselectivity control and diverse functionality. The catalytic energy profile and the chiral induction mode of the developed chiral Os(II)/Salox system are also further clarified by integrated experimental and computational studies.







Abstract
Herein, multiple types of chiral Os(II) complexes have been designed to address the appealing yet challenging asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization, among which the Os(II)/Salox species is found to be the most efficient for precise stereocontrol in realizing the asymmetric C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation. As exemplified by the enantioenriched pyrrolidinone synthesis, such tailored Os(II)/Salox catalyst efficiently enables an intramolecular site&#8208;/enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H amidation in the &#947;&#8208;position of dioxazolone substrates, in which benzyl, propargyl and allyl groups bearing various substituted forms are well compatible, affording the corresponding chiral &#947;&#8208;lactam products with good er values (up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1) and diverse functionality (&gt;35&#8197;examples). The unique performance advantage of the developed chiral Os(II)/Salox system in terms of the catalytic energy profile and the chiral induction has been further clarified by integrated experimental and computational studies.

&lt;p&gt;Based on a computer-aided ligand design, the first chiral Os(II)/Salox catalytic system is realized to address the appealing yet challenging asymmetric &#947;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H amidation of dioxazolones with precise site-/enantioselectivity control and diverse functionality. The catalytic energy profile and the chiral induction mode of the developed chiral Os(II)/Salox system are also further clarified by integrated experimental and computational studies.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pallamolides A&#8722;E</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential Michael addition reactions formed the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core of pallamolides A&#8722;E in the first total synthesis of these densely functionalized natural products. The approach also featured a SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization to generate the oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade to assemble the tetracyclic skeleton of the pallamolides.







Abstract
We have achieved the first total synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E. Of these compounds, pallamolides B&#8722;E possess intriguing tetracyclic skeletons with novel intramolecular transesterifications. Key transformations include highly diastereoselective sequential Michael addition reactions to construct the bicyclo[2.2.2]octane core with the simultaneous generation of two quaternary carbon centers, a one&#8208;pot SmI2&#8208;mediated intramolecular ketyl&#8211;enoate cyclization/ketone reduction to generate the key oxabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane moiety, and an acid&#8208;mediated deprotection/oxa&#8208;Michael addition/&#946;&#8208;hydroxy elimination cascade sequence to assemble the tetracyclic pallamolide skeleton. Kinetic resolution of ketone 14 through Corey&#8211;Bakshi&#8211;Shibata reduction enabled the asymmetric synthesis of pallamolides A&#8722;E.
