         <title>Formation and Loading of a (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl&#160;Starter Unit in the Assembly Line of Polyketide&#8208;Nonribosomal Peptide Hybrid Sanglifehrin A</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a spirolactam&#8208;conjugated, 22&#8208;membered macrolide with remarkable immunosuppressive and antiviral activities. This macrolide is a result of a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly line that utilizes (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl as a starter unit. Here, we report that the formation and loading of this starter unit in the SFA assembly line involve two unusual enzymatic reactions that occur on a discrete acyl carrier protein (ACP), SfaO. An amide synthetase, SfaP, catalyzes the amidation of (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonyl in a SfaO&#8208;dependent manner. Then, a b&#8208;ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III&#8208;like protein, SfaN, transfers resultant (2S)&#8208;2&#8208;ethylmalonamyl from SfaO onto the loading ACP domain of the hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS assembly line to prime SFA biosynthesis. Both SfaP and SfaN display promiscuous activities. This study furthers the appreciation of assembly line chemistry, as a new paradigm for unusual building block formation and incorporation is provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecule Saturation&#160;Boosts Acetylene Semihydrogenation Activity and Selectivity on a Core&#8208;Shell Ruthenium@Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing selectivity without expense of activity is desired but challenging in heterogeneous catalysis. By revealing the molecule saturation and adsorption sensitivity on overlayer thickness, strain, and coordination of Pd&#8208;based catalysts from first&#8208;principles calculations, we design a stable Pd monolayer (ML) catalyst on Ru terrace to boost both activity and selectivity of acetylene semihydrogenation. The least saturated molecule is found most sensitive to the change in catalyst electronic and geometric properties. By simultaneously compressing the Pd ML and exposing the high coordination sites, the adsorption of more saturated ethylene is considerably weakened to facilitate the desorption for high selectivity, but the even stronger weakening to the least saturated acetylene drives its hydrogenation more exothermic to boost the activity. Tailoring the molecule saturation and its sensitivity on the structures and compositions provide a rational of design of efficient catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells by a Multifunctional Composite Photoanode to 14.13%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new strategy to fabricate a multifunctional composite photoanode containing TiO2 hollow spheres (TiO2&#8208;HSs), Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) and novel NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4:Eu@SiO2 upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). The AuNPs are grown on the photoanode film including TiO2&#8208;HSs and UCNPs by a simple in&#8208;situ plasmonic treatment. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.13% is obtained, which is a record for N719 dye&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells, demonstrating great potential for the solar cells toward commercialization. This obvious enhancement is ascribed to a collaborative mechanism of the TiO2&#8208;HSs exhibiting excellent light&#8208;scattering ability, of the UCNPs converting near&#8208;infrared photons into visible photons and of the AuNPs presenting outstanding surface plasmon resonance effect. Notably, a steady&#8208;state experiment further reveals that the champion cell exhibits 95.33% retainment in efficiency even after 180 h of measurements, showing good device stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Concise Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Quinocarcin Enabled by Catalytic Enantioselective Reductive 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Secondary Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A concise asymmetric total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;quinocarcin has been accomplished with high step economy from commercially available starting materials. A catalytic enantioselective reductive 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction of N&#8208;heteroaryl secondary amides with reactive dipolarophile using iridium/copper relay catalysis was developed to prepare the key chiral pyrrolidine intermediate with three stereocenters. This protocol features excellent regio&#8208;, exo&#8208; and enantioselectivities, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. The high efficiency was also ensured by a Rh(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/cyclization and a tandem diastereoselective hydrogenation/cyclization to construct the tetrahydroisoquinoline&#8208;pyrrolidine tetracyclic core unit of quinocarcin.</dc:description>

         <title>When High&#8208;Temperature Cesium Chemistry Meets Self&#8208;Templating: Metal Acetates as Building Blocks of Unusual Highly Porous Carbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;templating is a facile strategy for synthesizing porous carbons by direct pyrolysis of organic metal salts. However, the method typically suffers from low yields (&lt; 4%) and limited specific surface areas (SSA &lt; 2000 m2&#183;g&#8208;1) originating from low activity of metal cations (e.g., K+ or Na+) in promoting construction and activation of carbon frameworks. Here we use cesium acetate as the only precursor of oxo&#8208;carbons with large SSA of the order of 3000 m2&#183;g&#8208;1, pore volume approaching 2 cm3&#183;g&#8208;1, tunable oxygen contents, and yields of up to 15%. We unravel the role of Cs+ as an efficient promoter of framework formation, templating and etching agent, while acetates act as carbon/oxygen sources of carbonaceous frameworks. The oxo&#8208;carbons show record&#8208;high CO2 uptake of 8.71 mmol&#183;g&#8208;1 and an ultimate specific capacitance of 313 F&#183;g&#8208;1in the supercapacitor.This study helps to understand and rationally tailor the materials design by a still rare organic solid&#8208;state chemistry.</dc:description>

Herein, we develop a new type of electron&#8208;accepting building block; ie., non&#8208;symmetric half&#8208;fused B&#8592;N coordinated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) (HBNDPP),&#160;for amorphous conjugated polymers towards flexible electronics. The rigid B&#8592;N fusion part of HBNDPP endows the resulting polymers with decent electron transport, while the non&#8208;symmetric structure of HBNDPP causes the polymer to exhibit multiple conformation isomers with flat torsional potential energies.&#160;Thus, it gets packed in an&#160;amorphous manner&#160;in solid state, ensuring good resistance to bending strain. Combined with hardness and softness, the flexible OFET devices exhibit n&#8208;type charge properties with decent mobility, good bending resistance, and good ambient stability. The preliminary study makes this building block a potential candidate for future design of conjugated materials for flexible electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Time&#8208;dependent Phosphorescence Color of Carbon Dots in Binary Salt Matrices through Activations by Structural Confinement and Defects for Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The emergence of time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials has taken information encryption to high&#8208;security levels. However, due to the only path of exciton transfer, it is almost impossible to obtain TDPC for chromophores with a single emission center. Theoretically, in inorganic&#8208;organic composites, the exciton transfer of organic chromophores depends on the inorganic structure. Here, we assign two structural effects to inorganic NaCl by metal (Mg2+ or Ca2+ or Ba2+) doping, which triggers the TDPC performance of carbon dots (CDs) with a single emission center. The resulting material is used for multi&#8208;level dynamic phosphorescence color 3D coding to achieve information encryption. The structural confinement activates the green phosphorescence of CDs; while the structural defect activates tunneling&#8208;related yellow phosphorescence. Such simply doped inorganic matrices can be synthesized using the periodic table of metal cations, endowing chromophores with tremendous control over TDPC properties. This demonstration extends the design view of dynamic luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallinity Regulation and Defects Passivation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Using Fully Conjugated Porous Aromatic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully conjugated porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) have been constructed through Gilch reaction. The obtained PAFs have rigid conjugated backbones, high specific surface area, and excellent stability. The prepared PAF&#8208;154 and PAF&#8208;155 have been successfully applied in the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by doping into the perovskite layer. The champion PSC devices afford a power conversion efficiency of 22.8% and 22.4%. It is found that the PAFs can be used as an efficient nucleation template, thus regulating the perovskite crystallinity. Meanwhile, PAFs can also passivate defects and promote carriers transporting in the perovskite film. By the comparative study with their linear counterpart, we unravel that the efficacy of PAFs is highly related to their porous structure and rigid fully conjugated networks. The unencapsulated devices with PAFs doping exhibit outstanding long&#8208;term stability, retaining 80% of their initial efficiencies after half&#8208;year storage in ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Burning Graphite Faster than Carbon Black: A Case of Diffusion Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>External diffusion may be exploited as a tool to purify materials in a way thought to be inaccessible from a chemical reactivity point of view. A mixture of two carbonaceous materials, graphite and carbon black, are thermally oxidized in either i) outside total diffusion&#8208;limited regime or ii) total diffusion&#8208;limited regime. Depending on the treatment applied it is possible to purify either graphite, a trivial task, or carbon black, a task thought impossible. Introducing geometrical selectivity, controlled total diffusion&#8208;limited chemistry exceeds by far the field of carbon materials and can be used as an engineering tool for many materials purification, original synthesis, or to introduce asymmetry in a system. Several examples for direct applications of the findings are mentioned.</dc:description>

         <title>Blended Conjugated Host and Unconjugated Dopant Polymers Towards N&#8208;type All&#8208;Polymer Conductors and High&#8208;ZT Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Type thermoelectrics typically consist of small molecule dopant+polymer host.&#160; Only a few polymer dopant+polymer host systems have been reported, and these have lower thermoelectric parameters. N&#8208;type polymers with high crystallinity and order are generally used for high&#8208;conductivity ( ) organic conductors. Few n&#8208;type polymers with only short&#8208;range lamellar stacking for high&#8208;conductivity materials have been reported. Here, we describe an n&#8208;type short&#8208;range lamellar&#8208;stacked all&#8208;polymer thermoelectric system with highest &#160;of 78 S &#8208;1, power factor (PF) of 163 &#956;W m&#8208;1K&#8208;2, and maximum figure of merit (ZT) of 0.53 at room temperature with a dopant/host ratio of 75 wt%. The minor effect of polymer dopant on the molecular arrangement of conjugated polymer PDPIN at high ratios, high doping capability, high Seebeck coefficient (S) absolute values relative to , and typical decreased thermal conductivity ( ) with increased doping ratio contribute to the promising performance.</dc:description>

         <title>An Artificial Single Molecular Channel Showing High Chloride Transport Selectivity and pH&#8208;Responsive Conductance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the unique structure and function of natural chloride channel (ClC) selectivity filter, we present herein the design of a ClC&#8208;type single channel molecule. This channel displays high ion transport activity with half&#8208;maximal effective concentration EC50 being 0.10 &#956;M or 0.075 mol% (channel molecule to lipid ratio) determined by fluorescent analysis using lucigenin&#8208;encapsulated vesicles. Planar bilayer lipid membrane conductance measurements indicated an excellent Cl&#8722;/K+ selectivity with permeability ratio PCl&#8722;/PK+&#160;up to 12.31, which is comparable with the chloride selectivity of natural ClC proteins. Moreover, high anion/anion selectivity (PCl&#8722;/PBr&#8722;&#160;= 66.21) and pH&#8208;dependent conductance and ion selectivity of channel molecule were also revealed. The ClC&#8208;like transport behaviours are contributed by the cooperation of hydrogen bonding and anion&#8211;&#960; interactions in the central macrocyclic skeleton, and by the existence of pH&#8208;responsive terminal phenylalanine residues.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes [Ba(PO4)2]WmO3m&#8208;3: 2D&#8208;metals with locked charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave instabilities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphate tungsten and molybenum bronzes represent an outstanding class of materials displaying textbook examples of charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) physics among other fundamental properties. Here we report on the existence of a novel structural branch with the general formula [Ba(PO4)2][W3O3&#8211;m] (m = 3, 4 and 5) denominated 'layered monophosphate tungsten bronzes' (L&#8208;MPTB). It results from thick [Ba(PO4)2]4&#8211; spacer layers disrupting the cationic metal oxide 2D&#8208;units and enforcing an overall trigonal structure. Their symmetries are preserved down to 1.8 K and the compounds show metallic behaviour with no clear anomaly as a function of temperature. However, their electronic structure displays the characteristic Fermi surface of previous bronzes derived from 5d&#8208;W states with hidden nesting properties. By analogy with previous bronzes, such a Fermi surface should result into CDW&#8208;order. Evidence of CDW&#8208;order was only indirectly observed in the low&#8208;temperature specific heat, giving an exotic context at the crossover between stable&#8208;2D metals and CDW&#8208;order.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental Confirmation of a Predicted Porous Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with low densities and high porosities are rare and challenging to design because most molecules have a strong energetic preference for close packing. Crystal structure prediction (CSP) can rank the crystal packings available to an organic molecule based on their relative lattice energies. This has become a powerful tool for the a priori design of porous molecular crystals. Previously, we combined CSP with structure&#8208;property predictions to generate energy&#8211;structure&#8211;function (ESF) maps for a series of triptycene&#8208;based molecules with quinoxaline groups. From these ESF maps, triptycene trisquinoxalinedione (TH5) was predicted to form a previously unknown low&#8208;energy HOF (TH5&#8208;A) with a remarkably low density of 0.374 g cm&#8208;3 and three&#8208;dimensional (3&#8208;D) pores. Here, we demonstrate the reliability of those ESF maps by discovering this TH5&#8208;A polymorph experimentally. This material has a high accessible surface area of 3,284 m2 g&#8208;1, as measured by nitrogen adsorption, making it one of the most porous HOFs reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208; and Data&#8208;Driven Protein Engineering of Transaminases for Improving Activity and Stereoselectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine transaminases (ATAs) are powerful biocatalysts for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines. Machine learning provides a promising approach for protein engineering, but activity prediction models for ATAs remain elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining high&#8208;quality training data. Thus, we first created variants of the ATA from Ruegeria sp. (3FCR) with improved catalytic activity (up to 2,000&#8208;fold) as well as reversed stereoselectivity by a structure&#8208;dependent rational design and collected a high&#8208;quality dataset in this process. Subsequently, we designed a modified one&#8208;hot code to describe steric and electronic effects of substrates and residues within ATAs. Finally, we built a gradient boosting regression tree predictor for catalytic activity and stereoselectivity, and applied this for the data&#8208;driven design of optimized variants which then showed improved activity (up to 3&#8208;fold compared to the best variants previously identified). We also demonstrated that the model can predict the catalytic activity for ATA variants of another origin by retraining with a small set of additional data.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Regulation of MOF Nanosheet Membrane for Accurate H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular scale chemical decoration on MOF molecular sieve nanosheets was developed. CO2 impurities physisorbed on the artificially introduced low dose amino side groups served as interlayer &#8220;bridges&#8221;, elegantly regulated interlayer spacing and retarded CO2 subsequent transports, bringing an unrivalled H2/CO2 separation accuracy which favored a high&#8208;purity H2 production.







Abstract
High&#8208;purity H2 production accompanied with a precise decarbonization opens an avenue to approach a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheet membranes provide great opportunities for an accurate and fast H2/CO2 separation, CO2 leakage through the membrane interlayer galleries decided the ultimate separation accuracy. Here we introduce low dose amino side groups into the Zn2(benzimidazolate)4 conformation. Physisorbed CO2 served as interlayer linkers, gently regulated and stabilized the interlayer spacing. These evoked a synergistic effect of CO2 adsorption&#8208;assisted molecular sieving and steric hinderance, whilst exquisitely preserving apertures for high&#8208;speed H2 transport. The optimized amino membranes set a new record for ultrathin nanosheet membranes in H2/CO2 separation (mixture separation factor: 1158, H2 permeance: 1417 gas permeation unit). This strategy provides an effective way to customize ultrathin nanosheet membranes with desirable molecular sieving ability.

         <title>Heterocyclic Chromophore Amphiphiles and their Supramolecular Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles have been introduced into the structure of the model perylene monoimide chromophore amphiphile to afford monomers that undergo supramolecular polymerization in water but have different conductivities. The heterocycles alter the monomeric molecular dipole moments, which impacts the internal order within the polymeric assemblies. The conductivity of the supramolecular polymers formed is seemingly dependent on short&#8208;range interactions.







Abstract
Supramolecular polymerization of &#960;&#8208;conjugated amphiphiles in water is an attractive approach to create functional nanostructures. Here, we report on the synthesis, optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, aqueous supramolecular polymerization, and conductivity of polycyclic aromatic dicarboximide amphiphiles. The chemical structure of the model perylene monoimide amphiphile was modified with heterocycles, essentially substituting one fused benzene ring with thiophene, pyridine or pyrrole rings. All the heterocycle&#8208;containing monomers investigated underwent supramolecular polymerization in water. Large changes to the monomeric molecular dipole moments led to nanostructures with low electrical conductivity due to diminished interactions. Although the substitution of benzene with thiophene did not notably change the monomer dipole moment, it led to crystalline nanoribbons with 20&#8208;fold higher electrical conductivity, due to enhanced dispersion interactions as a result of the presence of sulfur atoms.

         <title>Turn&#8208;on Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Indium Chlorides by 5s2 Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>

This study reports two new series of chiral indium&#8208;antimony chlorides, (R&#8208;MPA)4In2(1&#8722;x)Sb2xCl10 and (R&#8208;CHEA)4In2(1&#8722;x)Sb2xCl10 ((R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;methylphenethylamine (R&#8208;MPA), (R)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexylethylammonium (R&#8208;CHEA)) with tunable PLQY and luminescence dissymmetry factors. The bright STE emission is generated from lone pair 5s2 electrons of Sb3+. Near&#8208;ultraviolet pumped white light is demonstrated with a circular polarization up to 6.0&#8201;%.







Abstract
Introducing chirality into the metal&#8208;halide hybrids has enabled many emerging properties including chiroptical activity, spin&#8208;dependent transport, and ferroelectricity. However, most of the chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids to date are non&#8208;emissive, and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show a new strategy to turn on the circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids. We demonstrate that alloying Sb3+ into chiral indium&#8208;chloride hybrids dramatically increases the photoluminescence quantum yield in two new series of chiral indium&#8208;antimony chlorides. These materials exhibit strong CPL signals with tunable energy and a high dissymmetry factor up to 1.5&#215;10&#8722;2. Mechanistic studies reveal that the emission originates from the self&#8208;trapped excitons centered in 5s2 Sb3+. Moreover, near&#8208;ultraviolet pumped white light is demonstrated with a polarization up to 6.0&#8201;%. Our work demonstrates new strategies towards highly luminescent chiral metal&#8208;halide hybrids.

         <title>Exfoliated 2D Layered and Nonlayered Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides Nanosheets as Promising Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered and nonlayered phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) are successfully exfoliated into ultra&#8208;thin metal nanosheets through wet grinding exfoliation (WGE). The systematic investigation of the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR) mechanism offers new insights for the understanding of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials catalysts provide an atomic&#8208;scale view on a fascinating arena for understanding the mechanism of electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR). Here, we successfully exfoliated both layered and nonlayered ultra&#8208;thin metal phosphorous trichalcogenides (MPCh3) nanosheets via wet grinding exfoliation (WGE), and systematically investigated the mechanism of MPCh3 as catalysts for CO2 ECR. Unlike the layered CoPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheets, the active Sn atoms tend to be exposed on the surfaces of nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets. Correspondingly, the nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets exhibit clearly improved catalytic activity, showing formic acid selectivity up to 31.6&#8201;% with &#8722;7.51&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.65&#8197;V vs. RHE. The enhanced catalytic performance can be attributed to the formation of HCOO* via the first proton&#8208;electron pair addition on the SnPS3 surface. These results provide a new avenue to understand the novel CO2 ECR mechanism of Sn&#8208;based and MPCh3&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Membranes via Alkynylated Surface&#8208;Modification for Nanofiltration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY)&#8208;based membranes are prepared on alkynylated commercial ceramic tubes, overcoming the limitation that such layers could be synthesized only on a limited number of metal surfaces. The prepared HsGDY layers are strongly attached to the ceramic surface and exhibit excellent molecular permselectivity and ultra&#8208;high water permeance due to the unique surface properties and unusual conjugated structure.







Abstract
Graphdiynes (GDYs), two&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;like carbon systems, are considered as potential advanced membrane material due to their unique physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the scale&#8208;up of integrated GDY membranes is technologically challenging, and most studies remain at the theoretical stage. Herein, we report a simple and efficient alkynylated surface&#8208;mediated strategy to prepare hydrogen&#8208;substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY) membranes on commercial alumina tubes. Surface alkynylation initiates an accelerated surface&#8208;confined coupling reaction in the presence of a copper catalyst and facilitates the nanoscale epitaxial lateral growth of HsGDY. A continuous and ultra&#8208;thin HsGDY membrane (&#8764;100&#8197;nm) can be produced within 15&#8197;min. The resulting membranes exhibit outstanding molecular sieving together with excellent water permeances (ca. 1100&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 MPa&#8722;1), and show a long&#8208;term durability in cross&#8208;flow nanofiltration, owing to the superhydrophilic surface and hydrophobic pore walls.

         <title>A Systematic Study on the Effects of Solvating Solvents and Additives in Localized High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes over Electrochemical Performance of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of microscopic solvation structure, solvating solvent and additive of localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) over the electrolyte properties, the electrode/electrolyte interphases and the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) were systematically studied. The synergetic decomposition of anion, proper solvent and additive in LHCEs is the key to forming effective interphases and achieving long cycle life of LIBs.







Abstract
Localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) based on five different types of solvents were systematically studied and compared in lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The unique solvation structure of LHCEs promotes the participation of Li salt in forming solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anode, which enables solvents previously considered incompatible with Gr to achieve reversible lithiation/delithiation. However, the long cyclability of LIBs is still subject to the intrinsic properties of the solvent species in LHCEs. Such issue can be readily resolved by introducing a small amount of additive into LHCEs. The synergetic decompositions of Li salt, solvating solvent and additive yield effective SEIs and cathode electrolyte interphases (CEIs) in most of the studied LHCEs. This study reveals that both the structure and the composition of solvation sheaths in LHCEs have significant effect on SEI and CEI, and consequently, the cycle life of energetically dense LIBs.

Anisole was screened and found to slice the ionic aggregate to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic clusters, which significantly accelerates Li+ transport process in bulk electrolyte and SEI. The performance of Li&#8722;O2 battery is greatly improved thanks to the realized robust Li deposition behavior.







Abstract
Li&#8722;O2 batteries with bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide&#8208;based ionic liquid (TFSI&#8208;IL) electrolyte are promising because TFSI&#8208;IL can stabilize O2&#8722; to lower charge overpotential. However, slow Li+ transport in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte causes inferior Li deposition. Here we optimize weak solvating molecule (anisole) to generate anisole&#8208;doped ionic aggregate in TFSI&#8208;IL electrolyte. Such unique solvation environment can realize not only high Li+ transport parameters but also anion&#8208;derived solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Thus, fast Li+ transport is achieved in electrolyte bulk and SEI simultaneously, leading to robust Li deposition with high rate capability (3&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life (2000&#8197;h at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, Li&#8722;O2 batteries show good cycling stability (a small overpotential increase of 0.16&#8197;V after 120 cycles) and high rate capability (1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). This work provides an effective electrolyte design principle to realize stable Li deposition and high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;O2 batteries.

Tetrazoles and azides find broad application in pharmaceuticals, chemical biology, and high&#8208;energy materials. In this work multivariant linear regression and classification are leveraged to develop predictive statistical models for their decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity, which are key in evaluating the safety of a given molecule. Furthermore, interpretation of the statistical models provided rich insight into the decomposition mechanisms.







Abstract
Nitrogen atom&#8208;rich heterocycles and organic azides have found extensive use in many sectors of modern chemistry from drug discovery to energetic materials. The prediction and understanding of their energetic properties are thus key to the safe and effective application of these compounds. In this work, we disclose the use of multivariate linear regression modeling for the prediction of the decomposition temperature and impact sensitivity of structurally diverse tetrazoles and organic azides. We report a data&#8208;driven approach for property prediction featuring a collection of quantum mechanical parameters and computational workflows. The statistical models reported herein carry predictive accuracy as well as chemical interpretability. Model validation was successfully accomplished via tetrazole test sets with parameters generated exclusively in silico. Mechanistic analysis of the statistical models indicated distinct divergent pathways of thermal and impact&#8208;initiated decomposition.

         <title>Ionothermal Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Using Low&#8208;Melting Metal Salt Precursors
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;melting metal (hydrate) salts as both the precursor and the solvent for ionothermal synthesis, a range of stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be prepared with high crystallinity and porosity and minimal use of organic solvents.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous, crystalline materials constructed from organic linkers and inorganic nodes with myriad potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis, and drug delivery. A major barrier to the application of MOFs is their poor scalability, as most frameworks are prepared under highly dilute solvothermal conditions using toxic organic solvents. Herein, we demonstrate that combining a range of linkers with low&#8208;melting metal halide (hydrate) salts leads directly to high&#8208;quality MOFs without added solvent. Frameworks prepared under these ionothermal conditions possess porosities comparable to those prepared under traditional solvothermal conditions. In addition, we report the ionothermal syntheses of two frameworks that cannot be prepared directly under solvothermal conditions. Overall, the user&#8208;friendly method reported herein should be broadly applicable to the discovery and synthesis of stable metal&#8208;organic materials.

         <title>Direct N&#8722;H Activation to Generate Nitrogen Radical for Arylamine Synthesis via Quantum Dots Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct activation of amine N&#8722;H bonds is realized to provide N&#8208;radicals in a redox&#8208;neutral and site&#8208;selective manner. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots, the N&#8208;radicals are successfully applied to the synthesis of aromatic amines. The high efficiency and broad functional&#8208;group tolerance demonstrate the potential of photocatalytic N&#8208;radicals in the construction of valuable arylamines.







Abstract
Represented herein is the first example of N&#8208;radical generation direct from N&#8722;H bond activation under mild and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The in situ generated N&#8208;radical intercepts a reduced heteroarylnitrile/aryl halide for C&#8722;N bond formation under visible&#8208;light irradiation of quantum dots (QDs). A series of aryl and alkylamines with heteroarylnitriles/aryl halides exhibit high efficiency, site&#8208;selectivity and good functional&#8208;group tolerance. Moreover, consecutive C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N bond formation using benzylamines as substrates is also achieved, producing N&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamines with H2 evolution. The redox&#8208;neutral conditions, broad substrate scope, and efficiency of N&#8208;radical formation are advantageous for organic synthesis.

         <title>Directional Transformation of Heterometallic Oxo Clusters: A New Approach to Prepare Wide&#8208;Bandgap Cathode Interlayers for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by sulfur&#8208;containing organic ligands is employed as a molecular model to realize the directional preparation of PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure at the cathode interlayer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The oxygen atoms from the sulfate ion in the heterostructure connect with iodine from the perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. An efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is realized, and the stability of the devices is also improved.







Abstract
Typical wide&#8208;band gap cathode interlayer materials are difficulty in reducing interface recombination without limiting charge transport in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by S&#8208;containing ligands is introduced at the interface of perovskite and SnO2. By in situ heating, the cluster is transformed into PbSO4&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure. The oxygen atoms from sulfate ion in heterostructure connect with iodine from perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. While the yielded metallic interface between PbSO4 and PbTi3O7 promotes the electron transport across the interface. Finally, an efficiency as high as 24.2&#8201;% for the modified PSC is obtained. The heterostructure well&#8208;stabilize the interface of perovskite and SnO2, to greatly improve the device stability. This work provides a novel strategy to prepare wide&#8208;band gap cathode interlayer by directional transformation of heterometallic oxo clusters.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Propagation of a Minimal Catalytic RNA Network in GUV Protocells by Temperature Cycling and Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature&#8208;responsive RNA organelles inside giant unilamellar vesicles were exploited to increase catalytic rates of a minimal catalytic RNA network. Subsequent cycles of freezing and thawing serve as physico&#8208;chemical driver to exchange vesicle contents aiming at an efficient organelle&#8208;aided propagation of such catalytic networks across lipid vesicles.







Abstract
Compartmentalization is key to many cellular processes and a critical bottleneck of any minimal life approach. In cells, a complex chemistry is responsible for bringing together or separating biomolecules at the right place at the right time. Lipids, nucleic acids and proteins self&#8208;organize, thereby creating boundaries, interfaces and specialized microenvironments. Exploiting reversible RNA&#8208;based liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) inside giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), we present an efficient system capable of propagating an RNA&#8208;based enzymatic reaction across a population of GUVs upon freezing&#8208;thawing (FT) temperature cycles. We report that compartmentalization in the condensed RNA&#8208;rich phase can accelerate such an enzymatic reaction. In the decondensed state, RNA substrates become homogeneously dispersed, enabling content exchange between vesicles during freeze&#8208;thawing. This work explores how a minimal reversible phase separation system in lipid vesicles could help to implement spatiotemporal control in cyclic processes, as required for minimal cells.

         <title>Anticooperative Supramolecular Oligomerization Mediated by V&#8208;Shaped Monomer Design and Unconventional Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A V&#8208;shaped monomer derived from BODIPY has been shown to self&#8208;assemble in non&#8208;polar media into anticooperatively formed luminescent oligomers with ultrahigh thermal stability. The delicate balance between attractive interactions (unconventional C/N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F&#8722;B hydrogen bonds), steric side chain effects, and inefficient aromatic interactions associated with the non&#8208;preorganized V&#8208;shaped monomer geometry lead to a restricted growth into discrete oligomer stacks.







Abstract
After more than three decades of extensive investigations on supramolecular polymers, strategies for self&#8208;limiting growth still remain challenging. Herein, we exploit a new V&#8208;shaped monomer design to achieve anticooperatively formed oligomers with superior robustness and high luminescence. In toluene, the monomer&#8208;oligomer equilibrium is shifted to the monomer side, enabling the elucidation of the molecular packing modes and the resulting (weak) anticooperativity. Steric effects associated with an antiparallel staircase organization of the dyes are proposed to outcompete aromatic and unconventional B&#8722;F&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;N/C interactions, restricting the growth at the stage of oligomers. In methylcyclohexane (MCH), the packing modes and the anticooperativity are preserved; however, pronounced solvophobic and chain&#8208;enwrapping effects lead to thermally ultrastable oligomers. Our results shed light on understanding anticooperative effects and restricted growth in self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>Enhanced Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Selectivity of Clamp&#8208;Shaped Cobalt(II) Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clamp&#8208;shaped cobalt(II) porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes were investigated as to their electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and electrocatalytic ORR. Electrochemistry indicates that the first oxidation corresponds to a CoII/CoIII process. The ORR capacities of both complexes show higher selectively for the 4e&#8722; ORR and DFT calculations suggest a lower overpotential for the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway than for the 2e&#8722; pathway.







Abstract
The molecular structure, electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) features of two CoII porphyrin(2.1.2.1) complexes bearing Ph or F5Ph groups at the two meso&#8208;positions of the macrocycle are examined. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis reveal a highly bent, nonplanar macrocyclic conformation of the complex resulting in clamp&#8208;shaped molecular structures. Cyclic voltammetry paired with UV/Vis spectroelectrochemistry in PhCN/0.1&#8197;M TBAP suggest that the first electron addition corresponds to a macrocyclic&#8208;centered reduction while spectral changes observed during the first oxidation are consistent with a metal&#8208;centered CoII/CoIII process. The activity of the clamp&#8208;shaped complexes towards heterogeneous ORR in 0.1&#8197;M KOH show selectivity towards the 4e&#8722; ORR pathway giving H2O. DFT first&#8208;principle calculations on the porphyrin catalyst indicates a lower overpotential for 4e&#8722; ORR as compared to the 2e&#8722; pathway, consistent with experimental data.

         <title>Tuning the Cellular Uptake and Retention of Rhodamine Dyes by Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Contrast Imaging of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work reports a strategy involving the introduction of a polar aminoalkyl group into asymmetric rhodamine, which aids in regulating the cellular uptake, intracellular retention, and brightness of dyes to efficiently discriminate cancer cells from normal cells. The novel NYL2 dye can serve as an effective platform to engineer various activatable fluorescent probes for high&#8208;contrast imaging of cancer cells.







Abstract
Probes allowing high&#8208;contrast discrimination of cancer cells and effective retention are powerful tools for the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, conventional small&#8208;molecule probes often show limited performance in both aspects. Herein, we report an ingenious molecular engineering strategy for tuning the cellular uptake and retention of rhodamine dyes. Introduction of polar aminoethyl leads to the increased brightness and reduced cellular uptake of dyes, and this change can be reversed by amino acetylation. Moreover, these modifications allow cancer cells to take up more dyes than normal cells (16&#8208;fold) through active transport. Specifically, we further improve the signal contrast (56&#8208;fold) between cancer and normal cells by constructing activatable probes and confirm that the released fluorophore can remain in cancer cells with extended time, enabling long&#8208;term and specific tumor imaging.

         <title>Alternating Metal&#8208;Ligand Coordination Improves Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction by a Mononuclear Ru Catalyst
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;overpotential mechanistic route is proposed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. One metal center acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle. This ambivalent behavior of the metal along with the flexibility of the ligands allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate by intramolecular cyclization.







Abstract
Molecular electrocatalysts for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion often operate at large overpotentials, due to the large barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Illustrated with ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts, we herein propose a mechanistic route that involves one metal center that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle, by density functional theory in corroboration with experimental FTIR. The nucleophilic character of the Ru center manifests itself in the initial attack on CO2 to form [Ru&#8208;CO2]0, while its electrophilic character allows for the formation of a 5&#8208;membered metallacyclic intermediate, [Ru&#8208;CO2CO2]0,c, by addition of a second CO2 molecule and intramolecular cyclization. The calculated activation barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage via the metallacycle is decreased by 34.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 as compared to the non&#8208;cyclic adduct in the two electron reduced state of complex 1. Such metallacyclic intermediates in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction offer a new design feature that can be implemented consciously in future catalyst designs.

One metal center acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle. This ambivalent behavior of the metal along with the flexibility of the ligands allows for the formation of a 5-membered metallacyclic intermediate by intramolecular cyclization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO conversion often operate at large overpotentials, due to the large barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Illustrated with ruthenium polypyridyl catalysts, we herein propose a mechanistic route that involves one metal center that acts as both Lewis base and Lewis acid at different stages of the catalytic cycle, by density functional theory in corroboration with experimental FTIR. The nucleophilic character of the Ru center manifests itself in the initial attack on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [&lt;b&gt;Ru&lt;/b&gt;-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, while its electrophilic character allows for the formation of a 5-membered metallacyclic intermediate, [&lt;b&gt;Ru&lt;/b&gt;-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;0,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;, by addition of a second CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and intramolecular cyclization. The calculated activation barrier for C&#8722;O bond cleavage via the metallacycle is decreased by 34.9&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as compared to the non-cyclic adduct in the two electron reduced state of complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Such metallacyclic intermediates in electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction offer a new design feature that can be implemented consciously in future catalyst designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enforced Electronic&#8208;Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex Formation in Water for Photochemical Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
The sugar alcohol meglumine can solubilize organic compounds in water to synthetically useful levels, allowing the formation of enforced electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes in water. These EDA complexes offer a new activation for light driven C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling chemistry without sensitizers.







Abstract
The amino alcohol meglumine solubilizes organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor acceptor (EDA) complexes of haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles or thiols, which are not observed in organic solvents. UV&#8208;A photoinduced electron transfer within the EDA complexes induces the mesolytic cleavage of the halide ion and radical recombination of the arenes leading, after rearomatization and proton loss to C&#8722;C or C&#8722;S coupling products. Depending on the substitution pattern selective and unique cross&#8208;couplings are observed. UV and NMR measurements reveal the importance of the assembly for the photoinduced reaction. Enforced EDA aggregate formation in water allows new activation modes for organic photochemical synthesis.

         <title>Electroreduction Enables Regioselective 1,2&#8208;Diarylation of Alkenes with Two Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing cyanoarene radical anions as redox&#8208;mediators, the electrochemical regioselective 1,2&#8208;diarylation of alkenes with cyanoarenes and aryl halides takes place in the absence of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. The merit of this method has been well demonstrated by its wide scope, excellent regioselectivity, and powerful scale&#8208;up synthesis.







Abstract
Precisely introducing two similar functional groups into bulk chemical alkenes represents a formidable route to complex molecules. Especially, the selective activation of two electrophiles is in crucial demand, yet challenging for cross&#8208;electrophile&#8208;coupling. Herein, we demonstrate a redox&#8208;mediated electrolysis, in which aryl nitriles are both aryl radical precursors and redox&#8208;mediators, enables an intermolecular alkene 1,2&#8208;diarylation with a remarkable regioselectivity, thereby avoiding the involvement of transition&#8208;metal catalysts. This transformation utilizes cyanoarene radical anions for activating various aryl halides (including iodides, bromides, and even chlorides) and affords 1,2&#8208;diarylation adducts in up to 83&#8201;% yield and &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 regioselectivity with more than 80 examples, providing a feasible approach to complex bibenzyl derivatives.

         <title>Divalent Lanthanide Tetraisobutylaluminates: Reactivity and Living Isoprene Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homoleptic isobutylaluminates [Ln(AliBu4)2] (Ln=Sm, Eu, Yb) serve as single&#8208;component catalysts for cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;selective isoprene polymerization. Chlorination with C2Cl6 affords highly symmetric, mostly inactive clusters such as mixed&#8208;valent [Sm6Cl8(AliBu4)6], while activation of [Yb(AliBu4)2] with [PhNMe2H][B(C6F5)4] gives divalent &#8220;[Yb(AliBu4){AliBu3(PhNMe2)}][B(C6F5)4]&#8221; promoting ideal living polymerization.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln) tetraisobutylaluminates constitute key components in commercial 1,3&#8208;diene polymerization catalysts, and likewise are the homogeneous rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal catalysts of prime industrial importance. Discrete divalent rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal complexes [Ln(AliBu4)2] (Ln=Sm, Eu, Yb) reported here display the first structurally characterized homoleptic metal tetraisobutylaluminates. Treatment of [Ln(AliBu4)2] with C2Cl6 gives access to SmII/SmIII mixed&#8208;valence cluster [Sm6Cl8(AliBu4)6] and the YbII cluster [Yb4Cl4(AliBu4)4], respectively. Reaction with B(C6F5)3 leads to hydride abstraction and formation of arene&#8208;coordinated hydroborates such as [Sm{HB(C6F5)3}2(toluene)2]. Complexes [Ln(AliBu4)2] engage in single&#8208;component isoprene polymerization, affording high cis&#8208;1,4 polyisoprenes with narrow molecular weight distributions. Binary [Yb(AliBu4)2]/[HNPhMe2][B(C6F5)4] fabricates polyisoprene in a perfectly living manner. The catalytically active species are scrutinized by NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Electronic Structure Manipulation of the Mott Insulator RuCl3 via Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Topotactic Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of the honeycomb Mott&#8208;insulator RuCl3 are tailored by employing a facile and reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal intercalation strategy. The resulting product forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl3 monolayers, displaying distinct optical and electronic properties and dramatically boosted charge carrier transport characteristics.







Abstract
The core task for Mott insulators includes how rigid distributions of electrons evolve and how these induce exotic physical phenomena. However, it is highly challenging to chemically dope Mott insulators to tune properties. Herein, we report how to tailor electronic structures of the honeycomb Mott insulator RuCl3 employing a facile and reversible single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal intercalation process. The resulting product (NH4)0.5RuCl3&#8901;1.5&#8201;H2O forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl3 monolayers with NH4+ and H2O molecules. Its manipulated electronic structure markedly shrinks the Mott&#8211;Hubbard gap from 1.2 to 0.7&#8197;eV. Its electrical conductivity increases by more than 103 folds. This arises from concurrently enhanced carrier concentration and mobility in contrary to the general physics rule of their inverse proportionality. We show topotactic and topochemical intercalation chemistry to control Mott insulators, escalating the prospect of discovering exotic physical phenomena.

The resulting product (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;1.5&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O forms a new hybrid superlattice of alternating RuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules. Its manipulated electronic structure markedly shrinks the Mott&#8211;Hubbard gap from 1.2 to 0.7&#8197;eV. Its electrical conductivity increases by more than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; folds. This arises from concurrently enhanced carrier concentration and mobility in contrary to the general physics rule of their inverse proportionality. We show topotactic and topochemical intercalation chemistry to control Mott insulators, escalating the prospect of discovering exotic physical phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoswitchable Oxidopyrylium Ylide for Photoclick Reaction with High Spatiotemporal Precision: A Dynamic Switching Strategy to Compensate for Molecular Diffusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoswitching equilibrium between 2,3&#8208;diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) and mesoionic oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) is governed by dual&#8208;&#955; gating, in which PY can undergo fast [5+2] cycloaddition with BCN. A photoswitchable strategy for photoclick labeling with spatiotemporal control was developed, recycling the unreacted PY to minimize side&#8208;effects. Also, molecular diffusion of the reactive PY was compensated for by improvement of the spatial accuracy.







Abstract
We describe a novel type of photoclick reaction between 2,3&#8208;diaryl indenone epoxide (DIO) and ring&#8208;strained dipolarophiles, in which DIO serves as a P&#8208;type photoswitch to produce mesoionic oxidopyrylium ylide (PY) to initiate an ultra&#8208;fast [5+2] cycloaddition (k2h&#957;=1.9&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). The photoisomerization between DIO and PY can be tightly controlled by either 365 or 520&#8197;nm photo&#8208;stimulation, which allows reversion or regeneration of the reactive PY dipole on demand. Thus, this reversible photoactivation was exploited to increase the chemoselectivity of the [5+2] cycloaddition in complex environments via temporal dual&#8208;&#955; stimulation sequences and to recycle the DIO reagent for batch&#8208;wise protein conjugation. A dynamic photoswitching strategy is also proposed to compensate for molecular diffusion of PY in aqueous solution, enhancing the spatial resolution of lithographic surface decoration and bioorthogonal labeling on living cells via a spatiotemporal dual&#8208;&#955; photo&#8208;modulation.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Unsymmetrical Bis&#8208;Allylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes has been developed by simultaneously utilizing electrophilic trifluoromethyl alkenes and nucleophilic allylboronates as the allylic reagents. With the aid of a robust Ni0/NHC catalysis, valuable skipped trienes can be obtained in high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities under mild conditions.







Abstract
The catalytic bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes is an important but challenging protocol to construct all&#8208;carbon tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes. Particularly, the catalytic unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation of alkynes remains as an underexplored task to date. We herein report an unprecedented unsymmetrical bis&#8208;allylation by simultaneously utilizing electrophilic trifluoromethyl alkene and nucleophilic allylboronate as the allylic reagents. With the aid of robust Ni0/NHC catalysis, valuable skipped trienes can be obtained in high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivities under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction may proceed through a &#946;&#8208;fluorine elimination of a nickelacycle followed by a transmetalation step with allylboronate. The present method exhibits a good tolerance of various functional groups. Besides, the skipped triene products can undergo an array of elaborate transformations, which highlights the potential applications of this strategy.

         <title>Boranes Paving the Way to Anionic Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First examples of anionic cAACs (Ani&#8208;cAACs) bearing B(CN)3 or C2F5BF2 as N&#8208;substituents are reported and their stereo&#8208;electronic parameters have been evaluated. These anionic carbenes can replace anionic substituents as exemplified by the formation of selenium adducts and [Ani&#8208;cAAC&#8208;Au&#8208;PPh3].







Abstract
First examples of anionic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (Ani&#8208;cAACs) that contain borane substituents have been synthesized. The nature of the borane substituents allows a modulation of the &#963;&#8208;donor or &#960;&#8208;acceptor abilities compared to their neutral analogues. A B(CN)3&#8208;substituted Ani&#8208;cAAC has been generated and used in situ. The corresponding C2F5BF2&#8208;Ani&#8208;cAAC 6 was obtained in high yield on a multigram scale. First reactions of these novel ligands with elemental selenium and chloro(triphenylphosphine)gold(I) led to the anionic selenium adducts 7 and 8 and the Ani&#8208;cAAC gold complex 9. The properties of these compounds and data derived from theoretical calculations provide an insight into the electronic and steric properties of these novel anionic cAACs. Especially the ease of synthesis and the combination of properties such as negative charge, large buried volume, and good &#963;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability renders Ani&#8208;cAACs unique and promising new building blocks.

         <title>Type I Photosensitizer Targeting G&#8208;Quadruplex RNA Elicits Augmented Immunity for Cancer Ablation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (NIR) type&#8197;I photosensitizer (PS), BAMA, was developed using an acridinium scaffold that enables efficient O2.&#8722; production upon targeting G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). It was employed for imaging and effective photodynamic therapy (PDT) of an immunogenic cold tumor with bolstered antitumor immunity, raising the possibility of developing efficient PDT through ablation of functional RNAs for cancer therapy.







Abstract
Type&#8197;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising treatment modality for tumors with intrinsic hypoxia. However, type&#8197;I photosensitizers (PSs), especially ones with near infrared (NIR) absorption, are limited and their efficacy needs improvement via new targeting tactics. We develop a NIR type&#8197;I PS by engineering acridinium derived donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor systems. The PS exhibits an exclusive type&#8197;I PDT mechanism due to effective intersystem crossing and disfavored energy transfer to O2, and shows selective binding to G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) via hydrogen bonds identified by a molecular docking study. Moreover, it enables fluorogenic detection of G4s and efficient O2&#8901;&#8722; production in hypoxic conditions, leading to immunogenic cell death and substantial variations of gene expression in RNA sequencing. Our strategy demonstrates augmented antitumor immunity for effective ablation of immunogenic cold tumor, highlighting its potential of RNA&#8208;targeted type&#8197;I PDT in precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Near&#8208;Stoichiometric and Homogenized Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Minimized Performance Variation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>

Delaying initialized crystallization and manipulating crystal growth of mixed&#8208;cation alloyed perovskites by pre&#8208;seeding colloidal chemistry realized reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with homogenized chemical compositions and improved optoelectronic properties, delivering a record efficiency up to 24.31&#8201;% for blade&#8208;coated solar cells with minimized performance variation and extended lifespan.







Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation, small band&#8208;gap perovskites via rationally alloying formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA) together have been widely employed for blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells with satisfied efficiencies. One of the stringent challenges lies in difficult control of the nucleation and crystallization kinetics of the perovskites with mixed ingredients. Herein, a pre&#8208;seeding strategy by mixing FAPbI3 solution with pre&#8208;synthesized MAPbI3 microcrystals has been developed to smartly decouple the nucleation and crystallization process. As a result, the time window of initialized crystallization has been greatly extended by 3 folds (i.e. from 5&#8197;s to 20&#8197;s), which enables the formation of uniform and homogeneous alloyed&#8208;FAMA perovskite films with designated stoichiometric ratios. The resultant blade&#8208;coated solar cells achieved a champion efficiency of 24.31&#8201;% accompanied by outstanding reproducibility with more than 87&#8201;% of the devices showing efficiencies higher than 23&#8201;%.

         <title>Designing an Apparently Orbital&#8208;Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden [3s,5s]&#8208;Sigmatropic Shift through Transition&#8208;State Complexation and Stereoelectronic Effects</title>

         <dc:description>
The [3s,5s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift is a pericyclic reaction that is forbidden according to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Density functional theory calculations are used to show that systems utilizing transition&#8208;state complexation to a metal catalyst and strategically placed substituents engaging in key stereoelectronic effects can select for the [3s,5s] process and outcompete both allowed [3s,3s]&#8208; and [3s,5a]&#8208;shifts.







Abstract
The [3s,5s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift is an example of an orbital&#8208;symmetry forbidden pericyclic reaction that is outcompeted by the allowed [3s,3s]&#8208;sigmatropic shift. Density functional theory calculations are used to show that PdII&#8208;complexed systems with strategically placed substituents engaging in key stereoelectronic effects can select for the [3s,5s] process, thereby outcompeting both orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;allowed [3s,3s]&#8208; and [3s,5a]&#8208;shifts.

         <title>Phase Instability in van der Waals In2Se3 Determined by Surface Coordination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixture of experimental and theoretical approaches reveals that the ambient stability of 2D In2Se3 strongly depends on the surface coordination. Tetrahedral&#8208;coordinated surfaces were found to be more stable and suitable for device applications.







Abstract
van der Waals In2Se3 has attracted significant attention for its room&#8208;temperature 2D ferroelectricity/antiferroelectricity down to monolayer thickness. However, instability and potential degradation pathway in 2D In2Se3 have not yet been adequately addressed. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we here unravel the phase instability in both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8242;&#8208;In2Se3 originating from the relatively unstable octahedral coordination. Together with the broken bonds at the edge steps, it leads to moisture&#8208;facilitated oxidation of In2Se3 in air to form amorphous In2Se3&#8722;3xO3x layers and Se hemisphere particles. Both O2 and H2O are required for such surface oxidation, which can be further promoted by light illumination. In addition, the self&#8208;passivation effect from the In2Se3&#8722;3xO3x layer can effectively limit such oxidation to only a few nanometer thickness. The achieved insight paves way for better understanding and optimizing 2D In2Se3 performance for device applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Vicinal Tetrasubstituted Diamines via Reductive Coupling of Ketimines Templated by Chiral Diborons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines are prepared with high ee values and good to excellent yields via an unprecedented chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines. The synthetic value of these chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the development of efficient organocatalysts for the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes.







Abstract
We herein describe the chiral diboron&#8208;templated asymmetric homocoupling of aryl alkyl ketimines, providing for the first time a series of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines with excellent ee values and good to high yields. The powerful and efficient diboron&#8208;participated [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement is successfully demonstrated by the homocoupling of a variety of ketimines thanks to the rational design and engineering of chiral diborons. Systematic DFT studies suggest that two chiral diborons adopt different conformational assembling strategies to couple the diboron template with ketimine substrates in their tight concerted transition states to ensure the excellent enantioselectivities. The synthetic value of chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamines is demonstrated by the asymmetric &#945;&#8208;bromination of aliphatic aldehydes by employing a chiral vicinal tetrasubstituted diamine&#8208;based organocatalyst.

         <title>Breaking the Size Limitation of Directly&#8208;Synthesized PbS Quantum Dot Inks Toward Efficient Short&#8208;wavelength Infrared Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) PbS quantum dot (QD) inks is realized after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, SWIR solar cells and photodetector devices are fabricated, demonstrating record&#8208;high efficiency. The direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.







Abstract
PbS quantum dots (QDs) are promising building blocks for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) devices. The recently developed direct synthesis of semi&#8208;conductive PbS QD inks has substantially simplified the preparation processing and reduced the material cost, while facing the challenge to synthesize large&#8208;size QDs with absorption covering the SWIR region. Herein, we for the first time realize a low&#8208;cost, scalable synthesis of SWIR PbS QD inks after an extensive investigation of the reaction kinetics. Finally, based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, the solar cell demonstrates a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.44&#8201;% through an 1100&#8197;nm cutoff silicon filter and the photodetector device shows a low dark current density of 2&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V reverse bias with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 70&#8201;% at &#8776;1300&#8197;nm. Our results realize the direct synthesis of low&#8208;cost and scalable SWIR QD inks and may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.

Finally, based on these PbS SWIR QD inks, the solar cell demonstrates a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.44&#8201;% through an 1100&#8197;nm cutoff silicon filter and the photodetector device shows a low dark current density of 2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.8&#8197;V reverse bias with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 70&#8201;% at &#8776;1300&#8197;nm. Our results realize the direct synthesis of low-cost and scalable SWIR QD inks and may accelerate the industrialization of consumer SWIR technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Framework Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Nanotrap for the Precise Recognition and Separation of Gold</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold recovery with exceptional uptake capacity, high selectivity, and excellent recyclability has been achieved in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through the regulation of hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotraps within the pore surfaces.







Abstract
Utilizing weak interactions to effectively recover and separate precious metals in solution is of great importance but the practice remains a challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy to achieve precise recognition and separation of gold by regulating the hydrogen&#8208;bond (H&#8208;bond) nanotrap within the pore of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). It is found that both COF&#8208;HNU25 and COF&#8208;HNU26 can efficiently capture AuIII with fast kinetics, high selectivity, and uptake capacity. In particular, the COF&#8208;HNU25 with the high density of H&#8208;bond nanotraps exhibits an excellent gold uptake capacity of 1725&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, which is significantly higher than that (219&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1) of its isostructural COF (COF&#8208;42) without H&#8208;bond nanostrap in the pores. Importantly, the uptake capacity is strongly correlated to the number of H&#8208;bonds between phenolic OH in the COF and [AuCl4]&#8722; in water, and multiple H&#8208;bond interactions are the key driving force for the excellent gold recovery and reusability of the adsorbent.

         <title>Chemoproteomic and Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals that O&#8208;GlcNAc Regulates Mouse Embryonic Stem Cell Fate through the Pluripotency Network</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many pluripotency transcription factors (PTFs) were found to be O&#8208;GlcNAcylated in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and the O&#8208;GlcNAcylation stoichiometry at various modification sites suppressed during differentiation. Mechanistically, O&#8208;GlcNAc acts at the PTF network level and inhibition of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation enhances the expression of neuronal lineage&#8208;specific genes, promoting mESC&#8208;derived neuronal differentiation.







Abstract
Self&#8208;renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are influenced by protein O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) modification, but the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Herein, we report the identification of 979 O&#8208;GlcNAcylated proteins and 1340 modification sites in mouse ESCs (mESCs) by using a chemoproteomics method. In addition to OCT4 and SOX2, the third core pluripotency transcription factor (PTF) NANOG was found to be modified and functionally regulated by O&#8208;GlcNAc. Upon differentiation along the neuronal lineage, the O&#8208;GlcNAc stoichiometry at 123 sites of 83 proteins&#8212;several of which were PTFs&#8212;was found to decline. Transcriptomic profiling reveals 2456 differentially expressed genes responsive to OGT inhibition during differentiation, of which 901 are target genes of core PTFs. By acting on the core PTF network, suppression of O&#8208;GlcNAcylation upregulates neuron&#8208;related genes, thus contributing to mESC fate determination.

         <title>Structural and Mechanistic Studies on Substrate and Stereoselectivity of the Indole Monooxygenase VpIndA1: New Avenues for Biocatalytic Epoxidations and Sulfoxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal structure analysis of a group E flavoprotein monooxygenase in complex with substrates and products reveals a confined hydrophobic binding pocket that controls the stereoselectivity of sulfoxidation or epoxidation reactions. Molecular mechanics force&#8208;field calculations and kinetic studies allowed structure&#8208;based redesign of this cavity, resulting in variants with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity or acceptance of novel substrates.







Abstract
Flavoprotein monooxygenases are a versatile group of enzymes for biocatalytic transformations. Among these, group E monooxygenases (GEMs) catalyze enantioselective epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions. Here, we describe the crystal structure of an indole monooxygenase from the bacterium Variovorax paradoxus EPS, a GEM designated as VpIndA1. Complex structures with substrates reveal productive binding modes that, in conjunction with force&#8208;field calculations and rapid mixing kinetics, reveal the structural basis of substrate and stereoselectivity. Structure&#8208;based redesign of the substrate cavity yielded variants with new substrate selectivity (for sulfoxidation of benzyl phenyl sulfide) or with greatly enhanced stereoselectivity (from 35.1&#8201;% to 99.8&#8201;% ee for production of (1S,2R)&#8208;indene oxide). This first determination of the substrate binding mode of GEMs combined with structure&#8208;function relationships opens the door for structure&#8208;based design of these powerful biocatalysts.

         <title>A Heptacene Analogue Entailing a Quinoidal Benzodi[7]annulene (7/6/7 Ring) Core with a Tunable Configuration and Multiple Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Varying the substituents linked to the heptagons of a heptacene analogue containing a quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core allows modulation of the configuration of this acene. When Mes groups are attached to the heptagons, the resulting acene displays polymorphism, with a tunable configuration ranging from a curved to a wavy one. This acene can also be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid acenes containing heptagons have received increasing attention. We herein report a heptacene analogue containing a quinoidal benzodi[7]annulene core. Derivatives of this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene were obtained through an efficient synthetic strategy involving an Aldol condensation and a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction as key steps. The configuration of this heptacene analogue can be modulated from a wavy to a curved one by just varying the substituents from a (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl group to a 2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl (Trip) group. When mesityl (Mes) groups are linked to the heptagons, the resulting non&#8208;benzenoid acene displays polymorphism with a tunable configuration from a curved to a wavy one upon varying the crystallization conditions. In addition, this new non&#8208;benzenoid acene can be oxidized or reduced by NOSbF6 or KC8 to the respective radical cation or radical anion. Compared with the neutral acene, the radical anion shows a wavy configuration and the central hexagon becomes aromatic.

Co/Al&#8208; and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide bifunctional ligand, have been developed for site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of N&#8208;heteroarenes with alkynes. Pyridines, pyridones, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridines are efficiently alkenylated at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen. A ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer process is proposed as a general mechanism of these C&#8722;H activations.







Abstract
We report herein the design and development of Co/Al and Co/Mg bimetallic catalysts, supported by a phosphine/secondary phosphine oxide (PSPO) bifunctional ligand, for the site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H alkenylation of nitrogen&#8208;containing heteroarenes with alkynes. These catalysts enable the alkenylation of pyridine, pyridone, and imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives at the C&#8722;H site proximal to the Lewis basic nitrogen or oxygen atom, which represents a selectivity profile distinct from that of the previously developed cobalt&#8208;diphosphine/aluminum catalyst. The alkenylated products were obtained in moderate to good yields using various heterocycles and differently substituted internal alkynes. Kinetic isotope effect experiments suggest the irreversibility of the C&#8722;H activation step, the relevance of which to the rate&#8208;limiting step depends on the reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculations indicate that ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer is the common mechanism of C&#8722;H activation.

         <title>ARMOR: Auto&#8208;Assembled Resilient Biomimetic Calcified Ornaments for Selective Cell Protection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Driven Hybridization Chain Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy was created by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based HCR and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. The ARMOR can shield cells from external assaults and enhance the survival rate of the protected cells in an unfavorable environment. The ARMOR&#8208;based cell capture strategy can obtain more intact genetic information and provide a new method for clinical CTC analysis.







Abstract
Unlike plant and microbial cells having cell walls, the outermost layer of mammalian cell is a delicate, two&#8208;layered structure of phospholipids with proteins embedded, which is susceptible to environmental changes. It is necessary to create an &#8220;armor&#8221; on cell surface to protect cell integrity. Here, we propose an Auto&#8208;assembled Resilient bioMimetic calcified ORnaments (ARMOR) strategy driven by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and Ca2+ assisted calcification for selective cell protection. This co&#8208;recognition design enhances the selectivity and leverages robust in situ signal amplification by HCR to improve the sensitivity. The calcified shell is cogenerated by crosslinking the alginate&#8208;HCR product with Ca2+ ion. ARMOR has high efficiency for shielding cells from environmental assaults, which can be applied to circulating tumor cell (CTC) protection, isolation, and identification, maintaining the native state and intact genetic information for downstream analysis.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanobeacons Redirect Innate Immune Killing towards Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) were developed for redirecting innate immune killing towards cancer. The MINBs target the cancer cells and provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The recruited antibodies further gather natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages, triggering specific antibody&#8208;dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody&#8208;dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) to kill the tagged cancer cells.







Abstract
Harnessing innate immunity is an appealing strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, we report a new strategy called molecularly imprinted nanobeacons (MINBs) for redirecting innate immune killing towards triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). The MINBs were molecularly imprinted nanoparticles with the N&#8208;epitope of glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB) as the template and grafted with plentiful fluorescein moieties as the hapten. The MINBs could tag the TNBC cells via binding with GPNMB and thereby provide navigation for recruiting hapten&#8208;specific antibodies. The gathered antibodies could further trigger effective Fc&#8208;domain&#8208;mediated immune killing towards the tagged cancer cells. In vivo experiments showed that the TNBC growth was significantly inhibited after MINBs treatment by intravenous injection as compared with control groups. This study not only opens a new access for redirecting innate immunity towards TNBC but also paves the way for innate immunity&#8208;based therapy of other diseases.

         <title>Manipulating Host&#8208;Guest Charge Transfer of a Water&#8208;Soluble Double&#8208;Cavity Cyclophane for NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble double&#8208;cavity cyclophane with high electron&#8208;deficiency has been shown to bind two electron&#8208;rich guests and extend the charge&#8208;transfer absorption into the NIR&#8208;II region. The use of a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain led to a biocompatible host&#8211;guest complex exhibiting excellent NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects for cancer cell and bacterial ablation.







Abstract
Water&#8208;soluble small organic photothermal agents (PTAs) over NIR&#8208;II biowindow (1000&#8211;1350&#8197;nm) are highly desirable, but the rarity greatly limits their applications. Based on a water&#8208;soluble double&#8208;cavity cyclophane GBox&#8208;44+, we report a class of host&#8211;guest charge transfer (CT) complexes as structurally uniform PTAs for NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy. As a result of its high electron&#8208;deficiency, GBox&#8208;44+ can bind different electron&#8208;rich planar guests with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host/guest stoichiometry to readily tune the CT absorption band that extends to the NIR&#8208;II region. When using a diaminofluorene guest substituted with an oligoethylene glycol chain, the host&#8211;guest system realized both good biocompatibility and enhanced photothermal conversion at 1064&#8197;nm, and was then exploited as a high&#8208;efficiency NIR&#8208;II PTA for cancer cell and bacterial ablation. This work broadens the potential applications of host&#8211;guest cyclophane systems and provides a new access to bio&#8208;friendly NIR&#8208;II photoabsorbers with well&#8208;defined structures.

         <title>Preferential Pyrolysis Construction of Carbon Anodes with 8400&#8197;h Lifespan for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density K&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

A durable carbon anode has been constructed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density K&#8208;ion batteries by a preferential pyrolysis strategy, in which the low&#8208;potential active sites of sp2 hybridized C and vacancies were generated utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked supermolecule.







Abstract
Carbonaceous materials are promising anodes for practical potassium&#8208;ion batteries, but fail to meet the requirements for durability and high capacities at low potentials. Herein, we constructed a durable carbon anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density K&#8208;ion full cells by a preferential pyrolysis strategy. Utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked supermolecule, the preferential pyrolysis process introduces low&#8208;potential active sites of sp2 hybridized carbon and carbon vacancies, endowing a low&#8208;potential &#8220;vacancy&#8208;adsorption/intercalation&#8221; mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbonaceous materials are promising anodes for practical potassium-ion batteries, but fail to meet the requirements for durability and high capacities at low potentials. Herein, we constructed a durable carbon anode for high-energy-density K-ion full cells by a preferential pyrolysis strategy. Utilizing S and N volatilization from a &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked supermolecule, the preferential pyrolysis process introduces low-potential active sites of &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;

The as-prepared carbon anode exhibits a high capacity of 384.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (90&#8201;% capacity locates below 1&#8197;V vs. K/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), which contributes to a high energy density of 163&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of K-ion full battery.

         <title>The First UV Nonlinear Optical Selenite Material: Fluorination Control in CaYF(SeO3)2 and Y3F(SeO3)4</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;centrosymmetric hydrogen&#8208;free selenite Y3F(SeO3)4 was synthesized from the centrosymmetric CaYF(SeO3)2 by controlling the fluorine content. Y3F(SeO3)4 features large SHG intensity, wide band gap, short UV cut&#8208;off edge and high thermal stability.







Abstract
It is a great challenge to develop UV nonlinear optical (NLO) material due to the demanding conditions of strong second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity and wide band gap. The first ultraviolet NLO selenite material, Y3F(SeO3)4, has been obtained by control of the fluorine content in a centrosymmetric CaYF(SeO3)2. The two new compounds represent similar 3D structures composed of 3D yttrium open frameworks strengthened by selenite groups. CaYF(SeO3)2 has a large birefringence (0.138@532&#8197;nm and 0.127@1064&#8197;nm) and a wide optical band gap (5.06&#8197;eV). The non&#8208;centrosymmetric Y3F(SeO3)4 can exhibit strong SHG intensity (5.5&#215;KDP@1064&#8197;nm), wide band gap (5.03&#8197;eV), short UV cut&#8208;off edge (204&#8197;nm) and high thermal stability (690&#8201;&#176;C). So, Y3F(SeO3)4 is a new UV NLO material with excellent comprehensive properties. Our work shows that it is an effective method to develop new UV NLO selenite material by fluorination control of the centrosymmetric compounds.

         <title>Using Biological Photophysics to Map the Excited&#8208;State Topology of Molecular Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology to investigate the excited&#8208;state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in&#8197;cellulo using transient absorption spectroscopy is established and exemplified by two RuII photosensitizers (PSs) showing relevancy in photodynamic therapy. The kinetic signatures recorded for the PSs in&#8197;cellulo are distinct from those in water, indicating a complex interplay of either PS&#8208;biomolecular interaction or interaction between PSs or both.







Abstract
This study employs TLD1433, a RuII&#8208;based photodynamic therapy (PDT) agent in human clinical trials, as a benchmark to establish protocols for studying the excited&#8208;state dynamics of photosensitizers (PSs) in cellulo, in the local environment provided by human cancer cells. Very little is known about the excited&#8208;state properties of any PS in live cells, and for TLD1433, it is terra incognita. This contribution targets a general problem in phototherapy, which is how to interrogate the light&#8208;triggered, function&#8208;determining processes of the PSs in the relevant biological environment, and establishes methodological advances to study the ultrafast photoinduced processes for TLD1433 when taken up by MCF7 cells. We generalize the methodological developments and results in terms of molecular physics by applying them to TLD1433&#8217;s analogue TLD1633, making this study a benchmark to investigate the excited&#8208;state dynamics of phototoxic compounds in the complex biological environment.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Molecular Switch Toward Texture&#8208;Regulated Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Depending on the periodic pH evolution during Zn plating/stripping, a pH&#8208;triggered molecular switch with reversible transformation between &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone and &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate is applied to dynamically modulate the Zn/electrolyte interface. This molecular switch strategy results in texture&#8208;regulated Zn plating, suppressed hydrogen evolution, and excellent Zn reversibility even under high depth of discharge.







Abstract
Zn electrodes in aqueous media exhibit an unstable Zn/electrolyte interface due to severe parasitic reactions and dendrite formation. Here, a dynamic Zn interface modulation based on the molecular switch strategy is reported by hiring &#947;&#8208;butyrolactone (GBL) in ZnCl2/H2O electrolyte. During Zn plating, the increased interfacial alkalinity triggers molecular switch from GBL to &#947;&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (GHB). GHB strongly anchors on Zn surface via triple Zn&#8722;O bonding, leading to suppressive hydrogen evolution and texture&#8208;regulated Zn morphology. Upon Zn stripping, the fluctuant pH turns the molecular switch reaction off through the cyclization of GHB to GBL. This dynamic molecular switch strategy enables high Zn reversibility with Coulombic efficiency of 99.8&#8201;% and Zn||iodine batteries with high&#8208;cyclability under high Zn depth of discharge (50&#8201;%). This study demonstrates the importance of dynamic modulation for Zn electrode and realizes the reversible molecular switch strategy to enhance its reversibility.

         <title>Direct Oxygen&#8208;Oxygen Cleavage through Optimizing Interatomic Distances in Dual Single&#8208;atom Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual single&#8208;atom carbon electrocatalysts are rationally optimized for the interatomic distance and promote an effective oxygen reduction reaction via the direct oxygen&#8208;oxygen bond cleavage mechanism in acid electrolyte. The specific distance of dual&#8208;hetero single&#8208;atom pairs weakens and destabilizes the bond energy of the oxygen&#8208;oxygen bond through the strong and evenly bilateral electron and charge transfer capabilities.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on transition single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is sustainable in energy&#8208;conversion devices. However, the atomically controllable fabrication of single&#8208;atom sites and the sluggish kinetics of ORR have remained challenging. Here, we accelerate the kinetics of acid ORR through a direct O&#8722;O cleavage pathway through using a bi&#8208;functional ligand&#8208;assisted strategy to pre&#8208;control the distance of hetero&#8208;metal atoms. Concretely, the as&#8208;synthesized Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs on carbon substrates exhibited an outstanding ORR performance with the ultrahigh half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V vs. RHE in acid electrolyte. Experimental evidence and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs with a specific distance range of around 3&#8197;&#197;, which is the key to their ultrahigh activity, average the interaction between hetero&#8208;diatomic active sites and oxygen molecules. This work offers new insight into atomically controllable SACs synthesis and addresses the limitations of the ORR dissociative mechanism.

Here, we accelerate the kinetics of acid ORR through a direct O&#8722;O cleavage pathway through using a bi-functional ligand-assisted strategy to pre-control the distance of hetero-metal atoms. Concretely, the as-synthesized Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs on carbon substrates exhibited an outstanding ORR performance with the ultrahigh half-wave potential of 0.86&#8197;V vs. RHE in acid electrolyte. Experimental evidence and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the Fe&#8722;Zn diatomic pairs with a specific distance range of around 3&#8197;&#197;, which is the key to their ultrahigh activity, average the interaction between hetero-diatomic active sites and oxygen molecules. This work offers new insight into atomically controllable SACs synthesis and addresses the limitations of the ORR dissociative mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ir Nanoparticles Anchored on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Overall Water Splitting under pH&#8208;Universal Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient electrocatalyst was prepared by anchoring well&#8208;dispersed Ir nanoparticles on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets. The strong interaction of Ir and MOF through the formation of interfacial Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bonds optimized the adsorption energies of H2O, OH* and H*, thus leading to the improved performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water electrolysis under pH&#8208;universal conditions.







Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;activity and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts is critical for efficient hydrogen production by water electrolysis. Herein, we developed an advanced electrocatalyst by anchoring well&#8208;dispersed Ir nanoparticles on nickel metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) Ni&#8208;NDC (NDC: 2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic) nanosheets. Benefiting from the strong synergy between Ir and MOF through interfacial Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bonds, the synthesized Ir@Ni&#8208;NDC showed exceptional electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting in a wide pH range, superior to commercial benchmarks and most reported electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations revealed that the charge redistribution of Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Ir bridge induced the optimization of H2O, OH* and H* adsorption, thus leading to the accelerated electrochemical kinetics for HER and OER. This work provides a new clue to exploit bifunctional electrocatalysts for pH&#8208;universal overall water splitting.

The sugar alcohol meglumine enhances the solubility of organic compounds in water and enforces the formation of electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complexes, enabling photochemical C&#8722;C and C&#8722;S cross&#8208;coupling transformations without sensitizers. The light&#8208;driven redox&#8208;neutral protocol connects haloarenes with indoles, anilines, anisoles, and thiols, as reported by Burkhard K&#246;nig and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218775).

A flavin&#8208;dependent group E monooxygenase ("GEM&#8221;) has been characterized by crystal&#8208;structure analysis, computational and kinetic studies to reveal substrate binding and mechanistic details for this class of enzymes for the first time. Based on these data, Dirk Tischler, Norbert Str&#228;ter, and co&#8208;workers redesigned the substrate binding pocket to synthesize chiral epoxides and sulfoxides with high stereoselectivity, a true treasure of molecular gems, as described in their Research Article (e202300657).

A lead&#8208;doped titanium&#8208;oxo cluster protected by sulfur&#8208;containing organic ligands is employed as a molecular model to realize the preparation of a PbSO4&#8211;&#8208;PbTi3O7 heterostructure at the cathode interlayer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), as reported by Yong Peng, Lei Zhang, Jing Cao, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202218478). The oxygen atoms from the sulfate ion in the heterostructure connect with iodine from the perovskite to boost interfacial electron extraction and reduce charge recombination. The efficiency and stability of the modified PSC are significantly improved.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2 ECR) over metal phosphorous trichalcogenide (MPCh3) nanosheets was systematically investigated by Dong Wang, Chen Shen, Dan Ren, Hongguang Wang, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202217253). Unlike the layered CoPS3 and NiPS3 nanosheets, the active Sn atoms tend to be exposed on the surfaces of nonlayered SnPS3 nanosheets, which exhibit clearly improved formic acid selectivity.

         <title>Engineering Photosynthetic Microbial Consortia for Carbon&#8208;Negative Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li et&#8197;al. recently developed a highly compatible phototrophic community integrating a sucrose&#8208;producing CO2 sequestration module and a super&#8208;coupled module. By a simple alteration of the sucrose utilization module, four distinct products could be synthesized directly from channelling CO2 into various chemicals, thus enabling a carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis.







Abstract
Microbial consortia consisting of phototrophs and heterotrophs have raised extensive attention due to their potential in sustainable biotechnology. The challenge remains in the selection of appropriate partners since most heterotrophic microorganisms cannot naturally use the intermediate carbohydrates secreted by autotrophic partners. In a recent study, the Ni Lab has developed a highly compatible autotrophic&#8208;heterotrophic symbiotic system comprising Synechococcus elongatus and Vibrio natriegens. V.&#8197;natriegens (the sucrose utilization module) shows a high degree of nutritional complementarity and culturing compatibility with the engineered S. elongatus (the CO2 sequestration module). The combination of both species channels CO2 into various valuable chemicals, enabling carbon&#8208;negative biosynthesis.

         <title>The Rise of Trichlorides Enabling an Improved Chlorine Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorine is an indispensable base chemical that is used to produce numerous materials. To enable the chlorine industry to harvest renewable energies, a safe chlorine storage is of central importance. More recently, trichlorides, [Cl3]&#8722;, have evolved to a key technique for the storage of chlorine and for important chlorination reactions. In this minireview, the potential of trichlorides for academic research and the chlorine industry are outlined.







Abstract
Chlorine plays a central role for the industrial production of numerous materials with global relevance. More recently, polychlorides have been evolved from an area of academic interest to a research topic with enormous industrial potential. In this minireview, the value of trichlorides for chlorine storage and chlorination reactions are outlined. Particularly, the inexpensive ionic liquid [NEt3Me][Cl3] shows a similar and sometimes even advantageous reactivity compared to chlorine gas, while offering a superior safety profile. Used as a chlorine storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3] could help to overcome the current limitations of storing and transporting chlorine in larger quantities. Thus, trichlorides could become a key technique for the flexibilization of the chlorine production enabling an exploitation of renewable, yet fluctuating, electrical energy. As the loaded storage, [NEt3Me][Cl3], is a proven chlorination reagent, it could directly be employed for downstream processes, paving the path to a more practical and safer chlorine industry.

         <title>Antibacterial Nanomaterials: Mechanisms, Impacts on Antimicrobial Resistance and Design Principles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>

This review focuses on the impacts of antimicrobial nanomaterials on the evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The relationships among nanomaterial structures, bactericidal effects and AMR evolution are thoroughly discussed to summarize the design principles of desired antimicrobial nanomaterials for the prevention of AMR spread.







Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the biggest threats to the environment and health. AMR rapidly invalidates conventional antibiotics, and antimicrobial nanomaterials have been increasingly explored as alternatives. Interestingly, several antimicrobial nanomaterials show AMR&#8208;independent antimicrobial effects without detectable new resistance and have therefore been suggested to prevent AMR evolution. In contrast, some are found to trigger the evolution of AMR. Given these seemingly conflicting findings, a timely discussion of the two faces of antimicrobial nanomaterials is urgently needed. This review systematically compares the killing mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships of antibiotics and antimicrobial nanomaterials. We then focus on nano&#8208;microbe interactions to elucidate the impacts of molecular initiating events on AMR evolution. Finally, we provide an outlook on future antimicrobial nanomaterials and propose design principles for the prevention of AMR evolution.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarises the progress of the recently developed locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs), including their physicochemical properties, solution structures, and applications in lithium&#8208;metal batteries with a variety of high&#8208;energy cathode materials. A perspective on the future research directions of LCILEs to further understanding and achieve improved cell performances is outlined.







Abstract
Non&#8208;flammable ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are well&#8208;known candidates for safer and long&#8208;lifespan lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, the high viscosity and insufficient Li+ transport limit their practical application. Recently, non&#8208;solvating and low&#8208;viscosity co&#8208;solvents diluting ILEs without affecting the local Li+ solvation structure are employed to solve these problems. The diluted electrolytes, i.e., locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs), exhibiting lower viscosity, faster Li+ transport, and enhanced compatibility toward lithium metal anodes, are feasible options for the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs. Herein, the progress of the recently developed LCILEs are summarised, including their physicochemical properties, solution structures, and applications in LMBs with a variety of high&#8208;energy cathode materials. Lastly, a perspective on the future research directions of LCILEs to further understanding and achieve improved cell performances is outlined.

         <title>CRISPR&#8208;Cas Biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;Based Molecular Diagnostics</title>

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;based molecular diagnostic technologies. Four emerging research topics on target preamplification&#8208;free detection, microRNA (miRNA) detection, non&#8208;nucleic&#8208;acid detection, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection are also covered.







Abstract
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#8208;based nucleic acid testing has played a critical role in disease diagnostics, pathogen surveillance, and many more. However, this method requires a long turnaround time, expensive equipment, and trained personnel, limiting its widespread availability and diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology has recently demonstrated capability for nucleic acid detection with high sensitivity and specificity. CRISPR&#8208;mediated biosensing holds great promise for revolutionizing nucleic acid testing procedures and developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics. This review focuses on recent developments in both fundamental CRISPR biochemistry and CRISPR&#8208;based nucleic acid detection techniques. Four ongoing research hotspots in molecular diagnostics&#8208;target preamplification&#8208;free detection, microRNA (miRNA) testing, non&#8208;nucleic&#8208;acid detection, and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 detection&#8208;are also covered.

         <title>Hierarchical Microtubular Covalent Organic Frameworks Achieved by COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF Transformation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically microtubular covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were achieved by a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation process, where the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units were decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units. The mixed COFs with hierarchical architectures exhibited much&#8208;improved efficiency and selectivity in catalyzing CO2 reduction with phenylsilane and N&#8208;methylaniline due to enhanced mass transport ability.







Abstract
Pore environment and aggregated structure play a vital role in determining the properties of porous materials, especially regarding the mass transfer. Reticular chemistry imparts covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;aligned micro/mesopores, yet constructing hierarchical architectures remains a great challenge. Herein, we reported a COF&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation methodology to prepare microtubular COFs. In this process, the C3&#8208;symmetric guanidine units decomposed into C2&#8208;symmetric hydrazine units, leading to the crystal transformation of COFs. Moreover, the aggregated structure and conversion degree varied with the reaction time, where the hollow tubular aggregates composed of mixed COF crystals could be obtained. Such hierarchical architecture leads to enhanced mass transfer properties, as proved by the adsorption measurement and chemical catalytic reactions. This self&#8208;template strategy was successfully applied to another four COFs with different building units.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Chemoselective Coupling of Secondary Alcohols, Primary Alcohols and Methanol</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of secondary alcohol, primary alcohol and methanol for the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;methylated/alkylated alcohol with high chemoselectivity is presented.







Abstract
Herein, we report a manganese&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of secondary alcohols, primary alcohols and methanol for the synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;methylated/alkylated secondary alcohols. Using our method, a series of 1&#8208;arylethanol, benzyl alcohol derivatives, and methanol undergo sequential coupling efficiently to construct assembled alcohols with high chemoselectivity in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via methylation of a benzylated secondary alcohol intermediate to generate the final product.

         <title>pH&#8208;Triggered Recovery of Organic Polymer Photocatalytic Particles for the Production of High Value Compounds and Enhanced Recyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic nanoparticles are presented that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of an indole derivative. The particles could be readily recycled, allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;homogeneous polymeric photocatalysts are an emerging class of highly efficient and tunable photocatalytic materials, where the photocatalytic centers are easily accessible. The creation of highly efficient photocatalytic materials that can be rapidly separated and recovered is one of the critical challenges in photocatalytic chemistry. Here, we describe pH&#8208;responsive photocatalytic nanoparticles that are active and well&#8208;dispersed under acidic conditions but aggregate instantly upon elevation of pH, enabling easy recovery. These responsive photocatalytic polymers can be used in various photocatalytic transformations, including CrVI reduction and photoredox alkylation of indole derivative. Notably, the cationic nature of the photocatalyst accelerates reaction rate of an anionic substrate compared to uncharged species. These photocatalytic particles could be readily recycled allowing multiple successive photocatalytic reactions with no clear loss in activity.

         <title>Determining the Physico&#8208;Chemical Composition of Biomolecular Condensates from Spatially&#8208;Resolved NMR</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Because of the molecular complexity and dynamic nature of biomolecular condensates, effective tools to investigate their composition and structure have been lacking. Improved spatially&#8208;resolved NMR enables the quantification of multiple components in biomolecular condensates in equilibrium and in a label&#8208;free fashion. The ability to simultaneously observe proteins, small molecules, and water is expected to have a major impact on understanding the composition and physical chemistry of biomolecular condensates.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;Liquid phase separation has emerged as fundamental process underlying the formation of biomolecular condensates. Insights into the composition and structure of biomolecular condensates is, however, complicated by their molecular complexity and dynamics. Here, we introduce an improved spatially&#8208;resolved NMR experiment that enables quantitative analysis of the physico&#8208;chemical composition of multi&#8208;component biomolecular condensates in equilibrium and label&#8208;free. Application of spatially&#8208;resolved NMR to condensates formed by the Alzheimer's disease&#8208;associated protein Tau demonstrates decreased water content, exclusion of the molecular crowding agent dextran, presence of a specific chemical environment of the small molecule DSS, and &#8776;150&#8208;fold increased concentration of Tau inside the condensate. The results suggest that spatially&#8208;resolved NMR can have a major impact in understanding the composition and physical chemistry of biomolecular condensates.

         <title>Reactivities of &#945;&#8208;Oxo BMIDA Gold Carbenes Generated by Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Oxidation of BMIDA&#8208;Terminated Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Oxo BMIDA gold carbenes are oxidatively generated from BMIDA&#8208;terminated alkynes. With the electrophilicity modulated by BMIDA, these carbene species undergo C&#8722;H insertion in the absence of the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect. This chemistry provides expedient access to structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;boryl ketones, which were previously scarcely documented.







Abstract
An oxidative strategy is reported to access &#945;&#8208;oxo BMIDA gold carbenes directly from BMIDA&#8208;terminated alkynes. Besides offering expedient access to seldom studied boryl metal carbenes, these BMIDA gold carbene species undergo facile insertions into methyl, methylene, methine, and benzylic C&#8722;H bonds in the absence of the Thorpe&#8211;Ingold effect. They also undergo efficient OH insertion, cyclopropanation, and F&#8722;C alkylations. This chemistry provides rapid access to structurally diverse &#945;&#8208;BMIDA ketones, which are scarcely documented. In combination with DFT studies, the role of BMIDA is established to be an electron&#8208;donating group that attenuates the high electrophilicity of the gold carbene center.

         <title>Designing Solvated Double&#8208;Layer Polymer Electrolytes with Molecular Interactions Mediated Stable Interfaces for Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte is rationally designed for two purposes: enhancing the interfacial stability and Na ion conductance. The double&#8208;layer structure is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolytes to meet the different interfacial requirements. Meanwhile, different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizer to improve the Na+ conductivity and thermal stability.







Abstract
Unstable cathode&#8208;electrolyte and/or anode&#8208;electrolyte interface in polymer&#8208;based sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) will deteriorate their cycle performance. Herein, a unique solvated double&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (SDL&#8208;QSPE) with high Na+ ion conductivity is designed to simultaneously improve stability on both cathode and anode sides. Different functional fillers are solvated with plasticizers to improve Na+ conductivity and thermal stability. The SDL&#8208;QSPE is laminated by cathode&#8208; and anode&#8208;facing polymer electrolyte to meet the independent interfacial requirements of the two electrodes. The interfacial evolution is elucidated by theoretical calculations and 3D X&#8208;ray microtomography analysis. The Na0.67Mn2/3Ni1/3O2|SDL&#8208;QSPE|Na batteries exhibit 80.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 400&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;C with the Coulombic efficiency close to 100&#8201;%, which significantly outperforms those batteries using the monolayer&#8208;structured QSPE.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Persistent Spin Texture in a Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We implement electrically switchable persistent spin texture (PST) in a 2D perovskite ferroelectric, which highlights the potential of 2D ferroelectric PST&#8208;active materials for spin manipulation and facilitates high&#8208;performance spintronic device application.







Abstract
As a momentum&#8208;independent spin configuration, persistent spin texture (PST) could avoid spin relaxation and play an advantageous role in spin lifetime. Nevertheless, manipulation of PST is a challenge due to the limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationships. Herein, we present electrically switchable PST in a new 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (PA)2CsPb2Br7 (where PA is n&#8208;pentylammonium), which has a high Curie temperature of 349&#8197;K, evident spontaneous polarization (3.2&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and a low coercive electric field of 5.3&#8197;kV&#8201;cm&#8722;1. The combination of symmetry&#8208;breaking in ferroelectrics and effective spin&#8208;orbit field facilitates intrinsic PST in the bulk and monolayer structure models. Strikingly, the directions of spin texture are reversible by switching the spontaneous electric polarization. This electric switching behavior relates to the tilting of PbBr6 octahedra and the reorientation of organic PA+ cations. Our studies on ferroelectric PST of 2D hybrid perovskites afford a platform for electrical spin texture manipulation.

         <title>Amphibian&#8208;like Flexible Organic Crystal Optical Fibers for Underwater/Air Micro&#8208;Precision Lighting and Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic optical waveguides are good candidates for air/underwater dual&#8208;media compatible optical signal transduction. The passive signal transport in an organic flexible waveguide was effectively channelized for high&#8208;precision nano/micro particle sensing in ambient/aquatic conditions.







Abstract
Visible light guiding optical fibers with underwater operational capability are highly desired for subaquatic communication and sensing technologies. Herein, we present mechanically flexible, blue&#8208;violet fluorescent (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)biphenyl) (BPP) crystal waveguides with high&#8208;aspect ratio. These milli&#8208;meter&#8208;long BPP crystals guide light actively and passively in ambient and underwater conditions demonstrating their amphibian&#8208;like character. Due to the crystal's high flexibility, the optical fiber's output light direction in submerged and ambient states can be altered mechanically for high&#8208;precision lighting and sensing applications. The development of such multi&#8208;environment&#8208;compatible and mechanically flexible organic optical fibers acting as sensing materials possess enormous potential for short&#8208;range underwater photonic technologies.

         <title>Chemical Validation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase Using Fragment Linking and CRISPR Interference
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fragment screen yielded three series of Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphopantetheinyl adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT) ligands that bind to distinct regions within the active site. This presented a unique opportunity for fragment linking that was exploited for the design of higher affinity ligands, shown, using CRISPR interference, to possess on&#8208;target antimycobacterial activity.







Abstract
The coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway has attracted attention as a potential target for much&#8208;needed novel antimicrobial drugs, including for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), the lethal disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Seeking to identify inhibitors of Mtb phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (MtbPPAT), the enzyme that catalyses the penultimate step in CoA biosynthesis, we performed a fragment screen. In doing so, we discovered three series of fragments that occupy distinct regions of the MtbPPAT active site, presenting a unique opportunity for fragment linking. Here we show how, guided by X&#8208;ray crystal structures, we could link weakly&#8208;binding fragments to produce an active site binder with a KD &lt;20&#8197;&#956;M and on&#8208;target anti&#8208;Mtb activity, as demonstrated using CRISPR interference. This study represents a big step toward validating MtbPPAT as a potential drug target and designing a MtbPPAT&#8208;targeting anti&#8208;TB drug.

         <title>Organocatalytic Synthesis of Triflones Bearing Two Non&#8208;Adjacent Stereogenic Centers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient organocatalytic method to synthetically versatile chiral triflones with two non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers was developed. The work uses, for the first time, &#945;&#8208;aryl vinyl triflones as Michael acceptors in stereoselective catalysis. Control over the absolute configuration is achieved by a catalyst&#8208;controlled stereoselective C&#8722;C bond formation&#8208;protonation sequence.







Abstract
Trifluoromethylsulfones (triflones) are useful compounds for synthesis and beyond. Yet, methods to access chiral triflones are scarce. Here, we present a mild and efficient organocatalytic method for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral triflones using &#945;&#8208;aryl vinyl triflones, building blocks previously unexplored in asymmetric synthesis. The peptide&#8208;catalyzed reaction gives rise to a broad range of &#947;&#8208;triflylaldehydes with two non&#8208;adjacent stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. A catalyst&#8208;controlled stereoselective protonation following a C&#8722;C bond formation is key to control over the absolute and relative configuration. Straightforward derivatization of the products into, e.g., disubstituted &#948;&#8208;sultones, &#947;&#8208;lactones, and pyrrolidine heterocycles highlights the synthetic versatility of the products.

         <title>Fucose Migration Pathways Identified Using Infrared Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass&#8208;spectrometric study of fucosylated oligosaccharides is arduous due to the propensity of fucose to migrate in the gas phase&#8212;especially during the collision&#8208;induced dissociation step (but not always). Gas&#8208;phase infrared spectroscopy has shown its potential to identify fucose migration products. The investigations have also shown a new type of migration.







Abstract
Fucose is a ubiquitous monosaccharide associated to major classes of glycans. A main obstacle to the sequencing of fucosylated glycans is the migration of fucose, which leads to misinterpretations in mass spectrometry analysis. Here, using ion vibrational spectroscopy, we resolve the structure of fucosylated fragments of Lewis and blood group H antigen trisaccharides and we unveil the position and linkage of the fucose after migration. Our findings demonstrate that the structure of fragment ions resulting from fucose migration can be characterized. Additionally, we report a new type of fucose migration, which does not feature any change of mass and therefore had not been previously reported: it consists of a local migration where the fucose changes its position remaining on the initial residue. Our approach allows the characterization of glycans, an essential step to interpret glycomics data, as well as to understand underlying processes at play in mass spectrometry.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of the Orthorhombic Sn3O4 Polymorph</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A previously unreported orthorhombic Sn3O4 polymorph was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and characterized carefully by empirical and calculational methods.







Abstract
An unexplored tin oxide crystal phase (Sn3O4) was experimentally synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. After tuning the often&#8208;neglected parameters for the hydrothermal synthesis, namely the degree of filling of the precursor solution and the gas composition in the reactor head space, an unreported X&#8208;ray diffraction pattern was discovered. Through various characterization studies, such as Rietveld analysis, energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations, this novel material was characterized as orthorhombic mixed&#8208;valence tin oxide with the composition SnII2SnIVO4. This orthorhombic tin oxide is a new polymorph of Sn3O4, which differs from the reported conventional monoclinic structure. Computational and experimental analyses showed that orthorhombic Sn3O4 has a smaller band gap (2.0&#8197;eV), enabling greater absorption of visible light. This study is expected to improve the accuracy of hydrothermal synthesis and aid the discovery of new oxide materials.

         <title>Dynamically Resettable Electrode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface through Supramolecular Sol&#8208;Gel Transition Electrolyte for Flexible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel supramolecular sol&#8208;gel transition electrolyte that can dynamically reset damaged electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and accommodate deformations/dendrites is developed, providing a general strategy to enhance interface stability in flexible batteries.







Abstract
Flexible batteries based on gel electrolytes with high safety are promising power solutions for wearable electronics but suffer from vulnerable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces especially upon complex deformations, leading to irreversible capacity loss or even battery collapse. Here, a supramolecular sol&#8208;gel transition electrolyte (SGTE) that can dynamically accommodate deformations and repair electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces through its controllable rewetting at low temperatures is designed. Mediated by the micellization of polypropylene oxide blocks in Pluronic and host&#8208;guest interactions between &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) and polyethylene oxide blocks, the high ionic conductivity and compatibility with various salts of SGTE afford resettable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and thus constructions of a series of highly durable, flexible aqueous zinc batteries. The design of this novel gel electrolyte provides new insights for the development of flexible batteries.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Enabled Palladium(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H Arylation of Aliphatic Tertiary Amides

Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in simple amides has been achieved by using palladium(II) catalysis with a chiral sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) ligand. We report herein an efficient asymmetric PdII/SOHP&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic tertiary amides (up to 93&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee), in which the SOHP ligand plays a key role in the stereoselective C&#8722;H deprotonation&#8208;metalation step.







Abstract
Amide is one of the most widespread functional groups in organic and bioorganic chemistry, and it would be valuable to achieve stereoselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization in amide molecules. Palladium(II) catalysis has been prevalently used in the C&#8722;H activation chemistry in the past decades, however, due to the weakly&#8208;coordinating feature of simple amides, it is challenging to achieve their direct C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization with enantiocontrol by PdII catalysis. Our group has developed sulfoxide&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxypridine (SOHP) ligands, which exhibited remarkable activity in Pd&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H activation. In this work, we demonstrate that chiral SOHP ligands served as an ideal solution to enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H activation in simple amides. Herein, we report an efficient asymmetric PdII/SOHP&#8208;catalyzed &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of aliphatic tertiary amides, in which the SOHP ligand plays a key role in the stereoselective C&#8722;H deprotonation&#8208;metalation step.

         <title>Reductive Asymmetric Aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans Rearrangement by 1,3,2&#8208;Diazaphospholene Catalysis

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 17, April 17, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;step cascade transformation of chiral N&#8208;sulfinyl acrylamides comprised of a conjugate reduction, enantiospecific [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement, and subsequent S&#8722;O bond reductive cleavage provides access to synthetically valuable enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. Various &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides are obtained in good yields and high enantioselectivities under very mild conditions.







Abstract
1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene hydrides (DAP&#8722;H) enable smooth conjugate reduction of polarized double bonds. The transiently formed phosphorus&#8208;enolate provides a potential platform for reductive &#945;&#8208;functionalizations. In this respect, asymmetric C&#8208;heteroatom bond forming processes are synthetically appealing but remain elusive. We report a 1,3,2&#8208;diazaphospholene&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;step cascade reaction of N&#8208;sulfinyl acrylamides comprised of conjugate reduction, [2,3]&#8208;sigmatropic aza&#8208;Mislow&#8208;Evans rearrangement and subsequent S&#8722;O bond cleavage. The obtained enantio&#8208;enriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides are formed in good yields and excellent enantiospecificity. The stereo&#8208;defined P&#8208;bound N,O&#8208;ketene aminal ensures an excellent transfer of chirality from the sulfur stereocenter to &#945;&#8208;carbon. The transformation operates under mild conditions at ambient temperature. Moreover, DAP&#8722;H is a competent reductant for the cleavage of formed sulfenate ester, eliminating the extra step in traditional Mislow&#8208;Evans processes.

         <title>Haloboration of o&#8208;Alkynyl Phenols Generates Halogenated Bicyclic&#8208;Boronates

O&#8208;directed alkyne trans&#8208;haloboration using BX3 (X=Cl or Br) leads to C4&#8208;halogenated benzoxaborinines that are useful intermediates for accessing the core structure found in bicyclic boronate based &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitors. A computational study identified two viable mechanisms to furnish the trans&#8208;haloboration products.







Abstract
Benzoxaborinines are intermediates en&#8208;route to bicyclic boronates that are important active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Herein, the haloboration of o&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;phenols using BX3 (X=Cl or Br) is disclosed as a route to form C4&#8208;X&#8208;benzoxaborinines with good functional group tolerance. Computational studies indicated that there are two similar in barrier mechanisms: (i) double alkyne haloboration followed by retro&#8208;haloboration; (ii) concerted trans&#8208;haloboration involving an exogenous chloride source. The C4&#8208;halide in these benzoxaborinines is useful, with a one&#8208;pot haloboration&#8208;Negishi cross coupling protocol effective to form benzoxaborinines with an alkyl or an aryl at C4. Therefore this method is a useful addition to the toolbox for synthesising bicyclic&#8208;boronates that are attracting increasing attention as APIs.

Abstract
This invited Team Profile was created by Clay C.&#8197;C. Wang. He and his collaborators recently published an article on the conversion of polyethylenes to fungal secondary metabolites. First, the team employs an oxidative catalytic process, highly tolerant of impurities, to degrade post&#8208;consumer polyethylenes to carboxylic diacids. Then, they utilize engineered strains of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans to convert these diacids to structurally diverse and pharmacologically active secondary metabolites. &#8220;Conversion of Polyethylenes into Fungal Secondary Metabolites&#8221;, C. Rabot, Y. Chen, S. Bijlani, Y.&#8208;M. Chiang, C.&#8197;E. Oakley, B.&#8197;R. Oakley, T.&#8197;J. Williams, C.&#8197;C.&#8197;C. Wang, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2023, e202214609; Angew.

         <title>Delayed Doublet Emission in a Cerium(III) Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doublet emission from open&#8208;shell molecules has demonstrated its research and application value in recent years. However, understandings of the photoluminescence mechanism of open&#8208;shell molecules are far less than that of closed&#8208;shell molecules, leading to challenges in molecular design of efficient doublet emission systems. Here we report a cerium(III) 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbozol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl&#8208;tris(pyrazolyl)borate complex Ce(CzPhTp)3 with a new luminescence mechanism of delayed doublet emission, which also represents the first example with metal&#8208;centered delayed photoluminescence. The energy gap between the doublet and triplet excited states of Ce(CzPhTp)3 is reduced by the management of the inner and outer coordination spheres, thereby promoting efficient energy transfer between the two excited states and activating the delayed emission. The photoluminescence mechanism discovered may provide a new way for the design of efficient doublet emission and bring insights into rational molecular design and energy level regulation in open&#8208;shell molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled continuous evolution of enzymatic activity screened at ultrahigh throughput using drop&#8208;based microfluidics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes are highly specific catalysts delivering improved drugs and greener industrial processes. Naturally occurring enzymes must typically be optimized which is often accomplished through directed evolution; however, this is still a labor&#8208; and capital&#8208;intensive process, due in part to multiple molecular biology steps including DNA extraction, in vitro library generation, transformation, and limited screening throughput. We present an effective and broadly applicable continuous evolution platform that enables controlled exploration of fitness landscape to evolve enzymes at ultrahigh throughput based on direct measurement of enzymatic activity. This drop&#8208;based microfluidics platform cycles cells between growth and mutagenesis followed by screening with minimal human intervention, relying on the nCas9 chimera with mutagenesis polymerase to produce in vivo gene diversification using sgRNAs tiled along the gene. We evolve alditol oxidase to change its substrate specificity towards glycerol, turning a waste product into a valuable feedstock. We identify a variant with a 10.5&#8208;fold catalytic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>The Indenyl Effect: Accelerated C&#8208;H Amidation of Arenes via Ind*Rh(III) Nitrene Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigations into C&#8208;H amidation reactions catalysed by cationic half&#8208;sandwich d6 metal complexes revealed that the indenyl&#8208;derived catalyst [Ind*RhCl2]2 significantly accelerated the directed ortho C&#8208;H amidation of benzoyl silanes using 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazol&#8208;5&#8208;ones. Ring slippage involving a haptotropic &#951;5 to &#951;3 rearrangement of the indenyl complex proposedly enables ligand substitution at the metal centre to proceed via associative, rather than dissociative pathways, leading to significant rate and yield enhancements. Intriguingly, this phenomenon appears specific for C&#8208;H amidation reactions involving weakly coordinating carbonyl&#8208;based directing groups with no acceleration observed for the corresponding reactions involving strongly coordinating nitrogen&#8208;based directing groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Utilizing Cationic Vacancies and Spontaneous Polarization on Cathode to Enhance Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage and Inhibit Dendrite Growth in Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High energy density and intrinsic safety are the central pursuits in developing rechargeable Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). The capacity and stability of nickel cobalt oxide (NCO) cathode are unsatisfactory because of its semiconductor character. Herein, we propose a built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) approach by synergizing cationic vacancies and ferroelectric spontaneous polarization on cathode side to facilitate electron adsorption and suppress zinc dendrite growth on the anode side. Concretely, NCO with cationic vacancies was constructed to expand lattice spacing for enhanced zinc&#8208;ion storage. Heterojunction with BEF leads to the Heterojunction//Zn cell exhibiting a capacity of 170.3 mAh g&#8208;1 at 400 mA g&#8208;1 and delivering a competitive capacity retention of 83.3% over 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8208;1. We conclude the role of spontaneous polarization in suppressing zinc dendrite growth dynamics, which is conducive to developing high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;safety batteries via tailoring defective materials with ferroelectric polarization on the cathode.</dc:description>

         <title>Manipulating coulombic efficiency of cathodes in aqueous zinc batteries by anion chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrolyte environments, including cations, anions, and solvents are critical for the performance delivery of cathodes of batteries. Most works focused on interactions between cations and cathode materials, in contrast, there is a lack of in&#8208;depth research on the correlation between anions and cathodes. Here, we systematically investigated how anions manipulate the coulombic efficiency (CE) of cathodes of zinc batteries. We take intercalation&#8208;type V2O5 and conversion&#8208;type I2 cathodes as typical cases for profound studies. It was found that electronic properties of anions, including charge density and its distribution,&#160;can tune conversion or intercalation reactions, leading to significant CE differences. Using operando visual Raman microscopy and theoretical simulations, we confirm that competitive coordination between anions and I&#8208; can regulate CEs by modulating polyiodide diffusion rates in Zn&#8208;I2 cells. In Zn&#8208;V2O5 cells, anion&#8208;tuned solvation structures vastly affect CEs through varying Zn2+ intercalation kinetics. Conversion I2 cathode achieves a 99% CE with highly electron&#8208;donating anions, while anions with preferable charge structures that interact strongly with Zn2+ afford an intercalation V2O5 a nearly 100% CE. Understanding the mechanism of anion&#8208;governed CEs will help us evaluate compatibility of electrolytes with electrodes, thus providing a guideline for anion selection and electrolyte design for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;cycling zinc batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV Photon Upconversion: Recent Progress in New Materials and Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review summarizes recent progress in photon upconversion from visible to ultraviolet light based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. The development of new chromophores, which have achieved high efficiency and low threshold excitation intensity, the material design for film formation, and their application in various photochemical processes are summarized, and the future challenges as an ultraviolet light source are discussed.







Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV, &#955;&lt;400&#8197;nm) light is essential for various photochemical reactions, but its intensity in the solar spectrum is very low, and light sources that artificially generate high&#8208;energy UV light are inefficient and environmentally unfriendly. A solution to this problem is photon upconversion (UC) from visible (vis, &#955;&gt;400&#8197;nm) light to UV light. Among several mechanisms, UC based on triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA&#8208;UC) in particular has made remarkable progress in recent years. The development of new chromophores has enabled highly efficient conversion of low&#8208;intensity visible light into UV light. In this review, we summarize the recent development of visible&#8208;to&#8208;UV TTA&#8208;UC, from the development of chromophores and their production into films to their application in various photochemical processes such as catalysis, bond activation and polymerization. Finally, challenges and opportunities in future material development and applications will be discussed.

         <title>Mechanically activated solid state radical polymerization and cross&#8208;linking via piezocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solventless free radical polymerization of solid vinyl monomers that is mechanically initiated by piezocatalytic BaTiO3 powders is reported. Activating BaTiO3 using hammer strikes and ball milling instigates hydroxyl radical production from surface&#8208;bound water in the solid state. Mechanoredox hydroxyl radicals are then directed to polymerize traditionally incompatible co&#8208;monomers and create cross&#8208;linked polymer resins dictated by mechanical input.







Abstract
Piezocatalysis offers a means to transduce mechanical energy into chemical potential, harnessing physical force to drive redox reactions. Working in the solid state, we show here that piezoelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles can transduce mechanical load into a flux of reactive radical species capable of initiating solid state free radical polymerization. Activation of a BaTiO3 powder by ball milling, striking with a hammer, or repeated compressive loading generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH), which readily initiate radical chain growth and crosslinking of solid acrylamide, acrylate, methacrylate and styrenic monomers. Control experiments indicate a critical role for chemisorbed water on the BaTiO3 nanoparticle surface, which is oxidized to &#8901;OH via mechanoredox catalysis. The force&#8208;induced production of radicals by compressing dry piezoelectric materials represents a promising new route to harness mechanical energy for solid state radical synthesis.

         <title>Tuning the Electronic Properties of Platinum in Hybrid&#8208;Nanoparticle Assemblies for use in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum is the best electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we demonstrate that by contact electrification of Pt nanoparticle satellites on a gold or silver core, the Fermi level of Pt can be tuned. The electronic properties of Pt in such hybrid nanocatalysts were experimentally characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with the probe molecule 2,6&#8208;dimethyl phenyl isocyanide (2,6&#8208;DMPI). Our experimental findings are corroborated by a hybridization model and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, we demonstrate that tuning of the Fermi level of Pt results in reduced or increased overpotentials in water splitting.</dc:description>

Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediate. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization is unknown.

Abstract
Isodesmic reactions represent mild alternatives to other chemical transformations that require harsh oxidizing agents or highly reactive intermediates. However, enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization is unknown and enantioselective direct iodination of inert C&#8722;H bond is very rare. Rapid synthesis of chiral aromatic iodides is of significant importance for synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report an unprecedented highly enantioselective isodesmic C&#8722;H functionalization to access chiral iodinated phenylacetic Weinreb amides via desymmetrization and kinetic resolution with PdII catalysis. Importantly, further transformations of the enantioenriched products are readily available at the iodinated or the Weinreb amide position, paving the way of related studies for synthetic and medicinal chemists.

         <title>Proton Tunneling Distances for Metal Hydrides Formation Manage the Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a series of manganese polypyridine complexes, the intramolecular proton tunnelling distances for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) vary from 2.400 to 2.696&#8197;&#197; while the other structural, energetic, and electronic factors remain essentially similar. The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity of these catalysts is dominated by the intramolecular PTD&#8208;MH and the main product shifts from CO to HCOOH with a PTD&#8208;MH difference of ca. 0.3&#8197;&#197;.







Abstract
A series of manganese polypyridine complexes were prepared as CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Among these catalysts, the intramolecular proton tunneling distance for metal hydride formation (PTD&#8208;MH) vary from 2.400 to 2.696&#8197;&#197; while the structural, energetic, and electronic factors remain essentially similar to each other. The experimental and theoretical results revealed that the selectivity of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is dominated by the intramolecular PTD&#8208;MH within a difference of ca. 0.3&#8197;&#197;. Specifically, the catalyst functionalized with a pendent phenol group featuring a slightly longer PTD&#8208;MH favors the binding of proton to the [Mn&#8722;CO2] adduct rather than the Mn center and results in ca. 100&#8201;% selectivity for CO product. In contrast, decreasing the PTD&#8208;MH by attaching a dangling tertiary amine in the same catalyst skeleton facilitates the proton binding on the Mn center and switches the product from CO to HCOOH with a selectivity of 86&#8201;%.

         <title>Carbon Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Bandgap Emission for Electroluminescent Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We perform radical&#8208;assisted synthesis of hexagon&#8208;shaped carbon quantum dots (H&#8208;CQDs) delivering near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield as well as a high electron mobility of up to 0.07&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. The H&#8208;CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes show a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6&#8201;% and a record maximum brightness of over 11&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) feature bright and tunable photoluminescence, solution processability, and low toxicity, showing great potential in optoelectronics. However, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of CQDs with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) has not been achieved so far. In this study, we perform radical&#8208;assisted synthesis of hexagon&#8208;shaped CQDs (H&#8208;CQDs) delivering near&#8208;unity PLQY (96&#8201;%). Experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that the large vertically oriented transition dipole moment of H&#8208;CQDs originating from high symmetry results in nearly 100&#8201;% PLQY. The H&#8208;CQDs also exhibited a high electron mobility of up to 0.07&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. These properties enable the H&#8208;CQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 4.6&#8201;% and a record maximum brightness of over 11&#8201;000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. This study represents a significant advance that CQDs&#8208;based electroluminescent device can be utilized for potential display and lighting applications.

         <title>The Regioselective Solid&#8208;State Photo&#8208;Mechanochemical Synthesis of Nanographenes with UV light</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry and mechanochemistry have been combined to synthesize nanographenes in the complete absence of bulk solvents. The concept is showcased with two reactions&#8212;the Mallory reaction and the cyclodehydrochlorination, both applicable to the intramolecular formation of C&#8722;C bonds. Moreover, the approach can even form these bonds regioselectively in larger systems&#8212;something not possible before in mechanochemistry.







Abstract
Photochemical reactors inherently suffer from the low penetration depth of light and therefore rely on high dilutions to enable chemical reactions. Here we present the first method of UV (ultraviolet) photochemistry in the complete absence of bulk solvents in a ball mill. Triphenylene was synthesized by two routes, the Mallory reaction and the cyclodehydrochlorination (CDHC), resulting in yields of 81 and 92&#8201;%, respectively. The reaction was successfully scaled up to the gram scale and the robustness of the method was demonstrated for several different substrates. Finally, the regioselective assembly of nanographenes by mechanochemistry was demonstrated for larger systems. Thus, the mechanochemical approach presented here provides a powerful new tool for the atomically precise construction of nanographenes.

         <title>Influence of Potassium Metal&#8208;Support Interactions on Dendrite Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography imaging, cryogenic&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM), and mesoscale modeling are combined to explain how the potassium metal&#8208;support energetics influence the electrodeposit microstructure. Wettability critically influences the nucleation response, the growing film morphology and associated stress state, and the propensity for dendritic growth.







Abstract
Combined synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanotomography imaging, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) and modeling elucidate how potassium (K) metal&#8208;support energetics influence electrodeposit microstructure. Three model supports are employed: O&#8208;functionalized carbon cloth (potassiophilic, fully&#8208;wetted), non&#8208;functionalized cloth and Cu foil (potassiophobic, nonwetted). Nanotomography and focused ion beam (cryo&#8208;FIB) cross&#8208;sections yield complementary three&#8208;dimensional (3D) maps of cycled electrodeposits. Electrodeposit on potassiophobic support is a triphasic sponge, with fibrous dendrites covered by solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and interspersed with nanopores (sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm to 100&#8197;nm scale). Lage cracks and voids are also a key feature. On potassiophilic support, the deposit is dense and pore&#8208;free, with uniform surface and SEI morphology. Mesoscale modeling captures the critical role of substrate&#8208;metal interaction on K metal film nucleation and growth, as well as the associated stress state.

         <title>Monitoring Cardiac Biomarkers with Aptamer&#8208;Based Molecular Pendulum Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthetic nucleic acid&#8208;based reagent&#8208;free electronic biomolecular analysis technique enabled by high&#8208;performance signal transduction with molecular pendulums is presented. The approach was applied to the analysis of cardiac biomarkers with low femtomolar detection limits and minimal cross&#8208;reactivity in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.







Abstract
Reagent&#8208;free electronic biosensors capable of analyzing disease markers directly in unprocessed body fluids will enable the development of simple &amp; affordable devices for personalized healthcare monitoring. Here we report a powerful and versatile nucleic acid&#8208;based reagent&#8208;free electronic sensing system. The signal transduction is based on the kinetics of an electrode&#8208;tethered molecular pendulum&#8212;a rigid double stranded DNA with one of the strands displaying an analyte&#8208;binding aptamer and the other featuring a redox probe&#8212;that exhibits field&#8208;induced transport modulated by receptor occupancy. Using chronoamperometry, which enables the sensor to circumvent the conventional Debye length limitation, the binding of an analyte can be monitored as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag. The sensing platform demonstrates a low femtomolar quantification limit and minimal cross&#8208;reactivity in analyzing cardiac biomarkers in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.

         <title>Assembly of an A6L6 Anion Trigonal Antiprism and Binding of Glucopyranosides and Polyethylene Glycols (PEGs)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Appending triphenylphosphine oxide with three bis(urea) moieties has led to a ligand that assembles with phosphate anions to afford an unusual A6L6 trigonal antiprism. This antiprismatic cage features one central cavity and two large outer pockets which can bind monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000, and PEG2000), respectively, as confirmed by crystal structure analysis.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) has proven to be a very effective strategy for the construction of polyhedral structures. Here we demonstrate that variation of the &#8220;angle&#8221; of the backbone of C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, from triphenylamine to triphenylphosphine oxide, results in the change of the final construct from an A4L4 tetrahedron to a higher&#8208;nuclearity, A6L6 trigonal antiprism (A=anion, herein PO43&#8722;; L=ligand). Most interestingly, this assembly features a huge hollow internal space that is divided into three compartments: one central cavity and two large outer pockets. This multi&#8208;cavity character enables the binding of different guests, namely monosaccharides or polyethylene glycol molecules (PEG600, PEG1000 and PEG2000), respectively. The results prove that anion coordination by multiple hydrogen bonds may provide both sufficient strength and flexibility, thus making possible the formation of complicated structures with adaptive guest binding ability.

         <title>Restructuring and Activation of Cu(111) under Electrocatalytic Reduction Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potential&#8208; and pH&#8208; dependent restructuring of the Cu(111) surface induced by H adsorption under electrochemical reduction in acidic conditions is decoded by a combination of a grand canonical ensemble representation of surface states and operando electrochemical STM experiments.







Abstract
The dynamic restructuring of Cu surfaces in electroreduction conditions is of fundamental interest in electrocatalysis. We decode the structural dynamics of a Cu(111) electrode under reduction conditions by joint first&#8208;principles calculations and operando electrochemical scanning tunneling microscopy (ECSTM) experiments. Combining global optimization and grand canonical density functional theory, we unravel the potential&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent restructuring of Cu(111) in acidic electrolyte. At reductive potential, Cu(111) is covered by a high density of H atoms and, below a threshold potential, Cu adatoms are formed on the surface in a (4&#215;4) superstructure, a restructuring unfavorable in vacuum. The strong H adsorption is the driving force for the restructuring, itself induced by the electrode potential. On the restructured surface, barriers for hydrogen evolution reaction steps are low. Restructuring in electroreduction conditions creates highly active Cu adatom sites not present on Cu(111).

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Dihydropyrazoles by Palladium/Xu&#8208;Phos&#8208;Catalyzed Alleneamination of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;Unsaturated Hydrazones with Propargylic Acetates</title>

         <dc:description>
A new robust palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective alleneamination reaction of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates is described. The salient features of this reaction include general substrate scope, well functional group tolerance, good yields and high enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric carboamination reaction is one of the most significant transformations in organic chemistry. Herein, we report the first palladium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alleneamination of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated hydrazones with propargylic acetates. This protocol enables the efficient installation of various multisubstituted allene groups onto dihydropyrazoles in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities. The chiral sulfinamide phosphine ligand Xu&#8208;5 exhibits highly efficient stereoselective control in this protocol. The salient features of this reaction include the readily available starting materials, a broad substrate scope, an easy scale&#8208;up, mild reaction conditions and versatile transformations.

         <title>Exclusive Co&#8208;N4 Sites Confined in Two&#8208;dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Layers Enabling Highly Selective CO2 Electroreduction at Industrial&#8208;level Current</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the rich chemistry of both metal sites and ligands, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) possess abundant structures and tunable functionalities, which bring new opportunities for the design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance materials for catalysis and electrochemical processes. Herein, we first conduct density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations and predict that Co&#8208;based porphyrin porous organic layers (Co&#8208;PPOLs) exhibit good activity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion because of the low *CO adsorption energy at the Co&#8208;N4 sites, which shall facilitate the *CO desorption and gaseous CO formation. Then, we rationally design and prepare novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Co&#8208;PPOLs through a facile surfactant&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up method, which have exclusive Co&#8208;N4 sites. The 2D ultrathin feature of Co&#8208;PPOLs ensures the exposure of catalytic centers. Together with the large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity and CO2 adsorption capability, the Co&#8208;PPOLs achieve outstanding activity and selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO with FECO = 94.2% at a moderate cathodic potential (&#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE), accompanied with high chemical stability. In addition, Co&#8208;PPOLs can reach a high current above 200 mA in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactor, and maintain a high FECO &gt; 90% over 20 h, enabling industrial&#8208;level current and near&#8208;unity CO selectivity in CO2 electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;opening Polymerization of Enantiopure Bicyclic Ether&#8208;ester Monomers toward Closed&#8208;loop Recyclable and Crystalline Stereoregular Polyesters via Chemical Upcycling of Bioplastic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although great successes have been achieved, the preparation of closed&#8208;loop recyclable polyesters with high working temperatures still remains as a big challenge. Herein, we present the syntheses of a series of enantiopure bicyclic ether&#8208;ester monomers by upcycling of poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) bioplastic. The &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerizations of these enantiopure monomers to produce stereoregular polyesters with controlled molecular weights and well&#8208;defined chain ends were achieved. The effects of stereoconfiguration and substituent on polymerization kinetics and thermodynamics as well as the thermal properties of resultant polyesters were investigated. Of note, the stereoregular polyesters are semi&#8208;crystalline materials with melting temperatures up to 176 &#176;C, even higher than the commodity polyolefin plastics. These polyesters can be depolymerized back to recover pristine monomers, thus successfully establishing a closed&#8208;loop life cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrically Conductive &#960;&#8208;Intercalated Graphitic Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Containing Alternate &#960;&#8208;Donor/Acceptor Stacks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional graphitic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (GMOF) often display impressive electrical conductivity chiefly due to efficient through&#8208;bond in&#8208;plane charge transport, however, less efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane conduction through the stacked layers creates large disparity between two orthogonal conduction pathways and dampens their bulk conductivity. To address this issue and engineer higher bulk conductivity in 2D GMOFs, we have constructed via an elegant bottom&#8208;up method the first &#960;&#8208;intercalated GMOF (iGMOF1) featuring built&#8208;in alternate &#960;&#8208;donor/acceptor (&#960;D/A) stacks of Cu(II)&#8208;coordinated electron&#8208;rich hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP) ligands and non&#8208;coordinatively intercalated &#960;&#8208;acidic hexacyano&#8208;triphenylene (HCTP) molecules, which facilitated out&#8208;of&#8208;plane conduction while the hexagonal Cu3(HATP)2 scaffold enabled in&#8208;plane conduction. As a result, iGMOF1 attained an order of magnitude higher bulk electrical conductivity and much smaller activation energy than Cu3(HATP)2 (&#963; = 25 vs. 2 S/m, Ea = 36 vs. 65 meV), demostrating that simultaneous in&#8208;plane (through&#8208;bond) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (through &#960;D/A stacks) charge transport can generate higher electrical conductivity in novel iGMOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into Bioactivity of In&#8208;situ Trapped Enzyme&#8208;Covalent&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selecting a suitable support for enzyme immobilization with excellent catalytic activity and stability of enzyme is a significant component for the preparation of functional biosystems. The highly stable and metal&#8208;free properties of covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) make them ideal supports for enzyme immobilization. Herein, we constructed three kinds of COFs via a biofriendly and one&#8208;pot synthetic strategy at room temperature in aqueous solution. Among the three developed COFs (COF&#8208;LZU1, RT&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and ACOF&#8208;1), the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;incorporated COF&#8208;LZU1 were found to retain the highest activity. Structural analysis revealed that a weakest interaction between the enzyme and COF&#8208;LZU1 results in the formation of the hydrated enzyme, an easiest accessibility by the COF&#8208;LZU1 to the substrate, as well as an optimal conformation of enzyme together promoted the bioactivity of HRP&#8208;COF&#8208;LZU1. Furthermore, the COF&#8208;LZU1 is revealed to be a versatile nanoplatform for encapsulating multiple enzymes. The COF&#8208;LZU1 also offered superior protection for the immobilized enzymes under harsh conditions and during recycling. The comprehensive under&#8208;standing of interfacial interactions of COF host and enzyme guest, the substrate diffusion, as well as the enzyme conformation alteration within COF matrices represents an opportunity to design the ideal biocatalysts and open a broad range of applications of these nanosystems.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformationally Controlled sp3&#8208;Hydrocarbon&#8208;Based &#945;&#8208;Helix Mimetics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With over 60% of protein&#8211;protein interfaces featuring an &#945;&#8208;helix, &#945;&#8208;helix mimetics as inhibitors of these biomolecular interactions is a prevalent therapeutic strategy. However, methods to control the conformation of mimetics, thus enabling maximum efficacy, such as backbone stapling, can be restrictive. Alternatively, conformation can be controlled through the introduction of destabilizing interactions, such as the syn&#8208;pentane interaction. This tactic, which is often adopted by Nature, is not a common feature of lead optimization, presumably owing to the significant synthetic effort required. Through assembly&#8208;line synthesis with NMR and computational analysis, we have designed, prepared and characterized alternating syn&#8211;anti configured contiguously substituted hydrocarbons, which, through the avoidance of syn&#8208;pentane interactions, adopt well&#8208;defined conformations that present functional groups in an arrangement that mimics the &#945;&#8208;helix. The design of a p53 mimetic, which binds to Mdm2 with moderate to good affinity, demonstrates the therapeutic promise of these scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>The Sonogashira Coupling on Palladium Milling Balls &#8208; A new Reaction Pathway in Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing direct mechanocatalytical conditions, the Sonogashira coupling was successfully performed on the surface of milling tools by using pure Pd and Pd coated steel balls. The optimization of co&#8208;catalyst forming additives led to a protocol, which generates quantitative yields under aerobic conditions for various substrates within as little as 90 minutes. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art spectroscopic, diffractive, as well as in&#8208;situ methods lead to the identification of a previously unknown and highly reactive complex of the co&#8208;catalyst copper. This new complex differs substantially from the known complexes in liquid phase Sonogashira couplings, proving that reaction pathways in mechanochemistry may differ from those in established synthetic procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Adhesives with Extended Tolerance to Extreme Conditions via Water&#8208;Modulated Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of supramolecular adhesives with strong tolerance to extreme conditions has emerged as an important research area. In this study, by balancing supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding interactions, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, and cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, we designed and prepared a series of two&#8208;component supramolecular adhesives derived from small organic molecules. Highly efficient interfacial adhesion with maximum adhesion strength of ~10.0 MPa was realized on various surfaces in air, organic solvents, or liquid nitrogen. Owing to balanced supramolecular interactions, water participation prolonged and increased the tolerance of the adhesives in extreme environments. We demonstrate that the combination of imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids and phenols can be applied for various interfacial adhesions, thereby aiding the development of next&#8208;generation adhesives capable of adapting to various extreme conditions in a controlled manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8210;Cas12a reaction with caged crRNA enables rapid and sensitive nucleic acid detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system is a promising platform for nucleic acid detection. Regulating the CRISPR reaction would be extremely useful to improve the detection efficiency and speed of CRISPR diagnostic applications. Here, we have developed a light&#8208;start CRISPR&#8210;Cas12a reaction by employing caged CRISPR RNA (crRNA). When combined with recombinase polymerase amplification, a robust photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is achieved. The photocontrolled one&#8208;pot assay is simpler and is 50&#8208;fold more sensitive than the conventional assay. This improved detection efficiency also facilitates the development of a faster CRISPR diagnostic method. The detection of clinical samples demonstrated that 10&#8208;20 min is sufficient for effective detection, which is much faster than the current gold&#8208;standard technique PCR. We expect this advance in CRISPR diagnostics to promote its widespread detection applications in biomedicine, agriculture, and food safety.</dc:description>

         <title>Isobaric Stable Isotope N&#8208;Phosphorylation Labeling (iSIPL) for Ultrasensitive Proteome Quantification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable isotope chemical labeling methods have been widely used for high&#8208;throughput mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;based quantitative proteomics in biological and clinical applications. However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N&#8208;phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P&#8208;N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV&#8208;1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat&#8208;induced activation of HIV&#8208;1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein&#8208;protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large&#8208;scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stable isotope chemical labeling methods have been widely used for high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics in biological and clinical applications. However, the existing methods are far from meeting the requirements for high sensitivity detection. In the present study, a novel isobaric stable isotope N-phosphorylation labeling (iSIPL) strategy was developed for quantitative proteome analysis. The tryptic peptides were selectively labeled with iSIPL tag to generate the novel reporter ions containing phosphoramidate P-N bond with high intensities under lower collision energies. iSIPL strategy are suitable for peptide sequencing and quantitative analysis with high sensitivity and accuracy even for samples of limited quantity. Furthermore, iSIPL coupled with affinity purification and mass spectrometry was applied to measure the dynamics of cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) interactomes during transactivation of the HIV-1 provirus. The interaction of CDK9 with PARP13 was found to significantly decrease during Tat-induced activation of HIV-1 gene transcription, suggesting the effectiveness of iSIPL strategy in dynamic analysis of protein-protein interaction in vivo. More than that, the proposed iSIPL strategy would facilitate large-scale accurate quantitative proteomics by increasing multiplexing capability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photosystem II Inspired NiFe&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Efficient Water Oxidation via Second Coordination Sphere Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electrocatalytic model that is designed to obtain superior oxygen evolution reaction activity (270&#8197;mV at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and cycle stability (over 300&#8197;h) by tuning the proton transfer pathway. The electron&#8208;rich terephthalic acid anion located in the second coordination sphere of the active center can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which reduces the kinetic barrier for O&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The mismatched fast&#8208;electron&#8208;slow&#8208;proton process in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) severely restricts the catalytic efficiency. To overcome these issues, accelerating the proton transfer and elucidating the kinetic mechanism are highly sought after. Herein, inspired by photosystem II, we develop a family of OER electrocatalysts with FeO6/NiO6 units and carboxylate anions (TA2&#8722;) in the first and second coordination sphere, respectively. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the metal units and TA2&#8722;, the optimized catalyst delivers superior activity with a low overpotential of 270&#8197;mV at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability over 300&#8197;h. A proton&#8208;transfer&#8208;promotion mechanism is proposed by in situ Raman, catalytic tests, and theoretical calculations. The TA2&#8722; (proton acceptor) can mediate proton transfer pathways by preferentially accepting protons, which optimizes the O&#8722;H adsorption/activation process and reduces the kinetic barrier for O&#8722;O bond formation.

         <title>Engineering an Oxygen&#8208;Binding Protein for Photocatalytic CO2 Reductions in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a homogeneous photocatalytic system based on cobalt porphyrin substituted myoglobin (CoMb) for CO2 to CO conversion in water. By optimizing the reaction conditions, our catalysts achieved up to 2000 TON(CO) at low enzyme concentrations, and a product selectivity of 
80&#8201;% with an increased enzyme loading. We show that the efficiencies of CO generation and overall TON(CO) can be improved by introducing positively charged residues near the active stie of CoMb.







Abstract
While native CO2&#8208;reducing enzymes display remarkable catalytic efficiency and product selectivity, few artificial biocatalysts have been engineered to allow understanding how the native enzymes work. To address this issue, we report cobalt porphyrin substituted myoglobin (CoMb) as a homogeneous catalyst for photo&#8208;driven CO2 to CO conversion in water. The activity and product selectivity were optimized by varying pH and concentrations of the enzyme and the photosensitizer. Up to 2000 TON(CO) was attained at low enzyme concentrations with low product selectivity (15&#8201;%), while a product selectivity of 74&#8201;% was reached by increasing the enzyme loading but with a compromised TON(CO). The efficiency of CO generation and overall TON(CO) were further improved by introducing positively charged residues (Lys or Arg) near the active stie of CoMb, which demonstrates the value of tuning the enzyme secondary coordination sphere to enhance the CO2&#8208;reducing performance of a protein&#8208;based photocatalytic system.

         <title>Unveiling the Critical Role of Ion Coordination Configuration of Ether Electrolytes for High Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Albeit ethers&#160;are favorable electrolyte solvents for lithium (Li) metal anode, their inferior oxidation stability (&lt;4.0 V vs. Li/Li+) is problematic for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Studies of ether electrolytes have been focusing on the archetype glyme structure with ethylene oxide moieties. Herein, we unveil the crucial effect of ion coordination configuration on oxidation stability by varying the ether backbone structure. The designed 1,3&#8208;dimethoxypropane (DMP, C3)&#160; forms a unique six&#8208;membered chelating complex with Li+, whose stronger solvating ability suppresses oxidation side reactions. In addition, the favored hydrogen transfer reaction between C3 and anion induces a dramatic enrichment of LiF (a total atomic ratio of 76.7%) on the cathode surface. As a result, the C3&#8208;based electrolyte enables greatly improved cycling of nickel&#8208;rich cathodes under 4.7 V. This study offers fundamental insights into rational electrolyte design for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of catalyst&#8208;controlled methods for direct functionalization of two distinct C&#8211;H bonds represents an appealing approach for C&#8211;C formations in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we describe an organocatalytic approach for straightforward acylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds employing readily available aldehyde as &#8220;acyl source&#8221; involving dehydrogenative coupling of aldehydes with ether, amine, or benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. The developed method affords a broad range of ketones under mild conditions. Mechanistically, simple ortho&#8208;cyanoiodobenzene is essential in the oxidative radical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalysis to give a ketyl radical and C(sp3) radical through a rarely explored intermolecular hydrogen atom transfer pathway, rendering the acylative C&#8211;C formations in high efficiency under a metal&#8208; and light&#8208;free catalytic conditions. Moreover, the prepared products show promising anti&#8208;bacterial activities that shall encourage further investigations on novel agrochemical development.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Multicomponent Peptide Fibrils with Ordered and Programmable Compositional Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Advanced applications of biomacromolecular assemblies require a stringent degree of control over molecular arrangement, which is a challenge to current synthetic methods. Here we used a neighbor&#8208;controlled patterning strategy to build multicomponent peptide fibrils with an unprecedented capacity to manipulate local composition and peptide positions. Eight peptides were designed to have regulable nearest neighbors upon co&#8208;assembly, which, by simulation, afforded 412 different patterns within fibrils, with varied compositions and/or peptide positions. The fibrils with six prescribed patterns were experimentally constructed with high accuracy. The controlled patterning also applies to functionalities appended to the peptides, as exemplified by arranging carbohydrate ligands at nanoscale precision for protein recognition. This study offers a route to molecular editing of inner structures of peptide&#160;assemblies, prefiguring the uniqueness and richness of patterning&#8208;based material design.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional graphene oxide (GO) membranes are gaining popularity as a promising means to address global water scarcity. However, current GO membranes fail to sufficiently exclude angstrom&#8208;sized ions from solution. Herein, a de novo &#8220;posterior&#8221; interfacial polymerization (p&#8208;IP) strategy is reported to construct a tailor&#8208;made polyamide (PA) network in situ in an ultrathin GO membrane to strengthen size exclusion while imparting a positively charged membrane surface to repel metal ions. The electrostatic repulsion toward metal ions, coupled with the reinforced size exclusion, synergistically drives the high&#8208;efficiency metal ion separation through the synthesized positively charged GO framework (PC&#8208;GOF) membrane. This dual&#8208;mechanism&#8208;driven PC&#8208;GOF membrane exhibits superior metal ion rejection, anti&#8208;fouling ability, good operational stability, and ultra&#8208;high permeance (five times that of pristine GO membranes), enabling a sound step towards a sustainable water&#8211;energy&#8211;food nexus.</dc:description>

         <title>Apolipoprotein E Recognizes Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease Associated 3&#8208;O Sulfation of Heparan Sulfate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)&#8217;s &#949;4 alle is the most important genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cell&#8208;surface heparan sulfate (HS) is a cofactor for ApoE/LRP1 interaction and the prion&#8208;like spread of tau pathology between cells. 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;sulfo (3&#8208;  O  &#8208;S) modification of HS has been linked to AD through its interaction with tau, and enhanced levels of 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;sulfated HS and 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;sulfotransferases in AD brains. In this study, we characterized ApoE/HS interactions in wildtype ApoE3, AD&#8208;linked ApoE4, and AD&#8208;protective ApoE2 and ApoE3&#8208;Christchurch. Glycan microarray and SPR assays revealed that all ApoE isoforms recognized 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;S. NMR titration localized ApoE/3&#8208;  O  &#8208;S binding to the vicinity of canonical HS binding motif. In cells, the knockout of HS3ST1&#8212;a major 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;sulfotransferase&#8212;reduced cell surface binding and uptake of ApoE. 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;S is thus recognized by both tau and ApoE, suggesting that the interplay between 3&#8208;  O  &#8208;sulfated HS, tau and ApoE isoforms may modulate AD risk.</dc:description>

         <title>Photodissociative Modules that Control Dual&#8208;Emission Properties in Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;Acceptor Organoborane Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor fluorophores that consist of an electron&#8208;donating amino group and an electron&#8208;accepting triarylborane moiety generally exhibit substantial solvatochromism in their fluorescence while retaining high fluorescence quantum yields even in polar media. Herein, we report a new family of this compound class, which bears ortho&#8208;P(=X)R2&#8208;substituted phenyl groups (X = O or S) as a photodissociative module. The P=X moiety that intramolecularly coordinates to the boron atom undergoes dissociation in the excited state, giving rise to dual emission from the corresponding tetra&#8208; and tricoordinate boron species. The susceptibility of the systems to photodissociation depends on the coordination ability of the P=O and P=S moieties, whereby the latter facilitates dissociation. The intensity ratios of the dual emission bands are sensitive to environmental parameters, including temperature, solution polarity, and the viscosity of the medium. Moreover, precise tuning of the P(=X)R2 group and the electron&#8208;donating amino moiety led to single&#8208;molecule white emission in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of the lanthipeptide curvocidin and structural insights into its trifunctional synthetase CuvL</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthipeptides are ribosomally&#8208;synthesized natural products from bacteria featuring stable thioether&#8208;crosslinks and various bioactivities. Herein, we report on a new clade of tricyclic class&#8208;IV lanthipeptides with curvocidin from Thermomonospora curvata as its first representative. We obtained crystal structures of the corresponding lanthipeptide synthetase CuvL that showed a circular arrangement of its kinase, lyase and cyclase domains, forming a central reaction chamber for the iterative substrate processing involving nine catalytic events. The combination of experimental data and artificial intelligence&#8208;based structural models identified the N&#8208;terminal subdomain of the kinase domain as the primary site of substrate recruitment. The ribosomal precursor peptide of curvocidin employs an amphipathic a&#8208;helix in its leader region as an anchor to CuvL, while its substrate core shuttles within the central reaction chamber. Our study thus reveals general principles of domain organization and substrate recruitment of class&#8208;IV and class&#8208;III lanthipeptide synthetases.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Anchored Molybdenum Oxide Nanoclusters as Efficient Catalysts for the Electrosynthesis of Ammonia and Urea</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoOx nanoclusters supported on carbon black are used as highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts for selective synthesis of NH3 and urea via nitrate reduction and its coupling with CO2. This work opens up new opportunities for the rational design of novel electrocatalysts for the electrocatalytic activation of small molecules for the production of value&#8208;added chemicals.







Abstract
The electrochemical NO3&#8722; reduction and its coupling with CO2 can provide novel and clean routes to synthesize NH3 and urea, respectively. However, their practical application is still impeded by the lack of efficient catalysts with desirable Faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield rate. Herein, we report the synthesis of molybdenum oxide nanoclusters anchored on carbon black (MoOx/C) as electrocatalyst. It affords an outstanding FE of 98.14&#8201;% and NH3 yield rate of 91.63&#8197;mg&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 in NO3&#8722; reduction. Besides, the highest FE of 27.7&#8201;% with a maximum urea yield rate of 1431.5&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mgcat.&#8722;1 toward urea is also achieved. The formation of electron&#8208;rich MoOx nanoclusters with highly unsaturated metal sites in the MoOx/C heterostructure is beneficial for enhanced catalytic performance. Studies on the mechanism reveal that the stabilization of *NO and *CO2NOOH intermediates are critical for the NH3 and urea synthesis, respectively.

         <title>A Complete Triad of Zero&#8208;Valent 17&#8208;Electron Monoradicals of Group 7 Elements Stabilized by m&#8208;Terphenyl Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of structurally analogous monomeric manganese(0), technetium(0) and rhenium(0) monoradicals has been stabilized by means of sterically encumbered m&#8208;terphenyl isocyanides. They possess square&#8208;pyramidal structures. Their electron spin of S=
 allows the detection of resolved EPR spectra. High field EPR (Q band and W band) is shown to be a valuable tool for a complete analysis of the tensor components of the manganese compound.







Abstract
The first consistent series of mononuclear 17&#8208;electron complexes of three Group 7 elements has been isolated in crystalline form and studied by X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The paramagnetic compounds have a composition of [M0(CO)(CNp&#8208;F&#8208;ArDArF2)4] (M=Mn, Tc, Re; ArDArF2=2,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)2C6H2F) and are stabilized by four sterically encumbering isocyanides, which prevent the metalloradicals from dimerization. They have a square pyramidal structure with the carbonyl ligands as apexes. The frozen&#8208;solution EPR spectra of the rhenium and technetium compounds are clearly anisotropic with large 99Tc and 185,187Re hyperfine interactions for one component. High&#8208;field EPR (Q band and W band) has been applied for the elucidation of the EPR parameters of the manganese(0) complex.

&lt;p&gt;The first consistent series of mononuclear 17-electron complexes of three Group 7 elements has been isolated in crystalline form and studied by X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods. The paramagnetic compounds have a composition of [M&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(CO)(CN&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-F-Ar&lt;sup&gt;DArF2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] (M=Mn, Tc, Re; Ar&lt;sup&gt;DArF2&lt;/sup&gt;=2,6-(3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F) and are stabilized by four sterically encumbering isocyanides, which prevent the metalloradicals from dimerization. They have a square pyramidal structure with the carbonyl ligands as apexes. The frozen-solution EPR spectra of the rhenium and technetium compounds are clearly anisotropic with large &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc and &lt;sup&gt;185,187&lt;/sup&gt;Re hyperfine interactions for one component. High-field EPR (Q band and W band) has been applied for the elucidation of the EPR parameters of the manganese(0) complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Regulation of Emission Maxima and Construction of Highly Efficient Electroluminescent Materials with High Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering strategy is proposed and a series of congeners of BN&#8208;TP (a triphenylene core substituted with two di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcarbazole motifs and coordinated with one boron atom), namely BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4), are constructed. Anchoring the nitrogen&#8208;atom at different positions of triphenylene hexagonal lattice results in varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters demonstrate the precise regulation of emission maxima to meet industrial demand, and further enrich the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir.







Abstract
Advanced multiple resonance induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters have emerged as a privileged motif for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), because they furnish highly tunable TADF characteristics and high color purity emission. Herein, based on the unique nitrogen&#8208;atom embedding molecular engineering (NEME) strategy, a series of compounds BN&#8208;TP&#8208;Nx (x=1, 2, 3, 4) have been customized. The nitrogen&#8208;atom anchored at different position of triphenylene hexagonal lattice entails varying degrees of perturbation to the electronic structure. The newly&#8208;constructed emitters have demonstrated the precise regulation of emission maxima of MR&#8208;TADF emitters to meet the actual industrial demand, and further enormously enriched the MR&#8208;TADF molecular reservoir. The BN&#8208;TP&#8208;N3&#8208;based OLED exhibits ultrapure green emission, with peak of 524&#8197;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 33&#8197;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.23, 0.71), and maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3&#8201;%.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;&#960; Catalysis Made Asymmetric&#8212;Enantiomerization Catalysis Mediated by the Chiral &#960;&#8208;System of a Perylene Bisimide Cyclophane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of [5]helicene enantiomerization has been enhanced by a factor of about 700 by using a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane host at room temperature. Computational models suggest the reaction barrier is lowered through a stabilization of the nonplanar transition&#8208;state structure of [5]helicene within the cyclophane through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis, supported by a ground&#8208;state destabilization of the heterochiral host&#8211;guest complex.







Abstract
Enzymes actuate catalysis through a combination of transition state stabilization and ground state destabilization, inducing enantioselectivity through chiral binding sites. Here, we present a supramolecular model system which employs these basic principles to catalyze the enantiomerization of [5]helicene. Catalysis is hereby mediated not through a network of functional groups but through &#960;&#8208;&#960; catalysis exerted from the curved aromatic framework of a chiral perylene bisimide (PBI) cyclophane offering a binding pocket that is intricately complementary with the enantiomerization transition structure. Although transition state stabilization originates simply from dispersion and electrostatic interactions, enantiomerization kinetics are accelerated by a factor of ca. 700 at 295&#8197;K. Comparison with the meso&#8208;congener of the catalytically active cyclophane shows that upon configurational inversion in only one PBI moiety the catalytic effect is lost, highlighting the importance of precise transition structure recognition in supramolecular enzyme mimics.

         <title>Tuning the Microenvironment in Monolayer MgAl Layered Double Hydroxide for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Electrocatalysis in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monolayered MgAl layered double hydroxide (MgAl&#8208;LDH) is used for the regulation of the local environment of Cu as catalyst for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene electroreduction in neutral media. The catalyst benefits from the lower energy barrier of MgAl&#8208;LDH for water dissociation and an OH&#8722; enriched environment at the reaction interface, delivering a high C2H4 selectivity at a current density of 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide provides a feasibility to achieve a carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle. However, there are a number of bottleneck issues to be resolved before industrial application, such as the low conversion efficiency, selectivity and reaction rate, etc. Engineering local environment is a critical way to address these challenges. Here, a monolayer MgAl&#8208;LDH was proposed to optimize the local environment of Cu for stimulating industrial&#8208;current&#8208;density CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 electroreduction in neutral media. In situ spectroscopic results and theoretical study demonstrated that the Cu electrode modified by MgAl&#8208;LDH (MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu) displayed a much higher surface pH value compared to the bare Cu, which could be attributed to the decreased energy barrier for hydrolysis on MgAl&#8208;LDH sites with more OH&#8722; ions on the surface of the electrode. As a result, MgAl&#8208;LDH/Cu achieved a C2H4 Faradaic efficiency of 55.1&#8201;% at a current density up to 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KHCO3 electrolyte.

         <title>Peripherally Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Decorated Strategy Towards High&#8208;Performance Pure Green Electroluminescence with External Quantum Efficiency over 40&#8201;%</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve both large rate of reverse intersystem crossing and narrow full&#8208;width at half maximum of multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters by heavy&#8208;atom effect is proposed by peripherally decorating the MR&#8208;skeleton with selenoxanthone. External quantum efficiency (EQE) above 40&#8201;%, Commission Internationale de l'Echairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.19, 0.70) and reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diode.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom integration into thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule could significantly promote the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. However, simultaneously achieving high efficiency, small roll&#8208;off, narrowband emission and good operational lifetime remains a big challenge for the corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we report a pure green multi&#8208;resonance TADF molecule BN&#8208;STO by introducing a peripheral heavy atom selenium onto the parent BN&#8208;Cz molecule. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode device based on BN&#8208;STO exhibited state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.1&#8201;%, power efficiency (PE) of 176.9&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, well&#8208;suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and pure green gamut. This work reveals a feasible strategy to reach a balance between fast RISC process and narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of MR&#8208;TADF by heavy atom effect.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Stable Diazoalkenes by Diazo Transfer from Azides: Pyridine&#8208;Derived Diazoalkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable diazoalkenes based on a pyridine backbone are accessible via dinitrogen transfer from azides. This fundamentally new substance class features the lowest C&#8722;C bond polarization of the few known stable diazoalkenes, therefore representing best the presentation R2C=C=N2. Photochemically triggered loss of N2 represents a new strategy to access C4 cumulenes.







Abstract
Recently, stable diazoalkenes have received significant attention as a new substance class in organic chemistry. While their previous synthetic access was exclusively limited to the activation of nitrous oxide, we here establish a much more general synthetic approach utilizing a Regitz&#8208;type diazo transfer with azides. Importantly, this approach is also applicable to weakly polarized olefins such as 2&#8208;pyridine olefins. The new pyridine diazoalkenes are not accessible by the activation of nitrous oxide, allowing for a considerable extension of the scope of this only recently accessed functional group. The new diazoalkene class has properties distinct from the previously reported classes, such as photochemically triggered loss of dinitrogen affording cumulenes and not C&#8722;H insertion products. Pyridine&#8208;derived diazoalkenes represent the so far least polarized stable diazoalkene class reported.

         <title>Dynamic Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network as a Modulator of Bismuth&#8211;Antimony Complex Anodes for Self&#8208;Healable and Wider Temperature Adaptive Potassium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanoparticles deposited on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PET) are confined when the polymer is crosslinked with polythioctic acid (PTA) (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA). This material exhibits wider temperature adaptability for potassium storage, benefiting from a greater number of hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights into the intrinsic formation and potassium&#8208;storage mechanisms are also put forward.







Abstract
Antimony (Sb)&#8208;based anodes are attractive candidates in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their superior capacities and rational potassium inserting voltages. However, the sluggish kinetics and poor interface compatibility severely hinder practical application. Herein, Bi0.67Sb1.33S3 nanospheres embedded into in situ formed poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) crosslinked with polythioctic acid (PET@PTA) (Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA) were elaborately conceptualized with hydrogen bonds exchangeable binding (HBEB) sites. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA exhibits notable self&#8208;healing ability and wider temperature adaptability. Bi0.67Sb1.33S3/PET@PTA displays an impressive capacity of 819&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.05&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, prominent cycle ability with a 73&#8201;% capacity conservation after 500 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and high capacity retention of 66&#8201;% and 84&#8201;% at &#8722;40 and 70&#8201;&#176;C to that case at room temperature, respectively, for potassium storage. This work provides a new perspective for HBEB sites in maximizing the desirable K+ storage performance.

         <title>Electrochemical Nano&#8208;Roughening of Gold Microstructured Electrodes for Enhanced Sensing in Biofluids
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically structured high electroactive surface area gold electrodes were fabricated using a simple and inexpensive thermal wrinkling approach and a chronoamperometric pulsing nanoroughening method. The nanoroughened electrodes showed antifouling capabilities and could be used for the sensitive electrochemical detection of copper in tap&#8208;water and for the enzyme&#8208;free detection of glucose in human blood serum samples.







Abstract
A key challenge for sensor miniaturization is to create electrodes with smaller footprints, while maintaining or increasing sensitivity. In this work, the electroactive surface of gold electrodes was enhanced 30&#8208;fold by wrinkling followed by chronoamperometric (CA) pulsing. Electron microscopy showed increased surface roughness in response to an increased number of CA pulses. The nanoroughened electrodes also showed excellent fouling resistance when submerged in solutions containing bovine serum albumin. The nanoroughened electrodes were used for electrochemical detection of Cu2+ in tap water and of glucose in human blood plasma. In the latter case, the nanoroughened electrodes allowed highly sensitive enzyme&#8208;free sensing of glucose, with responses comparable to those of two commercial enzyme&#8208;based sensors. We anticipate that this methodology to fabricate nanostructured electrodes can accelerate the development of simple, cost&#8208;effective, and high sensitivity electrochemical platforms.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Dependent Sum&#8208;Frequency&#8208;Generation Spectroscopy for In Situ Tracking of Nanoparticle Morphology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy of adsorbed CO was employed to characterize the morphology of oxide&#8208;supported Pt and Pd nanoparticles. Via the Issp/Ippp ratio, the orientation of CO relative to the macroscopic surface normal reveals the abundance of inclined/curved facets.







Abstract
The surface structure of oxide&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles can be determined via characteristic vibrations of adsorbed probe molecules such as CO. Usually, spectroscopic studies focus on peak position and intensity, which are related to binding geometries and number of adsorption sites, respectively. Employing two differently prepared model catalysts, it is demonstrated that polarization&#8208;dependent sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveals the average surface structure and shape of the nanoparticles. SFG results for different particle sizes and morphologies are compared to direct real&#8208;space structure analysis by TEM and STM. The described feature of SFG could be used to monitor particle restructuring in situ and may be a valuable tool for operando catalysis.

         <title>Heterogeneous Photocatalytic Recycling of FeX2/FeX3 for Efficient Halogenation of C&#8208;H Bonds Using NaX</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Environmental&#8208;friendly halogenation of C&#8208;H bonds using abundant, non&#8208;toxic halogen salts is in high demand in various chemical industries, yet the efficiency and selectivity of laboratory available protocols are far behind the conventional photolytic halogenation process which uses hazardous halogen sources. Here we report an FeX2 (X = Br, Cl) coupled semiconductor system for efficient, selective, and continuous photocatalytic halogenation using NaX as halogen source under mild conditions. Herein, FeX2 catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen and the consumption of generated oxygen radicals, thus boosting the generation of halogen radicals and elemental halogen for direct halogenation and indirect halogenation via the formation of FeX3. Recycling of FeX2 and FeX3 during the photocatalytic process enables the halogenation of a wide range of hydrocarbons in a continuous flow, rendering it a promising method for applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolidified Chalcogen Precursors for High&#8208;Quality 2D Semiconductor Growth</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre&#8208;melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6 &#177; 1.9 meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9 &#177; 3) &#215; 1012 cm&#8208;2 and (10 &#177; 4) &#215; 1012 cm&#8208;2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have gained attention in optoelectronics for their extraordinary properties. However, the large amount and locally distributed lattice defects affect the optical properties of 2D TMDCs, and the defects originate from unstable factors in the synthesis process. In this work, we develop a method of pre-melting and resolidification of chalcogen precursors (sulfur and selenium), namely resolidified chalcogen, as precursor for the chemical vapor deposition growth of TMDCs with ultrahigh quality and uniformity. Taking WS2 as an example, the monolayer WS2 shows uniform fluorescence intensity and a small full-width at half-maximum of photoluminescence peak at low temperatures with an average value of 13.6 &#177; 1.9 meV. The defect densities at the interior and edge region are both low and comparable, i.e., (9 &#177; 3) &#215; 1012 cm-2 and (10 &#177; 4) &#215; 1012 cm-2, indicating its high structural quality and uniformity. This method is universal in growing high quality monolayer MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, and will benefit their applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;, Stereo&#8208; and Regioselective Fluoroallylation/Annulation of Hydrazones with gem&#8208;Difluorocyclopropanes via Tunable Palladium/NHC Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Defluorinative manipulation of polyfluorinated molecules has shown great promise due to its granting of synthetic versatility to inert C&#8208;F bonds. The development of chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselective strategies to realize highly efficient formation of either the linear/branched or E/Z products from gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropanes (gem&#8208;F2CPs) is a challenging task. Herein, we have realized palladium/NHC&#8208;catalyzed fluoroallylation/annulation of hydrazones with gem&#8208;F2CPs that incorporate the hydrazone N2 moiety into the products. The thermodynamically unstable fluorinated E&#8208;allylation products with aryl ketone hydrazones were obtained for the first time, while the di&#8208;alkyl ketone hydrazones yielded the monofluorinated products with branched selectivity under similar reaction conditions. With aldehyde hydrazones, two kinds of pyrazoles were obtained via a defluorinative allylation/annulation cascade, in which different carbon atoms of gem&#8208;F2CPs could be incorporated into the pyrazole rings regiospecifically. DFT calculations revealed that the divergent selectivity was kinetically controlled and the final C&#8211;C bond formation proceeded through a 7&#8208;membered TS.</dc:description>

         <title>Inducing Covalent Atomic Interaction in Intermetallic Pt Alloy Nanocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The harsh working environments of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) pose huge challenges to the stability of Pt&#8208;based alloy catalysts. The widespread presence of metallic bonds with significantly delocalized electron distribution often lead to component segregation and rapid performance decay. Here we report L10&#8208;Pt2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticles with a unique covalent atomic interaction between Pt&#8208;Ga as high&#8208;performance PEMFC cathode catalysts. The L10&#8208;Pt2CuGa/C catalyst shows superb oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and stability in fuel cell cathode (mass activity = 0.57 A mgPt&#8208;1 at 0.9 V, peak power density = 2.60/1.24 W cm&#8208;2 in H2&#8208;O2/air, 28 mV voltage loss at 0.8 A cm&#8208;2 after 30000 cycles). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimized adsorption of oxygen intermediates via the formed biaxial strain on L10&#8208;Pt2CuGa surface, and the durability enhancement stems from the stronger Pt&#8208;M bonds than those in L11&#8208;PtCu resulted from Pt&#8208;Ga covalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>meta&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Pyridines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridine moiety is an important core structure for a variety of drugs, agrochemicals, catalysts, and functional materials. Direct functionalization of C&#8211;H bonds in pyridines is a straightforward approach to access valuable substituted pyridines. Compared to the direct ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;functionalization, meta&#8208;selective pyridine C&#8211;H functionalization is far more challenging due to the inherent electronic properties of the pyridine entity. This review summarizes currently available methods for pyridine meta&#8208;C&#8211;H functionalization using a directing group, non&#8208;directed metalation, and temporary dearomatization strategies. Recent advances in ligand control and temporary dearomatization are highlighted. We analyze the advantages as well as limitations of current techniques and hope to inspire further developments in this important area.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Fueled Autonomous Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol&#8594;Gel&#8594;Sol Transitions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Complex non&#8208;equilibrium phase behaviors are a hallmark of natural self&#8208;assembling systems. Here we show how intricate phase transitions can be achieved via a chemically fueled reaction cycle yielding autonomous sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol&#8594;gel&#8594;sol transitions. A relay of chemical transformations based on thiazinane metathesis leads to two consecutive transient gelations in a closed system. Within seconds of fuel addition to deactivated thiazinane monomers, an imine&#8208;based hydrogel forms consisting of fibrillar microspheres. This gel quickly loses its mechanical strength and forms a solution, from which a second aldehyde&#8208;based gel nucleates and remains stable for over one day. Overall, our reaction cycle gives rise to two consecutive re&#8208;entrant phase transitions without any experimental intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>A Route to Stabilize Uranium(II) and Uranium(I) Synthons in Multimetallic Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the redox reactivity of a multimetallic uranium complex supported by triphenylsiloxide (&#8211;OSiPh3) ligands, where we show that low valent synthons can be stabilized via an unprecedented mechanism involving intramolecular ligand migration. The two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron reduction of the oxo&#8208;bridged diuranium(IV) complex [{(Ph3SiO)3(DME)U}2(&#956;&#8211;O)],&#160;4, yields the formal &#8220;U(II)/U(IV)&#8221; ,&#160;5, and &#8220;U(I)/U(IV)&#8221;&#160;6, complexes via ligand migration and formation of&#160;uranium&#8208;arene&#160;&#948;&#8208;bond&#160;interactions.&#160;Remarkably, complex&#160;5&#160;effects the two&#8208;electron reductive coupling of pyridine affording complex&#160;7, which demonstrates that the electron&#8208;transfer is accompanied by ligand migration, restoring the original ligand arrangement found in&#160;4.&#160;This work provides a new method for controlling the redox reactivity in molecular complexes of unstable, low&#8208;valent metal centers, and can lead to the further development of&#160;f&#8208;elements redox reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Photochemical H&#8208;Atom Transfer &amp; Cobalt Catalysis for the Desaturative Synthesis of Phenols from Cyclohexanones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenols are integral aromatic molecules widely encountered in the structure of natural products and routinely utilised for the synthesis of high&#8208;value materials. Accessing highly substituted derivatives can often be difficult especially when their functionalization pattern does not match the intrinsic reactivity leveraged by electrophilic aromatic substitution (SEAr) chemistry. Here we provide an alternative and mechanistically distinct approach for phenol synthesis using saturated cyclohexanone precursors. This process operates at ambient temperature, under simple purple light irradiation, and features a dual catalytic manifold carrying four sequential H&#8208;atom transfer processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Strong&#8208;Acid&#8208;Resistant [Th6] Cluster&#8208;Based Framework for Effectively and Size&#8208;Selectively Catalyzing Reductive Amination of Aldehydes with N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of N,N&#8208;Dimethylformamide (DMF) as amine source and reductant for synthesizing tertiary amines is a promising way to replace the substrates of formaldehyde and dimethylamine, and it is desirable to seek porous acid&#8208;resistant catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis of this reaction. Herein, a robust metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) {[Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6(BCP)3]&#183;10DMF} n  (1) containing stacked nanocages with a diameter of 1.55 nm was constructed. Compound 1 can maintain single&#8208;crystal structure even kept in air at 400 &#176;C for 3 h, in DMF or water at 200 &#176;C for 7 days, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the high interaction energy between the [Th6O4(OH)4(H2O)6]12+ clusters and ligands was responsible for the excellent stability of 1. Catalytic investigations revealed that 1 can effectively and size&#8208;selectively catalyze the reductive amination of aldehydes with DMF, and it can be reused at least five times without obvious loss in catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Co0&#8208;Co&#948;+ Interface Double&#8208;Site&#8208;Mediated C&#8211;C Coupling for the Photothermal Conversion of CO2 into Light Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar&#8208;driven CO2 hydrogenation into multi&#8208;carbon products is a highly desirable, but challenging reaction. The bottleneck of this reaction lies in the C&#8211;C coupling of C1 intermediates. Herein, we construct the C&#8211;C coupling centre for C1 intermediates via the in situ formation of Co0&#8208;Co&#948;+ interface double sites on MgAl2O4 (Co&#8208;CoOx/MAO). Our experimental and theoretical prediction results confirmed the effective adsorption and activation of CO2 by the Co0 site to produce C1 intermediates, while the introduction of the electron&#8208;deficient state of Co&#948;+ can effectively reduce the energy barrier of the key CHCH* intermediates. Consequently, Co&#8208;CoOx/MAO exhibited a high C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons production rate of 1303 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1; the total organic carbon selectivity of C2&#8211;4 hydrocarbons is 62.5% under light irradiation with a high ratio (~11) of olefin to paraffin. This study provides a new approach toward the design of photocatalysts used for CO2 conversion into C2+ products.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of the Hydrophobic Behaviour of Hydrophilic CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nature of the hydrophobicity found in rare&#8208;earth oxides is intriguing. The CeO2(100) surface, despite its strongly hydrophilic nature, exhibits hydrophobic behaviour when immersed in water. In order to understand this puzzling and counter&#8208;intuitive effect we performed a detailed analysis of the water structure and dynamics. We report here an ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulation (AIMD) study which demonstrates that the first water layer, in immediate contact with the hydroxylated CeO2 surface, is responsible for the effect behaving as a hydrophobic interface with respect to the rest of the liquid water.
The hydrophobicity is manifested in several ways:a considerable diffusion enhancement of the confined liquid water as compared with bulk water at the same thermodynamic condition, a weak adhesion energy and few H&#8208;bonds above the hydrophobic water layer, which may also sustain a water droplet. These findings introduce a new concept in water/rare&#8208;earth oxide interfaces: hydrophobicity mediated by specific water patterns on a hydrophilic surface.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Without excess Li, anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) have been proposed as the most likely solution to realizing highly&#8208;safe and cost&#8208;effective&#160;Li&#8208;metal batteries. Nevertheless, short cyclic life&#160;puzzles conventional AFLMBs&#160;due to&#160;anodic&#160;dead Li accumulation with a local current concentration induced by&#160;irreversible electrolyte depletion, insufficient active Li reservoir and slow Li+&#160;transfer at the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, SrI2&#160;is introduced&#160;into carbon paper (CP) current collector to effectively suppress dead Li&#160;through synergistic mechanisms including reversible I&#8208;/I3&#8208;&#160;redox reaction to reactivate dead Li, dielectric&#160;SEI surface&#160;with SrF2&#160;and LiF to&#160;prevent electrolyte decomposition and highly&#160;ionic conductive&#160;(3.488 mS cm&#8208;1) inner layer of SEI with abundant&#160;LiI to enable efficient Li+&#160;transfer inside.&#160;With the SrI2&#8208;modified current collector, the NCM532/CP cell delivers unprecedented cyclic performances with a capacity of 129.2 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;after 200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Dicarboxylation of Unactivated Skipped Dienes with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carboxylation of easily available alkenes with CO2 is highly important to afford value&#8208;added carboxylic acids. Although dicarboxylation of activated alkenes, especially 1,3&#8208;dienes, has been widely investigated, the challenging dicarboxylation of unactivated 1,n&#8208;dienes (n&gt;3) with CO2 remains unexplored. Herein, we report the first dicarboxylation of unactivated skipped dienes with CO2 via electrochemistry, affording valuable dicarboxylic acids. Control experiments and DFT calculations support the single electron transfer (SET) reduction of CO2 to its radical anion, which is followed by sluggish radical addition to unactivated alkenes, SET reduction of unstabilized alkyl radicals to carbanions and nucleophilic attack on CO2 to give desired products. This reaction features mild reaction conditions, broad substrate scope, facile derivations of products and promising application in polymer chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Current Capable and Non&#8208;Flammable Protic Organic Electrolyte for Rechargeable Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable Zinc batteries (RZBs) are considered a potent competitor for next&#8208;generation electrochemical devices, due to their multiple advantages. Nevertheless, traditional aqueous electrolytes may cause serious hazards to long&#8208;term battery cycling through fast capacity fading and poor Coulombic efficiency (CE), which happens due to complex reaction kinetics in aqueous systems. Herein, we proposed the novel adoption of the protic amide solvent, N&#8208;methyl formamide (NMF) as a Zinc battery electrolyte, which possesses a high dielectric constant and high flash point to promote fast kinetics and battery safety simultaneously. Dendrite&#8208;free and granular Zn deposition in Zn&#8208;NMF electrolyte assures ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 2000 h at 2.0 mA cm&#8208;2/2.0 mAh cm&#8208;2, high CE of 99.57 %, wide electrochemical window (~3.43 V vs. Zn2+/Zn), and outstanding durability up to 10.0 mAh cm&#8208;2. This work sheds light on the efficient performance of the protic non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte, which will open new opportunities to promote safe and energy&#8208;dense RZBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimizing Membranes for Osmotic Power Generation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of ion&#8208;selective membranes is the key towards efficient reverse electrodialysis&#8208;based osmotic power conversion. The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect.

The tradeoff between ion selectivity (output voltage) and ion permeability (output current) in existing porous membranes, however, limits the upgradation of power generation efficiency for practical applications. Thus, we provide the simple guidelines based on fundamentals of ion transport in nanofluidics for promoting osmotic power conversion. In addition, we discuss strategies for optimizing membrane performance through analysis of various material parameters in membrane design, such as pore size, surface charge, pore density, membrane thickness, ion pathway, pore order, and ionic diode effect. Lastly, a perspective on the future directions of membrane design to further maximize the efficiency of osmotic power conversion is outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Enabled Sonodynamic Activity of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Nanodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two inactive monomers incapable of generating singlet oxygen under ultrasound (US) irradiation were utilized for the reticular synthesis of a backbone&#8208;active covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with intrinsic sonodynamic activity. With Cu ions coordination, the fabricated TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu is demonstrated to exhibit a bilaterally enhanced nanodynamic feature of Cu ion&#8208;augmented sonodynamic activity and US&#8208;amplified chemodynamic catalytic efficacy.







Abstract
The development of covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizers with intrinsic sonodynamic effects is highly desirable. However, such COFs are generally constructed using small&#8208;molecule photosensitizers. Herein, we report that the reticular chemistry&#8208;based synthesis of COFs from two inert monomers yields a COF&#8208;based sonosensitizer (TPE&#8208;NN) with inherent sonodynamic activity. Subsequently, a nanoscale COF TPE&#8208;NN is fabricated and embedded with copper (Cu)&#8208;coordinated sites to obtain TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Results show that Cu coordination can enhance the sonodynamic effect of TPE&#8208;NN, whereas ultrasound (US) irradiation for sonodynamic therapy can augment the chemodynamic efficacy of TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu. Consequently, TPE&#8208;NN&#8208;Cu upon US irradiation shows high&#8208;performance anticancer effects based on mutually reinforced sono&#8208;/chemo&#8208;nanodynamic therapy. This study reveals the backbone&#8208;originated sonodynamic activity of COFs and proposes a paradigm of intrinsic COF sonosensitizers for nanodynamic therapy.

         <title>Low Bandgap 2D Perovskite Single Crystal with Anomalous&#8208;large Charges/ions Collection Ratio for Ultra&#8208;sensitive and Stable X&#8208;ray Detectors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low&#8208;dimensional halide perovskites have attracted increasing attention due to their improved moisture stability, reduced defects, and suppressed ions migration in many optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, X&#8208;ray detectors, and so on. However, they are still limited by their large bandgap and short charge carriers&#8217; diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate that the introduction of metal ions into organic interlayers of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite by cross&#8208;linking the copper paddle&#8208;wheel cluster&#8208;based lead bromide ([Cu(O2C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;NH3)2]PbBr4) perovskite single crystals with coordination bonds can not only significantly reduce the perovskite bandgap to 0.96 eV to boost the X&#8208;ray induced charge carriers, but can also selectively improve the charge carriers&#8217; transport along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction by shortening its interlayer spacing of 8.1% and blocking the ions motion paths. The [Cu(O2C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;NH3)2]PbBr4&#160;single&#8208;crystal device can reach a record charges/ions collection ratio of 1.76 &#215; 1018&#160;&#956;Gyair&#8208;1&#160;s, and exhibit a large sensitivity of 1.18 &#215; 105&#160;&#956;C Gy&#8208;1air&#160;cm&#8208;2&#160;with the lowest detectable dose rate of 56 nGyair&#160;s&#8208;1&#160;under 120 keV X&#8208;rays irradiation. In addition, [Cu(O2C&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;NH3)2]PbBr4&#160;single&#8208;crystal detector exposed to the air without any encapsulation shows excellent X&#8208;ray imaging capability with long&#8208;term operational stability without any attenuation of 120 days.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Transmission Channels Promoting Charge Separation of Conjugated Polymers for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with Controllable Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers (CPs) represents a promising platform for photocatalytic CO2 fixation owing to their suitable band structures that meet the requirements of the reduction potential of CO2 to value&#8208;added fuels. However, the photocatalytic performance of CPs is rather restrained by the low charge transfer efficiency. Herein, we rationally designed three CPs with a more delocalized electronic transmission channel and planar molecular structure, which are regarded to evidently reduce the exciton binding energy (Eb) and accelerate the internal charge transfer process. Besides, the assembly of suitable electron&#8208;output &#8220;tentacles&#8221; and cocatalysts on the surface of CPs could effectively facilitate interfacial electron delivery. Accordingly, the optimal P&#8208;2CN exhibits an apparent quantum yield of 4.6% at 420 nm for photocatalytic CO2 to CO. Further adjusting the amounts of cyano groups and cocatalysts, the CO selectivity could be obtained in the range of 0&#8208;80.5%.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong, Supertough and Self&#8208;Healing Biomimetic Layered Nanocomposites Enabled by Reversible&#160;Interfacial Polymer Chain Sliding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the remarkable progress in ultrastrong mechanical laminate materials, the simultaneous achievement of toughness, stretchability and self&#8208;healing properties in biomimetic layered nanocomposites remains a great challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of their hard essences and lack of effective stress transfer at the organic&#8208;inorganic fragile boundary. Here, an ultratough nanocomposite laminate is prepared by constructing chain&#8208;sliding cross&#8208;linking at the interface between sulfonated graphene nanosheets and polyurethane layers based on the ring molecules sliding on the linear polymer chains to release stresses. Unlike traditional supramolecular bonding toughening with limited sliding spacing, our strategy enables interfacial molecular chains reversible slippage when the inorganic nanosheets bear stretching force, providing sufficient interlayer spatial distance for relative sliding to dissipate more energy. The resulting laminates exhibit strong strength (22.33 MPa), supertoughness (219.08 MJ m&#8211;3), ultrahigh stretchability (&gt;1900%) and self&#8208;healing ability (99.7%), which far surpass most of reported synthetic and natural laminate materials. Moreover, the fabricated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electronic skin shows excellent flexibility, sensitivity and healability for human physiological signals monitoring. This strategy breaks through the challenge that traditional layered nanocomposites are intrinsically stiff and opens up the functional application of layered nanocomposites in flexible devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular nanocarbons are promising chiroptical materials; their synthesis, however, remains a big challenge. Herein, we report the facile synthesis and chiral resolution of a double&#8208;stranded figure&#8208;eight carbon nanobelt 1 in which two [5]helicene units are fused together. Two synthetic routes were developed, and particularly, a strategy involving Suzuki coupling&#8208;mediated macrocyclization followed by Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of vinyl ether turned out to be the most efficient. The structure of 1 was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. The isolated (P,P)&#8210; and (M,M)&#8210; enantiomers show persistent chiroptical properties with relatively large dissymmetric factors (|gabs| = 5.4&#180;10&#8208;3 and |glum| = 1.0&#180;10&#8208;2), which can be explained by the effective electron delocalization along the fully conjugated belt and the unique D2 symmetry. 1 exhibits local aromatic character with a dominant structure containing eight Clar&#8217;s aromatic sextet rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Stochastic Bullvalene Architecture Modulates Structural Rigidity in &#960;&#8208;Rich Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bullvalene, a shape&#8208;shifting molecular cage, is incorporated into a pi&#8208;rich polymer backbone to modulate chain architecture. Stochastic bullvalene isomers within the backbone lead to a kinked chain architecture and decreased thermal transitions that are tunable based on percent bullvalene incorporation.







Abstract
The synthesis and processing of &#960;&#8208;rich polymers found in novel electronics and textiles is difficult because chain stiffness leads to low solubility and high thermal transitions. The incorporation of &#8220;shape&#8208;shifting&#8221; molecular cages into &#960;&#8208;rich backbone provides an ensemble of structural kinks to modulate chain architecture via a self&#8208;contained library of valence isomers. In this work, we report the synthesis and characterization of (bullvalene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene)s that feature smaller persistence lengths than a prototypical rigid rod polymer, poly(p&#8208;phenylene). By varying the amount of bullvalene incorporation within a poly(p&#8208;phenylene) chain (0&#8211;50&#8201;%), we can tune thermal properties and solution&#8208;state conformation. These features are caused by stochastic bullvalene isomers within the polymer backbone that result in kinked architectures. Synthetically, bullvalene incorporation offers a facile method to decrease structural rigidity within &#960;&#8208;rich materials without concomitant crystallization. VT&#8197;NMR experiments confirm that these materials remain dynamic in solution, offering the opportunity for future stimuli&#8208;responsive applications.

         <title>Rational Utilization of Black Phosphorus Nanosheets to Enhance Palladium&#8208;Mediated Bioorthogonal Catalytic Activity for Activation of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is applied to enhance palladium&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity by using a powerful partner: black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, which can accelerate the transformation of Pd2+ to Pd0 to boost the reaction cycle, thus achieving a superior decaging efficiency of prodyes and prodrugs.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;catalyzed chemistry has played a significant role in the growing subfield of bioorthogonal catalysis. However, rationally designing Pd nanocatalysts that show outstanding catalytic activity and good biocompatibility poses a great challenge. Herein, we propose an innovative strategy through exploiting black phosphorous nanosheets (BPNSs) to enhance Pd&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalytic activity. Firstly, the electron&#8208;donor properties of BPNSs enable in situ growth of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on it. Meanwhile, due to the superb capability of reducing PdII, BPNSs can act as hard nucleophiles to accelerate the transmetallation in the decaging reaction process. Secondly, the lone pair electrons of BPNSs can firmly anchor PdNPs on their surface via Pd&#8722;P bonds. This design endows Pd/BP with the capability to retard tumor growth by activating prodrugs. This work proposes new insights into the design of heterogeneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts (TMCs) for bioorthogonal catalysis.

         <title>Unsupervised Learning&#8208;Guided Accelerated Discovery of Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) model to automatically search the chemical space containing over 420&#8201;000 candidates to identify promising AEMs with highly chemical stability.







Abstract
Without insight into the correlation between the structure and properties, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for fuel cells are developed usually using the empirical trial and error method or simulation methods. Here, a virtual module compound enumeration screening (V&#8208;MCES) approach, which does not require the establishment of expensive training databases and can search the chemical space containing more than 4.2&#215;105 candidates was proposed. The accuracy of the V&#8208;MCES model was considerably improved when the model was combined with supervised learning for the feature selection of molecular descriptors. Techniques from V&#8208;MCES, correlating the molecular structures of the AEMs with the predicted chemical stability, generated a ranking list of potential high stability AEMs. Under the guidance of V&#8208;MCES, highly stable AEMs were synthesized. With understanding of AEM structure and performance by machine learning, AEM science may enter a new era of unprecedented levels of architectural design.

         <title>Branched Multimeric Peptides as Affinity Reagents for the Detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Klotho recognizing branched peptides were prepared via parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis. The branched peptide binders show at least a 30&#8208;fold improvement in affinity relative to the monomeric versions, can be used to study Klotho engagement by pull&#8208;down from cell lysates, and label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Klotho, an aging&#8208;related protein found in the kidney, parathyroid gland, and choroid plexus, acts as an essential co&#8208;receptor with the fibroblast growth factor 23 receptor complex to regulate serum phosphate and vitamin D levels. Decreased levels of &#945;&#8208;Klotho are a hallmark of age&#8208;associated diseases. Detecting or labeling &#945;&#8208;Klotho in biological milieu has long been a challenge, however, hampering the understanding of its role. Here, we developed branched peptides by single&#8208;shot parallel automated fast&#8208;flow synthesis that recognize &#945;&#8208;Klotho with improved affinity relative to their monomeric versions. These peptides were further shown to selectively label Klotho for live imaging in kidney cells. Our results demonstrate that automated flow technology enables rapid synthesis of complex peptide architectures, showing promise for future detection of &#945;&#8208;Klotho in physiological settings.

         <title>Engineering a Self&#8208;Grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;MOF Heterojunction with Selectively Anchored High&#8208;Density Pt Single&#8208;Atomic Cocatalysts for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt with selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts is synthesized by leveraging the chelating functionality of ligands and finely controlled surface reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC. The high activity is confirmed due to the efficient charge separation promoted by the heterojunction and the selective location of Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction.







Abstract
A photocatalyst TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt is developed with a self&#8208;grown TiO2/Ti&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction, i.e., TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC, and selectively anchored high&#8208;density Pt single&#8208;atomic cocatalysts on Ti&#8208;BPDC for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This intimate heterojunction, growing from the surface pyrolytic reconstruction of Ti&#8208;BPDC, works in a direct Z&#8208;scheme, efficiently separating electrons and holes. Pt is selectively anchored on Ti&#8208;BPDC by ligands and is found in the form of single atoms with loading up to 1.8&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The selective location of Pt is the electron&#8208;enriched domain of the heterojunction, which further enhances the utilization of the separated electrons. This tailored TiO2/Ti&#8208;BPDC&#8208;Pt shows a significantly enhanced activity of 12.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 compared to other TiO2&#8208; or MOF&#8208;based catalysts. The structure&#8208;activity relationship further proves the balance of two simultaneously exposed domains of heterojunctions is critical to fulfilling this kind of catalyst.

&lt;p&gt;A Z-scheme heterojunction TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti-BPDC-Pt with selectively anchored high-density Pt single-atomic cocatalysts is synthesized by leveraging the chelating functionality of ligands and finely controlled surface reconstruction of Ti-BPDC. The high activity is confirmed due to the efficient charge separation promoted by the heterojunction and the selective location of Pt single-atomic cocatalysts on the electron-enriched domain of the heterojunction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photocatalyst TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti-BPDC-Pt is developed with a self-grown TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti-metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) heterojunction, i.e., TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti-BPDC, and selectively anchored high-density Pt single-atomic cocatalysts on Ti-BPDC for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This intimate heterojunction, growing from the surface pyrolytic reconstruction of Ti-BPDC, works in a direct Z-scheme, efficiently separating electrons and holes. Pt is selectively anchored on Ti-BPDC by ligands and is found in the form of single atoms with loading up to 1.8&#8197;wt&#8201;%. The selective location of Pt is the electron-enriched domain of the heterojunction, which further enhances the utilization of the separated electrons. This tailored TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ti-BPDC-Pt shows a significantly enhanced activity of 12.4&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to other TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or MOF-based catalysts. The structure-activity relationship further proves the balance of two simultaneously exposed domains of heterojunctions is critical to fulfilling this kind of catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cascade Synthesis of Benzotriazulene with Three Embedded Azulene Units and Large Stokes Shifts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C3&#8208;symmetrical truxene&#8208;based benzotriazulene derivative with three embedded azulene units was concisely synthesized by means of a cascade [4+3] annulation involving a Suzuki coupling followed by Knoevenagel condensation of a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. The regioselectively trinitrated product exhibits a large Stokes shift of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1 along with unique solvatochromic effects in different solvents.







Abstract
We report here the one&#8208;pot synthesis of benzo[1,2&#8208;a&#8201;:&#8201;3,4&#8208;a&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;a&#8242;&#8242;]triazulene (BTA), wherein three azulene units are embedded through a tandem reaction comprising two steps, Suzuki coupling and Knoevenagel condensation, between a readily available triborylated truxene precursor and 8&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde. Its nitration leads to a regioselective trinitrated product, namely, BTA&#8208;NO2. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed that the superstructure of BTA consists of a dimer stacked by two enantiomeric helicene conformers, while that of BTA&#8208;NO2 consists of an unprecedented &#960;&#8208;tetramer stacked from two enantiomeric dimers, that is, four distinct helicene conformers. Both compounds show excellent stability and fluorescence with large Stokes shifts of up to 5100&#8197;cm&#8722;1. In addition, BTA&#8208;NO2 exhibits a unique solvatochromic effect in different solvents and hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced emission transfer in different ratios of THF/H2O solutions.

         <title>Transformation of an Imine Cage to a Covalent Organic Framework Film at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic covalent chemistry&#8208;directed transformation of an imine cage to highly porous covalent organic framework free&#8208;standing films at the aqueous&#8211;organic interface has been demonstrated under ambient conditions for size&#8208;selective molecular separation. The faster formation and better crystallinity of cage&#8208;derived COF films are due to the imine intermediate&#8208;assisted facile transimination and the dynamic self&#8208;assembly processes at the interface.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) opens up a fascinating route for the construction of well&#8208;organized supramolecular architectures, starting from organic molecular cages to crystalline macromolecular covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Herein, for the first time, we have manifested a facile room&#8208;temperature DCC&#8208;directed transformation of discrete organic imine cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF film at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface. The unfolding of the cage leading to the generation of imine intermediates, followed by their interface&#8208;assisted preorganization and subsequent growth of the COF film, are elucidated through detailed spectroscopic and microscopic investigations. The interfacial cage&#8208;to&#8208;COF transformation provides a facile route for the faster fabrication of free&#8208;standing COF films with high porosity and crystallinity, demonstrating excellent performance towards molecular sieving and high solvent permeance. Thus, the current study opens up a new route for structural interconversion between two crystalline entities with diverse dimensionality employing DCC at the confined interface.

         <title>Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Small Molecules: Long&#8208;Axis Polymerization Leads to a Nearly Concentration&#8208;Independent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nearly concentration&#8208;independent luminescence has been demonstrated by polymerizing a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor type TADF small molecule through its long&#8208;axis direction rather than the short&#8208;axis one. The corresponding PLQY remains almost unchanged, leading a promising EQE up to 20&#8201;% in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.







Abstract
Nowadays numerous thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers have been developed for PLEDs to realize high device performance and tunable emission colors. However, they often possess a strong concentration dependence on their luminescence including aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE). Herein, we first report a nearly concentration&#8208;independent TADF polymer based on the strategy of polymerized TADF small molecules. It is found that when a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) type TADF small molecule is polymerized through its long&#8208;axis direction, the triplet state is distributed along the polymeric backbone to effectively suppress the unwanted concentration quenching. Unlike the short&#8208;axis one with an ACQ effect, the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of the resultant long&#8208;axis polymer remains almost unchanged with the increasing doping concentration. Accordingly, a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 20&#8201;% is successfully achieved in a whole doping control window of 5&#8211;100&#8197;wt.&#8201;%.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Electrocatalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reactions Accelerated by Interpretable Intrinsic Descriptor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes an interpretable intrinsic descriptor to accelerate the high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;single&#8208;atom catalysts without calculations by combining physical insights with machine learning. The role of metal&#8208;ligand interaction on activity is also clarified using this descriptor. A series of experiments further verify the descriptor's guidance.







Abstract
Developing easily accessible descriptors is crucial but challenging to rationally design single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). This paper describes a simple and interpretable activity descriptor, which is easily obtained from the atomic databases. The defined descriptor proves to accelerate high&#8208;throughput screening of more than 700&#8197;graphene&#8208;based SACs without computations, universal for 3&#8211;5d transition metals and C/N/P/B/O&#8208;based coordination environments. Meanwhile, the analytical formula of this descriptor reveals the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the molecular orbital level. Using electrochemical nitrogen reduction as an example, this descriptor's guidance role has been experimentally validated by 13&#8197;previous reports as well as our synthesized 4&#8197;SACs. Orderly combining machine learning with physical insights, this work provides a new generalized strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;throughput screening while comprehensive understanding the structure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;activity relationship.

A thin versatile interlayer consisting of multifunctional adsorption sites is introduced to suppress the cathode crossover in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries using various high&#8208;capacity cathodes, such as Ni&#8208;rich layered metal oxide cathode, Li&#8208;/Mn&#8208;rich cathode, and sulfur cathode, while stabilizing the lithium stripping/plating process even under current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
The universal cathode crossover such as chemical and oxygen has been significantly overlooked in lithium metal batteries using high&#8208;energy cathodes which leads to severe capacity degradation and raises serious safety concerns. Herein, a versatile and thin (&#8776;25&#8197;&#956;m) interlayer composed of multifunctional active sites was developed to simultaneously regulate the Li deposition process and suppress the cathode crossover. The as&#8208;induced dual&#8208;gradient solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase combined with abundant lithiophilic sites enable stable Li stripping/plating process even under high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron X&#8208;ray experiments revealed that N&#8208;rich framework and CoZn dual active sites can effectively mitigate the undesired cathode crossover, hence significantly minimizing Li corrosion. Therefore, assembled lithium metal cells using various high&#8208;energy cathode materials including LiNi0.7Mn0.2Co0.1O2, Li1.2Co0.1Mn0.55Ni0.15O2, and sulfur demonstrate significantly improved cycling stability with high cathode loading.

         <title>A Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activated Photocage Based on a Ruthenium Complex for Cancer Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru complex&#8208;based photocage that can be activated by NIR light was designed and was engineered into amphiphilic block copolymers which self&#8208;assembled into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, Ru complexes are released from the nanoparticles and effectively inhibit tumor proliferation in mice via combined chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, demonstrating the promising anticancer applications of the Ru&#8208;based photocage in vivo.







Abstract
Conventional photocages only respond to short wavelength light, which is a significant obstacle to developing efficient phototherapy in vivo. The development of photocages activated by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light at wavelengths from 700 to 950&#8197;nm is important for in vivo studies but remains challenging. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a photocage based on a ruthenium (Ru) complex with NIR light&#8208;triggered photocleavage reaction. The commercial anticancer drug, tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), was coordinated to the RuII center to create the Ru&#8208;based photocage that is readily responsive to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm. The photocage inherited the anticancer properties of THC. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we further engineered a self&#8208;assembled photocage&#8208;based nanoparticle system with amphiphilic block copolymers. Upon exposure to NIR light at 760&#8197;nm, the Ru complex&#8208;based photocages were released from the polymeric nanoparticles and efficiently inhibited tumor proliferation in vivo.

         <title>Intramolecular Ynamide&#8211;Benzyne (3+2) Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions involving benzyne and ynamides as three&#8208;atom components have been accomplished through the utilization of benzyne precursors having a linking functionality. The ambivalent nature of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom, is thus brought to light in this approach.







Abstract
We report herein intramolecular (3+2) cycloaddition reactions between ynamides as three&#8208;atom components and benzyne. In these intramolecular reactions, the two&#8208;bond formation is realized by exploiting benzyne precursors that contain a chlorosilyl group as a linking functionality. This method thus highlights the ambivalent character of the intermediate indolium ylide, which exhibits both nucleophilic and electrophilic properties at its C2 atom.

         <title>Mimicking Photosynthesis: A Natural Z&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst Constructed from Red Mud Bauxite Waste for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;mimicking Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalyst was constructed by coupling acid&#8208;activated and alkali&#8208;treated red mud bauxite waste with an iron electron mediator. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state system presented a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity for overall water splitting, which even exceeded several artificially synthesized Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts. This work provides a sustainable way for new energy production through component engineering of natural mineral&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Z&#8208;Scheme photocatalysts have attracted significant attention due to their great potential for solar fuel production. However, delicately coupling two individual semiconductors with a charge shuttle by a material strategy remains a challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a new protocol of natural Z&#8208;Scheme heterostructures by strategically engineering the component and interfacial structure of red mud bauxite waste. Advanced characterizations elucidated that the hydrogen&#8208;induced formation of metallic Fe enabled the effective Z&#8208;Scheme electron transfer from &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 to TiO2, leading to the significantly boosted spatial separation of photo&#8208;generated carriers for overall water splitting. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunction based on natural minerals for solar fuel production. Thus our work provides a new avenue toward the utilization of natural minerals for advanced catalysis applications.

         <title>Study of Intermolecular Reconfiguration of Flexible COF&#8208;5 Film and Its Ultra&#8208;high Chemiresistive Humidity Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible COF&#8208;5 film is synthesized on PI substrate by a vapor&#8208;assisted conversion method and fabricate humidity sensor. The sensor shows resistance response to 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH in 4 orders of magnitude and maintains liner relation even bended at 180&#176;. Simulations are applied to reveal the intermolecular reconfiguration mechanism in humidity sensing. The superior sensitivity makes COF&#8208;5 films a protential candidate for human respiration monitoring.







Abstract
Recently, abundant active materials are developed to achieve the wearable detection of human body humidity. However, the limited response signal and sensitivity restrict further application due to their moderate affinity to water. Herein, we propose a flexible COF&#8208;5 film synthesized by a brief vapor&#8208;assisted method at room temperature. Intermediates are calculated by DFT simulation to investigate the interaction between COF&#8208;5 and water. The adsorption and desorption of water molecule result in a reversible deformation of COF layers while creating new conductive path by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The as&#8208;prepared COF&#8208;5 films are applied to the flexible humidity sensors, exhibiting a resistance change in 4 orders of magnitude with remarkable linear relation between log function of resistance and relative humidity (RH) in 11&#8201;%&#8211;98&#8201;% RH range. Applications including respiratory monitoring and non&#8208;contact switch are tested, providing a promising prospect for the detection of human body humidity.

         <title>Epitope Imprinting of Phospholipids by Oriented Assembly at the Oil/Water Interface for the Selective Recognition of Plasma Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imprinting strategy for targeting the polar epitope of phospholipids was developed based on reversed phase microemulsion oriented molecular imprinting. The prepared phospholipid&#8208;MIP can specifically recognize plasma membranes via a phospholipid exposed on the outer leaflet and thus differentiate physiological conditions of cells such as apoptosis, providing an alternative tool for targeted drug delivery and theranostics.







Abstract
Phospholipids, as fundamental building blocks of the cell membrane, play important roles for molecule transportation, cell recognition, etc. However, due to the structural diversity and amphipathic nature, there are few methods for the specific recognition of lipids as compared to other biomolecules such as proteins and glycans. Herein, we developed a molecular imprinting strategy for controllable imprinting toward the polar head of phospholipid exposed on the surface of cellular membranes for recognition. Phosphatidylserine, as unique lipid on the outer membrane leaflet of exosome and also hallmark for cell apoptosis, was imprinted with the developed method. The phosphatidylserine imprinted materials showed high efficiency and specific targeting capability not only for apoptotic cell imaging but also for the isolation of exosomes. Collectively, the synthesized molecularly imprinted materials have great potential for selective plasma membrane recognition for targeted drug delivery and biomarker discovery.

     alt="Epitope Imprinting of Phospholipids by Oriented Assembly at the Oil/Water Interface for the Selective Recognition of Plasma Membranes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An imprinting strategy for targeting the polar epitope of phospholipids was developed based on reversed phase microemulsion oriented molecular imprinting. The prepared phospholipid-MIP can specifically recognize plasma membranes via a phospholipid exposed on the outer leaflet and thus differentiate physiological conditions of cells such as apoptosis, providing an alternative tool for targeted drug delivery and theranostics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phospholipids, as fundamental building blocks of the cell membrane, play important roles for molecule transportation, cell recognition, etc. However, due to the structural diversity and amphipathic nature, there are few methods for the specific recognition of lipids as compared to other biomolecules such as proteins and glycans. Herein, we developed a molecular imprinting strategy for controllable imprinting toward the polar head of phospholipid exposed on the surface of cellular membranes for recognition. Phosphatidylserine, as unique lipid on the outer membrane leaflet of exosome and also hallmark for cell apoptosis, was imprinted with the developed method. The phosphatidylserine imprinted materials showed high efficiency and specific targeting capability not only for apoptotic cell imaging but also for the isolation of exosomes. Collectively, the synthesized molecularly imprinted materials have great potential for selective plasma membrane recognition for targeted drug delivery and biomarker discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Glass Formation in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystalline materials have governed the development of hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs), giving rise to a variety of fascinating applications such as solar cells and optoelectronic devices. With increasing interest in non&#8208;crystalline systems, the glassy state of HOIPs has recently been identified. Here, the basic building blocks of crystalline HOIPs appear to be retained, though their glasses lack long&#8208;range periodic order. The emerging family of glasses formed from HOIPs exhibits diverse properties, complementary to their crystalline state. This mini review describes the chemical diversity of both three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional crystalline HOIPs and demonstrates how glasses are produced from these materials. Specifically, current achievements in melt&#8208;quenched glasses formed from HOIPs are highlighted. We conclude with our perspective on the future of this new family of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Sulfonylation of Aryl Bromides Enabled by Potassium Metabisulfite as a Uniquely Effective SO2 Surrogate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides has been developed utilizing an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. While initial mechanistic studies identified SO2 as a catalyst poison, later use of the isolated oxidative addition complex revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2 slowly released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5.







Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a nickel&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylation of aryl bromides is disclosed. The reaction proceeds in good yields for a variety of substrates and utilizes an inexpensive, stench&#8208;free, inorganic sulfur salt (K2S2O5) as a uniquely effective SO2 surrogate. The active oxidative addition complex was synthesized, isolated, and fully characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis. The use of the isolated oxidative addition complex in both stoichiometric and catalytic reactions revealed that SO2 insertion occurs via dissolved SO2, likely released upon thermal decomposition of K2S2O5. Key to the success of the reaction is the role of K2S2O5 as a reservoir of SO2 that is slowly released, thus preventing catalyst poisoning.

         <dc:description>
A new and convenient palladium&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative procedure of bromoacetonitrile has been developed. A variety of valuable 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;N&#8208;acetamide and 2&#8208;cyanoacetate compounds were obtained in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions. Furthermore, this transformation can be carried out under atmospheric pressure and provides an alternative route to 7 drug compounds.

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Mediated Mitochondrial RNA Modification for Cancer RNA Interference Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the well&#8208;known cyclization reaction between furan and nucleotides of nucleic acid under the ignition of 1O2, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification (NIMiRM) strategy was herein developed for long&#8208;term NIR/PA dual&#8208;modality imaging and remarkable suppression of tumors in vivo.







Abstract
Mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) plays a critical role in synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Interfering mtRNA is a highly effective way to induce cell apoptosis. Herein, we report a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated mitochondrial RNA modification approach for long&#8208;term imaging and effective suppression of tumors. A tumor&#8208;targetable NIR fluorescent probe f&#8208;CRI consisting of a cyclic RGD peptide, a NIR fluorophore IR780, and a singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;labile furan group for RNA modification was rationally designed and synthesized. This probe was demonstrated to dominantly accumulate in cellular mitochondria and could be covalently conjugated onto mtRNA upon 808&#8197;nm irradiation resulting in prolonged retention in tumors. More notably, this covalent modification of mtRNA by f&#8208;CRI could perturb the function of mitochondria leading to remarkable tumor suppression. We thus envision that our current approach would offer a potential approach for cancer RNA interference therapeutics.

         <title>From Dinitrogen to N&#8208;Containing Organic Compounds: Using Li2CN2 as a Synthon</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for the conversion of inert N2 into various nitrogen&#8208;containing organic compounds is presented. The activated N&#8208;containing species Li2CN2 is successfully prepared in high yields from N2 gas, C and LiH. Li2CN2 can be transformed into a range of N&#8208;containing organic compounds, including cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives. 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives, have also been prepared from 15N2 gas.







Abstract
Through the synergies of a heterogeneous synthetic approach and a homogeneous synthetic methodology, N&#8208;containing organic compounds can be synthesized via activated N&#8208;containing species prepared from N2 gas and suitable carbon sources. From N2, carbon, and LiH, we have previously succeeded in the high&#8208;yield preparation of Li2CN2 as the activated N&#8208;containing species. In this work, we applied Li2CN2 as a novel synthetic synthon for constructing N&#8208;containing organic compounds. A series of reaction models, including a substitution reaction, cycloaddition reaction, and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction, were successfully performed using Li2CN2 under mild conditions. Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N&#8208;aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the 15N&#8208;labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti&#8208;cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from 15N2 gas.

Various valuable cyanamides, carbodiimides, N-aryl cyanamides and 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were readily synthesized in moderate to excellent yields. With this method, the &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N-labeled products, including oxazolidine derivatives with anti-cancer activity, could also be facilely prepared from &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Missing&#8208;Linker&#8208;Confined Single&#8208;Atomic Pt Nanozymes for Enzymatic Theranostics of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled single&#8208;atomic Pt nanozyme was developed using a facile missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination strategy. The nanozyme shows superior catalase&#8208;mimicking activity for the catalytic conversion of H2O2 overproduced in tumors into localized O2 for tumor hypoxia alleviation, which leads to enhanced ROS generation from loaded photosensitizers for apoptotic cancer cell death.







Abstract
Conventional nanozymes often possess low active site density. Pursuing effective strategies for constructing highly active single&#8208;atomic nanosystems with maximum atom utilization efficiency is exceptionally attractive. Herein, we develop a facile &#8220;missing&#8208;linker&#8208;confined coordination&#8221; strategy to fabricate two self&#8208;assembled nanozymes, i.e., conventional nanozyme (NE) and single&#8208;atomic nanozyme (SAE), which respectively consist of Pt nanoparticles and single Pt atoms as active catalytic sites anchored in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with encapsulated photosensitizers for catalase&#8208;mimicking enhanced photodynamic therapy. Compared to a Pt nanoparticle&#8208;based conventional nanozyme, a Pt single&#8208;atomic nanozyme shows enhanced catalase&#8208;mimicking activity in generating oxygen for overcoming tumor hypoxia, thus exhibiting a more efficient reactive oxygen species generation and high tumor inhibition rate.

         <title>A Hydrazine&#8208;Nitrate Flow Battery Catalyzed by a Bimetallic RuCo Precatalyst for Wastewater Purification along with Simultaneous Generation of Ammonia and Electricity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new and general electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, the bimetallic RuCo precatalyst can efficiently catalyze both the hydrazine oxidation and nitrate reduction reactions so as to assemble a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery with electricity and ammonia generation.







Abstract
The traditional technologies for industrial and agricultural effluent treatment are often energy&#8208;intensive. Herein, we suggest an electrochemical redox strategy for spontaneous and simultaneous decontamination of wastewater and generation of both fuels and electricity at low cost. Using hydrazine and nitrate effluents as a demonstration, we propose a hydrazine&#8208;nitrate flow battery (HNFB) that can efficiently purify the wastewater and meanwhile generate both ammonia fuel and electricity with the assistance of our developed bimetallic RuCo precatalyst. Specifically, the battery delivers a peak power density of 12&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and continuously operates for 20&#8197;h with an ammonia yield rate of ca. 0.38&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 under 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The generated electricity can further drive a hydrazine electrolyzer to produce hydrogen fuel. Our work provides an alternative pathway to purify wastewater and generate high value&#8208;added fuels at low cost.

         <title>Catalytic Chemo&#8208; and Regioselective Radical Carbocyanation of 2&#8208;Azadienes for the Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Nitriles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and broadly applicable method for the construction of complex &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile derivatives through a novel cascade strategy is presented. Alkyl radicals are generated by the photo&#8208;mediated reductive decarboxylation of redox&#8208;active esters, captured by 2&#8208;azadienes to provide 2&#8208;azallyl radicals and cyanized by a copper catalyst.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino nitriles are versatile structural motifs in a variety of biologically active compounds and pharmaceuticals and they serve as valuable building blocks in synthesis. The preparation of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles from readily available scaffolds, however, remains challenging. Herein is reported a novel dual catalytic photoredox/copper&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208; and regioselective radical carbocyanation of 2&#8208;azadienes to access functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles by using redox&#8208;active esters (RAEs) and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This cascade process employs a broad scope of RAEs and provides the corresponding &#945;&#8208;amino nitrile building blocks in 50&#8211;95&#8201;% yields (51 examples, regioselectivity &gt;95&#8201;:&#8201;5). The products were transformed into prized &#945;&#8208;amino nitriles and &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical cascade coupling process.

         <dc:description>
Dense, smooth, substrate&#8208;integrated, large&#8208;area and thickness&#8208;controlled perovskite microcrystalline films are prepared. They are used as self&#8208;powered microcrystalline X&#8208;ray detectors with an impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, which may further reduce the X&#8208;ray radiation risk to patients.







Abstract
Perovskite single crystals and polycrystalline films have complementary merits and deficiencies in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Herein, we report preparation of dense and smooth perovskite microcrystalline films with both merits of single crystals and polycrystalline films through polycrystal&#8208;induced growth and hot&#8208;pressing treatment (HPT). Utilizing polycrystalline films as seeds, multi&#8208;inch&#8208;sized microcrystalline films can be in situ grown on diverse substrates with maximum grain size reaching 100&#8197;&#956;m, which endows the microcrystalline films with comparable carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime (&#956;&#964;) product as single crystals. As a result, self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detectors with impressive sensitivity of 6.1&#215;104&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low detection limit of 1.5&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1 are achieved, leading to high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray imaging at an ultra&#8208;low dose rate of 67&#8197;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1. Combining with the fast response speed (186&#8197;&#956;s), this work may contribute to the development of perovskite&#8208;based low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <dc:description>
The coordination environment of Ru in Ru/TiO2 dictates the reaction pathway for polyethylene terephthalate hydrogenolysis. Under&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor the formation of arenes through a desired binding orientation of aromatic adsorbates, which discourages ring hydrogenation and ring&#8208;opening reactions.







Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrogenolysis can produce benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), where the selectivity control is challenging. We report a reaction pathway dictated by the Ru coordination environment by examining the binding geometries of adsorbates on differently coordinated Ru centers and their evolution during PET hydrogenolysis. A BTX yield of 77&#8201;% was obtained using a Ru/TiO2 with a Ru coordination number of ca. 5.0 where edge/corner sites are dominant, while more gas and saturated products were formed for Ru/TiO2 containing primarily terrace sites. Density functional theory and isotopic labelling revealed that under&#8208;coordinated Ru edge sites favor &#8220;upright&#8221; adsorption of aromatic adsorbates while well&#8208;coordinated Ru sites favor &#8220;flat&#8208;lying&#8221; adsorption, where the former mitigates ring hydrogenation and opening. This study demonstrates that reaction pathways can be directed through controlled reactant/intermediate binding via tuning of the Ru coordination environment for efficient conversion of PET to BTX.

         <title>Cooperative Proton and Li&#8208;ion Conduction in a 2D&#8208;Layered MOF via Mechanical Insertion of Lithium Halides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high ionic conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) was observed in the 2D&#8208;Ti&#8208;dobdc MOF after Li salt intercalation, which improved the H2O affinity of the frameworks, facilitating Li+ and H+ diffusion. Furthermore, the ion diffusion evaluated by PFG&#8197;NMR indicates the counter anion effect. It was demonstrated that the moderate covalent/ionic character of LiBr and the high H2O uptake are crucial factors in efficient ionic conductors.







Abstract
Ionic conduction in highly designable and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks has been explored through the introduction of various ionic species (H+, OH&#8722;, Li+, etc.) using post&#8208;synthetic modification such as acid, salt, or ionic liquid incorporation. Here, we report on high ionic conductivity (&#963;&gt;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in a two&#8208;dimensionally (2D)&#8208;layered Ti&#8208;dobdc (Ti2(Hdobdc)2(H2dobdc), H4dobdc: 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid) via LiX (X=Cl, Br, I) intercalation using mechanical mixing. The anionic species in lithium halide strongly affect the ionic conductivity and durability of conductivity. Solid&#8208;state pulsed&#8208;field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG&#8197;NMR ) verified the high mobility of H+ and Li+ ions in the temperature range of 300&#8211;400&#8197;K. In particular, the insertion of Li salts improved the H+ mobility above 373&#8197;K owing to strong binding with H2O. Furthermore, the continuous increase in Li+ mobility with temperature contributed to the retention of the overall high ionic conductivity at high temperatures.

         <title>Pyrene&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four highly porous pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared for photocatalytic H2O2 generation. The reported findings highlight that the presence of pyrene active sites in very close proximity leads to unwanted H2O2 decomposition. Accordingly, a biphasic system (benzyl alcohol and water) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition.







Abstract
Four highly porous covalent organic frameworks (COFs) containing pyrene units were prepared and explored for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The experimental studies are complemented by density functional theory calculations, proving that the pyrene unit is more active for H2O2 production than the bipyridine and (diarylamino)benzene units reported previously. H2O2 decomposition experiments verified that the distribution of pyrene units over a large surface area of COFs plays an important role in catalytic performance. The Py&#8208;Py&#8208;COF though contains more pyrene units than other COFs which induces a high H2O2 decomposition due to a dense concentration of pyrene in close proximity over a limited surface area. Therefore, a two&#8208;phase reaction system (water&#8208;benzyl alcohol) was employed to inhibit H2O2 decomposition. This is the first report on applying pyrene&#8208;based COFs in a two&#8208;phase system for photocatalytic H2O2 generation.

         <title>Imaging Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Membrane Interactions: Ion&#8208;Channel Pores and Lipid&#8208;Bilayer Permeability in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;association of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) into oligomeric, protofibril, annular and fibril assemblies is intimately linked with neuronal toxicity and Alzheimer's disease. A&#946; can have a range of impacts on the lipid membrane including a carpeting effect and ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Imaging these interactions with the lipid bilayer is providing a clearer picture of A&#946;&#8208;induced membrane permeability, which leads to loss of cellular homeostasis.







Abstract
The accumulation of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptides (A&#946;) is central to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which A&#946; triggers a cascade of events that leads to dementia is a topic of intense investigation. A&#946; self&#8208;associates into a series of complex assemblies with different structural and biophysical properties. It is the interaction of these oligomeric, protofibril and fibrillar assemblies with lipid membranes, or with membrane receptors, that results in membrane permeability and loss of cellular homeostasis, a key event in Alzheimer's disease pathology. A&#946; can have an array of impacts on lipid membranes, reports have included: a carpeting effect; a detergent effect; and A&#946; ion&#8208;channel pore formation. Recent advances imaging these interactions are providing a clearer picture of A&#946; induced membrane disruption. Understanding the relationship between different A&#946; structures and membrane permeability will inform therapeutics targeting A&#946; cytotoxicity.

         <title>Decrypting the Controlled Product Selectivity over Ag&#8722;Cu Bimetallic Surface Alloys for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8722;Cu surface alloys, as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, demonstrated controllable product selectivity with their surface compositions and the applied potentials rationally tuned. The working mechanism of these catalysts was revealed by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations. A predominant region map describing the thermodynamic predominance of *CO involved subsequent reactions is provided as reliable guidance for the design of catalysts CO2 reduction towards value&#8208;added products.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) with controlled product selectivity is realized on Ag&#8722;Cu bimetallic surface alloys, with high selectivity towards C2 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;60&#8201;% faradaic efficiency, FE), C1 hydrocarbons/alcohols (&#8776;41&#8201;% FE) and CO (&#8776;74&#8201;% FE) achieved by tuning surface compositions and applied potentials. In situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that surface&#8208;composition&#8208;dependent d&#8208;band center could tune *CO binding strengths, regulating the *CO subsequent reaction pathways and then the product selectivity. Further adjusting the applied potentials will alter the energy of participated electrons, which leads to controlled ECO2RR selectivity towards desired products. A predominant region map, with an indicator proposed to evaluate the thermodynamic predominance of the *CO subsequent reactions, is then provided as a reliable theoretical guidance for the controllable ECO2RR product selectivity over bimetallic alloys.

         <title>Toward Scalable Nanofluidic Osmotic Power Generation from Hypersaline Water Sources with a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a strategy toward scalable nanofluidic osmotic power generation by using PSS/HKUST&#8208;1 membrane with subnanometer pores and using hypersaline water sources. The hypersaline water sources provide high ionic conductivity and the subnanometer pores guarantee charge selectivity under high salinity. The power density stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2 when the membrane area increased to 7&#8197;mm2, the highest for macro&#8208;sized nanofluidic membranes.







Abstract
Nanofluidic membranes have shown great promise in harvesting osmotic energy but its scalablity remains challenging since most studies only tested with a membrane area of &#8776;10&#8722;2&#8197;mm2 or smaller. We demonstrate that metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework membranes with subnanometer pores can be used for scalable osmotic power generation from hypersaline water sources. Our membrane can be scaled up to a few mm2, and the power density can be stabilized at 1.7&#8197;W&#8201;m&#8722;2. We reveal that the key is to improve the out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane conductance while keeping the membrane's charge selectivity, contradicting the previous conception that the ionic conductivity of the membrane plays the dominating role. We highlight that subnanometer pores are essential to ensure the charge selectivity in hypersaline water sources. Our results suggest the importance to engineer the interplay between the in&#8208;membrane and out&#8208;of&#8208;membrane ion transport properties for scalable osmotic power generation.

         <title>Rationally Modulating the Functions of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx Nanocomposite Electrocatalysts towards Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the understanding of intrinsic properties of the catalyst and the interactions with all pertinent intermediates, an efficient Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx electrocatalyst was designed and proven to realize mutual coordination among functions of active sites on the efficient dissociative adsorption of water, the easy desorption of OH&#8722;, and the facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation concurrently, leading to significantly boosted alkaline HER kinetics.







Abstract
Identifying electrocatalysts with functions of easy dissociation of water, rapid transformation of hydroxyl and facile hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bond formation are indispensable while challenge for realizing efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we presented the design of Ni3Sn2&#8208;NiSnOx nanocomposites towards addressing this challenge. We showed that Ni3Sn2 possessed ideal hydrogen adsorption and low hydroxyl adsorption abilities and NiSnOx facilitated water dissociation and hydroxyl transfer process, respectively. Consequently, the fine&#8208;tuned interplay of the two functional parts realized the mutual coordination among the multiple functions and led to significantly boosted HER kinetics. Current densities of 10 and 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were obtained at overpotentials of 14 and 165&#8197;mV on the optimized catalyst. This work highlights the significance of considering intrinsic interactions between active sites and all pertinent intermediates on obtaining promising electrocatalysts.

         <title>Electrochemical CaC2&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Biochar to C2H2: High Carbon Efficiency and Low Contamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid cathode electrolysis in molten salts is expected to convert biomass carbon into CaC2 with 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency. Simultaneously, the electrolysis can remove elements such as S and P from biomass, circumventing the contamination of harmful H2S and H3P in the final hydrolytic C2H2 product.







Abstract
The carbon to CaC2 route is promising to provide a sustainable elementary unit, C2H2, for the organic synthesis industry, but the traditional thermal reaction process suffers from low carbon efficiency, harmful gas contamination, high temperature operation, and risky CO management. We herein report a high carbon efficiency (ca. 100&#8201;%) conversion of biochar to C2H2 through an electrolytic synthesis of solid CaC2 in molten CaCl2/KCl/CaO at 973&#8197;K. The main reactions are carbon reduction to CaC2 at the solid carbon cathode and oxygen evolution at an inert anode. Meanwhile, the electrolysis removes S and P from the solid cathode, avoiding the formation of CaS and Ca3P2 in CaC2 and consequently eliminating H2S and PH3 contamination in the finally produced C2H2.

         <title>Atomically Local Electric Field Induced Interface Water Reorientation for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breaking the periodic surface of catalysts by the inclusion of single atoms can help building atomic electric fields that highly promote the hydrogen evolution reaction activity. We show here that this is achieved by modulating the interfacial water orientation and by subsequently decreasing the active sites&#8208;hydrogen distance.







Abstract
The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single&#8208;atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00&#215;1010&#8197;N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M&#8722;H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activated Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Based on Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Copper(I) Cluster&#8208;Assembled Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) copper cluster&#8208;assembled chains was prepared, which exhibited unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property. Based on which the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was constructed, which showed reversible photo&#8208;response property with excellent fatigue resistance.







Abstract
In this study, a pair of chiral copper(I) cluster&#8208;assembled materials (R/S&#8208;2) was prepared, exhibiting unique photo&#8208;response characteristics with a concentration&#8208;wavelength correlation property in DMSO solution. By the combination of R/S&#8208;2 with a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, the first photo&#8208;activated circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) film was developed, the CPL signal (glum=9&#215;10&#8722;3) of which could be induced by UV light irradiation. Moreover, the film exhibited a reversible photo&#8208;response and extremely good fatigue resistance. Mechanism study revealed that the photo&#8208;response properties of the R/S&#8208;2 solution and film are attributed to the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S&#8208;2 and a photo&#8208;induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster&#8208;assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive composite materials.

Mechanism study revealed that the photo-response properties of the R/S-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; solution and film are attributed to the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics of R/S-&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and a photo-induced deoxygenation process. This study enriches the types of luminescent cluster-assembled molecules and provides a new strategy for the construction of metal cluster-based stimuli-responsive composite materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8208;Bound or O&#8208;Bound Surface: Which One Boosts Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis?</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate is a sustainable and promising alternative for urea synthesis. Here we demonstrate that the localized negatively charged surface with C&#8208;affinity is superior to the positively charged one with O&#8208;affinity, providing guidance for screening and design of electrocatalysts for urea synthesis.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from carbon dioxide and nitrate under ambient conditions is kind of sustainable and promising alternative method for urea synthesis. To date, the influence of catalyst surface properties on molecular adsorption configuration and electrocatalytic urea synthesis activity is unclear. In this work, we proposed that the urea synthesis activity is closely linked with the localized surface charge on bimetallic electrocatalysts, it is found that a negatively charged surface induces C&#8208;bound path and boosts urea synthesis. The urea yield rate can reach 13.1&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 on negatively charged Cu97In3&#8208;C, which is about 13&#8197;times that of positively charged Cu30In70&#8208;C counterpart with O&#8208;bound surface. This conclusion also applies to Cu&#8722;Bi and Cu&#8722;Sn systems. The molecular modification shifts the surface of Cu97In3&#8208;C to positively charged state, which leads to a sharp decline in urea synthesis performance. We demonstrated that the C&#8208;bound surface is more favorable than O&#8208;bound one to boost electrocatalytic urea synthesis.
