         <title>Thermodynamic Compensation of Surface Hydroxyl Moieties in Reduced Polyoxometalates Translates to Deviations in the Mechanism of Proton&#8211;coupled Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change in the central atom in the series of vanadium&#8208;doped Keggin&#8208;type polyoxotungstate clusters results in the near&#8208;perfect thermal compensation between redox potential and proton affinity. Despite identical driving forces, this series of polyoxotungstate clusters exhibits distinguished different proton&#8211;coupled electron transfer mechanisms toward the dehydrogenating of organic substrates.








Abstract
The design of H&#8208;atom transfer catalysts requires the control of redox potential and proton affinity to direct the mechanism, rate, and selectivity of proton&#8211;coupled electron transfer (PCET). In the present study, we demonstrate that a series of reduced and protonated vanadium&#8208;substituted Keggin&#8208;type polyoxotungstates ([XVW11O39(OH)]n&#8211;, X&#160;=&#160;Si, n&#160;=&#160;5; X&#160;=&#160;P, n&#160;=&#160;4; X&#160;=&#160;S, n&#160;=&#160;3), exhibit invariant bond dissociation free energies of surface O&#9472;H bonds (BDFE(O&#9472;H)s). Despite uniform driving forces for H&#8208;atom uptake, kinetic analysis with a variety of H&#8208;atom donors (5,10&#8208;dihydrophenazine, hydrazobenzene, and hydroquinones) reveals differences in rates of substrate oxidation, which are ascribed to disparate PCET mechanisms. Together, these findings show that substitution at the central heteroatom tunes the electron&#8208; and proton&#8208;transfer driving forces (&#916;GPT and &#916;GET) thereby dictating the operative PCET mechanism.

         <title>Water&#8208;Splitting &#8220;Without Water&#8221;: Splitting of the Crystallised Water of Hydrated Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike liquid water, the structural and molecular properties of water molecules embedded in hydrated salts are subject to strong influences and vary little. This makes them potential candidates for the water splitting reaction. Here, we present the first example of the electrochemical decomposition of crystallised water.








Abstract
In contrast to the liquid phase of water, the structural molecular realities of H2O molecules embedded in crystallised salts vary little and can be precisely determined. However, this water, which is neither in the liquid nor in the gas phase, has not yet been used in water electrolysis. Here, we demonstrate that water electrolysis can be achieved without the addition of (liquid) water through experiments with a wide range of hydrated salts and organic solvent suspensions. We obtain an excellent correlation between the position of the FTIR O&#9472;H stretch vibration of the hydrated salts and the onset of the OER potential from CV measurements. Together with first&#8208;principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that intramolecular bonds in crystallised water can be effectively controlled through choice of the inorganic salt. Targeted manipulation of the bonds in the H2O molecule is a promising new approach to more efficient hydrogen production.

         <title>Photoenzymatic Aliphatic C&#9472;Br Activation for Enantioselective Synthesis of &#947;&#8208;Stereogenic Nitriles from Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work showcases a photoenzymatic platform using bromoacetonitrile as a practical cyanide source for asymmetric &#947;&#8208;hydrocyanation of alkenes. The system enables direct activation of inert aliphatic C&#9472;Br bonds via engineered ene&#8208;reductases (PETNR H182M) under visible light. Remarkably, the enzyme achieves excellent enantiocontrol through stereoselective hydrogen atom transfer within its active site








Abstract
Enzymatic strategies for direct cyano group incorporation remain underdeveloped, creating synthetic bottlenecks for accessing chiral nitrile derivatives in pharmaceuticals and functional materials. Herein, we have developed a photoenzymatic &#947;&#8208;hydrocyanation strategy that addresses this gap. The system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in activating the challenging aliphatic C&#9472;Br bond of bromoacetonitrile through engineered ene&#8208;reductase catalysis. Upon visible light excitation, the reduced flavin cofactor generates cyanomethyl radicals that are spatially confined and precisely oriented within the enzyme's active site for efficient coupling with &#945;&#8208;methylstyrenes. This synergistic photoenzymatic system also demonstrates distinct stereochemical control, with the engineered active site simultaneously governing radical generation and subsequent enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer to afford a large range of &#947;&#8208;stereogenic nitriles in up to 93% yield, 94% ee &#8211; a transformation that poses considerable challenges for traditional transition metal catalysis. Beyond providing a robust platform for asymmetric cyanoalkylation, this work significantly advances photoenzymatic catalysis by establishing unactivated alkyl bromides as viable radical precursors for selective bond formations.

         <title>On the Origin of Substrate Specificity of Enzymes from the Amidohydrolase Superfamily</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive analyses of two enzyme classes from the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS) revealed that catalysis proceeds either via 1,4 or 1,6 nucleophilic conjugate addition and that this property defines substrate specificity. Moreover, although all substrates and products are entirely achiral, this mechanistic difference results in an inverted enantioselectivity for fleeting chiral intermediates in the two analyzed AHS classes.








Abstract
The sequencing of numerous genomes has led to the identification of open reading frames for millions of enzymes, many of which use unknown substrates. Hence, the identification of both primary and promiscuous activities remains a major challenge for enzyme research. Here, we identified the mechanistic basis of substrate specificity for members of the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS). Comprehensive analyses of two AHS classes revealed that catalysis proceeds either via 1,4 or 1,6 nucleophilic conjugate addition mediated by a glutamine that is located at two different positions within the active site thereby shaping substrate scope in these enzymes. These different enzymatic properties result in an inverted enantioselectivity for fleeting chiral intermediates, which are transient chiral species on the reaction pathway from an achiral substrate to an achiral product. Moreover, we demonstrated that catalysis focuses on conserved core structures rather than on all moieties of a given substrate, which increases the degree of promiscuity and evolvability in these enzymes. Using site&#8208;directed mutagenesis, we showed that an enzyme specialized in a specific nucleophilic conjugate addition can both readily adapt to secondary substrates and accommodate novel substrates by few amino acid exchanges. Hence, our study reveals mechanistic principles that underly substrate specificity, promiscuity, and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Monitoring Enzyme Clustering in a Highly Crystalline Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Small&#8208;Angle Neutron Scattering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering was used to probe porosity changes in the high&#8208;q range (0.06&#8211;0.4 &#197;&#8722;1) of a highly crystalline Tb&#8208;mesoMOF. The appearance of a broad scattering feature at low&#8208;q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&#8722;1) in Cyt. c@Tb&#8208;mesoMOF indicates enzyme clustering within the framework across long&#8208;range length scales.








Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level investigation of enzyme behavior in confined, cell&#8208;free environments is essential to understanding intrinsic properties and optimizing systems for desired functions. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide unique structural features that enable the immobilization of bulky biomolecules and allow direct probing of enzymatic behavior under confinement. Here, small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) was employed to probe porosity changes in a highly crystalline Tb&#8208;mesoMOF and to reveal the spatial arrangement of encapsulated enzymes across long&#8208;range length scales. Structural characteristics such as framework void space were resolved by SANS, while contrast&#8208;matching experiments using D2O/H2O mixtures suppressed background scattering from the MOF and isolated the enzyme contribution. Compared to unloaded Tb&#8208;mesoMOF, cytochrome c (Cyt. c)&#8208;loaded Tb&#8208;mesoMOF exhibited the emergence of a broad scattering feature at low q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&#8722;1), indicative of enzyme clustering within the framework, accompanied by enhanced loading rate and capacity. Additional structural analyses using complementary techniques further corroborated these findings.

The appearance of a broad scattering feature at low-q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in Cyt. c@Tb-mesoMOF indicates enzyme clustering within the framework across long-range length scales.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular-level investigation of enzyme behavior in confined, cell-free environments is essential to understanding intrinsic properties and optimizing systems for desired functions. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide unique structural features that enable the immobilization of bulky biomolecules and allow direct probing of enzymatic behavior under confinement. Here, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) was employed to probe porosity changes in a highly crystalline Tb-mesoMOF and to reveal the spatial arrangement of encapsulated enzymes across long-range length scales. Structural characteristics such as framework void space were resolved by SANS, while contrast-matching experiments using D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mixtures suppressed background scattering from the MOF and isolated the enzyme contribution. Compared to unloaded Tb-mesoMOF, cytochrome c (Cyt. c)-loaded Tb-mesoMOF exhibited the emergence of a broad scattering feature at low q (&#8764;0.005 &#197;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), indicative of enzyme clustering within the framework, accompanied by enhanced loading rate and capacity. Additional structural analyses using complementary techniques further corroborated these findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Ketone Hydrogenation to Secondary Alcohols with High Activity and Selectivity Under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic screening identifies Ru nanoparticles on carbon black (RuNP/C) as an efficient electrocatalyst for acetone hydrogenation via a hydrogen atom transfer pathway, enabled by optimized acetone and hydrogen adsorption. RuNP/C achieves 95% isopropanol Faradaic efficiency at 250 mA cm&#8722;2 and 99% single&#8208;pass conversion in the membrane electrode assembly, and selectively hydrogenates diverse ketones to secondary alcohols.








Abstract
Secondary alcohols are indispensable building blocks in the production of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers, yet their conventional synthesis routes are energy and resource intensive. Electrochemical ketone hydrogenation under ambient conditions offers an attractive approach to synthesize secondary alcohols, but this process is often hindered by base&#8208;catalyzed self&#8208;condensation, hydrogenolysis, and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we demonstrate that Ru nanoparticles supported on commercial carbon black (RuNP/C) can enable efficient, selective, and stable electrochemical hydrogenation of a wide range of structurally diverse ketones to produce corresponding secondary alcohols under ambient conditions. Mechanistic investigations reveal that RuNP/C can simultaneously promote generation of reactive hydrogen species and adsorption of ketone molecules, facilitating rapid transfer of reactive hydrogen species to adsorbed ketone molecules, thereby enabling efficient secondary alcohols formation and suppressing HER. This work opens a green and sustainable pathway for ketone upgrading.

         <title>A Modularly Integrated Chiral Cavitand</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modular, three&#8208;component coassembly system has been developed that achieves high&#8208;fidelity integration of chiral functions on a cavitand. The resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived cavitand, embedded with a sequential hydrogen bonding donor&#8211;acceptor array of benzimidazoles, enables corral encapsulation of chiral carboxylic acids and alcohols, promoting the deracemization of the corrals with propeller chirality.








Abstract
Rational assembly of multiple molecular building blocks enables functional integration. However, precise construction of complex systems comprising of three or more molecular modules is challenging due to the pathway complexity. Here, we report a highly modular, three&#8208;component coassembly system that achieves high&#8208;fidelity integration of chiral functions on a cavitand. The resorcin[4]arene&#8208;derived cavitand, embedded with a sequential hydrogen bonding donor&#8211;acceptor array of benzimidazoles, enables corral encapsulation of chiral carboxylic acids and alcohols, promoting the deracemization of the corrals with propeller chirality. This approach allows for the unprecedented construction of modular supramolecular&#8208;chiral cavitand. After installing chiral acid module on corral, the cavity is expanded that could further include a guest molecule as a third module. Chirality was successfully transferred from the cavitand to the luminescent module, resulting in efficient circularly polarized luminescence. This study leverages the propeller chirality of deep cavitands to construct a highly modular, functionally integrated molecular system, demonstrating great potential for building customizable and disassemblable molecular functional platforms.

         <title>Photoswitchable Peptides as Molecular Tools to Encode Structural Order and Disorder in Intracellular Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a photoswitchable peptide conjugate which exhibits isomerism&#8208;dependent self&#8208;assembly: the planar trans&#8208;isomer assembles into well&#8208;ordered nanofibers while the non&#8208;planar cis&#8208;isomer yields disordered aggregates. Our study offers a direct visualization on the effects of structure formation inside living cells.








Abstract
Understanding how self&#8208;assembled structure formation affects cells remains a central challenge in supramolecular chemistry. However, chemical tools that allow access to both ordered and disordered intracellular assemblies from a single molecular scaffold are rare due to design complexity. Here, we present a photoswitchable isotripeptide incorporating an arylazopyrazole (AAP) unit, which undergoes intracellular cleavage to yield a self&#8208;assembling monomer. Upon photoisomerization, the planar trans&#8208;isomer forms &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich nanofibers with strong aromatic interactions, while the non&#8208;planar cis&#8208;isomer assembles into disordered, random&#8208;coil aggregates lacking aromatic contribution. The structural dynamics of the assemblies are demonstrated by repeated photoswitching between the two states in buffered conditions. Notably, A549 cancer cell viability correlates with the isomer&#8208;dependent assembly behavior and critical aggregation concentrations (CACs): the trans&#8208;isomer, with higher aggregation propensity, exhibits greater cytotoxicity. This photoswitchable peptide system thus provides a powerful platform with fast, reversible and robust switching kinetics, long isomer half&#8208;lives, and high photostability to probe the intracellular consequences of supramolecular order and disorder using a single molecular scaffold.

         <title>Regio&#8208;Divergent and Stereo&#8208;Controlled Alder&#8208;Ene Reaction: Harnessing the Unique Electronic and Steric Properties of B(MIDA) Moiety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the regioselectivity of Alder&#8208;ene reactions with unsymmetrical alkynes remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that propargyl B(MIDA)&#8208;substituted alkynes serve as effective substrates for regiodivergent Alder&#8208;ene reactions. By selecting either [CpRu] or [Cp*Ru] catalysts, we can selectively access linear or branched 1,4&#8208;dienes via &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylation, respectively. Mechanistic studies indicate that the B(MIDA) group exerts a unique stereo&#8208;electronic effect responsible for this regiocontrol.








Abstract
1,4&#8208;Dienes are pivotal structural motifs in bioactive natural products and serve as valuable intermediates in synthetic chemistry. Among the various methods for their synthesis, the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed Alder&#8208;ene reaction stands out due to its redox&#8208;neutral, atom&#8208; and step&#8208;efficient nature. However, controlling regioselectivity with unsymmetrical alkynes remains a persistent challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that propargyl B(MIDA)&#8208;substituted alkynes are effective substrates for regio&#8208;divergent Alder&#8208;ene reactions. By selecting between [CpRu] and [Cp*Ru] catalysts, we can selectively obtain either linear or branched 1,4&#8208;dienes via &#947;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;allylation. Mechanistic investigations reveal that &#963;(C&#9472;B)&#8594;&#963;(Ru&#9472;C)* hyperconjugation plays a critical role for &#947;&#8208;selectivity, while steric repulsion between the Cp* ligand and the bulky B(MIDA) group governs the &#946;&#8208;selectivity. This approach provides a straightforward and efficient means to access two distinct allylic boron&#8208;functionalized 1,4&#8208;dienes, each featuring differentiated double bonds, which are highly amenable to further chemical elaboration.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assemblies Regulate the Catalytic Activity of Peptide Fibrils</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic self&#8208;assembling peptides (cSAPs) form fibrils that catalyze the retro&#8208;aldol reaction of Methodol. Co&#8208;assembly with inactive peptides tunes catalytic efficiency by altering substrate accessibility and the distance to the nucleophilic lysine. This approach enables precise engineering of catalytic domains and activities in peptide&#8208;based catalytic nanostructures. 



Abstract
Short peptide sequences self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular structures through intermolecular interactions, creating a microenvironment in which chemical reactions can be catalyzed. In recent years, many peptide sequences have shown to demonstrate catalytic activity upon nanostructure formation, but the engineering of the catalytic microenvironment through co&#8208;assembly strategies have not been explored. We introduce a peptide sequence that gains retro&#8208;aldolase activity upon assembly to supramolecular peptide fibrils in aqueous buffer solution (pH 7.4).

     alt="Co-Assemblies Regulate the Catalytic Activity of Peptide Fibrils"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic self-assembling peptides (cSAPs) form fibrils that catalyze the retro-aldol reaction of Methodol. Co-assembly with inactive peptides tunes catalytic efficiency by altering substrate accessibility and the distance to the nucleophilic lysine. This approach enables precise engineering of catalytic domains and activities in peptide-based catalytic nanostructures. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short peptide sequences self-assemble into supramolecular structures through intermolecular interactions, creating a microenvironment in which chemical reactions can be catalyzed. In recent years, many peptide sequences have shown to demonstrate catalytic activity upon nanostructure formation, but the engineering of the catalytic microenvironment through co-assembly strategies have not been explored. We introduce a peptide sequence that gains retro-aldolase activity upon assembly to supramolecular peptide fibrils in aqueous buffer solution (pH 7.4). The catalytic activity is first optimized through synthetic sequence variation and the structure formation properties of the peptides are characterized. Co-assembly with inactive peptide sequences enables the up- or downregulation of the catalytic activity over a dynamic range, by modulating the likelihood for substrate interaction and thus the distance of the substrate to the nucleophilic lysine at the active site. It is observed that co-assemblies with positively charged sequences increase activity, whereas negatively charged peptide sequences decrease activity. We show that the emerging field of peptide-based catalysts can be further advanced by the engineering of the catalytic domain using heterogeneous supramolecular assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A 4+3 &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Film&#8208;Based Fluorescent NO2 Sensor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel fluorescent NO2 sensor using a newl fabricated &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COF membrane. It shows ultrafast response/recovery (1.5&#160;s/2.0&#160;s), high selectivity, a 0.1&#160;ppm detection limit, and stability over 5000 tests. Its practical use is proven by real&#8208;time monitoring of vehicle exhaust and waste incineration emissions, enabled by its porous, electron&#8208;rich structure.








Abstract
Developing compact and structurally simple sensors for reliable and rapid monitoring of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) remains a challenge. In this study, we synthesized a novel &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked 4&#160;+&#160;3 covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with unique topology structure using tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethene (ETTA) and 1,3,5&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol (TP) as monomers through liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial polymerization. The sensitive NO2 response of the ETTA&#8208;TP COF membrane enables the creation of the first and high&#8208;performance NO2 film&#8208;based fluorescent sensor, achieving fastest response/recovery time (1.5 s/2.0&#160;s) and a high selectivity (over 16 potential interferents). This sensor realizes a low detection limit of 0.1&#160;ppm and a broad detection range from 0.1 to 50&#160;ppm, while maintaining stable performance over 5000 continuous tests. Furthermore, it demonstrates on&#8208;site, real&#8208;time monitoring of NO2 emissions from automotive exhaust and waste incineration. The sensing mechanism studies reveal that the carbonyl groups of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine structure can bind NO2 via electrostatic interactions and undergoes an energy&#8208;level&#8208;matching photoinduced electron transfer process under photoexcitation. The responses of other carbonyl&#8208;containing fluorescent molecules and COF materials to NO2 corroborate the generality of this mechanism. This study offers valuable insights into the development of oxidizing gas sensors characterized by fast response time, high sensitivity, and robust in situ online monitoring capabilities.

         <title>A Unique CYP450 Enzyme Unlocks Antrodia Camphorata Lanostane Triterpenoid Diversity Through Oxidation and Skeletal Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional CYP450 enzyme from Antrodia camphorata, AcCYP1, not only catalyzes the C21 and C15 oxidation of lanosterol, but also mediates a C14&#8211;C15 methyl migration to produce a rare triterpene skeleton. This finding reveals a novel enzymatic approach to expand the diversity of triterpene skeleton and facilitates the de novo heterologous synthesis of high&#8208;value lanostane triterpenoids.








Abstract
Lanostane triterpenoids, key therapeutic components of medicinal mushrooms, such as rare Antrodia camphorata, face heterologous biosynthesis barriers due to the lack of enzymes for essential C21/C15 oxidation and skeletal rearrangement, limiting access to these rare therapeutics. In this study, we deciphered these missing steps through the characterization of a single CYP450 enzyme, AcCYP1. Notably, AcCYP1 not only catalyzes the indispensable C21 and C15 oxidations, but also represents the first CYP450 enzyme identified to directly rearrange a triterpenoid backbone. This rearrangement generates the uncommon lanostane skeleton characterized by a &#916;14(15) double bond and a C15 methyl group by disrupting canonical hydroxyl rebound and triggering cation&#8208;initiated rearrangement. Mechanistically, the catalytic performance of AcCYP1 is regulated by proximal active&#8208;pocket geometry and distal hydrophobicity. Mutating the key residue N520 markedly enhanced enzymatic activity, enabling controllable yeast&#8208;based production of lanostane triterpenoids with expanded structural diversity for more efficient than conventional artificial cultivation. Collectively, this work uncovers a non&#8208;canonical route for triterpenoid structural diversification beyond oxidosqualene cyclases, establishes a systematic strategy for deciphering biosynthetic pathways, and provides scalable, sustainable access to rare natural products.

         <title>Amphiphobic Solvent&#8208;Mediated Relay Push&#8208;Escape Strategy for Highly Efficient Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphobic solvent, hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether (FE), modulates Li+ solvation via a &#8220;relay push&#8208;escape&#8221; mechanism. After adding into a 1&#160;M LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolyte, FE forces FSI&#8722; anions into the inner Li+ solvation sheath while expelling DME solvents, forming a CIP/AGG&#8208;rich structure. This confers the resulting electrolyte high ionic conductivity, a low melting point, weak solvation, and exceptional anodic/cathodic stability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries promise high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, wide operating temperature ranges, and fast charging. However, integrating these attributes remains a formidable challenge, as it necessitates an electrolyte that concurrently delivers high ionic conductivity, low solvation energy, low melting point, and the ability to form a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (EEI), a feat elusive to conventional formulations. Here, we successfully address this challenge with a &#8220;relay push&#8208;escape&#8221; strategy using amphiphobic hexafluoroisopropyl methyl ether. Its anion&#8208;repulsive Coulombic field and steric hindrance transform conventional 1&#160;M LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolyte into L4DF electrolyte, triggers a novel mechanism that drives anions into the inner Li&#8314; solvation sheaths, displacing DME solvents to form a contacted ion&#8208;pair and aggregative ion&#8208;pair&#8208;dominated structure. The resulting L4DF electrolyte facilitates rapid Li&#8314; desolvation and fosters the formation of a stable, anion&#8208;derived LiF&#8208;rich EEI. As a result, the L4DF electrolyte demonstrates exceptional compatibility with lithium&#8208;metal, showing high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li half&#8208;cell achieves 91.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and outstanding performance under 5 C fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Remarkably, a 5.52 Ah pouch&#8208;cell reaches an energy density of 502.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 while retaining 87.6% of its capacity for 260 cycles. This work paves the way for the precise design of electrolytes for advanced batteries.

         <title>Gyroid Labyrinth of Supertwisted Double Helices in a Liquid Crystal Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A side chain liquid crystal (LC) polymethylsiloxane (PMS) forms an unusual four&#8208;network gyroid (4NG) structure. In each of the two chiral subspaces, separated by the gyroid minimum surface, there are two networks of aromatic moieties instead of one. These wind around the central polysiloxane bundle, forming a double helix. Furthermore, the double helices are found to supertwist, their chiralities being opposite of those of the subspaces they occupy.








Abstract
A liquid crystal (LC) polymethylsiloxane (PMS) with rod&#8208;like aromatic side&#8208;groups attached via an alkylene spacer and bearing three n&#8208;dodecyl end&#8208;tails is found to form an unusual cubic structure. In a normal LC double gyroid (DG), the two chiral subspaces, one each side of the G&#8208;surface, are occupied by one network each. Here each such network is split into two aromatic strands that wind around the central polysiloxane bundle, forming a double helix, resulting in a four&#8208;network gyroid (4NG). While in previous normal LC DGs the network twist was assumed to follow that of the subspace, in 4NG the twist sense of the double&#8208;helix is opposite to that of the subspace., i.e., while a right&#8208;handed subspace twists by&#160;+70.5&#176; between junctions, the double&#8208;helix &#8220;supertwists&#8221; by &#8722;109.5&#176;, and the opposite is true for the left&#8208;handed subspace. Detailed analysis by X&#8208;ray diffraction, DSC, and depolarized fluorescence (DF) shows a gradual but significant reversible change in the degree of mixing between the aromatic side groups and the polysiloxane backbones at 120 &#176;C&#8211;130 &#176;C in 4NG. Also, a significant increase in the system mobility starts only at &#8764;40 &#176;C above the melting point, indicating persistence of local double&#8208;helical segments even in the melt.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A liquid crystal (LC) polymethylsiloxane (PMS) with rod-like aromatic side-groups attached via an alkylene spacer and bearing three n-dodecyl end-tails is found to form an unusual cubic structure. In a normal LC double gyroid (DG), the two chiral subspaces, one each side of the G-surface, are occupied by one network each. Here each such network is split into two aromatic strands that wind around the central polysiloxane bundle, forming a double helix, resulting in a four-network gyroid (4NG). While in previous normal LC DGs the network twist was assumed to follow that of the subspace, in 4NG the twist sense of the double-helix is opposite to that of the subspace., i.e., while a right-handed subspace twists by&#160;+70.5&#176; between junctions, the double-helix &#8220;supertwists&#8221; by &#8722;109.5&#176;, and the opposite is true for the left-handed subspace. Detailed analysis by X-ray diffraction, DSC, and depolarized fluorescence (DF) shows a gradual but significant reversible change in the degree of mixing between the aromatic side groups and the polysiloxane backbones at 120 &#176;C&#8211;130 &#176;C in 4NG. Also, a significant increase in the system mobility starts only at &#8764;40 &#176;C above the melting point, indicating persistence of local double-helical segments even in the melt.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Crown&#8208;Ether Polyimides Break the K+/Na+ Selectivity Barrier in Artificial K+ Channels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of highly selective artificial potassium channel has been developed by embedding 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 ether ionophores into a polyimide scaffold via tunable alkyl linkers, achieving a remarkable K+/Na+ selectivity of 153.2&#160;&#177;&#160;5.3 along with high K+ conductance of 36.8&#160;pS. This sets a new benchmark among synthetic channels and overcomes the classical trade&#8208;off between high ion conductance and selectivity.








Abstract
Natural potassium channels such as KcsA exhibit extraordinary K+/Na+ selectivity (&gt;1000), whereas the best biomimetic counterparts have reached only 41.3. To close this performance gap, we developed a modular design comprising three tunable components: a flexible aliphatic polyimide (PI) backbone, variable alkyl linkers (CnH2n+1, n&#160;=&#160;4&#8211;16), and ion&#8208;binding 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 units. This architecture promotes robust membrane integration via the PI scaffold and precise control of crown ether conformation and spatial arrangement through linker optimization, enabling exceptionally selective and efficient K+ transport. Of four synthesized polymer channels, three display high K+ conductance (36.8&#8211;47.0&#160;pS) &#8212;up to twice that of gramicidin A (23.2&#160;pS) &#8212;together with K+/Na+ selectivity exceeding 100. Notably, channel 4, incorporating the longest C16H33 linker, achieves an unprecedented selectivity of 153.2&#160;&#177;&#160;5.3. This synergistic combination of ultrahigh selectivity and superior conductance establishes a new benchmark for artificial potassium channels and provides a versatile platform for biomimetic membrane technologies, channel&#8208;targeted therapeutics, and biosensing applications.

         <title>Direct Air Capture and Photoconversion of CO2 to Ethylene by Defect&#8208;Tailored Cu3&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of defect&#8208;tailored Cu3&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu3&#8208;MOFs) featuring coordinatively unsaturated Cu active sites were constructed for simultaneous direct air capture and photoreduction of CO2 to ethylene, offering fundamental insights for developing advanced materials in direct air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.








Abstract
The development of efficient direct air capture (DAC) systems coupled with photocatalytic CO2 conversion is still an appealing challenge. Here, we engineered a series of defective Cu3&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Cu3&#8208;MOFs) for integrated atmospheric CO2 capture and in situ photoreduction. The defective Cu3&#8208;MOFs were constructed through selective removal of coordinated CO32&#8722; from pristine MOFs with HCl etching, generating unsaturated Cu active sites for CO2 harvesting, and the Cu3&#8208;MOFs demonstrated enhanced CO2 capture kinetics and capacity that compared to their pristine counterpart. Remarkably, the captured CO2 could be directly photoreduced to C2H4 with an optimal production rate of 18.25&#160;&#181;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 without additional photosensitizer or sacrificial agent. The experimental and theoretical results revealed that the defective sites not only facilitated CO2 adsorption but also promoted C&#8211;C coupling of *CO intermediates, thereby enhancing C2H4 production. This work provides deep insights for designing advanced materials toward direct air&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Ag12[Ge9(Hyp)2]6 An Intermetalloid Cluster with Bis&#8208;Silylated Ge9 Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of K2Ge9(Hyp)2 (Hyp&#160;=&#160;Si(SiMe3)3) with phosphine stabilized silver halides gives the new intermetalloid cluster Ag12[Ge9(Hyp)2]6 exhibiting a novel Ag12 core surrounded by six [Ge9(Hyp)2] units acting as ligands. Within the Ag12 core two different kinds of silver atoms are present underlining the intermetalloid character of the cluster. 








Abstract
We present the synthesis and characterization of the novel intermetalloid cluster compound Ag12[Ge9(Hyp)2]6, exhibiting a silver core surrounded by bis&#8208;silylated Ge9&#8208;clusters. The new intermetalloid cluster has an Ag12 metal cluster core with silver atoms in different oxidation states. To the silver core six [Ge9(Hyp)2] units are coordinated, acting as ligands. The [Ge9(Hyp)2] units are arranged octahedrally around the Ag12 core, leading to a variety of Ag&#8208;Ge bonds and contacts. The cluster is a first example of an intermetalloid cluster, exhibiting a silver core, shielded by [Ge9(Hyp)2] units.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Local Redox Reactions on Individual Ti3C2Tx MXene Flakes in Aqueous Environment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local chemistry of individual Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes and confined water are investigated by in situ Scanning Transmission X&#8208;ray Microscopy (STXM) in aqueous environment. We reveal water&#8208;induced redox reactions non&#8208;uniformly distributed over the MXene flakes upon sequential exposure to acidic and neutral aqueous solution containing alkali cations.








Abstract
Water at an interface, confined in nanopores or between layers exhibits unique structural and dynamic properties that differ significantly from bulk water. In layered 2D materials such as MXenes, intercalated water is believed to affect their surface chemistry by inducing local oxidation and contribute to redox processes during electrochemical cycling. However, the chemical nature of confined water and its interaction with MXene surface chemistry remains unclear. Here, we employ scanning transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (STXM) to investigate in situ the chemical interaction of water in individual Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes in humid and aqueous environments with &#8764;50&#160;nm spatial resolution. At the oxygen K&#8208;edge, we uncover that water trapped in pockets and wrinkles in few&#8208;layered MXene flakes has a different hydrogen bonding compared to water confined in the MXene interlayer spacing. We also reveal water&#8208;induced local redox reactions of Ti atoms non&#8208;uniformly distributed on the MXene flake upon interaction with liquid water and alkali ion neutral electrolytes, which are partly reversible upon exposure to an acidic electrolyte.

         <title>Electrochemical Azolation of Electron&#8208;rich Fluoroarenes: A Controlled Redox Chain Unlocks C&#9472;N Bond&#8208;forming e&#8208;SNAr</title>

         <dc:description>
Anodic oxidation unlocks C&#9472;N bond formation in electron&#8208;rich fluoroarenes. Spatial separation of redox events extends the lifetime of active intermediates, expands the scope of nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, and promotes a new mechanism for SNAr reactions: uphill redox catalysis. Powered by voltage control, azolation occurs quickly and selectively; reactions proceed with catalytic charge and can be easily scaled in a batch setup.








Abstract
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions are critical methods for forming C&#9472;N bonds in synthetic campaigns, but limitations in electrophile electronics restrict access to a large portion of chemical space. Photochemical oxidation of fluoroarenes has emerged as an attractive strategy to activate fluoroarenes toward nucleophilic addition, but back&#8208;electron transfer to solution&#8208;phase reduced photocatalysts limit the scope and efficiency of these methods. Herein, we describe an electrochemical strategy to overcome this obstacle by spatially separating redox events at electrode surfaces, extending the lifetime of the activated electrophile and enabling the azolation of electron&#8208;rich alkoxyfluoroarenes. Through stabilization of the oxidized product with voltage control and HFIP solvent, the reaction proceeds with catalytic charge via a proposed uphill redox chain mechanism. A wide range of electron&#8208;rich fluoroarenes and azoles are tolerated&#8212;including those with orthogonal functional group handles. The redox catalytic nature of this e&#8208;SNAr reaction enables energy and mass efficient syntheses and facile scaling in a simple batch setup.

         <title>Boron Hybridization Engineering for Regulating Room Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a series of phosphorescence films were achieved by boron hybridization engineering, with the longest phosphorescence lifetime reaching up to&#160;2.23&#160;s under ambient conditions. Notably, the formation of B&#8208;N bonds can not only reduce the vibrational of triplet excitons, but also act as stimulus&#8208;responsive sites, which undergo cleavage and formation under the stimulation of acids and bases.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have attracted widespread attention for their potential in both fundamental research and advanced technologies. However, their development is hindered by weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling and nonradiative decay. Here, we present a boron hybridization engineering strategy in which arylboronic esters are incorporated into poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine). By regulating the hybridization state of boron atoms from sp2 to sp3, the phosphorescence properties can be effectively tuned. Simultaneously, the formation of B&#8208;N bonds suppresses nonradiative decay, leading to long&#8208;lived RTP with lifetimes up to&#160;2.23&#160;s. Both experimental evidence and theoretical calculations confirm the occurrence of boron hybridization switching and its decisive role in modulating phosphorescence. Moreover, the B&#8208;N bonds exhibit acid&#8208;base responsiveness, endowing the system with dynamic phosphorescence behavior. Beyond demonstrating triplet exciton control, this work establishes a molecular design principle that may guide the creation of multifunctional organic phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Selective Intracellular Polymerization via Acrolein&#8208;Driven Cyclodimerization Cascade</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The endogenous cancer metabolite acrolein triggers a catalyst&#8208;free cyclodimerization cascade. This intracellular polymerization uses a specifically engineered monomer containing a tetraphenylethylene (TPE) unit, which generates a strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission signal. This strategy enables &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence, allowing for selective and precise imaging of malignant cells in human breast cancer tissue.








Abstract
The intracellular polymerization of synthetic macromolecules presents a unique method for modifying cell behavior, enabling real&#8208;time imaging, and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness. However, most current strategies rely on external catalysts or non&#8208;physiological triggers, often lacking target&#8208;cell specificity. Here, we report a cancer&#8208;selective intracellular cyclodimerization cascade polymerization driven solely by endogenous acrolein, an oncometabolite overproduced in malignant cells. Acrolein plays dual roles as a polymerization initiator through imine formation and as a structural component of the resulting polymer. We designed a meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bis(2&#8208;aminoethanol) monomer that incorporates an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active tetraphenylethylene unit. In acrolein&#8208;rich cancer cells, condensation between the aminoethanol groups and acrolein generates imines, which then undergo a spontaneous, catalyst&#8208;free cyclodimerization cascade, yielding eight&#8208;membered 1,5&#8208;diazacyclooctane polymers that embed native acrolein. This polymerization triggers robust AIE fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221;, facilitating high&#8208;contrast imaging of malignant cells with minimal background in healthy cells. We demonstrated selective fluorescence in multiple cancer cell lines and applied this platform to freshly resected human breast tumor samples, showing its utility for rapid intraoperative assessment. This strategy establishes a versatile toolkit for precision diagnostics, engineered intracellular materials, and next&#8208;generation therapeutics.

         <title>Promoting Electro&#8208;Hydrogenation of Hydrophobic Benzofuran over Pd&#8208;Based Catalyst in Aqueous Media via Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient electro&#8208;hydrogenation of benzofuran (BF) is demonstrated with a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;83.7% towards 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (DHBF) over a Pd&#8208;based catalyst involving water as hydrogen source. As verified, the auxiliary electrolyte (AE) mediates the formation of interfacial water, which lowers the reaction barrier and hence facilitates the BF hydrogenation.








Abstract
The electro&#8208;hydrogenation of benzofuran (BF) has been considered as a promising route for the selective synthesis of 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (DHBF), a valuable motif prevalent in agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. However, the aqueous hydrogenation of hydrophobic BF has rarely been investigated, probably due to intense competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, taking Pd nanoparticles anchored on carboxylated carbon nanotube (Pd@c&#8208;CNT) as a model catalyst, we demonstrate a highly selective BF hydrogenation to DHBF under aqueous acidic conditions, yielding DHBF Faradaic efficiency (FEDHBF) of approximately 50%. It is found that incorporating tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as an auxiliary electrolyte (AE) can further enhance the FEDHBF up to 83.7%. In situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) combined with theoretical calculations reveals that the hydrated TBA+ cation promotes the formation of interfacial water on the hydrophobic cathode surface, thereby lowering the reaction barrier and facilitating BF hydrogenation. A series of electrolyses using deuterated and/or non&#8208;deuterated electrolytes verifies that the water dissociation at the counter electrode (anode) serves as the primary proton source for the BF hydrogenation.

         <dc:description>
Iodine(I) triggers an unusual 4&#8208;endo cyclization of &#945;&#8208;bicyclobutanyl alcohols and amines, enabling rapid access to 2&#8208;oxa&#8208; and 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes. This strain&#8208;release rearrangement proceeds under mild conditions via an iodonium&#8208;induced carbocation and tolerates diverse substituents, providing a versatile platform for constructing heteroatom&#8208;containing BCH scaffolds.








Abstract
Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane (BCB) has been widely explored as a scaffold for constructing 3D bioisosteres of benzene, owing to its olefin&#8208;like reactivity and ability to undergo cycloaddition reactions. Herein, we report that BCB derivatives bearing &#946;&#8208;positioned hydroxyl or tosylamino groups (i.e., &#945;&#8208;BCB alcohols or amines) undergo an unusual iodine(I)&#8208;mediated 4&#8208;endo cyclization to afford 2&#8208;oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and 2&#8208;azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs). This strategy addresses a major limitation of prior BCHs synthesis, which typically require substrates tethered to carbonyl groups or aromatic rings to enable electronic polarization or photo&#8208;excitability. By circumventing this requirement, our method significantly broadens the range of substituents that can be incorporated into the BCH framework. Additionally, the transformation features practical advantages, including straightforward one&#8208;step substrate preparation, mild reaction conditions, and rapid kinetics&#8212;often completing within minutes. Mechanistic studies suggest that the 4&#8208;endo cyclization proceeds via an iodonium&#8208;induced carbocation intermediate, which is intramolecularly trapped by the nucleophilic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NHTs group.

Herein, we report that BCB derivatives bearing &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-positioned hydroxyl or tosylamino groups (i.e., &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-BCB alcohols or amines) undergo an unusual iodine(I)-mediated 4-endo cyclization to afford 2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes and 2-azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs). This strategy addresses a major limitation of prior BCHs synthesis, which typically require substrates tethered to carbonyl groups or aromatic rings to enable electronic polarization or photo-excitability. By circumventing this requirement, our method significantly broadens the range of substituents that can be incorporated into the BCH framework. Additionally, the transformation features practical advantages, including straightforward one-step substrate preparation, mild reaction conditions, and rapid kinetics&#8212;often completing within minutes. Mechanistic studies suggest that the 4-endo cyclization proceeds via an iodonium-induced carbocation intermediate, which is intramolecularly trapped by the nucleophilic &#9472;OH or &#9472;NHTs group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Conductivity Argyrodite Electrolyte with Self&#8208;Passivating Stability for Single&#8208;Electrolyte All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

A novel Li5.5P0.94Ta0.06S4.5Cl0.75Br0.75 electrolyte was designed via dual&#8208;halide (Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;) occupation and Ta5+ substitution, achieving high ionic conductivity and long&#8208;term stability with both high&#8208;nickel cathodes and lithium metal anodes. Consequently, a high&#8208;energy, stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery was successfully constructed using this single electrolyte. 








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their enhanced safety and energy density. Among solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5X compounds offer economic advantages but suffer from limited ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, we design a novel SSE, Li5.5P0.94Ta0.06S4.5Cl0.75Br0.75, featuring dual halide (Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;) occupation and Ta5+ substitution to enhance conductivity and interfacial compatibility. The resulting SSE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 12 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Inspired by Al corrosion passivation, it forms in situ self&#8208;passivating interfacial layers, ensuring stability against both lithium metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes. Batteries incorporating this electrolyte achieved 100% capacity retention over 200 cycles at 0.2C, and over 81% retention after 1200 cycles at 0.5C. Under high&#8208;loading (30&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) and N/P&#160;=&#160;1.8 conditions, 81% capacity was maintained after 150 cycles. A 10&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;cm2 pouch cell retained 96.4% of its capacity after 200 cycles. This work offers a viable route toward high&#8208;performance, scalable ASSLBs using a single&#8208;passivating electrolyte.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2] Annulations of &#945;&#8208;Allyl &#947;&#8208;Benzyl Allenoates via a Transannular Cyclization Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of &#945;&#8208;allyl &#947;&#8208;benzyl allenoates, catalyzed by chiral spiro phosphines via an intramolecular and transannular cyclization relay, has been developed. This strategy enables the efficient synthesis of a variety of chiral bicyclo[3.2.0]heptenes bearing three contiguous stereocenters, delivering good yields and excellent stereoselectivities.








Abstract
Fused cyclobutane frameworks are valuable scaffolds in natural products and pharmaceuticals, yet catalytic asymmetric methods for their construction remain rare due to ring strain and stereocontrol challenges. Here, we report a spiro phosphine&#8208;catalyzed, stereoconvergent, and enantioselective [2&#160;+&#160;2] annulation of racemic &#945;&#8208;allyl &#947;&#8208;benzyl allenoates via transannular cyclization, efficiently delivering bicyclo[3.2.0]heptenes in high yields and excellent enantioselectivity. Experimental studies and DFT calculations indicate a stepwise mechanism involving seven&#8208;membered zwitterion formation, dynamic kinetic resolution through reversible nucleophilic addition, and a rate&#8208; and enantioselectivity&#8208;determining deprotonation via intramolecular hydrogen transfer. This protocol offers a concise and general approach to enantioenriched fused cyclobutanes, expanding synthetic options for drug discovery.

         <title>Bifunctional Photoactive Chiral Ligands Enable Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;O Coupling</title>

Photoactive chiral ligands: A family of bifunctional photoactive chiral ligands (CzPyox) have been designed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of heterobiaryl triflates and carboxylic acids via kinetic resolution (KR), exhibiting superior catalytic performance than the combination of chiral ligands and photosensitizers. Mechanistic studies reveal that incorporating carbazole (Cz) groups into the pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) scaffold significantly enhances visible&#8208;light absorption, thereby promoting the photoinduced reductive elimination step.








Abstract
Asymmetric metallaphotoredox catalysis (AMPC) typically relies on dual catalytic systems that often suffer from incompatibility between the photocatalytic and chiral metal catalytic cycles. Current strategies based on bifunctional chiral photoactive catalysts, while promising, are generally substrate&#8208;specific and metal&#8208;dependent. Therefore, the rational design of novel bifunctional photoactive chiral catalysts capable of promoting efficient enantioselective transformations remains an important yet challenging goal. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of new bifunctional photoactive chiral ligands by incorporating carbazole (Cz) groups into a pyridine&#8208;oxazoline (Pyox) scaffold. This two&#8208;in&#8208;one design not only enhances the light&#8208;harvesting ability of the ligands but also enables more efficient intramolecular through&#8208;bond electron/energy transfer. Using these ligands, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven, enantioselective Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;O cross&#8208;coupling of heterobiaryls with diverse carboxylic acids was realized via a kinetic resolution (KR) process. The protocol proceeds under mild conditions with broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance, affording a wide range of atropisomeric heterobiaryl esters and enantioenriched triflates in high yields and enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies reveal that the incorporation of Cz groups into the Pyox ligand significantly enhances visible&#8208;light absorption, thereby promoting an efficient Ni(0)/Ni(II)/Ni(0) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Blue&#8211;Green&#8211;Yellow Thermochromic Fluorescence and Bubble&#8208;Propelled Crystal Motion Driven by Molecular Gear Rotations</title>

         <dc:description>
A nonporous organic solvate crystal displays gear&#8208;driven two&#8208;step transformations, releasing guests and reorganizing packing to yield a vivid blue &#8594; green &#8594; yellow fluorescence sequence, coupled with bubble&#8208;propelled crystal motion.








Abstract
Guest&#8208;release induced responsive behaviors in nonporous organic solvate crystals remain elusive due to the lack of well&#8208;defined diffusion pathways and the rarity of crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transitions. Here, we report a pentiptycene&#8208;derived nonporous organic solvate (1B) that exhibits a striking blue &#8594; green &#8594; yellow thermochromic fluorescence sequence through a two&#8208;stage crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformation. In the first stage, subtle gear&#8208;like rotations transiently open a zigzag diffusion pathway, releasing dichloromethane (DCM) and generating a green&#8208;emissive phase (1G). In silicone oil, asymmetric bubble evolution during DCM release drives directional crystal propulsion. A second heating step triggers a &#8764;90&#176; correlated gear rotation that reconfigures alkyl conformation and anthracene packing, producing excimer&#8208;based yellow emission (1Y). These coupled sequential optical, mechanical, and structural responses reveal a unique paradigm of guest&#8208;driven dynamics in nonporous solvate crystals.

An intramolecular Mannich reaction (A/B/E/F rings) and intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions (C/D rings) afforded a cage&#8208;like hexacyclic core skeleton of denudatine alkaloids. Derivatization of the hexacyclic intermediate enabled the first asymmetric total syntheses of four denudatine alkaloids: (&#8211;)&#8208;cochlearenine, (&#8211;)&#8208;macrocentrine, (&#8211;)&#8208;dictizine, and (&#8211;)&#8208;15&#8208;veratroyl&#8208;17&#8208;acetyl&#8208;19&#8208;oxodictizine (see scheme).








Abstract
The first asymmetric total syntheses of four denudatine alkaloids, cochlearenine, macrocentrine, dictizine, and 15&#8208;veratroyl&#8208;17&#8208;acetyl&#8208;19&#8208;oxodictizine, along with the asymmetric synthesis of the proposed structure of acochlearine, were accomplished in a divergent manner. Highly fused tetracyclic skeletons (A/B/E/F rings) with different N&#8208;alkyl groups (Me and Et) were constructed by Br&#248;nsted acid promoted intramolecular Mannich reactions. The bicyclo[2.2.2]octane C/D rings were constructed via two&#8208;fold intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. By utilizing these key processes, the common intermediates, possessing the complex cage&#8208;like hexacyclic skeleton, were constructed. From these common intermediates, the four denudatine alkaloids were synthesized through late&#8208;stage, chemo&#8208; and stereoselective modifications around the A/C rings. The spectroscopic data of the proposed structure of acochlearine were inconsistent with those of natural acochlearine.

         <title>18F&#8208;Radiopharmaceutical Diversification Enabled by Deaminative Cross&#8208;Electrophile Couplings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general Ni&#8208;mediated (C)sp2&#8211;(C)sp3 cross&#8208;coupling expedites access to 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals, essential for positron emission tomography imaging and drug discovery. This late&#8208;stage diversification approach was implemented across three user&#8208;friendly automated protocols affording 18F&#8208;radiotracers in sufficient quantities for imaging. Tailored high&#8208;throughput experimentation rapidly discovers radiochemically applicable reaction conditions.








Abstract
The development of 18F&#8208;labelled radiotracers is of vital importance for (pre)clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and to guide drug discovery campaigns. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches often require labour&#8208;intensive preparation of highly functionalised radiolabelling precursors. This bottleneck impedes analogue generation for optimal imaging and exploration of radiochemical space. To this end, we disclose a nickel&#8208;mediated aryl (C)sp2&#8208;(C)sp3 cross&#8208;coupling with amine&#8208;derived alkyl 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium salts as coupling partners amenable to radiosynthesis. The method was applied to primary and secondary 2,4,6&#8208;triphenylpyridinium salts in radiochemical conversion (RCC) up to 86% and a high&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) assay proved crucial for expedient ligand evaluation. A late&#8208;stage diversification case study from a sole precursor achieved six 18F&#8208;labelled GSK&#8208;3 kinase inhibitor analogues, one being prepared in up to gigabecquerel (GBq) quantities in a (semi)automated two&#8208;step protocol applied across three commercial radiosynthesis platforms.

         <title>Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Electrocatalytic Halogen&#8208;Mediated Ethylene Oxidation in Seawater by Metallophthalocyanine&#8208;Based COFs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work successfully achieved efficient halogen&#8208;mediated electrocatalytic ethylene oxidation reaction (EOR) by piperazine&#8208;linked metal&#8208;phthalocyanine based covalent organic framework catalysts, achieved the efficient oxidative conversion of ethylene into chloroethanol with FE&#160;=&#160;81.3% then obtained EG with 70% yield. Furthermore, the efficient electrosynthesis of bromoethanol with FE&#160;=&#160;76.5% was then achieved, and successfully obtained EC with 90% yield. DFT calculations revealed the key intermediates during the EOR process.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic strategy to convert ethylene (C2H4) into high value&#8208;added chemicals has great potential for C2H4 utilization. The halogen&#8208;mediated indirect electrocatalytic ethylene oxidation reactions (EOR) offer an attractive strategy for C2H4 conversion while still challenging. In this work, we rationally designed a series of highly crystalline and stable metallophthalocyanine covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for EORs. Among these COFs, NiPc&#8208;TABQ COF achieved maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 81.3% for 2&#8208;chloroethanol, and CoPc&#8208;TABQ COF demonstrated exceptional EOR activity with FE of 76.5% for 2&#8208;bromoethanol, which showed one of the best performances among previous reports. More importantly, this process was capable of being driven by solar energy through photovoltaic (PV) integration and natural seawater as electrolyte and source of chlorine thus achieved the efficient chlorine&#8208;mediated EOR. Furthermore, the yield ClCH2CH2OH and BrCH2CH2OH tandemly converted into higher value&#8208;added chemicals including ethylene glycol and ethylene carbonate, achieving conversion rate of 70% and 90%, respectively. Mechanistic insights were elucidated through in situ experimental analyses and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the halogen&#8208;mediated processes. This work firstly realized the efficient EOR by COFs, also achieved solar energy driven and seawater electrolyte based green electrocatalysis for the first time, demonstrating their great potential in sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Hyperfluorescence Blue OLEDs via TADF Sensitizers with Very Short Delayed Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;efficiency and stable hyperfluorescence blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode has been designed with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0% and a long lifetime of 175.4&#160;h by employing a thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitizer, which exhibits a rapid rate of reverse intersystem crossing approaching 107 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hyperfluorescence blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are promising for fabricating pure organic blue devices with high efficiency and color purity by employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers and multiple&#8208;resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters. However, developing blue TADF sensitizers with the rate of reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC) over 107 s&#8722;1 remains a challenge. In this work, a blue TADF sensitizer with kRISC of 9.71&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 has been designed by regulating the energy levels of the excited states and enhancing the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect. v&#8208;DABNA is further doped to fabricate the hyperfluorescence device, which exhibits a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 31.0% and a long operational lifetime of 175.4&#160;h. The results reveal the significance of kRISC and pave the way for designing blue TADF sensitizers and hyperfluorescence devices.

         <title>Beyond Solution Processing: Vacuum Evaporation of Carbazole&#8208;Phosphonic Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Enables Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;25.4% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce the vacuum evaporation technique to deposit compact self&#8208;assembled molecule (SAM) layers on flexible substrates and establish the relevant molecular structure&#8211;property relationships. Benefiting from the optimized interfacial properties, small&#8208;area (0.09&#160;cm2) flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 25.47%, while large&#8208;area devices (1.04&#160;cm2) also deliver a high efficiency of 24.08%.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality and uniform self&#8208;assembled molecule (SAM) films are critical for the controllable fabrication of high&#8208;performance inverted flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). However, solution&#8208;processed SAMs suffer from poor surface coverage and inadequate chemical anchoring on conducting substrates, especially for flexible substrates with high roughness, compromising the charge transport efficiency and device stability. Herein, we introduce thermal evaporation for depositing carbazole&#8208;phosphonic SAM films and establish the correlations between molecular configurations and surface properties. Vacuum&#8208;evaporated SAMs exhibit enhanced substrate coverage and surface wettability compared to solution&#8208;processed counterparts through the regulated molecular packing. The increased surface energy of vacuum&#8208;evaporated SAM films accelerates perovskite nucleation kinetics, balances growth rates across the films, and optimizes interfacial contact quality. Molecular configuration tailoring in the SAM backbones further refines the morphological quality and energetic alignment at the buried interface, thus promoting efficient charge transport and reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. As a result, the optimized devices using vacuum&#8208;evaporated SAM films achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.47% (certified 25.38%), among the highest PCEs reported for F&#8208;PSCs. Furthermore, the optimized devices demonstrate enhanced mechanical durability and operational stability, underscoring a practical methodology route toward efficient and stable F&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Switching CO2 Electroreduction Pathways via Polyvinylpyrrolidone&#8208;Mediated Water Configuration Control</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace amounts of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are introduced into the electrolyte to precisely reconfigure interfacial water, enabling reversible switching between CH4 and C2+ products during CO2 electroreduction. Mechanistic studies reveal that PVP modulates K+ hydration and hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, offering a universal molecular&#8208;level strategy to steer electrocatalytic pathways.








Abstract
The water configuration plays a critical role in steering the CO2 electroreduction pathway, yet achieving precise control over water arrangement remains a significant challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into 3&#160;M KCl enables targeted control over the CO2 electroreduction product distribution by simply adjusting the PVP concentration. Using a Cu19CeOx (molar ratio of Cu:Ce&#160;=&#160;19:1) electrode, in the absence of PVP, multicarbon (C2+) products dominate, but substantial CO and H2 are also generated, with negligible CH4 formation. Remarkably, the addition of just 25&#160;ppm PVP shifts the primary product to CH4, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.4% at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Further increasing the PVP concentration to 125&#160;ppm switches the dominant product back to C2+, with an impressive FE of 90.8% at 800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This trend is consistent across various Cu&#8208;based catalysts, highlighting the universality of this approach. Mechanistic studies reveal that PVP reconstructs the water configuration at the cathode surface, modulating not only the adsorption strength and coverage of *CO intermediates but also the kinetics of water dissociation, thereby dictating the reaction pathway.

         <title>H+/OH&#8722; Switchable Coordination Chemistry Enables Sustainable and Selective Critical Metal Recovery from Spent Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a H+/OH&#8722; switchable coordination chemistry mechanism for highly efficient and selective recovery of critical metals from spent LIB. H+&#8208;rich K4Fe(CN)6 triggers efficient Li+ leaching from LIBs, and the transition metals selectively precipitate as KxH2&#8722;xMFe(CN)6 (M&#160;=&#160;Fe, Mn, Co, Ni). Subsequent OH&#8722;&#8208;rich basic solution treatment enables the stepwise recovery of transition metals as oxides/hydroxides, followed by regeneration of K4Fe(CN)6.








Abstract
Sustainable end&#8208;of&#8208;life management of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for minimizing environmental impact and enhancing supply chain resilience. Here, we present a novel H+/OH&#8722; switchable reversible coordination chemistry mechanism that utilizes a cost&#8208;effective, recyclable K4Fe(CN)6 aqueous solution for highly efficient and selective recovery of critical metals from various spent LIB cathodes. Under H+&#8208;rich acidic conditions, the LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode demonstrates a high Li leaching efficiency of 96.57%, while cobalt selectively reacts with K4Fe(CN)6 to precipitate as K0.5H1.5CoFe(CN)6&#183;H2O. Subsequent OH&#8722;&#8208;rich base treatment facilitates the stepwise recovery of cobalt from K0.5H1.5CoFe(CN)6&#183;H2O to form CoOOH, achieving a 95.18% recovery efficiency and K4Fe(CN)6 regeneration. In situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy reveal the dynamic crystal structural evolution and reversible coordination chemistry between Co&#9472;O bonding in LiCoO2/CoOOH and Co&#9472;N bonding in K0.5H1.5CoFe(CN)6&#183;H2O, driven by the H+/OH&#8722; pair in the K4Fe(CN)6 solution. This strategy is applicable for recovering critical metals from a wide range of LIBs cathodes (e.g., NCMs, LFP), offering significant techno&#8208;economic and environmental benefits, and lays the foundation for sustainable critical metals recycling from urban minerals beyond spent LIBs.

         <dc:description>
Molecular solar thermal storage (MOST) systems have recently regained great interest after a period of intense research around five decades ago. This perspective clarifies the nomenclature, and introduces the term &#8220;mostophore&#8221; for molecular entities that harvest and store light energy as heat. It revisits practical system requirements and provides a historical perspective with future prospects. 








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal storage (MOST) systems have gained increasing attention in the past years after an intense initial exploration phase around five decades ago. Over time multiple terms have been circulating in the literature, such as solar thermal fuels or solar thermal batteries. Besides clarifying the nomenclature, we introduce the term &#8220;mostophore&#8221; as a molecular entity able to harvest and store light energy in the form of heat. Furthermore, we revisit the requirements for practical systems and put the concept in a historic perspective with a future outlook.

         <title>Activation of Cyanate Anions by Phosphine Radical Cations Enables Formal Hydrocarbamoylation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalytic formal hydrocarbamoylation reaction that employs a cyanate anion as the C1 source and provides N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products from activated alkenes is described. Mechanistic investigations suggest generation of a phosphoranyl radical by addition of the cyanate anion to a phosphine radical cation, which enables the delivery of the carbamoyl group across alkenes.








Abstract
Catalytic methods that enable functionalization of alkenes with radical intermediates generated from common feedstock chemicals are valuable in synthetic chemistry. In this study, we disclose a photocatalytic formal hydrocarbamoylation strategy for preparation of N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane products from activated alkenes through isocyanate&#8208;derived phosphoranyl radicals. Mechanistic investigations suggest generation of the phosphoranyl radical by addition of a cyanate anion to a phosphine radical cation and provide support for its reactivity through the isocyanate moiety. This redox&#8208;neutral method enables hydrofunctionalization of diverse alkenylarene and electron&#8208;deficient alkene substrates containing sensitive groups such as epoxide, unactivated alkene, amine, or electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles. The synthetic versatility of the N&#8208;acyl iminophosphorane functionality is demonstrated through one&#8208;step conversion to other valuable nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups.

         <title>Boosting Magnesium Storage Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polyimide Cathodes Through Synergistic Molecular and Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;electrolyte co&#8208;design strategy coupling &#960;&#8208;conjugated polyimides with tailored magnesium electrolytes is proposed to achieve fast, durable Mg2+ storage. The chloride&#8208;free Mg[B(hfip)4]2 system enables a reversible enolization redox (C&#9552;O &#8652; C&#9472;O&#8722;/[C&#9472;O&#8722;]2Mg2+), while the &#960;&#8208;stacked NUPI framework ensures efficient Mg2+ transport, delivering a high capacity of 175 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultralow fading (&#8764;0.05% per cycle) even after 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) offer the promise of low cost, intrinsic safety, and high volumetric energy density, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of cathodes capable of reversible Mg2+ storage and by cathode&#8211;electrolyte incompatibilities. Here, we demonstrate that coupling molecularly engineered polyimide (PI) cathodes with tailored electrolyte speciation enables fast and durable Mg storage. Two PIs, poly(naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride&#8208;urea imide) (NUPI) and poly(perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride&#8208;urea imide) (PUPI), with analogous backbones but distinct degrees of &#960;&#8208;conjugation were systematically evaluated in both chloride&#8208;containing and chloride&#8208;free electrolytes. Systematic studies indicate that chloride&#8208;free electrolytes, characterized by weakly coordinating anions, enable reversible enolization (C&#9552;O &#8652; C&#9472;O&#8722;/[C&#9472;O&#8722;]2Mg2+) while suppressing side reactions. Additionally, NUPI, featuring stronger &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking and more ordered layered structures, facilitates Mg2+ transport and interfacial charge transfer. When combined with a graphene oxide&#8208;modified separator, the NUPI cathode delivers 175&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and exhibits ultralow capacity fading (&#8776;0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1). Operando/ex situ spectroscopy analyses and theoretical calculations further confirm the enolization&#8208;dominated redox mechanism. This work establishes a molecular&#8208;electrolyte co&#8208;design paradigm for high&#8208;rate, durable MMBs based on carbonyl polymer chemistry.

         <title>Energy Interception&#8208;Enhanced Ultrasound&#8208;Induced Luminescence Enables Efficient Anticancer Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PFPV@HBA&#8208;NPs ultrasound&#8208;induced luminescence nanoreporter convert ultrasonic mechanical energy into reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated luminescence through piezocatalysis and ROS interception, enabling real&#8208;time quantification of therapeutic responses. Upon ultrasonic excitation, the nanoreporter induces tumor cell death via oxidative and inflammatory cascades, while luminescence intensity correlates with therapeutic efficiency, offering precise and controllable cancer treatment.








Abstract
Ultrasound&#8208;induced luminescence (UIL) imaging uses the ultrasound mechanical force to trigger luminescence from different materials within tissue, offering improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and imaging depth compared with traditional fluorescence imaging. However, some obstacles hinder this technique, including the limited available molecules, ambiguous mechanism and low luminescence intensity. Herein, we expand the types of UIL molecules to include several phthalocyanines and semiconductor polymers. We demonstrate that these molecules enable convert ultrasound fluctuations into reactive oxygen species (ROS) through piezocatalysis. Subsequently, ROS oxidize unsaturated bonds in molecules for transducing chemical energy into photons, during which energy conversion and utilization efficiency dictating resultant luminescence intensity. Capitalizing on this mechanism, we further design energy interception strategy by employing substrates with heightened reactivity toward ROS, enabling efficient capture of the chemical energy stored in ROS and a 78.7&#8208;fold increase in UIL intensity. ROS generated under ultrasonic excitation not only induce luminescence but also damage tumor cells through synergistic oxidation and inflammatory cascade activation, implicating a correlation between luminescence intensity and cell death. Consequently, our enhanced UIL system provides an accurate, real&#8208;time reporter for ROS generation under ultrasonic excitation and establishes a reliable platform for monitoring and evaluating tumor therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>Taming of Low&#8208;Valent Arsenic Compounds and Transfer of Nascent As2 Facilitated by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) stabilized arsenic compounds with formal oxidation numbers at As of&#160;+1, 0, and&#160;&#8722;1 are presented. A stable FLP&#8208;chelated complex of As2 was prepared which undergoes the light&#8208;induced release of nascent diarsenic, As2nasc, which reveals clean triple&#8208;bond type reactivity with dienes and metal&#8208;metal bonds under mild conditions






.

Abstract
The first examples of frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;stabilized compounds with formal oxidation states of arsenic ranging from &#8722;1 to&#160;+1 have been synthesized. These chelates include the metalated arsinidenyl As(&#9472;I) anion in FLP{As&#9472;K} (1), which provides access to the parent FLP&#8208;stabilized arsinidene, As(+I)&#9472;H, in FLP{As&#9472;H} (3), and a diatomic arsenic(0) allotrope within FLP{As&#9472;As}FLP (5). Irradiation of the As2 complex 5 represents an unprecedented method for the generation of nascent diarsenic, As2nasc, which shows triple&#8208;bond like reactivity with a diene and selective As2 unit insertion into metal&#8208;metal bonds under mild conditions.

         <title>Molding of Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 Particles Based on Regulating Li+ Transport for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a size gradient design for Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5&#160;that achieves fast and uniform Li+ transport. Specifically, the influence of transmission continuity and interface quantity on Li+ transport is confirmed. Then, the control of interfaces to regulate Li+ flux is confirmed through finite element analysis and characterization results. This design suppresses interface side reactions and dendrite, providing new insights into promoting pure Li metal as the anode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLBs) are coming with sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolytes (S&#8208;SSEs) for superior Li+ conductivity, but irregular particles and interfaces lead to disorder Li+ flux in S&#8208;SSEs that hinder pure Li as an anode. Specially, its mesoscopic structure cannot be adequately described by average size, making it difficult to analyze Li+ flux effectively. Herein, a model is constructed on the molding of Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 (LPSC) particles and defined size as the number (N) and consistency (&#963;) to evaluate their effects on Li+ transfer and concentration uniformity. Through machine learning of calculation data (Li+ concentration with N and &#963;) and experimental results, excessive interfaces can hinder Li+ transport and local aggregation of irregular interfaces leads to uneven ion transport. Therefore, a particle size gradient S&#8208;SSEs (induced by different size LPSC particles) is predicted to achieve fast and uniform Li+ transport. Subsequently, this designed S&#8208;SSE is applied in ASSLBs, which can complete a 1000 h cycle with capacity retention exceeding 80%. This study elucidates that the long cycle ASSLBs can be achieved by adjusting the molding of LPSC particles. Specifically, it demonstrates that the Li+ flux of the whole S&#8208;SSEs can be optimized through gradient size design.

&lt;p&gt;We propose a size gradient design for Li&lt;sub&gt;5.5&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;4.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;that achieves fast and uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Specifically, the influence of transmission continuity and interface quantity on Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is confirmed. Then, the control of interfaces to regulate Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux is confirmed through finite element analysis and characterization results. This design suppresses interface side reactions and dendrite, providing new insights into promoting pure Li metal as the anode for all-solid-state batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state Li metal batteries (ASSLBs) are coming with sulfide solid-state electrolytes (S-SSEs) for superior Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity, but irregular particles and interfaces lead to disorder Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux in S-SSEs that hinder pure Li as an anode. Specially, its mesoscopic structure cannot be adequately described by average size, making it difficult to analyze Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux effectively. Herein, a model is constructed on the molding of Li&lt;sub&gt;5.5&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;4.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt; (LPSC) particles and defined size as the number (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;) and consistency (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;) to evaluate their effects on Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer and concentration uniformity. Through machine learning of calculation data (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;) and experimental results, excessive interfaces can hinder Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and local aggregation of irregular interfaces leads to uneven ion transport. Therefore, a particle size gradient S-SSEs (induced by different size LPSC particles) is predicted to achieve fast and uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport. Subsequently, this designed S-SSE is applied in ASSLBs, which can complete a 1000 h cycle with capacity retention exceeding 80%. This study elucidates that the long cycle ASSLBs can be achieved by adjusting the molding of LPSC particles. Specifically, it demonstrates that the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux of the whole S-SSEs can be optimized through gradient size design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Photopyroelectric Catalysis for Immunoactivation/Ferroptosis Combined Therapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time propose a novel concept of photothermal&#8208;pyroelectric cascade catalysis (photopyroelectric catalysis) to circumvent a trade&#8208;off between narrow bandgap (long wavelength of NIR&#8208;II) and high redox potential, and engineer a new type of photopyroelectric ZnS:Cu nanoparticles, realizing high efficacy of NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven catalytical H2 generation and glutathione depletion for immunoactivation/ferroptosis combined tumor therapy.








Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light is desired to drive photocatalytic therapy owing to its high tissue penetrability and operationality, but the efficiency of direct NIR&#8208;II&#8208;photocatalytic H2 generation is negligible owing to a trade&#8208;off between narrow semiconductor bandgap and high redox potential. Here, this work proposes a new concept of photothermal&#8208;pyroelectric cascade catalysis (photopyroelectric catalysis) to circumvent the trade&#8208;off for enhanced NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven catalytic efficiency, and develop a novel kind of multifunctional ZnS:Cu nanoparticles with a wide bandgap (2.7&#160;eV) and high NIR&#8208;II&#8208;photothermal (52.4%) and pyroelectric efficiencies (0.44 mC m&#8722;2 K&#8722;1), realizing high efficacy of NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;driven catalytical H2 generation (8.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Under NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, intratumoral ZnS:Cu nanoparticles locally utilize thermal energy during both photothermal heating and natural cooling for pyroelectrocatalytic H2 generation and oxidative depletion of intratumorally overexpressed glutathione, which induce tumor immunoactivation and ferroptosis, respectively, achieving high&#8208;efficacy synergetic therapy of tumor. This work opens an avenue for exploiting NIR&#8208;II light for efficient catalysis in the fields of both solar energy and catalytic medicine.

         <title>Thermodynamic and Kinetic Separation Within a Flexible Hydrogen Bonded Organic Framework for Ternary Benzene/Cyclohexene/Cyclohexane Mixture</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;112a can separate Bz/CHE/CHA ternary mixture into three pure components (99.9%) by tuning temperature in one column, with yields of 1.05, 0.46, and 0.31&#160;mmol&#183;g&#8722;1 for Bz, CHE, and CHA.








Abstract
The separation of benzene (Bz), cyclohexene (CHE), and cyclohexane (CHA) is crucial in the petrochemical industry but remains highly challenging due to their similar boiling points and molecular kinetic sizes. Herein, we report HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;112a, a flexible HOF material constructed from self&#8208;assembled &#960;&#8208;pillars with suitable and adaptive one&#8208;dimensional channels (3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;6.0&#160;&#197;), for thermodynamic and kinetic separation of Bz, CHE, and CHA ternary mixture. Specifically, HOF&#8208;FJU&#8208;112a is capable of thermodynamically separating Bz/CHA and CHE/CHA, while kinetically separating Bz/CHE, simultaneously leading to a complete separation of the Bz/CHE/CHA ternary mixture. Breakthrough and elution experiments confirm efficient binary and ternary separation, including complete resolution of Bz/CHE/CHA mixtures into three pure components (99.9%) in one single column, with the outstanding breakthrough yield. This study demonstrates a new design paradigm for multifunctional HOFs and affirms their promise in challenging C6 hydrocarbon separations.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Squaramine Macrocycles as Molecular Sieves for Selective Halogen Separation and Aromatic Bromination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally tunable squaramine [2+2] macrocycles act as the first purely organic molecular sieves for selective bromine capture over iodine, combining high uptake, total I2 exclusion, and remarkable stability. The bromine&#8208;loaded crystals further function as safe, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle solid reagents enabling efficient aromatic bromination under mild conditions.








Abstract
Selective separation of bromine (Br2) from iodine (I2) remains a fundamental bottleneck in industrial halogen separation and applied bromination chemistry. A safe, efficient, and selective Br2 supply is indispensable for large&#8208;scale transformations and product purity, yet separation is complicated by their comparable kinetic diameters (3.5 and 4.0 &#197;, respectively) and strong tendency to form interhalogen species. Conventional capture technologies remain hindered by limited stability, low capacity, and poor selectivity. Here, structurally tunable squaramine&#8208;based [2+2] macrocycles with intrinsic cavity diameters (&#8764;3.5 &#197;) are introduced as efficient and selective molecular sieves. The pristine squaramine [2+2] macrocycle achieves high Br2 uptake of 4.9 g.g&#8722;1 from cyclohexane solution and 5.7 g.g&#8722;1 in the vapor phase, while its hydrochloride derivative ([2+2].HCl) displays substantial Br2 uptake (4.3 g.g&#8722;1 cyclohexane, 3.0 g.g&#8722;1 in vapor) and completely excludes I2 even under concentrated mixed&#8208;halogen conditions. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed a chloride&#8208;to&#8208;bromide exchange mechanism stabilizing unique polybromide species, further supported by UV&#8211;vis, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and metadynamics simulations. These findings establish squaramine [2+2] as the first macrocyclic molecular sieves for selective Br2 capture and total I2 rejection, offering robust and scalable platforms for halogen separation, environmental remediation, and safe, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle Br2 reservoirs for selective catalytic and synthetic bromination processes.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Diketopiperazine Alkaloids via Divergent C3&#8211;N1' and C3&#8211;C5' Bond Anchor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We disclosed an aniline&#8208;regulated oxidative coupling strategy to achieve customizable chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereocontrol for diverse C3&#8208;connected diketopiperazine alkaloid syntheses, as exemplified by the divergent synthesis of (+)&#8208;tetratryptomycin B, (+)&#8208;pestalazine B, and (+)&#8208;iso&#8208;naseseazine B.








Abstract
Diketopiperazine alkaloids are typically soldered via an inner tryptophan&#8211;tryptophan linkage diversely from C3&#8211;carbon/nitrogen anchor. The manifold stereochemical frameworks afford broad spectrum of pharmacological activities, meanwhile pose formidable challenges for the efficient synthesis of these alkaloids, particularly in addressing chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, and stereoselectivity. Herein, we disclosed a divergent oxidative coupling between designed 8 and aniline derivatives 13 via the steerable iodine&#8208;releasing reagent 14, achieving the divergent total syntheses of diketopiperazine alkaloids via C3&#8211;N1' and C3&#8211;C5' bond anchor. The electronic and steric attributes from aniline govern chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity for the linkage, enabling programmable assembly for divergently anchored alkaloids libraries. This approach established a stereospecific platform for the unified synthesis of three bioactive alkaloids via a dominant endo&#8208;selective manifold: (+)&#8208;tetratryptomycin B, (+)&#8208;pestalazine B, and (+)&#8208;iso&#8208;naseseazine B. The aniline&#8208;regulated paradigm unlocked cross&#8208;coupling with predictable selectivity for C3&#8208;centered alkaloid syntheses.

         <title>Reticular Chemistry&#8208;Guided Topology Engineering of Pillar&#8208;Layer Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks for Boosting SF6/N2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable ultramicroporous MOF based on the pillaring of hxl layers was constructed guided by reticular chemistry. It features triangular channels with optimal pore size and positive surface potential, providing a molecular trap for SF6. This MOF exhibited a commendable SF6 adsorption capacity at low pressure and an extremely high selectivity over N2, enabling it to efficiently recover SF6 with both high purity and productivity.








Abstract
Pillar&#8208;layered metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold high promise in the field of gas adsorption and separation. Capitalizing on reticular chemistry and topology&#8208;guided pore engineering, we herein present a rare non&#8208;interpenetrated MOF based on the pillaring of hxl layer, comprised of hexanuclear Ni6 clusters bridged by mixed O&#8208; and N&#8208;donor linkers. Notably, it features uniform triangular channels with optimal ultramicropore size and positive surface potential, constituting a molecular trap for SF6. By leveraging such pore characteristics, a commendable low&#8208;pressure adsorption capacity and selectivity for SF6 over N2 is achieved, significantly superior to the counterparts of pillared sql&#8208; and kgm&#8208;MOFs and on par with some leading adsorbents. A joint theoretical and crystallographic study reveals the superiority of topology&#8208;directed pore regulation on SF6 adsorption. Breakthrough experiments demonstrate that this MOF is capable of recovering high&#8208;purity (&gt;99.9%) SF6 from binary SF6/N2 mixture (10/90, v/v) at ambient conditions, attaining a record&#8208;high productivity in a single adsorption&#8208;desorption cycle. Moreover, excellent stability and scalable synthesis with low costs confer it with a great application prospect.

         <title>Biomarker&#8208;Gated Photocatalysis Uncaging in Live System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal precision in photocontrolled reactions is challenging. We developed a platform combining biomarker&#8208;triggered unlocking and photocatalytic amplification. Using diiodo&#8208;BODIPY carboxylic acid, we suppressed its photocatalytic activity by masking the carboxyl group, which can be restored by enzyme/ROS&#8208;cleavable linkers. This &#8220;activate&#8208;then&#8208;catalyze&#8221; approach enhances biomarker detection and enables AND&#8208;gate chemical and protein therapy.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal precision in photocontrolled biochemical reactions remains a central challenge. We report a sequential activation platform that integrates biomarker&#8208;triggered unlocking of photocatalyst activity with photocatalytic bioorthogonal uncaging, designed to enhance bioimaging and enable AND&#8208;gate therapeutics. By engineering diiodo&#8208;BODIPY carboxylic acid&#8212;an organic photocatalyst enabling efficient azide&#8208;to&#8208;amine reduction under light&#8212;we masked its carboxyl group as an ester to completely suppress photocatalytic activity. Strategic incorporation of enzyme&#8208; or ROS&#8208;cleavable self&#8208;immolative linkers restored catalysis in response to nitroreductase (NTR) or H2O2, respectively. This &#8220;lock&#8208;and&#8208;key&#8221; mechanism enables two primary functionalities: enhanced bioimaging through signal amplification by biomarker&#8208;activated BODIPY catalysts, and an &#8220;AND&#8208;gate&#8221; therapeutic activation requiring both NTR presence and light exposure for the release of caged therapeutic agents like RNase A or doxorubicin. Our platform integrates bioresponsive chemistry with light&#8208;mediated control, offering a blueprint for logical gate&#8208;regulated cellular processes and advancing precision medicine with potential for more targeted and efficient therapies.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost NaNO3&#8208;Based Phosphate Electrolytes with Exceptional Stability Toward Sustainable and High&#8208;Safety Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrolyte system was proposed for sustainable and high&#8208;safety sodium&#8208;ion batteries, utilizing NaNO3 as the sole sodium salt in a dual&#8208;solvent mixture of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and tris&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP). TMP facilitates high NaNO3 solubility via its strong electron&#8208;donating ability, while TFEP modulates ion&#8208;solvent coordination to enhance reduction stability and promote the formation of a stratified inorganic NaF/NaNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase film on hard carbon anodes. 








Abstract
The pursuit of cost&#8208;effective and sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs)&#160;necessitates innovative electrolyte designs to address the limitations of conventional sodium salts (e.g., NaPF6, NaFSI), which suffer from complex synthesis, atmospheric instability, and high production costs. Inorganic sodium salts such as NaNO3 offer a promising alternative due to their low cost, air stability, and thermal robustness, but their poor solubility in non&#8208;aqueous solvents and inadequate reduction stability hinder practical application. Herein, we propose a novel electrolyte system utilizing NaNO3 as the sole sodium salt, dissolved in a dual&#8208;solvent formulation of trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and tris&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP). TMP enables high NaNO3 solubility via its high Gutmann donor number and permittivity, while TFEP modulates ion&#8208;solvent coordination to enhance reduction stability and promote the formation of a stratified inorganic NaF/NaNxOy&#8208;rich SEI film on hard carbon (HC) anodes. Attributed to the enhanced reduction resistance of the solvation structure and the robust SEI film, the HC electrode achieves a high initial Coulombic efficiency (78.6%) and impressive cycling stability with 99.4% capacity retention after 200 cycles, while the Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7) (NFPP) cathode retains 87.5% capacity after 400 cycles. Additionally, HC//NFPP pouch cells confirmed the system's viability, even discharged under ignition conditions. This study provides a strategic blueprint for designing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety electrolytes for advanced SIBs, highlighting the promise of NaNO3 in achieving sustainable energy storage solutions.

         <title>Modulating Janus Effect of Cations to Control Electronic Symmetry and Hole Mobility in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By innovatively combining Raman spectroscopy for symmetry analysis with theoretical calculations of electronic structures, we provide new insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of Spiro. Our results reveal that symmetry&#8208;breaking is a key factor in enhancing Spiro's hole mobility (&#956;). Metal cation&#8211;&#960; interactions break the molecular symmetry of Spiro, tuning &#956; by reshaping the electronic structure.








Abstract
Li&#8208;TFSI&#8208;doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (Spiro) remains the benchmark hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The success of Li&#8208;TFSI doping has reinforced the prevailing notion that raising the oxidation level (OL) of Spiro proportionally enhances its conductivity, which relies on both hole concentration and mobility. While the role of hole concentration has been exhaustively explored, the origin of hole mobility enhancement has remained elusive. Here, we unveil the Janus effect of metal cations that decouples Spiro's hole mobility from its OL. Metal cation&#8211;&#960; interactions break the molecular symmetry of Spiro, reshaping its electronic structure and directly modulating hole mobility, whereas ion&#8211;ion interactions between metal cations and TFSI&#8722; anions exclusively govern the OL. By quantifying these orthogonal interactions, we establish a clear structure&#8211;property relationship that links electronic symmetry to macroscopic charge transport. This framework provides a rational design paradigm for next&#8208;generation, high&#8208;mobility hole conductors, applicable to perovskite solar cells and a wide range of optoelectronic materials and devices.

&lt;p&gt;By innovatively combining Raman spectroscopy for symmetry analysis with theoretical calculations of electronic structures, we provide new insights into the structure&#8211;property relationship of Spiro. Our results reveal that symmetry-breaking is a key factor in enhancing Spiro's hole mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;). Metal cation&#8211;&#960; interactions break the molecular symmetry of Spiro, tuning &lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt; by reshaping the electronic structure.

         <title>Symmetric Vs Asymmetric Imide Anion Decomposition Pathways And Their Influence On Solid Electrolyte Interphase Stability For Si Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetric bis(flourosulfonyl)imide anions in imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquids direct the formation of a conformal SEI on 3D a&#8208;Si architecture, featuring an ionorganic&#8208;rich (LiF/LiOH) inner and Li2SO4/polymeric outer layer. This anion&#8208;derived, mechanically robust SEI suppresses pulverization and delivers a high reversible capacity of 2489&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1C over 250 cycles.








Abstract
A sturdy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is imperative for extending the calendar&#8208;life of Si anodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, carbonate electrolytes form unstable interphases, hindering their practical implementation. Alternatively, fluorinated sulfonylimide (FSI&#8722;/TFSI&#8722;) based ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, coupled with Li&#8208;imide salts, enable anion&#8208;derived SEI formation, thereby enhancing capacity retention. However, the functional role of these anions in directing SEI formation and evolution within IL&#8208;based systems is poorly understood. Moreover, the mechanistic interplay between the decomposition pathways of symmetric and asymmetric anions in governing interfacial chemistry remains elusive. Herein, we investigate the chemistry and morphology of SEIs formed using various imidazolium&#8208;based ILs containing both symmetric and asymmetric anions. We reveal that the synergistic interactions between symmetrical bis(fluorinated sulfonyl)imide anions and imidazolium cations facilitate an inorganic&#8208;rich (LiF/LiOH) inner and a Li2SO4/polymeric outer layer SEI, conformally coating the 3D Si interface. The complementary effects of inorganic&#8208;rich and polymer components, featuring key Li2SO4 species, reinforce mechanical integrity and flexibility, suppressing pulverization and enabling reversible capacity of 2489&#160;mAh/g at 1C over 250 cycles. Correlating electrochemical performance with surface analysis provides critical insights into the impact of fluorinated sulfonylimide on passivation behavior and battery performance, guiding future design of ionic liquid electrolytes for LIBs.

         <title>Deciphering Eg Occupancy Descriptor in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eg occupancy serves as a pivotal descriptor for oxygen electrocatalysis, integrating multidimensional electronic factors into a unified predictive framework. Governing the mechanisms and kinetics of OER/ORR by regulating intermediate adsorption, it can be precisely tuned via heteroatom doping and interface engineering. A deep understanding of its principles, rooted in coordination chemistry and probed by XAS and DFT, is key to designing eg&#8208;optimized, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
Single variable descriptors serve as pivotal tools for evaluating catalyst performance, elucidating reaction mechanisms and guiding catalyst design in electrocatalysis. Among the existing oxygen electrocatalysis descriptors, eg occupancy stands out for integrating multidimensional electronic factors into a quantitative framework, enabling precise prediction of activity/selectivity trends. However, a comprehensive model for translating the mechanistic insights of eg occupancy into rational catalyst design remains underdeveloped. This review bridges this gap through a systematic analysis of eg occupancy across five dimensions: 1) fundamental principles of eg occupancy tuning via transition metal coordination environments, 2) characterization techniques for eg occupancy determination, 3) its governing role in oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) mechanisms and kinetics, 4) precise eg occupancy tuning strategies for material design, and 5) emerging challenges and future perspectives in rational catalyst design. By integrating these perspectives, this work not only deciphers the mechanistic link between eg occupancy and catalytic activities but also establishes design principles for eg&#8208;optimized electrocatalysts, thereby advancing next&#8208;generation oxygen electrocatalysts beyond noble&#8208;metal benchmarks for sustainable energy applications (e.g., fuel cells, water electrolyzers, and zinc&#8208;air batteries).

         <title>Reverse Lipid Droplet Function for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a &#8220;lipid droplet function reversal strategy&#8221; that reverses lipid droplet function from protective to destructive via a Fenton&#8208;reaction&#8208;triggered lipid peroxidation, which reshapes the tumor microenvironment, while effectively inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma growth and metastasis. This strategy redefines organelle&#8208;targeted therapy and underscores the therapeutic potential of subcellular metabolic engineering.








Abstract
Lipid droplet (LD)&#8208;mediated organelle interactions promote tumor progression and immune evasion in tumors, but directly targeting LD remains challenging. Here, we developed a strategy to reverse LD function for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) immunotherapy. We first established a positive correlation between LD&#8208;related proteins and poor prognosis in HCC patients. We then engineered F127&#8208;modified, linoleic acid (LA)&#8208;capped copper MOF nanoparticles (LCMF NPs). These NPs are recognized by CD36 and internalized into LDs. Whereafter, copper ions catalyze surface LA into radicals via Fenton reaction, triggering a polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxidation cascade. This chemical reaction reverses the protective effect of LDs on organelles into an oxidative damage effect. Mechanistically, this process induces significant DNA damage, upregulating key immunogenic cell death markers HMGB1 and calreticulin. In vivo, reversing LD function reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and inhibits growth of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, this LD functional reversal strategy establishes LD&#8208;organelle networks as viable immunotherapy targets and offers a promising approach for treating metastatic tumors via organelle&#8208;level metabolic disruption.

         <title>Coexistence of G&#8208;Quadruplex and i&#8208;Motif Within a DNA Duplex is Tolerated by a PCBP2&#8208;Assisted Replisome</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) and i&#8208;motif (iM) structures can stably coexist within a DNA duplex and exhibit mechanically interdependent stabilities, such that iM unfolding by the oncogenic factor PCBP2 or under alkaline conditions destabilizes the opposing G4 and favors duplex formation.








Abstract
G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) and i&#8208;motifs (iMs) are non&#8208;canonical, four&#8208;stranded DNA structures that are formed in guanine&#8208; and cytosine&#8208;rich sequences, respectively. These structural motifs play crucial regulatory roles in diverse genomic processes and have emerged as promising therapeutic targets. Although individual G4s and iMs have been intensively characterized, whether they could form simultaneously on complementary DNA strands has remained unclear. Using single&#8208;molecule analysis, we demonstrate that under physiologically relevant conditions, G4 and iM structures can indeed coexist within a native DNA fragment comprising 24 guanine and cytosine bases. Strikingly, due to the intrinsic sequence complementation, the stabilities of the two motifs are mutually affected, giving rise to a tightly coupled unfolding pathway. Quantitative measurements reveal that iM unfolding attenuates the mechanical stability of the facing G4 by approximately 13.7&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, we identify an oncogenic splicing factor, PCBP2, as an iM&#8208;interacting protein. Through destabilizing iM and consequently the concomitant G4, PCBP2 enables a replisome to bypass these otherwise persistent barriers. Our findings provide fresh insights into G4&#8211;iM interplay and establish PCBP2 as a key regulator of structured DNA during genome maintenance.

         <title>Sequential Phosphorus Doping and Selective Etching: A Dual&#8208;Step Approach for CO2 Reduction Pathway Regulation in Rhodium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;step surface modulation strategy is developed for effectively tuning the selectivity and activity of CO2 hydrogenation. The incorporation of phosphorus (P) weakens the CO adsorption ability and inhibits the formation of *HCO, switching the product from CH4 to CO. The following ascorbic acid (AA)&#8208;assisted selective surface etching provides more oxygen vacancies for activating CO2, thereby increasing the activity.








Abstract
CO2 hydrogenation is a significant way to reduce carbon emissions, but it is facing serious challenges in selectivity control. Herein, we report a sequential dual&#8208;step surface modulation strategy comprising phosphorus (P) incorporation into CeO2 supports followed by selective ascorbic acid (AA)&#8208;mediated etching. This approach enables precise tuning of product selectivity while maintaining exceptional catalytic activity. The final Rh/CeO2&#8208;P&#8208;AA catalyst exhibits a significant enhancement in the CO generation rate, reaching 1336.3 molCO molRh&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with nearly 100% CO selectivity, almost 1.9 times higher than that of Rh/CeO2&#8208;P (691.8 molCO molRh&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and 6.7 times higher than that of Rh/CeO2 (199.9 molCO molRh&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). The incorporation of P induces an elevation of the surface states of Rh species, contributing to lower adsorption capacity for CO, thus leading to the selectivity changes. More importantly, benefiting from the weak acidity and reducibility, AA can assist in the re&#8208;movement of some of the phosphate radicals and the partial reduction of Ce4+, thereby providing more oxygen defects for activating CO2.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Migratory Carboxylation of Unactivated Olefins or Halides with CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a general and practical Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the remote hydro&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylation of unactivated olefins or halides with carbon dioxide (CO2) was developed. Various ectopic carboxylation products were conveniently accessible from a wide range of readily available substrates under mild reaction conditions.








Abstract
Coupling carbon dioxide (CO2) with organic molecules through the electrocarboxylation reaction constitutes a promising approach for generating value&#8208;added carboxylic acids. Up to now, activated substrates (such as styrene and butadiene derivatives) have been predominantly focused on due to their high activity. In contrast, the unactivated substrates, with low reductive potentials and unstable radical intermediates but more abundant in nature and industry, have rarely been employed. Herein, we proposed a nickel&#8208;electrocatalytic system for the regioconvergent carboxylation of unactivated olefins or halides. Various carboxylic acids were obtained by the remote hydro&#8208; or di&#8208;carboxylation under mild reaction conditions with inexpensive catalysts and electrodes. It was noteworthy that readily available alkanes could also be utilized as starting substrates for the site&#8208;selective electrocarboxylation process by the unified catalytic strategy. This method expands the scope of organic molecules coupled with CO2, and demonstrates the possibility of ectopic and remote C&#9472;H carboxylation. Mechanistic investigations indicated that the Ni&#9472;H species generated in the Ni&#8208;electrocatalytic system play a key role for promoting chain walking to efficiently produce activated olefin intermediates, which subsequently undergo radical addition with CO2 radical anion and further transform into the desired products.

         <title>Co1Zn Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Boosts Active Hydrogen Spillover for Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Ammonia Over 2&#160;A cm&#8722;2 Current Density</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8211;noble Co1Zn single&#8211;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst that exhibits a pronounced hydrogen spillover effect, boosting highly active electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia. Co1Zn SAA catalyst demonstrates a remarkable current density of 2.4 A cm&#8722;2 with a high a yield rate of 204.5 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for ammonia production, which is 2.5&#8211;fold higher than that of the unalloyed Zn NSs lacking hydrogen spillover effect.








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia reaction (NO3RR) involves a series of hydrogenation steps involving nitrate&#8208;derived intermediates. Consequently, accelerating the provision of active hydrogen is expected to enhance the reaction kinetics. In this work, we report a Co1Zn single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst that exhibits a pronounced hydrogen spillover effect. By virtue of this spillover phenomenon, the Co1Zn SAA nanosheets (Co1Zn NSs) achieve nitrate electroreduction at ampere&#8208;level current densities. Specifically, Co1Zn NSs deliver a high current density of 2.4&#160;A cm&#8722;2 (corresponding to an ammonia yield rate of 204.5&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.7% for ammonia production, which is approximately 2.5&#8208;fold higher than that obtained with Zn nanosheets lacking hydrogen spillover effect. Moreover, Co1Zn NSs demonstrate a great application potential in Zn&#8722;NO3&#8722; rechargeable battery. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the isolated Co atoms in Co1Zn NSs served as a &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; for hydrogen spillover during NO3RR, thereby increasing the coverage of active hydrogen on the catalyst surface and lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step of NO3RR, and finally markedly enhanced the catalytic performance.

         <title>Design of Piezoelectric, Hydrophobic, and Metal&#8208;Free Porous Frameworks for High&#8208;Rate Conversion of Water and Air to Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PAFs synthesized through a clear coupling reaction connection exhibited ideal piezoelectric catalytic effects, benefiting from the high exposure of active sites, band structure dependent synergistic reaction pathway, absence of metal components, and hydrophobicity of the designed PAFs, the obtained piezoelectric PAF&#8208;255 converted water and air into hydrogen peroxide at a rate of up to 30&#160;694 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is superior to other piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a crucial chemical is important in modern industry. Considering its composition, directly conversion from water and oxygen is a sustainable route. Production process under the driven force of mechanism stimuli, namely piezocatalysis, is easy to operate, expensive electrode&#8208;free and light&#8208;independent. Current challenge of piezocatalysts lies in the limited hydrogen peroxide production. Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs)&#160;are a class of porous materials constructed from covalently linked aromatic rings with adjustable framework chemistry and high tolerance in harsh conditions. However, PAFs are generally amorphous, and their electronic, photonic and other physical properties are less developed. To achieve piezoelectricity in PAFs, we designed short&#8208;range regular dipolar motifs as featured units to give the whole framework significant piezoelectric effect. In this work, the synthesized framework from unambiguous connecting manner of coupling reactions showed desired pizeocatalytic effect. The obtained piezoelectric PAFs converted water and air to H2O2 with a rate as high as 30694&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The groundbreaking production rate was achieved owing to the highly exposed active sites, band&#8208;structure&#8208;dependent corporative reaction pathways, metal&#8208;free composition and hydrophobicity of the PAFs designed in this study. This work first built piezoelectric catalysts in amorphous frameworks based on the definite connection of coupling reactions, and pave the way to the targeted design of PAFs functions for environmental water utilization.

         <dc:description>
The 23rd European Symposium on Organic Chemistry (ESOC&#8208;2025) in Copenhagen celebrated the enormous breadth of organic chemistry in Europe and beyond. The meeting had more than 600 participants celebrating organic chemistry in Europe 200 years after the first description of benzene.








Abstract
The 23rd in the series of &#8220;European Symposium on Organic Chemistry&#8221; (ESOC) was held at Tivoli Congress Center in Copenhagen from June 29th to July 3rd of 2025. ESOC was held for the first time in Cologne, Germany, in 1979, and has since been held approximately every other year. This year, Christian Marcus Pedersen and Michael Pittelkow from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen hosted the event, and there were 619 registered participants from 49 countries. There were 13 plenary lectures, 13 invited lectures, and 21 &#8220;oral communications&#8221; that had been selected on the basis of applications. There were two poster sessions with a total of 350 posters. A total of six poster prizes were awarded, two awarded by the attendees via the app and four awarded by the poster prize committee. Among the total of 47 lectures, the &#8220;Patai&#8208;Rappoport lecture award&#8221; was presented by Eric Jacobsen from Harvard University, &#8220;Dr. The Margaret Faul Women in Chemistry award&#8221; lectures given by Franziska Schoenebeck from Aachen University (Academia Award), and Dani Schultz from Merck (Industry Award). EuChemS awarded the &#8220;Award for research 2024&#8221; to Ilan Marek from Technion and the &#8216;Young investigator award 2024&#8242; to Aur&#233;lien de la Torre from d'Orsay. The EuChemS Award for &#8216;Award for service 2024&#8242; was awarded to Berit Olofsson from Stockholm University.

         <title>Capturing the Complexities of Catalyst&#8211;Support Interactions with the Help of Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Maxson and Szilv&#225;si use a machine&#8208;learned interatomic potential to model supported silver nanoparticles. They show that the idealized nanoparticle shapes commonly invoked in the computational catalysis literature do not reflect experiments for diameters below 8 nm and instead form an oblong shape of lower symmetry.








Abstract
The structure of metal nanoparticles is central to their catalytic activity, but metal&#8211;support interactions are difficult to model via quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations. Using a machine&#8208;learned potential to model supported silver nanoparticles, it has been shown that the idealized nanoparticle shapes commonly invoked in the literature do not reflect experiments for diameters below 8&#160;nm, as reported by Maxson and Szilv&#225;si.

         <dc:description>
The famous French impressionist painter Claude Monet painted the portal of Rouen Cathedral many times between 1892 and 1894. Observing the same model, he attempted to capture the moment under different lighting conditions and at different times of the day. Inspired from this masterpiece, the Research Article by Hani Amouri, Andreas Steffen et al. (e202515695) illustrates a new class of carbene Au&#8208;alkynyl complexes where inorganic and organic chromphores merge in harmony to generate anti&#8208;Kasha panchromatic emitters, which emit over the entire visible spectrum under different excitation wavelengths.

A single propargylic alcohol beam enters a catalyst prism and splits into three product beams via adaptive rhodium catalysis assisted by a Lewis&#8208;acidic secondary sphere. In their Communication (e202515903), Christophe Werl&#233; and co&#8208;workers describe a rhodium catalyst featuring a triazine ligand with a borane arm that selectively transforms a propargylic alcohol into retained alkynes, allylic ethers, or (E)&#8208;alkenes.

         <title>Outside Back Cover: Iron (IV) Formation and the pH&#8208;Dependent Kinetics of the Fenton Reaction (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 49/2025)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the Research Article (e17261) by Kevin R. Wilson and co&#8208;workers, a new unified kinetic model is developed to describe the pH dependent kinetics of the Fenton reaction. By incorporating iron speciation and updated rate constants, the model reproduces experimental results and reveals that hydroxyl radicals dominate at low pH, while Fe(IV) becomes the main oxidant under near&#8208;neutral conditions.

A weak&#8208;solvation electrolyte with reduced coordinated water is developed by introducing proline containing both hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors, which disrupts the hydrogen&#8208;bond network among water molecules and promotes fast desolvation and interfacial kinetics. This design enables uniform Zn deposition, suppressed parasitic reactions, and stable performance across a wide temperature range.

         <title>Materials Innovation and the Changing Face of Photocatalytic and Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction Research: From Metal Nanoclusters to Extended Frameworks</title>

Innovative catalyst design is advancing precision&#8208;controlled catalysis for CO2 reduction. This minireview investigates the forefront of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) leveraging metal nanoclusters (NCs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), concentrating on structure&#8211;activity correlations, precision synthesis methods, and mechanistic elucidation of CO2 conversion pathways. 








Abstract
The accelerating rise in atmospheric CO2 levels, driven by anthropogenic emissions, underscores the urgent need for transformative carbon management strategies. Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs) offer a promising route to valorize CO2 into energy&#8208;rich fuels and chemical feedstocks, yet the intrinsic thermodynamic and kinetic barriers necessitate catalysts that combine high activity, selectivity, and durability. Recent breakthroughs in materials chemistry have spotlighted two emerging material classes&#8212;atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) and extended reticular frameworks such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;as frontiers for next&#8208;generation CO2RR catalysts. Both systems offer unparalleled opportunities to engineer active sites at the atomic and molecular levels, enabling precise modulation of local environments, electronic structures, and substrate interactions. This review brings these two materials paradigms under a common vision of precision&#8208;controlled catalysis, highlighting how innovations in cluster size, framework topology, and chemical functionality dictate product selectivity and C&#9472;C coupling behavior. We discuss emerging mechanistic insights, synthetic strategies, and structure&#8211;function relationships and outline challenges in conductivity, stability, and scalability. Finally, we propose integrated design principles to guide the development of hybrid platforms for efficient and selective CO2 valorization.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Chemiluminescence Microscopy for Imaging Heterogeneous Photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;Type Activity on Individual Hematite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a unique chemiluminescence (CL) approach for well&#8208;controlled CL imaging of individual photocatalyst particles. The CL imaging approach is based on light&#8208;addressable catalysis to reveal the heterogeneous activity of photocatalysts at the single particle level with high controllability for CL emission. As an illustrative application, we demonstrate the potential of the CL microscopy approach for well&#8208;controlled imaging heterogeneous photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;type activity on individual hematite photocatalysts.








Abstract
While chemiluminescence (CL) offers a promising method for assessing catalytic activity in chemical catalysis, a well&#8208;controlled assessment of the inherent heterogeneity of catalyst particles at a single&#8208;particle level remains challenging. Here, we report light&#8208;induced CL microscopy for imaging heterogeneous photocatalytic activity on individual photocatalysts in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. The CL microscopy approach is based on light&#8208;addressable catalysis to reveal the heterogeneous activity of photocatalysts at the single catalyst level with high controllability for CL emission. We also report, for the first time, the spatial heterogeneity of photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;type activity of dendritic hematite within a single hematite photocatalyst, along with the unique activity distribution of the individual photocatalysts across a population of dendritic hematite structures of varying shapes and sizes.

         <title>Multicomponent Synthesis on a Diiron Platform of Stable Ferrabenzenes with Promising Anticancer Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot reaction on a diiron platform yields the first isolable series of ferrabenzene compounds. X&#8208;ray, NMR, and DFT studies confirm their aromatic character. Selected derivatives display favorable physicochemical prerequisites for biological applications and exhibit a promising in vitro cytotoxicity profile, linked to disruption of mitochondrial activity.








Abstract
Despite extensive research on metallabenzenes, ferrabenzenes have remained elusive, with only a single example reported to date, discovered accidentally. In this work, we present a reproducible, room&#8208;temperature reaction on a diiron bis&#8208;cyclopentadienyl platform, providing access to a class of four substituted ferrabenzenes (5a&#8208;c), stabilized by &#951;6&#8208;coordination to a second iron fragment. This synthesis involves a one&#8208;pot double C&#9472;C coupling of iminium, carbene (from a diazo compound), and carbon monoxide moieties, yielding ferra&#8208;cyclohexadienone derivatives (4a&#8208;c), followed by O&#8208;alkylation with alkyl triflates. Experimental and computational studies enabled the proposal of a plausible reaction mechanism. Combined X&#8208;ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and computational data support the aromatic character of the ferrabenzene ring in compounds 5a&#8208;c and, to a lesser extent, in their precursors 4a&#8208;c. Complexes 4a&#8208;c and 5a&#8208;c were further characterized by IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and IR spectroelectrochemistry. A selection of ferrabenzenes (5a, 5b, 5aEt) revealed physicochemical properties suitable for biological applications, including permanent air stability, adequate aqueous solubility and stability, and balanced hydrophilic/lipophilic profile. These compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity in vitro against three cancer cell lines, with 5aEt standing out for its pronounced activity, attributed to disruption of cell redox homeostasis, and marked selectivity compared to two noncancerous cell lines.

         <title>Mapping Boryl Radical Properties and Reactivity Using Machine Learning: The B&#8208;Rad and React&#8208;B&#8208;Rad Maps</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boryl radicals are central to synthesis, yet their steric and electronic complexity makes systematic mapping challenging. The B&#8208;rad map organizes 141 in silico&#8208;parametrized 7e&#8208;4c radicals into five meaningful clusters via unsupervised learning. React&#8208;B&#8208;rad maps enriched with computed barriers reveal reactivity trends, while supervised classification confirms predictive power, establishing a platform for virtual design and screening.








Abstract
Boryl radicals have become indispensable in organic synthesis, yet, translating their complex steric and electronic properties into actionable reactivity insights remains challenging. Herein, we present a comprehensive classification of boryl radicals, including a publicly accessible database of 141 neutral 7e&#8208;4c boryl radicals, each parametrized by a set of electronic and steric features derived from DFT calculations.

     alt="Mapping Boryl Radical Properties and Reactivity Using Machine Learning: The B-Rad and React-B-Rad Maps"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boryl radicals are central to synthesis, yet their steric and electronic complexity makes systematic mapping challenging. The B-rad map organizes 141 in silico-parametrized 7e-4c radicals into five meaningful clusters via unsupervised learning. React-B-rad maps enriched with computed barriers reveal reactivity trends, while supervised classification confirms predictive power, establishing a platform for virtual design and screening.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boryl radicals have become indispensable in organic synthesis, yet, translating their complex steric and electronic properties into actionable reactivity insights remains challenging. Herein, we present a comprehensive classification of boryl radicals, including a publicly accessible database of 141 neutral 7e-4c boryl radicals, each parametrized by a set of electronic and steric features derived from DFT calculations. Unsupervised machine learning (&lt;i&gt;k-&lt;/i&gt;means clustering) and dimensionality reduction (PCA/UMAP) condense this high dimensional descriptor space into the &#8220;B-rad map&#8221;, capturing trends in sterics and electronics among the resulting five clusters. Global electrophilicity (&lt;i&gt;&#969;&lt;/i&gt;) and nucleophilicity &lt;i&gt;(N)&lt;/i&gt; indices are overlaid to create a polarity&#8209;annotated guide, while DFT&#8209;computed activation free energies for six benchmark reactions (HAT, radical addition, and XAT for two different substrates) yield the React&#8209;B&#8209;rad maps that directly link intrinsic properties to specific reaction performance. To demonstrate predictive power, supervised machine learning models (random forest) are trained on the descriptors and successfully predict radical reactivity regimes across all reaction types. Overall, this integrated, machine-learning-driven platform can serve as both a practical guide for experimental decision-making and a foundation for data-driven discovery, paving the way towards rational design and virtual screening of boryl-radical reagents for diverse synthetic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Thermostable Chemically Responsive GlowCas9 System for Real&#8208;Time Therapeutic Monitoring Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR&#8208;associated protein SpCas9 was rationally engineered by fusing a split nanoluciferase to form a thermostable and reporter enzyme, GlowCas9. The GlowCas9 is chemically responsive and detectable in vitro and in vivo with high sensitivity without the need for expensive antibodies. The dual&#8208;function GlowCas9 is superior in gene editing and homology&#8208;based DNA repair applications than the wild&#8208;type Cas9. The protein engineering strategy is generalizable to other CRISPR enzyme orthologs, like in SaCas9.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR&#8208;associated protein (Cas) has revolutionized gene therapy applications due to its ease of design and efficiency, albeit accompanied by off&#8208;target effects. Spatiotemporally regulated Cas9 offers safer gene editing methods due to its lower off&#8208;target mediated genotoxicities; however, probing the Cas9 in real time for assessing the delivery efficiency, gene editing timeframe, and spatial target information remains elusive. Here, we report an engineered Cas9 system, GlowCas9, that can be probed chemically in real&#8208;time across all assay systems, including cell lysate, native gel, ex vivo, and in vivo. Importantly, we rationally engineered the Cas9 system to attain remarkable thermostability with enhanced gene editing activities. Besides its sensitive reporter and enhanced gene editing activity, the GlowCas9 system exhibits precision HDR&#8208;based gene knock&#8208;in ability in cells and significantly outperformed the WTCas9. Overall, we report a new thermostable engineered SpCas9 system for real&#8208;time theratracking applications compatible with diverse assay formats, including live ex vivo and in vivo. This GlowCas9 system will add a new dimension of non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time tracking in gene therapy development, both ex vivo and in vivo.

         <title>Rotational Flexibility in Dication Drives Ambient Temperature Ferroelectricity in an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Halide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study reports a new Ag(I)&#8208;based hybrid halide, (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)Ag2Br4, that shows ferroelectricity driven by the rotation of its organic cation. It undergoes a reversible ferroelectric&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at 330&#160;K, confirmed by experimental and theoretical analyses. This work emphasizes how organic cation dynamics can tune ferroelectric behavior in coinage metal&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid materials. 








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halides (OIHHs) have gained attention as potential ferroelectric materials due to structure&#8208;property synergy of the organic and inorganic constituents. This study introduces an unusual Ag(I)&#8208;based ternary OIHH, (4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)Ag2Br4, featuring rotational flexibility in the organic dication to induce asymmetry into the structure. The compound crystallizes in a monoclinic crystal system with a non&#8208;centrosymmetric polar P21 space group at room&#8208;temperature and undergoes a structural phase transition to a centrosymmetric phase (P21/c) at Curie temperature (Tc) of 330&#160;K which was further supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), second harmonic generation (SHG) signals, dielectric anomaly, current&#8208;voltage (I&#8211;V) profiles, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. Ferroelectricity is confirmed through polarization&#8211;electric field (P&#8211;E) hysteresis loops and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), exhibiting switchable polar domains. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed electronic structures of the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases, identified the (&#946;&#8208;AgBr2)nn&#8722; inorganic anionic chain contributing to the net polarization, and in general, complemented the experimental results. Comparative studies with structurally analogous Ag(I)&#8208;based OIHHs lacking dication rotational freedom endorse the critical role of organic flexibility in driving ferroelectricity. This study provides insights into the role of organic dications in controlling ferroelectric behavior and offers a promising pathway for developing coinage metal&#8208;based OIHH ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Superhydrophilic FeIV2MnII Nanocluster: A Combined Diagnostic and Therapeutic Agent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>

An atomically precise nanocluster with a superhydrophilic architecture acts as an efficient magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) dual&#8208;mode diagnostic agent, while providing for a photothermal&#8208;based antitumor effect.








Abstract
We report here an atomically precise nanocluster, (NH4)2MnII(H2O)2[FeIV(L)]2&#183;11H2O (Fe2Mn). This system was designed to harness superhydrophilic interactions to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), while permitting photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal antitumor therapy. It was synthesized using Fe&#8208;HDCL, an Fe(IV) system with strong near infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion capabilities, as a precursor and manganese(II) ion that allows for MRI as the metal center. Fe2Mn not only produces a useful photothermal effect but also provides for MRI enhancement with a longitudinal relaxivity (r1) of 7.67 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at 0.5 T and 6.02 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at 3.0 T, values that are nearly double those of common gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (e.g., Gd&#8208;DTPA, r1&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.0 &#8764; 4.0 mM&#8722;1s&#8722;1). This enhanced relaxivity arises from two para&#8208;positioned water coordination sites (q&#160;=&#160;2) on the manganese(II) ion and robust hydrogen bonding between hydrophilic groups on the Fe&#8208;HDCL surface and surrounding water molecules, forming a second&#8208;sphere hydration shell. As detailed below, the nanocluster of this study (Fe2Mn) enables high&#8208;quality dual&#8208;mode MR/PA imaging and effective low&#8208;dose (25&#160;&#181;mol&#183;kg&#8722;1) laser&#8208;triggered photothermal tumor ablation. The present study thus demonstrates how rationally designed superhydrophilic architectures that control both inner sphere coordination and second sphere hydration dynamics can give rise to more effective theranostic agents.

         <title>Thermomagnetic Bistability, Colossal Negative Thermal Expansion, and THz&#8208;Heat&#8208;Induced Switching in Cu&#8208;Nitroxide Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>

Bistability in molecule&#8208;based magnets is vital for device applications. We present the first Cu(II)&#8208;nitroxide complex with thermally driven bistability up to 144&#160;K and slow relaxation over 9 h at 95&#160;K via an unprecedented autocatalytic mechanism. Fast switching by a single THz pulse is demonstrated. Along with colossal anisotropic negative thermal expansion, these findings reveal new opportunities for advanced molecular devices.








Abstract
Bistability in molecule&#8208;based magnets is crucial for their applications in functional devices, and thermally induced excited spin state trapping (TIESST) represents a promising route to maintain two distinct spin states for a significant period of time. Heterospin compounds based on Cu(II) and nitroxide radicals demonstrate highly tunable non&#8208;classical spin transitions, nevertheless they did not reveal TIESST effects up to date. Here, we report the first Cu(II)&#8208;nitroxide complex that exhibits TIESST&#8208;driven bistability up to 116&#160;K. The TIESST temperature is close to temperatures of the spin transition, which is accompanied by a hysteresis of 30&#160;K (T1/2&#8593; = 144&#160;K, T1/2&#8595; = 114&#160;K). The trapped excited state features a very slow relaxation that exceeds 9&#160;h at 95&#160;K. Fast switching is also feasible for this complex: almost complete conversion from the ground to excited state occurs in a single THz pulse within 50&#160;ms. The slow relaxation and preservation of the crystal quality enabled us to perform an XRD study and demonstrate that the trapped and stable phases coexist during the transition. It was demonstrated, that relaxation of excited state proceeds via an autocatalytic mechanism, previously unreported for spin&#8208;crossover systems, which introduces a new paradigm in spin relaxation dynamics.

         <title>A Novel Antimalarial Agent that Inhibits Protein Synthesis in Plasmodium falciparum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compound 31 represents a promising avenue for the development as an antimalarial agent with a potent activity profile (PfNF54 IC50&#160;&#177;&#160;s.d.&#160;=&#160;3.9&#160;&#177;&#160;0.4&#160;nM). It has a novel mode of action by binding to cytosolic ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in the parasite. 








Abstract
The emergence of drug resistance to nearly all antimalarials following their rollout underscores the need for novel chemotypes with novel modes of action to replenish the antimalarial drug&#8208;development pipeline. We identified a novel class of compounds in the antimalarial armory. Compound 31, characterized by a 2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl benzamide scaffold, displays potent activity against blood&#8208;stage and mature sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum and no toxicity in human cells. Resistance selection studies with 31 identified a previously unknown point mutation in the P. falciparum multidrug&#8208;resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1) gene, for which we confirmed causality by CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;based gene editing as the primary mediator of resistance. No cross&#8208;resistance toward first&#8208;line antimalarials was identified in compound 31&#8208;resistant parasites. Proteomics studies indicated that the primary mode of action of 31 is through direct binding to cytosolic ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis in the parasite. Taken together, compound 31 is a promising starting point for the development of a next&#8208;generation antimalarial.

         <title>Total Biocatalytic Synthesis of Capsaicinoids Using Ferulic Acid: A Versatile Two&#8208;Step Strategy for Natural Product Diversification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic cascade was developed for the total synthesis of bioactive capsaicinoids from biomass&#8208;derived ferulic acid. The vanillylamine module (VM), containing phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD), aromatic dioxygenase (ADO), and transaminase (TA), integrated with the capsaicinoid module (CM), comprising carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and polyphosphate kinase (PPK) for ATP regeneration, enabling efficient amide bond formation to yield diverse capsaicinoids.








Abstract
The wide&#8208;ranging application of capsaicinoids, the active compounds in chili peppers, has driven increasing interest in the development of sustainable production strategies. However, capsaicinoid synthesis remains a challenge. The objective of this pioneering study is to report the total biocatalytic synthesis of structurally diverse capsaicinoids from bio&#8208;based ferulic acids. An X&#8208;ray crystallographic study elucidated the structural basis for the exceptional potential of a novel transaminase from Phaeobacter porticola (PPTA) to transform the highest ever reported concentration of vanillin (100&#8211;200&#160;mM) to vanillylamine, with &gt;99% conversion and modest conversion ranging from 48% to 79% for 300 to 500&#160;mM substrate. Using PPTA in tandem with phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD) and aromatic dioxygenase (ADO) further enabled the direct synthesis of vanillylamine from ferulic acid with &gt;99% conversion. Furthermore, the integration of a multi&#8208;enzymatic cascade with carboxylic acid reductases (CARs) successfully synthesized structurally diverse capsaicinoids via amide bond formation between vanillylamine and free fatty acids, with excellent conversions ranging from 72% to &gt;88%. A 50&#8208;mM enzymatic reaction afforded 95% and 80% conversion of vanillylamine and capsaicin, respectively.

         <title>EDA Complex&#8208;Driven Desaturation of Heterocyclic Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by HFIP</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel light&#8208;mediated desaturation strategy enabled by electron donor&#8211;acceptor complex formation. DFT and mechanistic studies reveal that the reaction proceeds via single&#8208;electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, and base&#8208;mediated deprotonation sequentially with pyridinium salt serving dually as oxidant and base, and hexafluoroisopropanol functioning as solvent and radical mediator. Notably, this strategy demonstrates broad substrate scope, enabling efficient synthesis of quinolinones, coumarins, and flavones, and also facilitates the late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug molecules. 








Abstract
Recently, electron donor&#8211;acceptor (EDA) complex&#8208;mediated organic synthetic strategies have emerged as powerful tools for diverse bond&#8208;forming transformations; however, their efficiency often diminishes when ionic reactants are involved. This limitation arises from the requirement of polar solvents such as DMSO or DMF to solubilize ionic species for the formation of effective EDA complex. Consequently, these solvents engage in competing EDA complex formation or disrupt ionization equilibria. In parallel, there is a pressing necessity of modern and efficient strategy to achieve dehydrogenation reactions, which are in general limited by the drawbacks of traditional approaches. To address both, herein, we disclose an innovative desaturation strategy based on the formation of an EDA complex between a dihydrogenated organic substrate and an N&#8208;methoxy pyridinium salt. In our study, solubility issues, which are associated with the pyridinium salt, are effectively addressed by using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP). Beyond enhancing solubility, HFIP also functions as a transient H&#8208;shuttle, significantly reducing the activation energy for this transformation. This cooperative interplay between HFIP and the pyridinium salt enables the efficient and selective desaturation of a broad range of heterocyclic carbonyl compounds&#8212;including quinolinones, coumarins, and flavones&#8212;which are valuable scaffolds in pharmaceutical and agrochemical research. At the end, detailed mechanistic studies with the aid of experiments as well as DFT studies clearly disclose the mechanism as well as the important role of HFIP in this reaction.

         <title>From Lignocellulose to Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Innovative Synthesis through Friedel&#8211;Crafts Alkylation and Hydrodeoxygenation</title>

The aviation sector's reliance on fossil kerosene is a major source of CO2 emissions, while wood waste represents an abundant, renewable carbon resource that can help reduce its footprint. Hemicellulose and lignin are catalytically converted into kerosene&#8208;like naphthenes via Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and hydrodeoxygenation, enabling sustainable drop&#8208;in aviation fuels compatible with existing engines and infrastructure.








Abstract
To address the aviation sector's growing carbon footprint, this study presents a novel route for producing sustainable aviation fuel precursors via acid&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation of wood&#8208;derived lignin monomers with furfuryl alcohol. Using guaiacol as a model compound, key catalytic requirements were investigated in batch mode. Although heterogeneous zeolites showed initial promise, pore blocking by oligomerized furfuryl alcohol limited performance, leading to the selection of para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid as an effective homogeneous catalyst. A fed&#8208;batch strategy was employed to suppress oligomerization by controlling furfuryl alcohol concentration. The resulting alkylated products, structurally aligned with conventional kerosene, were further upgraded via metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeoxygenation, achieving final overall yields up to 92 C%.

         <title>Flux Synthesis of Lattice&#8208;Engineered Rutile Solid Solutions for Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature flux strategy enables the formation of nitrogen&#8208;doped Ti&#8211;Ru rutile solid solutions for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The resulting catalyst exhibits high activity, remarkable Ru mass utilization, and long&#8208;term durability in both half&#8208;cell and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) tests.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vital for advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) technologies. Here, we report a flux synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped Ti&#8211;Ru rutile&#8208;type solid&#8208;solution oxides (M&#8208;TiRu4) using molten NaNO3 as the flux medium. The flux medium promotes the low&#8208;temperature conversion of TiN to rutile TiO2, while in situ&#8208;formed RuO2 nanoparticles facilitate lattice templating and couple with interfacial ion migration, enabling the formation of homogeneous solid solutions with abundant lattice heterogeneity. Simultaneously, nitrogen atoms are stably incorporated into the lattice of solid solutions, inducing bandgap narrowing, which enhances electronic conductivity. The developed M&#8208;TiRu4 catalyst exhibits exceptional acidic OER performance, delivering a low overpotential of 194&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, superior durability over 600 h, and a Ru mass activity 7.8 times that of commercial RuO2. At the device level, M&#8208;TiRu4 enables PEMWE operation at 1.64&#160;V @ 2&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable performance at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 200 h with a minimal degradation rate of 20&#160;&#181;V h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates a robust approach for designing high&#8208;performance, durable acidic OER catalysts via synergistic lattice and electronic structure engineering, paving the way for next&#8208;generation water&#8208;splitting technologies.

         <title>Discovery of a Cryptic Pocket in EcDsbA Opens New Opportunities for Antibacterial Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>

A dynamics&#8208;driven fragment&#8208;based approach reveals a cryptic pocket in EcDsbA, enabling the rational design of inhibitors beyond its canonical substrate&#8208;binding site.








Abstract
We have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize dynamics in the bacterial oxidoreductase enzyme Escherichia coli disulfide bond protein A (EcDsbA). Through this process we identified a cryptic pocket in the structure. We demonstrate that we can identify small molecule &#8220;fragments&#8221; that bind entirely within this cryptic site. The fragments bind to the cryptic pocket with unusually slow kinetics and a preference for interacting with the oxidized state of EcDsbA where the two cysteine residues at the active site form a disulfide bond. We characterize the mechanism of binding, involving conformational changes in the active&#8208;site helix of EcDsbA, which are observed preferentially in the oxidized state. This dynamics&#8208;driven binding mechanism explains both the slow kinetics and the redox&#8208;dependent binding of the ligands. Furthermore, we demonstrate that compounds binding to the cryptic pocket inhibit EcDsbA activity. These findings highlight the value of dynamics data in identification of the cryptic pocket and identify a new target site for developing more potent inhibitors of EcDsbA.

         <title>Panchromatic Gold Alkynyl Complexes with Pyrenyl&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand Displaying Anti&#8208;Kasha Behavior</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynyl&#8208;Au(I)&#8208;complexes containing pyrenyl&#8208;NHC chromophoric ligand have been engineered. The judicious placement of the organic chromophores at the carbene unit generates anti&#8208;Kasha panchromatic emission not observed previously in related compounds. This remarkable behavior is triggered by the charge transfer (CT) states of CCPh &#8594; pyrene. In contrast, the Au&#8211;CN compound without CCPh shows only weak fluorescence. A combined experimental and theoretical study is advanced to explain this phenomenon.








Abstract
A unique family of alkynyl&#8208;gold(I)&#8208;complexes (1&#8211;6) containing pyrenyl&#8208;NHC chromophoric ligand (NHC&#160;=&#160;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) has been prepared and fully characterized. The complexes were engineered such that a pyrenyl ligand was introduced to one nitrogen center of the carbene unit while to the other nitrogen center we attached a methyl (1), n&#8208;butyl (2), or naphthyl (3&#8211;6) group in order to probe their effect on the photophysical properties of our Au&#8208;alkynyl complexes. For comparison purposes the cyanide&#8208;gold(I) complex (7) was prepared and fully characterized. The molecular structures of 3 and 4 and 7 were ascertained by X&#8208;ray diffraction study. In stark contrast to the alkynyl complexes, the cyano&#8208;Au complex 7 displayed only weak fluorescence highlighting the impact of the &#8211;C&#8801;C&#9472;Ar unit on their emission properties. The alkynyl complexes displayed different behavior, for instance, complex 1 exhibited excimer emissions originated from the pyrene chromophore while compound 2&#8211;6 displayed remarkable multi&#8208;emissive properties, mainly 3&#8211;6 showing panchromatic behavior with emissions dependent on the excitation wavelengths suggesting anti&#8208;Kasha behavior. TD&#8208;DFT&#8208;calculations were carried out to support interpretation of the experimental results. These remarkable results have not been observed previously, making these molecules important candidates for a wide range of applications in the optical domain.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicon&#8208;based olefination strategy has been developed to access challenging (Z)&#8208;configured &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated ketones from readily accessible branched vinyl silanes and acid chlorides. This method enables the straightforward synthesis of a broad variety of deconjugated ketones with high (Z)&#8208;selectivity under mild conditions and provides a new retrosynthetic disconnection to streamline the synthesis of complex scaffolds and natural products.

&lt;p&gt;A silicon-based olefination strategy has been developed to access challenging (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-configured &#946;,&#947;-unsaturated ketones from readily accessible branched vinyl silanes and acid chlorides. This method enables the straightforward synthesis of a broad variety of deconjugated ketones with high (&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;)-selectivity under mild conditions and provides a new retrosynthetic disconnection to streamline the synthesis of complex scaffolds and natural products.

         <title>Lithium Iodide Enables Bis&#8208;electrophilic Ring&#8208;Opening of Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium iodide&#8208;mediated electrophile&#8211;electrophile ring opening of azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) furnishes densely substituted azetidines. Leveraging ABB ring strain under mild, base&#8208;free conditions, the method enables sequential electrophilic incorporation, displays broad scope and operational simplicity, and is amenable to late&#8208;stage functionalization.








Abstract
Azetidines are privileged nitrogen heterocycles in medicinal chemistry; however, current synthetic methodologies utilizing azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (ABBs) predominantly rely on classical nucleophile&#8211;electrophile or radical&#8208;based approaches. Here, we report an unprecedented electrophile&#8211;electrophile ring&#8208;opening strategy enabled by lithium iodide&#8208;mediated activation of ABBs, offering direct and versatile access to densely substituted azetidines through sequential electrophilic incorporation. This new reactivity exploits the inherent ring strain of ABBs under mild, base&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby eliminating the necessity for harsh reaction environments. Mechanistic studies and control experiments unequivocally establish the pivotal role of lithium iodide in ring&#8208;opening and generating an in situ enolate intermediate, facilitating efficient bisfunctionalization via electrophilic trapping. The operational simplicity, extensive substrate scope, and remarkable compatibility with late&#8208;stage functionalization significantly enhance the synthetic versatility and modularity of ABB&#8208;derived azetidines, presenting a powerful approach for rapidly assembling complex molecules containing azetidines.

Isotactic poly(cyclohexene carbonate) crystalizes both as enantiopure polymer and upon stereocomplexation of the two opposite enantiomers. Both structures are characterized by multiple H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C tight attractive interactions, whereas in the stereocomplex a tight interdigitation of the two enantiomeric chains occurs due to additional intimate dipole interactions between carbonyl groups of the opposite enantiomers.








Abstract
Enantiopure isotactic poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC) has been synthesized with chiral Zn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diiminate catalyst. PCHC crystallizes both as enantiopure polymer (R)&#8208;PCHC and (S)&#8208;PCHC and upon stereocomplexation of the two enantiomers. We report the crystal structures of the enantiopure polymer and of the stereocomplex (R/S)&#8208;PCHC and explain their crystallization based on the establishment of multiple attractive H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C interactions between oxygen atoms of carbonyl groups and the hydrogen atoms of the cyclohexyl rings and C&#9552;O&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;C&#9552;O intimate dipole interactions between carbonyl groups of chains of opposite chirality in the stereocomplex. The crystal structure of the enantiopure polymer is characterized by chains in 2/1 helical conformation packed in the orthorhombic unit cell with axes a&#160;=&#160;11.55&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;9.42&#160;&#197;, and c&#160;=&#160;7.36&#160;&#197;, according to the space group P212121, with steric interdigitation between chains of similar chirality favored by multiple attractive H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C interactions. The stereocomplex crystallizes in an orthorhombic unit cell with axes a&#160;=&#160;10.40&#160;&#197;, b&#160;=&#160;8.41&#160;&#197;, and c&#160;=&#160;7.36&#160;&#197;, according to the space group Pbc21, driven by establishment of additional C&#9552;O&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;C&#9552;O dipole interactions between carbonyl groups of chains of opposite chirality, besides of the multiple attractive H&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O&#9552;C interactions.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Dual Synergistic Interfacial Passivation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual synergistic interfacial passivation strategy using a tetrathiol&#8208;based molecule, pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) to enhance the ZnO/perovskite interface for application in inverted perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs). By incorporating PETMP, Pe&#8208;QLEDs achieved a record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.35%, accompanied by significantly enhanced device stability.








Abstract
Inverted perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;QLEDs) hold significant promise for next&#8208;generation displays due to their compatibility with n&#8208;type thin&#8208;film transistor&#8208;driven active&#8208;matrix panels, a critical advantage for industrial integration. However, interfacial reactions between the ZnO electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite quantum dots (Pe&#8208;QDs) induce severe degradation and fluorescence quenching, undermining device efficiency and operational stability. To resolve this, we introduce a dual synergistic interfacial passivation strategy employing pentaerythritol tetrakis(3&#8208;mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) as a multifunctional buffer layer. The PETMP layer addresses interfacial incompatibility through two synergistic mechanisms: (I) Thiol groups in PETMP form robust S&#9472;Zn bonds with the ZnO ETL, passivating surface oxygen vacancies, improving film morphology, and reducing the electron injection barrier. (II) Concurrently, these thiols coordinate with undercoordinated Pb ions on the Pe&#8208;QD surface, enhancing luminescence efficiency and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination. This dual synergistic passivation strategy yields inverted green Pe&#8208;QLEDs with a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 24.35%, doubling the performance of conventional devices using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) buffers (EQE&#160;=&#160;12.61%). Additionally, the optimized interface resulting from this strategy significantly enhances the operational stability of the devices. This work establishes PETMP&#8208;based passivation as a transformative approach for high&#8208;performance inverted Pe&#8208;QLEDs and other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Responsive Biomimetic Nanoplatelets for Thrombus&#8208;Mediated Photothermal Immunotherapy of Tumor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marginal tumor resistance in photothermal therapy is often overlooked due to unclear tumor boundaries, which can be fatal in aggressive tumor therapy. Here, we report reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive, self&#8208;recruiting nanoplatelets that effectively ablate internal tumors and starve marginal tumors via vascular occlusion under photoirradiation. This approach could assist in the treatment of postoperative recurrence, achieving an 80% inhibition rate in a patient&#8208;derived xenograft tumor model.








Abstract
One of the biggest advantages of photothermal therapy (PTT) as a compelling cancer treatment is its spatiotemporal nature. However, there are still significant challenges in completely eradicating tumors through PTT due to the unclear boundary between tumor and normal tissues. Here, we present a tumor vascular disruption strategy that leverages photothermally induced hemorrhage to enhance therapeutic efficacy through thrombosis&#8208;driven intensive PTT and peripheral tumor vascular embolization. A biomimetic nanoplatelet (PPIE@P), reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive nanogel scaffold loading with indocyanine green (ICG) and the coagulant etamsylate with platelet membrane camouflage, is developed. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, ICG&#8208;generated ROS trigger precise disintegration of PPIE@P, releasing the coagulant while producing hyperthermia that induces vascular injury and hemorrhage. This process activates the coagulation cascade and recruits additional nanoplatelets to the hemorrhagic tumor site. Subsequently, the penetrating ICG and coagulant&#8208;accelerated blood clots enable intense hyperthermia during a second photoirradiation, whereas embolization of peripheral tumor&#8208;associated vessels contributes to complete tumor eradication. Notably, this antiangiogenic PTT strategy also elicits a potent systematic immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and effector T&#8208;cell infiltration.

&lt;p&gt;Marginal tumor resistance in photothermal therapy is often overlooked due to unclear tumor boundaries, which can be fatal in aggressive tumor therapy. Here, we report reactive oxygen species-responsive, self-recruiting nanoplatelets that effectively ablate internal tumors and starve marginal tumors via vascular occlusion under photoirradiation. This approach could assist in the treatment of postoperative recurrence, achieving an 80% inhibition rate in a patient-derived xenograft tumor model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest advantages of photothermal therapy (PTT) as a compelling cancer treatment is its spatiotemporal nature. However, there are still significant challenges in completely eradicating tumors through PTT due to the unclear boundary between tumor and normal tissues. Here, we present a tumor vascular disruption strategy that leverages photothermally induced hemorrhage to enhance therapeutic efficacy through thrombosis-driven intensive PTT and peripheral tumor vascular embolization. A biomimetic nanoplatelet (PPIE@P), reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive nanogel scaffold loading with indocyanine green (ICG) and the coagulant etamsylate with platelet membrane camouflage, is developed. Upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, ICG-generated ROS trigger precise disintegration of PPIE@P, releasing the coagulant while producing hyperthermia that induces vascular injury and hemorrhage. This process activates the coagulation cascade and recruits additional nanoplatelets to the hemorrhagic tumor site. Subsequently, the penetrating ICG and coagulant-accelerated blood clots enable intense hyperthermia during a second photoirradiation, whereas embolization of peripheral tumor-associated vessels contributes to complete tumor eradication. Notably, this antiangiogenic PTT strategy also elicits a potent systematic immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and effector T-cell infiltration. Overall, this work introduces a thrombus-augmented PTT paradigm with strong potential for future clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Engineering and Modification of Non&#8208;Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases Based on Golden Gate Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Golden Gate Assembly (GGA)&#8208;based method was developed for the efficient assembly of natural and engineered non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). This method has enabled the creation of NRPS libraries to generate novel peptides in high&#8208;throughput as well as the targeted derivatisation of natural products (NPs).








Abstract
Non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) are multimodular enzymes that produce complex peptides with diverse biological activities, potentially being used as clinical drugs. However, the pharmaceutical applications of such natural peptides often require further derivatisation and modification of the peptide backbone, mainly performed by chemical synthesis. A sustainable alternative resembles the in vivo engineering of NRPS to change and modify the enzyme properties rationally and, thus, the produced products. The novel NRPS engineering approach, the eXchange Unit Thiolation domain (XUT) concept, allows the efficient modular assembly of different natural NRPS fragments to form hybrid NRPS that produce defined peptides. In this study, we describe a Golden Gate Assembly (GGA)&#8208;based method for efficient high&#8208;throughput generation of novel and engineered NRPS libraries utilising the XUT concept. This method was applied to generate over 100 novel NRPS with the possibility of changing starter, elongation, and termination modules, respectively. Additionally, we applied this method for targeted modification of the xenoamicin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) xabABCD from Xenorhabdus doucetiae, resulting in the generation of 25 novel xenoamicin derivatives.

A high&#8208;throughput and universal wafer&#8208;scale patterning integration of perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures, tunable crystal sizes, different band gaps, and substrates is demonstrated by the synergy of the stencil&#8208;assisted printing technique and fluid dynamics modulation. Pure crystallographic orientation, accurate positioning, and high&#8208;quality perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays empower low&#8208;threshold directional emission lasers and high&#8208;performance polarized photodetectors.








Abstract
Patterned perovskite arrays with subwavelength nanostructures have greatly accelerated the development of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional optoelectronic devices due to the strong light&#8208;matter interactions. However, the fabrication of perovskite subwavelength nanostructure devices suffers from polycrystalline structure, high cost, long cycle, and low throughput, which limits the application of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance, and multifunctional devices. In this study, we innovatively report a high&#8208;throughput and universal wafer&#8208;scale perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays processing method by synergy of stencil&#8208;assisted printing technique and fluid dynamics modulation, enabling the patterning of perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures, tunable crystal sizes, different band gaps, and substrates. Pure crystallographic orientation, accurate positioning, and high&#8208;quality perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures ensure the realization of a low&#8208;threshold and directional emission laser. Furthermore, high&#8208;performance polarized photodetectors were demonstrated based on single&#8208;crystal arrays with subwavelength nanostructures. This pioneering work provides a new strategy and opportunity for the wafer&#8208;scale integration of perovskite single&#8208;crystal functional optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Intergrowth of Prismatic and Octahedral Layers to Inhibit Fe Migration in Oxide Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;based layered oxide materials show promise as sustainable cathode in SIBs but are hindered by irreversible Fe migration. Maintaining a higher proportion of prismatic stacking layers at high charge voltages can prevent Fe migration to tetrahedral site and mitigate crack generation, thus preserving structure integrity and rendering excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;based layered oxides have emerged as promising sustainable cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their earth abundance. However, the oxidation of Fe3+ to Fe4+ is typically accompanied by its migration to Na layers for capacity and voltage decay. Herein, we demonstrated that Fe migration can be suppressed by modulating the prismatic (P) and octahedral (O) intergrowth at deeply charged states in O3&#8208;Na0.8Fe0.4Ni0.1Mn0.4M0.15O2 (M&#160;=&#160;Ca, Mg). The strong bonding of O2&#8722;&#9472;Ca2+&#9472;O2&#8722; in Na layers prevents the gliding of transition&#8208;metal (TM) layers and mitigates the P&#8208; to O&#8208;type stacking transition at&#160;&#8805;&#160;3.7&#160;V, which alleviates formation of vacant tetrahedra in O&#8208;type stacking structure to restrict Fe migration. At the same time, Mg incorporation in TM layers promotes an upward shift of Fe 3d states toward the Fermi level and facilitates the sluggish redox of Fe3+/Fe4+. These enable its high specific capacity of 136&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding cycling stability with capacity retention of 72% after 1000 cycles. This work paves the pathway for design of sustainable cathode materials for SIBs and beyond.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Phosphorus Anodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries via Tailored Reversible Na/Polyphosphide Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored and reversible Na2P16&#8596; Na3P reaction pathway is enabled by anchoring Na2P16 onto carbon cloth (CC) via P&#9472;O&#9472;C bonds and optmizing the electrolyte. These strategies overcome the kinetic and structural limitations of red phosphorus, yielding a composite anode with high areal capacity and long cycling stability, advancing the design of high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
To surmount the inherent limitations and fully harness the remarkable ultra&#8208;high specific capacity (2,596&#160;mAh g&#8722;1) of phosphorus (P) anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), we unveil an alternative fast and reversible electrochemical pathway based on Na2P16&#8596;Na3P, which transcends the barriers posed by sluggish reaction kinetics in solid&#8208;state red P. It entails the immobilization of dissolved sodium polyphosphide (Na2P16) onto carbon cloth (CC) matrices via robust C&#9472;O&#9472;P bonding (Na2P16@CC), and the intrinsic superior malleability of Na2P16 effectively mitigates the issue of electrode pulverization caused by volumetric changes of red P during (de)sodiation. Additionally, the profound chemical adsorption of surface oxygen&#8208;doped CC toward phosphorus species and the utilization of weakly solvating cyclic carbonate solvents synergistically inhibit the vexing dissolution of high&#8208;order polyphosphides in the electrolyte. By capitalizing on the advances of the novel reaction mechanism, the Na2P16@CC composite anode material achieves improved sodium storage performance with a high initial reversible capacity of 1.75&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a capacity retention of 81% over 600 cycles. This work opens an avenue toward the rational design of P&#8208;based anodes for high&#8208;energy SIBs.

It entails the immobilization of dissolved sodium polyphosphide (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;) onto carbon cloth (CC) matrices via robust C&#9472;O&#9472;P bonding (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;@CC), and the intrinsic superior malleability of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; effectively mitigates the issue of electrode pulverization caused by volumetric changes of red P during (de)sodiation. Additionally, the profound chemical adsorption of surface oxygen-doped CC toward phosphorus species and the utilization of weakly solvating cyclic carbonate solvents synergistically inhibit the vexing dissolution of high-order polyphosphides in the electrolyte. By capitalizing on the advances of the novel reaction mechanism, the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;@CC composite anode material achieves improved sodium storage performance with a high initial reversible capacity of 1.75&#160;mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a capacity retention of 81% over 600 cycles. This work opens an avenue toward the rational design of P-based anodes for high-energy SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly, Rearrangement, and Disassembly of {Cr6} Horseshoe Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS2), and low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we elucidate the self&#8208;assembly, rearrangement, and disassembly processes of polymetallic {Cr6}x (x&#160;=&#160;1 &#8211; 5) horseshoe oligomers.








Abstract
Molecular assemblies are commonly found in biological systems, and designing synthetic mimics of these is a challenge for modern chemistry. Here, we apply ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS), density functional theory (DFT), and mass&#8208;selective electrospray ion beam deposition followed by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to decipher the self&#8208;assembly, rearrangement, and disassembly processes of {Cr6}n horseshoe oligomers (n&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;5). Activated tandem IM&#8208;MS reveals the oligomer disassembly in detail, highlighting the stability of the dimer unit. When n&#160;=&#160;2 and n = 3 oligomers are deposited on surfaces, we observe the rearrangement of dimers and trimers to dimers of dimers, and at higher coverages, the formation of an unexpected hexagonal&#8208;like network. In its entirety, the experimental and computational data provide a convincing framework for the analysis of supramolecular assembly processes in noncrystalline phases that could be used in future design strategies.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Synthesis and Screening of a Cyanimide Library Identifies Selective Inhibitors of ISG15&#8208;Specific Protease mUSP18</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deubiquitinases (DUBs) and Ub&#8208;like proteases are attractive but challenging drug targets. We developed a high&#8208;throughput synthesis method and prepared a 7536&#8208;member cyanimide DUB&#8208;targeted compound library in 1536&#8208;well plates, using Echo acoustic dispensing. Screening yielded a selective, 35&#160;nM inhibitor of mUSP18, the main ISG15 protease. Treatment of interferon&#8208;stimulated EL4 cells with this inhibitor significantly enhanced ISGylation levels.








Abstract
High&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) of large compound collections is a critical early step in many drug discovery programs. Its success depends heavily on the quality of the compound libraries used, and as such, the development of targeted libraries has emerged to enhance the effectiveness of HTS efforts. However, the acquisition of such libraries remains costly and labor&#8208;intensive, often yielding compound quantities far exceeding required amounts. We present a high&#8208;throughput synthesis&#8208;to&#8208;screening method for the efficient in&#8208;plate generation and immediate HTS of a deubiquitinase (DUB)&#8208;focused compound library. Central to our approach is the Echo acoustic liquid handler, which transfers nanoliter volumes of DMSO&#8208;based solutions, facilitating miniaturized synthesis directly in 1536&#8208;well plates. We constructed a library of 7536 compounds featuring a DUB&#8208;privileged cyanimide warhead and screened against twelve ubiquitin(&#8208;like) proteases. This identified two structurally related molecules with selective inhibitory activity against the interferon&#8208;stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) protease mUSP18, which we further developed into a first&#8208;in&#8208;class mUSP18 inhibitor with 35&#160;nM potency. This compound, BB07CA902, demonstrated exceptional specificity for mUSP18 across 41 DUBs and effectively increased ISGylation levels in cells by inhibiting mUSP18 activity. Our technology enables the efficient preparation of large DUB&#8208;targeted cyanimide&#8208;based libraries, which will accelerate future DUB inhibitor development.

         <title>Linkage Multi&#8208;functionalization in Covalent Organic Frameworks via Criss&#8211;Cross 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functionalization of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has been achieved by the criss&#8211;cross 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition between azine linkages in the precursor COFs and alkynes carrying various functional groups. The general applicability and high efficiency of this method have been demonstrated by the synthesis of various COFs with excellent tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.








Abstract
Introducing functional groups to skeletons of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is fundamentally important to create specific properties and functions for this class of crystalline porous polymers. The strategy of multi&#8208;functionalization could introduce multiple functional groups in one&#8208;step but has rarely been developed for polymers. Herein, we report a novel linkage conversion strategy which could simultaneously install multiple functional groups into a single site of azine&#8208;linked COFs. This strategy is based on criss&#8211;cross 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition reaction between azine linkages in COFs and multifarious alkynes carrying different functional groups. Its general applicability and high efficiency have been demonstrated by the successful construction of more than 10 COFs with widespread functional groups, for which homo&#8208;type and hetero&#8208;type functional groups could be introduced. This study provides a general and powerful tool to introduce highly dense functional groups into nanopores of COFs, enabling the further exploration of their applications bestowed by the functional groups.

         <title>Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Ultrabright and Ultraphotostable NIR&#8208;II Emissive Water&#8208;Soluble Gold Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an illumination method to generate water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters with ultra&#8208;high NIR&#8208;II QY (&#8764;14% in H2O, &#8764;60% in D2O) and photostability (unchanged emission for hours). Photooxidation converts Au38(pMBA)24 to Au76(pMBA)44, enhancing emission via accelerated inter&#8208;system crossing, prolonged triplet lifetime, and suppressed nonradiative decay. This strategy provides a robust pathway to develop highly emissive photostable luminophores.








Abstract
The long&#8208;standing issues of photobleaching and low photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region greatly hinder the luminophore's downstream applications. Herein we developed an ingenious method of continuous light illumination to achieve water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters with both ultra&#8208;high QY in NIR&#8208;II region (&#8764;14% in H2O, &#8764;60% in D2O, the highest QY among NIR&#8208;II emitting water&#8208;soluble nanoclusters with typical QY&lt;1%) and ultra&#8208;high photostability where emission remained completely unchanged under several hours&#8217; illumination. Photooxidation&#8208;induced transformation of Au38(pMBA)24 to Au76(pMBA)44 (pMBA&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid) has been demonstrated to be the mechanism of the emission enhancement. The accelerated inter&#8208;system crossing rate, extended lowest triplet lifetime, and suppressed nonradiative decay collectively contribute to the higher QY of Au76(pMBA)44. This photooxidation strategy opens a new pathway to the development of more highly emissive and photostable luminophores.

Photooxidation-induced transformation of Au&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;(pMBA)&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; to Au&lt;sub&gt;76&lt;/sub&gt;(pMBA)&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt; (pMBA&#160;=&#160;4-mercaptobenzoic acid) has been demonstrated to be the mechanism of the emission enhancement. The accelerated inter-system crossing rate, extended lowest triplet lifetime, and suppressed nonradiative decay collectively contribute to the higher QY of Au&lt;sub&gt;76&lt;/sub&gt;(pMBA)&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;. This photooxidation strategy opens a new pathway to the development of more highly emissive and photostable luminophores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atomic Ni&#8208;N4 Biofuel Cell for Mimicking Intramolecular Electron&#8208;Harnessing of Laccase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C atomic unit installed in PAN&#8208;derived N&#8208;carbon electrode accelerates anodic oxidation of BPA in a BFC with an increased power density with increasing BPA concentration. A comparison of electrooxidation of BPA by LAC@ZIF&#8208;8 and Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC in BFCs suggests how a Ni&#8211;N4 atomic sites exhibit intramolecular electron harnessing like laccase enzyme, even without an external mediator such as ABTS and offers a concentration&#8208;dependent enhanced power density.








Abstract
Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC, consisting of an atomic Ni&#8211;N4&#160;site, mimics the intramolecular electron&#8208;harnessing of natural laccase (LAC) confined in a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (LAC@ZIF&#8208;8) for anodic electrooxidation of bisphenol&#8208;A (BPA). We have introduced a facile &#960;&#8208;conjugated unit of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;resorcinol&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped conjugated &#8208;C&#8801;N. The atomically dispersed Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom in Ni&#8211;N4&#8208; PAN&#8211;NC exhibits high activity for the paired electrolysis of ORR and the electrooxidation of BPA with an enhanced current density. The single Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC electrode effectively withdraws the electrons from electrooxidizing BPA due to a built&#8208;in electric field via incorporation of Ni&#8211;N4. The paired electrolysis of Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC biofuel cells is determined by LSV, EIS, and power&#8208;polarization curve&#160;for anodic electrooxidation of BPA. Machine learning molecular dynamics (ML&#8208;MD) simulation depicts non&#8208;covalent interaction (hydrogen bonding) between the O&#8208;hydroxyl of BPA and the N of the Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC, suggesting&#160;preferential adsorption&#160;on&#160;the Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;PAN&#8211;NC surface via weak van der Waals interactions and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between the aromatic rings of BPA and the conjugated PAN&#8208;NC. An increased power density with increased concentration of BPA in the absence of ABTS suggests a DET mechanism of BPA electrooxidation on Ni&#8211;N4, unlike a MET in the presence of ABTS when using LAC@ZIF&#8208;8. Thus, single atomic&#160;Ni&#160;&#8722;&#160;N4&#160;opens avenues with&#160;a DET mechanism.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Excited&#8208;State Dipole Moment: Governing Non&#8208;Sacrificial H2O2 Generation on Porphyrin Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The H2O2 generation rate of porphyrin&#8208;based photocatalysts correlates strongly with their excited&#8208;state dipole moment (&#181;e), rather than the traditionally emphasized ground&#8208;state dipole moment (&#181;g) or the number of carboxyl groups. Porphyrins exhibit prolonged exciton lifetime (&#8764;5&#160;ns), in contrast to the sub&#8208;nanoseconds typically in inorganic photocatalysts, thereby providing sufficient time for &#181;e&#160;formation.








Abstract
H2O2 production via the simultaneous oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) on organic photocatalysts theoretically achieves 100% atom economy. However, the charge separation and transfer mechanism in such organic systems remains poorly understood, especially as organic molecular designs based on ground&#8208;state dipole moments (&#181;g) often fail to predict photocatalytic behavior. Here, we synthesize a series of carboxyl&#8208;modified tetraphenylporphyrin supramolecular photocatalysts (TPP&#8208;(COOH)n, where n&#160;=&#160;1&#8764;4, 8) to investigate the structure&#8208;activity relationship. The H2O2 generation activity follows the order TPP&#8208;(COOH)2&#160;&lt;&#160;TPP&#8208;(COOH) &lt; TPP&#8208;(COOH)3&#160;&lt;&#160;TPP&#8208;(COOH)8&#160;&lt;&#160;TPP&#8208;(COOH)4, increasing with the excited&#8208;state dipole moment (&#181;e) rather than the traditionally considered &#181;g or number of &#8208;COOH groups. The &#181;e, influenced by O 2p&#8208;band center shifts from carboxyl substitution, is demonstrated to govern the charge separation and transfer via an internal electric field. Moreover, exciton dissociation studies indicated that low&#8208;dielectric TPP&#8208;(COOH)n exhibits notably prolonged excitonic lifetimes (ca. 5&#160;ns), making &#181;e the key activity determinant. Based on this insight, we designed a high&#8208;&#181;e phthalocyanine supramolecular photocatalyst (H2Pc(COOH)8), achieving an unprecedented H2O2 production rate of 58 mM&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;g&#8722;1 and a quantum efficiency (QE) of 18.7% at 420&#160;nm. This study establishes &#181;e as a predictive parameter for H2O2 generation on organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Choline Iodide&#8208;Mediated Sulfur Conversion and Zinc Plating/Stripping Chemistry in Aqueous Zn&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Choline iodide (ChI), as an electrolyte additive, enables aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries to achieve low polarization and prolonged cycle life. Coupled with the catalytic effect of I&#8722; during charging, Ch+ not only accelerates the reaction kinetics of the discharge process by generating highly active intermediates, but also inhibits polyiodide shuttling through its adsorption on the zinc anode surface. 








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;S batteries are promising candidates for future energy storage due to their intrinsic safety, environmental friendliness, and low cost. However, their practical application is hindered by sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and rapid zinc anode degradation. Here, we introduce choline iodide (ChI) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive that enables bidirectional catalysis of sulfur conversion and simultaneous protection of the zinc anode. During discharge, Ch+ promotes the formation of soluble polysulfide intermediates, which rapidly combine with Zn2+ to form ZnS via a solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid pathway, accelerating reaction kinetics. During charge, iodine species catalyze the conversion of ZnS back to sulfur. Moreover, Ch+ adsorbs on the zinc anode, suppressing dendrite growth and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Importantly, Ch+ also inhibits polyiodide shuttling at high iodine concentrations, maximizing catalytic efficiency. Coupled with a CoNC solid&#8208;phase catalyst, the Zn&#8211;S cell achieves a record&#8208;low polarization of 0.26&#160;V at 0.1&#160;C, delivers 780&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C, and maintains 380&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 5500 cycles.

         <title>Activating Co2+/Co3+ Redox Couple Mediated&#8208;Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethyl Furfuryl Under Low Potentials</title>

Oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption of OH&#8722; on F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4, while the highly electronegative lattice F atoms enhance the oxidability of Co3+&#8208;OHads. This synergy enables F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 to catalyze the low&#8208;potential eHMFOR mediated by the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple.








Abstract
Cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalysts are promising candidates for electrochemical 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (eHMFOR). However, the activity origin for eHMFOR on most cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalysts is the Co3+/Co4+ redox couple at the high&#8208;potential window, instead of the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple at the low&#8208;potential window, thus leading to a high onset potential above 1.3&#160;V. Herein, we developed F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 catalyst containing abound oxygen vacancies and lattice fluorine (F) heteroatom, which activates the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple for eHMFOR at the low&#8208;potential window, e.g., 1.15&#160;V. Oxygen vacancies prompt the electrochemical generation of Co3+&#8208;OHads at low potentials, and meanwhile, lattice F heteroatoms enhance the electrophilicity of Co3+&#8208;OHads. Benefiting by those unique structure, F&#8208;VO&#8208;CoMoO4 catalyst effectively electro&#8208;synthesizes 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid from 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural, with a high yield (95.3%) and Faradaic efficiency (96.1%). This work provides an intelligent strategy for achieving the low&#8208;potential eHMFOR mediated by the Co2+/Co3+ redox couple, unlocking significant potential for reducing the energy consumption in biomass conversion.

         <title>Methanol Upcycling Toward Glycolaldehyde Synthesis Enabled by New High&#8208;Performance Photoredox Route</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We for the first time identify a new high&#8208;performance selective photoredox route to glycolaldehyde (GA) synthesis via dehydrogenation C&#9472;C coupling of methanol paired with H2 production over the Ni&#8208;decorated ZnIn2S4 (Ni/ZIS) catalyst. The optimal apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 22% for GA production is achieved at &#955; = 360&#160;nm, reaching the highest literature value in the field of photocatalytic methanol conversion. 








Abstract
Glycolaldehyde (GA) possesses great potential to serve as the feedstock for the C2&#8208;based chemical industry and plays a vital role in the fabrication of pharmaceuticals and various chemicals. However, conventional GA synthesis methods suffer from harsh reaction conditions, low selectivity, and high purification costs. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate a new photoredox&#8208;catalyzed high&#8208;performance route toward dehydrogenative C&#9472;C coupling of methanol into GA paired with H2 generation over Ni&#8208;decorated ZnIn2S4, presenting an essentially untapped photocatalytic tactic for selective GA synthesis. Specifically, GA is formed with the production rate of 30.0 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and the selectivity of 94% and the optimal apparent quantum yield at &#955; = 360&#160;nm reaches 22%, the highest value reported to date for selective photocatalytic methanol conversion to GA. Mechanistic studies reveal that the decoration of Ni facilitates interfacial charge separation and transfer and promotes the formation of key radical intermediates of &#8226;CH2OH and &#8226;OCH3 for GA production. This work offers a conceptually new photocatalytic approach for the efficient and sustainable production of GA and enriches the content of methanol upcycling chemistry.

A novel type of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) asymmetric POM&#8211;LDH single&#8208;layered nanosheets, denoted as APLNs, was fabricated by an interfacial assembly approach. These APLNs not only visualized and quantified the charge distribution on 2D surfaces but also exhibited enhanced 2&#8208;electron selectivity in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Constructing two&#8208;dimensional (2D) asymmetric single&#8208;layered nanosheets (2D ASNs) with anisotropic microstructures, intrinsic gradient electric field, and unprecedented energy conversion efficiency remains a great challenge. Here, we present an interfacial&#8208;assisted out&#8208;of&#8208;plane assembly method to synthesize a novel type of 2D ASNs composed of layered double hydroxide (LDH), polyoxometalate (POM), and dioctadecyldimethylammonium. The synthesized asymmetric POM&#8211;LDH single&#8208;layered nanosheets (APLNs) exhibited two distinct surfaces: one with hydrophilic Mg(Al)&#8211;OH groups and the other with hydrophobic alkyl chains. Molecular dynamics simulations elucidated that the strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electrostatic forces drive the assembly process and stabilize the asymmetric structures. By varying the size and charges of POMs, we observed a consistent 1: 2 charge ratio between each POM and its corresponding occupied LDH laminate area. This finding was further validated by visualizing the distribution of electron&#8208;rich POMs through transmission electron microscopy, inferring that the surface charge distributions on the 2D surfaces could be quantified and visualized. When applied to the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction, the hydrophobic surface of the APLNs demonstrated the H2O2 selectivity of &#8764;90% compared to that of &#8764;50% for the hydrophilic surface, highlighting the crucial role of the distinct surface properties in modulating the reaction pathway and product selectivity.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Recognition of Inosine&#8208;Modified RNA by Deoxyribozyme with Distant Cleavage Site</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme, named RCD&#8208;I4T3,&#160;was identified through in vitro selection that specifically recognizes inosine&#8208;modified RNA and cleaves at a distant position, representing the first DNAzyme with spatially separated recognition and cleavage domains.








Abstract
We report an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme (RCD), RCD&#8208;I4T3, discovered through in vitro selection, that can specifically recognize an inosine&#8208;modified site in RNA and cleave at a remote site (eight nucleotides downstream of the inosine). RCD&#8208;I4T3 represents the first DNAzyme with spatially separated domains for target recognition and catalytic cleavage, functionally analogous to Type IIS restriction endonucleases and endonuclease V, which is not previously observed in DNA catalysts. The RCD&#8208;I4T3 serves as a potent RNA&#8208;cleaving tool, exhibiting an observed rate constant (kobs) of 1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 min&#8722;1 for inosine&#8208;modified RNA, and successfully targeting natural inosine&#8208;containing mRNA fragments with high specificity. This modular architecture minimizes the off&#8208;target activity through stringent two&#8208;step validation (i.e., recognition and cleavage) and enables independent functional optimization. The unique structural and mechanistic features of RCD&#8208;I4T3 expand the functional repertoire of DNAzymes for biological applications.

         <title>A Reversible Chemoenzymatic Labeling Strategy for Profiling of Protein O&#8208;Glucosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible chemoenzymatic labeling strategy for the efficient analysis of protein O&#8208;Glc was developed, and numerous canonical and noncanonical O&#8208;Glc modifications were identified across human cell lines with mass spectrometry (MS) technology, suggesting protein O&#8208;Glc is a widespread post&#8208;translational protein modification.








Abstract
O&#8208;linked glucose (O&#8208;Glc), the &#946;&#8208;linked modification of serine residues, is a rare form of protein glycosylation first identified on proteins containing epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;like domains (canonical O&#8208;Glc). Several recent studies revealed that proteins lacking EGF&#8208;like domains could also undergo O&#8208;Glc modification (noncanonical O&#8208;Glc). However, the biosynthetic origin and biological function of protein O&#8208;glucosylation remain poorly understood and debated, owing to the lack of effective analytical tools. Here, a reversible chemoenzymatic labeling strategy for O&#8208;Glc analysis is described. By the strategy described, a large number of canonical and noncanonical O&#8208;Glc sites were identified in human cell lines, indicating that protein O&#8208;Glc is a widespread post&#8208;translational protein modification.

         <title>Crafting Immune&#8208;Cancer Cell Crosstalk via Modular Multilayer Logic DNA Nanoadaptors</title>

We present a modular DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) featuring multi&#8208;port scaffold and plug&#8208;and&#8208;play connectors that programs immune&#8208;cancer cell interactions via customizable multilayer logic gates responding to cellular antigens and microenvironmental cues, enabling on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing.








Abstract
Synthetic molecular recognition tools offer a promising approach to reconfigure cell&#8208;cell interactions, but engineering user&#8208;defined logic circuits to control intercellular communication in heterogeneous microenvironments endures as a critical barrier. Herein, we present a multilayer logic DNA nanoadaptor (Magic&#8208;NA) to define immune&#8208;cancer cell crosstalk by a customized logic operation of multiple variables, including cell surface antigens and microenvironmental characteristics. The modular Magic&#8208;NA consists of a DNA di&#8208;tetrahedral scaffold featuring three ports at each terminal. These ports can be interfaced with a library of plug&#8208;and&#8208;play logic connectors specifically activated by molecular triggers and targeted to desired cells, enabling programmable design of both logic circuits and inputs. We demonstrated an AND&#8208;AND logic network in Magic&#8208;NA that guides natural killer (NK) cells to target cells for selective cytotoxicity, based on tumor microenvironment (TME) acidic pH, and cellular antigens PTK7 and MUC1. Furthermore, leveraging the multi&#8208;port design, we implemented an OR&#8208;AND logic gate system to achieve on&#8208;demand cell targeting and broad&#8208;spectrum cell killing. This nanoplatform provides a paradigm for manipulating cellular interactions through Boolean integration of cell&#8208;intrinsic markers and microenvironmental cues, advancing the development of precision cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Statistical Sampling&#8208;Driven Design for Supported Bimetallic Nanocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A statistical sampling&#8208;driven strategy through the gas&#8211;solid nanoreactor approach was developed to rationally guide the preparation of bimetallic nanocatalysts on the basis of the comparative ease of bimetal alloy formation. Over metal oxide&#8208;supported PdAu&#8208;catalyzed model CO2 reduction reactions, the results not only realize the preparation of the alloy or phase separation of supported PdAu, but also unveil the key factors governing the activity and product selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation.








Abstract
Tailoring supported bimetals to alloyed or phase&#8208;separated structures is of vital importance while this process is blocked by the support interferences during universal impregnation processes. Conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approaches rooted in chemical intuition often lack efficiency and generality. Here, we present a design strategy guided by the statistical sampling of comparative ease of alloy formation through the metadynamics&#8208;based gas&#8211;solid nanoreactor approach, which enables the rational and systematic development of bimetallic nanocatalysts (NCs). Using metal oxide&#8208;supported PdAu coupling with model CO2 reduction as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system, the integrated theoretical and experimental results not only validated the reliability of simulation results but also successfully predicted and realized the alloy formation or phase separation of supported PdAu NCs. The generated PdAu alloys over CeO2 weaken the metallicity of supported Pd species and thus the catalytic hydrogenation property, but increase moderate basicity, contributing to activated CO2 hydrogenation to CO via a formate intermediate. However, the phase separation of Pd and Au over TiO2 support promotes formic acid production efficiency attributed to increasing weak basicity to accelerate CO2 activation during a bicarbonate pathway. These findings highlight statistical sampling as a general broadly applicable framework for the rational design of advanced bimetallic NCs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Stabilized Heterometallic Pair Sites for Selective Ethanol Dehydrogenation on Pt&#8211;Cr&#8211;Ag Alloy Catalysts</title>

Trimetallic PtxCrxAg1&#8208;x (x &lt; 0.1) alloys feature active Pt&#8211;Cr pairs for non&#8208;oxidative ethanol dehydrogenation. Operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy confirms the preferential formation of Pt&#8211;Cr pairs dispersed throughout an Ag matrix and demonstrates that the Pt&#8211;Cr sites have high activity and selectivity for catalytic ethanol dehydrogenation, while suppressing reactions that deactivate binary Pt&#8211;Ag and Cr&#8211;Ag alloys.








Abstract
Self&#8208;stabilized, heterometallic pair&#8208;sites can enable fine&#8208;tuning of catalytic functionality while also mitigating dynamic structural changes that degrade catalytic performance. This study demonstrates the development and characterization of trimetallic PtxCrxAg1&#8208;2x (x &#8804; 0.1) alloys with active Pt&#8211;Cr pair&#8208;ensembles for non&#8208;oxidative ethanol dehydrogenation, leveraging predictions that favorable bonding stabilizes Pt&#8211;Cr pairs diluted in Ag. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the preferential formation and stability of Pt&#8211;Cr pairings dispersed throughout the Ag matrix, and ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that Pt&#8211;Cr sites have significant activity for ethanol dehydrogenation, while suppressing reaction processes that deactivate binary Pt&#8211;Ag and Cr&#8211;Ag alloys. This work demonstrates that stabilizing heterometallic pair sites within trimetallic alloys provides a new avenue for designing catalysts with discrete active sites that are durable and highly selective.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Planar Ge(IV)O4 Linkers in Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Anodic Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two dimensional fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with novel planar redox active Ge(IV)O4 linkers have been fabricated, which show the thus far reported best anodic Na+ storage performance with high reversible specific capacities and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for ion storage usually suffer from the employment of inactive linking units and intrinsically lower conductivity than 10&#8722;6&#160;S cm&#8722;1, resulting in significant specific capacity loss. Developing COFs with redox&#8208;active linkers in addition to the functional building blocks and highly intra&#8208;layer conjugated electronic structure for enhanced conductivity is therefore crucial toward enhancing ion storage capacity. Herein, two dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine&#8208;based (Pc&#8208;based) COFs, GeO4&#8208;MPc&#8208;COFs (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, and Zn), with redox&#8208;active Ge(IV)O4 linkers and multiple active sites in the functional Pc building blocks were fabricated from octahydroxylphthalocyaninato metal complexes MPc(OH)8 and GeO2. The planar arrangement of Ge(IV)O4 moieties induces significantly p&#8211;&#960; interaction between Ge(IV)O4 moieties and Pc macrocycles, facilitating the delocalization of &#960; electrons throughout the 2D networks of GeO4&#8208;MPc&#8208;COFs and resulting in an impressive conductivity of 0.14&#8211;0.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;S cm&#8722;1. This, in combination with the reversible redox activity of Ge(IV)O4 linkers and N&#8208;rich Pc building blocks in the GeO4&#8208;MPc&#8208;COFs, leads to outstanding anodic Na+ storage performance with a high reversible specific capacity (607&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling stability (only 0.00057% capacity decay per cycle during 4,000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 5&#160;A g&#8722;1), representing the thus far reported best performance.

&lt;p&gt;Two dimensional fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with novel planar redox active Ge(IV)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; linkers have been fabricated, which show the thus far reported best anodic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage performance with high reversible specific capacities and excellent cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for ion storage usually suffer from the employment of inactive linking units and intrinsically lower conductivity than 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in significant specific capacity loss. Developing COFs with redox-active linkers in addition to the functional building blocks and highly intra-layer conjugated electronic structure for enhanced conductivity is therefore crucial toward enhancing ion storage capacity. Herein, two dimensional (2D) phthalocyanine-based (Pc-based) COFs, GeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-MPc-COFs (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Ni, and Zn), with redox-active Ge(IV)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; linkers and multiple active sites in the functional Pc building blocks were fabricated from octahydroxylphthalocyaninato metal complexes MPc(OH)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The planar arrangement of Ge(IV)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moieties induces significantly p&#8211;&#960; interaction between Ge(IV)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; moieties and Pc macrocycles, facilitating the delocalization of &#960; electrons throughout the 2D networks of GeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-MPc-COFs and resulting in an impressive conductivity of 0.14&#8211;0.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This, in combination with the reversible redox activity of Ge(IV)O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; linkers and N-rich Pc building blocks in the GeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-MPc-COFs, leads to outstanding anodic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage performance with a high reversible specific capacity (607&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 100&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent cycling stability (only 0.00057% capacity decay per cycle during 4,000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 5&#160;A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), representing the thus far reported best performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressed Concentration Quenching Via Divalent Eu/Sr Alloying in Hybrid Iodides Scintillators Toward Bright Luminescence for X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>

Divalent Eu/Sr&#8208;based bimetallic hybrid iodide scintillators exhibit 1D [Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI6]4&#8722; octahedra chains, suppressing nonradiative energy loss effectively by maintaining optimal spacing and dispersion between adjacent Eu(II) emission centers. The suppressed quenching benefits to realize a high PLQY to 92.2%, excellent LY of 54&#160;000 &#177; 300&#160;ph MeV&#8722;1 and extremely low detection limits of 49.9 nGy s&#8722;1. The large&#8208;area ceramic wafer counterparts demonstrate high resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 15.7&#8201;lp&#8201;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Overcoming concentration quenching in rare&#8208;earth&#8208;activated luminescent materials always remains a challenge for enhancing photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Herein, we report two divalent Sr&#8208;based hybrid iodides, (Ph3MeP)SrI3 and (Ph3EtP)SrI3 (Ph3MeP&#160;=&#160;methyltriphenylphosphonium, Ph3EtP&#160;=&#160;ethyltriphenylphosphonium), and equivalent Eu/Sr alloying have been identified experimentally in the full range of 0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;1 for (Ph3MeP)Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI3 and (Ph3EtP)Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI3. These Eu/Sr&#8208;based hybrid iodides exhibit 1D [Sr(1&#8208;x)EuxI6]4&#8722; octahedra chains, suppressing nonradiative energy loss effectively by maintaining optimal spacing and dispersion between adjacent Eu(II) emission centers. Upon even heavily Eu(II) alloying, (Ph3MeP)Sr0.5Eu0.5I3 exhibits efficient green emission (&#955;em = 525&#160;nm) with a high PLQY of &#8764;92.2%. Accordingly, it achieves a high scintillation light yield of 54&#160;000 &#177; 300&#160;ph MeV&#8722;1 and a low detection limit of 49.9 nGy s&#8722;1. Furthermore, ceramic wafers counterparts of Eu/Sr alloy prepared via cold sintering process demonstrate high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 15.7 lp mm&#8722;1. These findings not only present a new family of hybrid bimetallic iodides via Eu/Sr alloying, but also provides structurally guided strategy to suppress concentration quenching toward bright luminescence for scintillation applications.

         <title>Discovery of a Serine&#8208;Directed Chemical Reaction for Site&#8208;Specific Protein Modification via Phage Display Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces CuII&#8208;assisted serine arylation (CASA), a serine&#8208;selective protein modification method discovered through phage display technology. Unlike traditional approaches requiring unnatural amino acids, CASA employs a CuII&#8208;mediated hydroxyl&#8208;arylation reaction to precisely target single serine residues within complex proteins. By enabling rapid protein labeling, CASA also streamlines the production of homogeneous antibody&#8211;drug conjugates with enhanced therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Conventional biocompatible chemistry typically depends on unnatural functional groups, such as alkynes and azides. Here, we present a natural amino acid&#8208;based alternative by leveraging phage display to discover CuII&#8208;assisted serine arylation (CASA), a serine&#8208;selective strategy for chemical protein modification, achieved through a CuII&#8208;mediated hydroxyl&#8208;arylation reaction. CASA enables fast and precise modification of a single serine hydroxyl group within complex proteins while leaving the other amino acids, including serines at other sites, unmodified. CASA demonstrates robust performance in on&#8208;demand modification of diverse recombinant proteins, including therapeutic antibodies, with single&#8208;residue precision. The system's ability to selectively target individual proteins within crude cell lysates suggests its potential for applications in complex biological environments and positions it as a versatile tool for protein engineering.

This study introduces a &#8220;waste&#8208;to&#8208;wealth&#8221; approach by converting hazardous nickel&#8208;laden waste into atomically precise single&#8208;site Ni&#8211;S4 catalysts via molecular engineering. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional industrial capacity, achieving &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency and high H2O2 yield rates (&gt;70&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), enabling sustainable applications in textile bleaching and wastewater remediation.








Abstract
The persistent environmental threat posed by nickel&#8208;laden industrial wastewater demands advanced strategies beyond conventional treatment&#8208;and&#8208;dispose methods. Here, we propose a coordination chemistry&#8208;guided approach to molecularly engineer nickel complexes from wastewater into single&#8208;site electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR). By precisely tailoring the ligand fields using sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate (SDD), the derived SDD&#8208;Ni catalyst exhibits&#160;&gt;95% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2 synthesis across industrial&#8208;level current densities (200&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) in flow&#8208;cell. Notably, at 781&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the catalyst delivers a record H2O2 productivity of 70.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Real&#8208;wastewater&#8208;derived SDD&#8208;Ni catalysts showed similar performance and sustained &gt;450&#160;h stability in continuous flow&#8208;cell operation, underscoring their practical feasibility. Mechanistic studies reveal that the square&#8208;planar Ni&#8211;S4 coordination structure enables end&#8208;on O2 adsorption and optimal *OOH intermediates binding, ensuring exceptional 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity. This work provides a molecular&#8208;level solution for decentralized H2O2 production by repurposing hazardous Ni wastes into high&#8208;value electrocatalytic systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The persistent environmental threat posed by nickel-laden industrial wastewater demands advanced strategies beyond conventional treatment-and-dispose methods. Here, we propose a coordination chemistry-guided approach to molecularly engineer nickel complexes from wastewater into single-site electrocatalysts for the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR). By precisely tailoring the ligand fields using sodium dimethyl dithiocarbamate (SDD), the derived SDD-Ni catalyst exhibits&#160;&amp;gt;95% Faradaic efficiency for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis across industrial-level current densities (200&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in flow-cell. Notably, at 781&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the catalyst delivers a record H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; productivity of 70.75&#160;mol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Real-wastewater-derived SDD-Ni catalysts showed similar performance and sustained &amp;gt;450&#160;h stability in continuous flow-cell operation, underscoring their practical feasibility. Mechanistic studies reveal that the square-planar Ni&#8211;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; coordination structure enables end-on O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and optimal *OOH intermediates binding, ensuring exceptional 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR selectivity. This work provides a molecular-level solution for decentralized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production by repurposing hazardous Ni wastes into high-value electrocatalytic systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimensionality&#8208;Dependent Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Memory in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals a dimensionality&#8208;dependent pressure&#8208;induced emission memory in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Only one&#8208;dimensional (1D) COFs retain a persistent fluorescence enhancement after pressure release, a phenomenon originating from anisotropic contraction and conformational locking of flexible linkages.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials with memory effects hold significant promise for advanced applications in optical data storage and pressure sensing. We present the first crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibiting a pressure&#8208;induced emission memory effect, characterized by persistent pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE) that remains after decompression. Through the synthesis of a dimensional series of tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based COFs&#8212;JUC&#8208;730 and JUC&#8208;731 (one&#8208;dimensional, 1D), JUC&#8208;732 (two&#8208;dimensional, 2D), and JUC&#8208;733 (three&#8208;dimensional, 3D)&#8212;we systematically investigated how framework dimensionality governs photophysical responses under hydrostatic pressure. Remarkably, the 1D COFs exhibit pronounced PIEE, with JUC&#8208;730 retaining a 2.4&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement post&#8208;decompression, representing the first observation of an emission memory effect in COFs.&#160;In situ&#160;FT&#8208;IR, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), and DFT analyses demonstrate that this memory effect originates from anisotropic unit&#8208;cell contraction, facilitated by conformational locking of flexible aryl&#8211;O&#8211;aryl (C&#8211;O&#8211;C) linkages in JUC&#8208;730, which results in a binding energy of &#8764;4.79&#160;eV that stabilizes the emissive state. By contrast, the 2D and 3D COFs either undergo fluorescence quenching or fail to retain emission enhancement due to irreversible structural changes. These results establish a clear structure&#8211;dimensionality&#8211;function relationship and provide a design strategy for mechanically programmable luminescent materials with tailored pressure&#8208;responsive properties.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Tolerant and Scalable Diffusio&#8211;Osmotic Power Generation with Sulfonated Covalent Organic Framework Membrane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the harvesting of salinity gradient energy via diffusio&#8211;osmosis. This approach eliminates the need of selectivity and thus overcomes the permeability&#8211;selectivity trade&#8208;off and concentration polarization, showing high power density and scalability. Notably, our material maintains power generation even with substantial pinholes, simplifying membrane fabrication than before.








Abstract
Salinity gradient energy extracted with the reverse electrodialysis technique is attracting great interest and has been suggested as a promising renewable and stable energy source. However, the reverse electrodialysis relies on highly charge&#8208;selective membranes, causing a range of problems including the selectivity&#8211;permeability trade&#8208;off, strong concentration polarization, and strict requirement on the material structure, severely limiting its viability for large scale applications. We demonstrate these problems may be addressed by adopting the diffusio&#8211;osmosis process to generate power using sulfonated covalent framework membranes (COF), which does not require any charge selectivity. As a result, the membrane shows much higher power density compared to similar&#8208;sized membranes and enables much higher scalability. Remarkably, the generator has loose requirement on material structure and could largely maintain its power generation performance even when a substantial number of pinholes are present. This could make the material fabrication significantly easier than before. We expect our work to advance the practical application of salinity gradient energy extraction.

         <title>In Situ Chemical Construction of Ultrathin Zn2+&#8208;Conductive Interphase for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;thin zinc&#8208;polyphosphate/g&#8208;C3N4 (PPAG) artificial interphase was constructed on Zn foil. This hybrid architecture integrates chain&#8208;structured polyphosphates with g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;induced negative microelectric fields, creating Zn2+&#8208;selective ion pathways, which ensures desolvation effect and uniform Zn2+ deposition. Consequently, the engineered Zn@PPAG electrode exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance, surpassing that of most reported artificial interfacial layers.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc (Zn) interfacial chemistry is inherently safe but encounters significant challenges with irreversibility, as exemplified by low Coulombic efficiency (CE) and uncontrollable deposition. Here, an ultra&#8208;thin electrode skin, merely &#8764;100&#160;nm thick and composed of zinc&#8208;polyphosphate and graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) (denoted as PPAG) has been in situ constructed on the Zn anode surface through an ultrafast chemical synthesis. The PPAG layer integrates chain&#8208;like polyphosphate architectures with a ring&#8208;shaped negative microelectric field generated by g&#8208;C3N4, synergistically enabling Zn2+&#8208;dominated charge transport. This unique configuration facilitates long&#8208;range and rapid movement of cations, thereby increasing the Zn2+ transference number from 0.34 (bare Zn) to 0.70, ensuring high&#8208;current operation of the Zn anode. Moreover, the homogeneous dispersion of g&#8208;C3N4 within PPAG provides abundant nucleation sites, simultaneously enabling smooth Zn2+ deposition and suppressing parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@PPAG||Cu half&#8208;cell achieves exceptional cyclability with a CE of 99.67% over 2900 cycles. Furthermore, symmetric cells demonstrate a superior cycling lifespan exceeding 3800 and 1500&#160;h at current densities of 5.0 and 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work establishes a universal ultrafast strategy for Zn anode engineering, accelerating practical applications of Zn&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Discovery of Antivirulence ClpP Inhibitors by Self&#8208;Resistance Gene&#8208;Guided Mining Coupled with Dual Functional Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Streptoclipamide A, a potent ClpP inhibitor (IC50&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM), was discovered by self&#8208;resistance&#8208;guided genome mining coupled with dual functional screening. It uniquely suppresses MRSA virulence toxins without growth inhibition and synergizes with vancomycin in murine pneumonia. This work expands the ClpP inhibitor arsenal and provides a blueprint for resistance&#8208;conscious antimicrobial development.








Abstract
The global threat of MRSA demands innovative anti&#8208;virulence strategies. Caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), a central virulence regulator in MRSA, represents an attractive yet underexploited target. Here, we developed a discovery platform integrating self&#8208;resistance gene&#8208;guided genome mining with dual functional screening, combining fluorometric&#8208;based assay and counter&#8208;screening against ADEP&#8208;induced ClpP activation. This led to the discovery of streptoclipamides A&#8211;G, novel hybrid polyketide&#8208;nonribosomal peptide ClpP inhibitors from str BGC, validated via heterologous expression and gene knockout. Structure&#8211;activity relationship studies enabled by engineered analogues identified key pharmacophores. Streptoclipamide A potently inhibits ClpP (IC50&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM) by engaging Thr72 via its C&#8208;21 hydroxyl group, confirmed by biophysics and self&#8208;resistance&#8208;conferring T72P mutation. Streptoclipamide A suppressed MRSA virulence in vitro by reducing critical toxin production, including &#945;&#8208;hemolysin, and demonstrated protection in Galleria mellonella and murine pneumonia models. This work expands chemical diversity of ClpP&#8208;targeting agents, and establishes a genome mining&#8208;driven platform for discovering new therapeutics against antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens.

It uniquely suppresses MRSA virulence toxins without growth inhibition and synergizes with vancomycin in murine pneumonia. This work expands the ClpP inhibitor arsenal and provides a blueprint for resistance-conscious antimicrobial development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global threat of MRSA demands innovative anti-virulence strategies. Caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP), a central virulence regulator in MRSA, represents an attractive yet underexploited target. Here, we developed a discovery platform integrating self-resistance gene-guided genome mining with dual functional screening, combining fluorometric-based assay and counter-screening against ADEP-induced ClpP activation. This led to the discovery of streptoclipamides A&#8211;G, novel hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptide ClpP inhibitors from &lt;i&gt;str&lt;/i&gt; BGC, validated via heterologous expression and gene knockout. Structure&#8211;activity relationship studies enabled by engineered analogues identified key pharmacophores. Streptoclipamide A potently inhibits ClpP (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;480&#160;nM) by engaging Thr72 via its C-21 hydroxyl group, confirmed by biophysics and self-resistance-conferring T72P mutation. Streptoclipamide A suppressed MRSA virulence in vitro by reducing critical toxin production, including &#945;-hemolysin, and demonstrated protection in &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; and murine pneumonia models. This work expands chemical diversity of ClpP-targeting agents, and establishes a genome mining-driven platform for discovering new therapeutics against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Identification of a Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting&#8208;Chimera that Addresses Activated Checkpoint Kinase&#8208;1 Reveals its Non&#8208;Catalytic Functions in Tumor Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
In cancer cells, the induction of DNA replication stress by HU activates CHK1 by autophosphorylation. This leads to cell cycle arrest and recruits the DNA repair protein WRN to promote DNA repair and cell survival. In such cells, addition of the CHK1 inhibitor 9a propels DNA damage and apoptosis. MA203&#8208;mediated proteasomal degradation of CHK1 prevents compensatory ATM&#8208;mediated phosphorylation of remaining CHK1 molecules, aggravating DNA damage and apoptosis.








Abstract
Checkpoint kinase&#8208;1 (CHK1) controls DNA replication and repair. Tumor cells depend on CHK1, whose high levels are associated with worse patient prognosis. We define a bona fide proteolysis&#8208;targeting&#8208;chimera (PROTAC) for CHK1. PROTAC MA203 contains the type I kinase inhibitor rabusertib, which preferentially inhibits activated CHK1, and the cereblon (CRBN) ligand pomalidomide. MA203 accelerates CRBN&#8208;dependent proteasomal degradation of CHK1 in solid tumor&#8208;derived cells and acute leukemia cells. Chemotherapy&#8208;induced DNA replication stress and a consequent activation of CHK1 accelerate this event&#8208;driven process which promotes DNA damage and tumor cell apoptosis. Biochemical and cellular target engagement studies confirm the potency and selectivity of MA203. MA203 does not damage healthy differentiated and primitive hematopoietic cells, stromal cells, and retinal epithelial cells. MA203 is superior to its corresponding kinase inhibitor concerning DNA damage, dysregulation of BCL2 proteins, and apoptosis induction. These processes occur independently of the tumor&#8208;suppressive transcription factor p53. Elimination of CHK1 protein as structural element, but not its inhibition per se, triggers a proteasomal degradation of key DNA replication and repair proteins. Genetic CHK1 elimination confirms that such newly recognized functions of CHK1 rely on functions beyond its well&#8208;known catalytic activity. Thus, kinase&#8208;independent functions of CHK1 can be exploited with innovative pharmacological agents.

         <title>Asymmetric Electrosorption in a Bio&#8208;Inspired Reactor Enables Energy Efficient Ocean Carbon Removal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coral&#8208;inspired capacitive decarbonization (CDC) reactor enables direct ocean carbon removal by coupling selective electrodes with an asymmetric electrosorption strategy. Dissolved inorganic carbon is mineralized into stable CaCO3 with an ultralow intrinsic energy input (2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 CO2) and demonstrated continuous operation over 100&#160;h without electrode fouling.








Abstract
Ocean carbon removal represents a promising pathway for mitigating residual anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), yet existing methods are constrained by high energy demands and potential ecological risks. Here, inspired by the natural calcification process of corals, we present a bio&#8208;inspired capacitive decarbonization (CDC) reactor that sequesters dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from seawater as CaCO3 using only seawater&#8208;derived Ca2+ and renewable electricity. The CDC system integrates a Ca2+&#8208;selective electrode with a weak electric field to regulate ion transport and disrupt the hydration shell of Ca2+, enhancing its reaction with CO32&#8722;. To address the limited concentration of CO32&#8722; relative to Ca2+ in seawater, we introduce an asymmetric electrosorption strategy to preferentially enrich CO32&#8722; at the electrode interface, achieving a DIC conversion rate of up to 34% with an ultralow intrinsic electrochemical energy input of 2.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 CO2 for the CDC reactor. The reactor exhibits stable continuous operation for over 100&#160;h without fouling, enabled by spatially decoupled CaCO3 precipitation. To mitigate the reduction in seawater alkalinity, we introduce a mineral&#8208;assisted re&#8208;alkalinization step that effectively restores pH and supports continued CO2 absorption. A global integrated analysis model shows the CDC technology could remove up to 11&#8211;438 million tonnes of CO2 by 2050&#8211;2100. This work demonstrates a scalable and low&#8208;energy solution for durable ocean carbon removal.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Birth&#8208;Acceptor: Easily&#8208;Synthesized Mixture for Easily&#8208;Fabricated Quaternary Organic Solar Cells with Beyond 20% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
We developed a simple method to fabricate high&#8208;performance quaternary organic solar cells (QOSCs) by using &#8220;multiple&#8208;birth&#8208;acceptor&#8221; (MBA) mixtures synthesized by reacting one D middle segment with two A terminal units. Without separation, these MBAs could be used directly as electron acceptors, and the performance of PM6: MBA&#8208;based QOSCs are significantly superior to that of binary/ternary devices. The PM6:MBA13 quaternary device achieves a record PCE of 20.10%.








Abstract
Ternary strategy has been proved very effective to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, quaternary OSCs (QOSCs), containing four components in the active layer, have been rarely reported due to the complexity of material synthesis and optimization of active layer composition. Here, we developed a simple method to fabricate high&#8208;performance QOSCs by using &#8220;multiple&#8208;birth&#8208;acceptor&#8221; (MBA), a mixture of three molecules synthesized simultaneously. These A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type MBAs (MBA31, MBA11, MBA13, and MBA19) were synthesized by reacting one DA'D&#8208;type central segment (BTP&#8208;2CHO) with two A terminal units (&#947;&#8208;IC&#8208;Cl and IC&#8208;2Cl) with different feed ratios (&#947;&#8208;IC&#8208;Cl: IC&#8208;2Cl&#160;=&#160;3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 1:9). Without the need to isolate individual components, these MBAs can be utilized directly as electron acceptor to fabricate QOSCs. Compared with binary and ternary devices, QOSCs based on PM6: MBAs exhibit dramatically improved PCEs. Further device optimization, by using 2PACz as hole transport layer and DIB as an additive, PM6:MBA13&#8208;based device achieves a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PCE of 20.10%, among the highest values reported for QOSCs to date. Obviously, this method simplifies the material synthesis and device fabrication process for QOSCs. This study provides a feasible method to synthesize MBAs and subsequently fabricate high&#8208;performance QOSCs, and thereby opens up a new venue for the further optimization of OSCs.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Engineered Ultralong Phosphorescence in Double &#960;&#8208;Helical Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a novel class of double &#960;&#8208;helical nanographenes featuring a chiral cyclooctahexaphenylene core with diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. This innovative design leverages symmetry&#8208;forbidden transitions governed by Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextet rule to achieve ultraslong phosphorescence.

The development of long&#8208;lived organic phosphorescent materials faces significant challenges in achieving precise control over triplet exciton emission processes. Herein, we present an innovative design strategy toward a novel class of double &#960;&#8208;helical nanographenes (8&#8211;10) by integrating a chiral cyclooctahexaphenylene (COTh) core with diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The process underwent sequential Knoevenagel condensation, Diels&#8211;Alder [4&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition, and final Scholl dehydrocyclization, using phenanthraquinone dimer 3 as the key chiral building block. By systematically varying the symmetry of PAH subunits from C2 to C2v to D6h, we achieved remarkable orange&#8208;red phosphorescence with lifetimes (&#964;p) reaching&#160;5.5&#160;s and afterglow durations up to&#160;45&#160;s at 77&#160;K for 10 featuring highly D6h&#8208;symmetric hexabenzocoronene (HBC) moieties. This exceptional performance stems from three synergistic effects in high&#8208;symmetry, rigid PAHs: (1) significantly suppressed S1&#8594;S0 radiative rates (kf) due to symmetry&#8208;forbidden transitions governed by Clar's &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, (2) extremely low triplet radiative decay (kp), and (3) minimized nonradiative dissipation (knr). These double &#960;&#8208;helical nanographenes further demonstrate tunable chiroptical properties, with absorption dissymmetry factor (|gabs|) of 0.011 for 9 and exceptional Cotton effects (&#916;&#949; = 457 M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1) for 10. This research offers a valuable insight into the molecular design of chiral afterglow materials.

         <title>In Situ Construction of NaF&#8208;rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase with Metallic Ce Sites for Stable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a substrate&#8208;driven in situ interfacial engineering strategy to construct NaF&#8208;rich SEI with metallic Ce active sites, which stabilizes the interphase, accelerates Na+ desolvation, and enables 90% ultrahigh DOD along with stable anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Developing reversible Na plating/stripping under high depth of discharge (DOD) is critical for stable anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs). Achieving high reversibility relies on a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), yet current strategies depend on high&#8208;concentration salts or fluorinated solvents, limiting their practicality. Herein, we demonstrate an in situ NaF&#8208;rich SEI with metallic Ce sites that bypasses electrolyte decomposition. Operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and TOF&#8208;SIMS revealed a conversion reaction between Na+ and CeF3@NC, forming NaF and metallic Ce sites during cycling. This substrate&#8208;driven well&#8208;defined NaF&#8208;rich SEI ensures interfacial stability even under high DOD. Moreover, metallic Ce sites exhibit strong PF6&#8722; affinity, facilitating Na+ desolvation by lowering the energy barrier for step&#8208;by&#8208;step anion extraction. Consequently, the anode achieved ultra&#8208;long stability of 5800&#160;h (20% DOD) and 1600&#160;h (90% DOD). The full cells delivered the impressive cycling stability for 500 cycles with 93.3% capacity retention, while a pouch cell retained 90.98% capacity after 300 cycles. Notably, the AFSMBs with high cathode loading (&gt;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) exhibited excellent stability, retaining 83.6% capacity over 100 cycles. This work provides new insights into engineering robust in situ SEI, paving the way for accelerating practical application of AFSMBs.

         <title>Adaptive Rhodium Catalysis with a Lewis&#8209;Acidic Secondary Sphere for Divergent Hydrogenation of Propargylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adaptive rhodium catalysis with a Lewis&#8208;acidic secondary sphere enables divergent hydrogenation of propargylic alcohols into alkynes, allylic ethers, or alkenes. Catalyst design and condition&#8208;dependent pathways provide practical guidance for chemoselectivity control.








Abstract
Achieving chemoselective transformations of multifunctional molecules under mild and sustainable conditions remains a central challenge in catalysis. Here, we show that a rhodium complex equipped with a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere can mediate condition&#8208;dependent, divergent hydrogenation of propargylic alcohols. By tuning the reaction medium, the system selectively yields one of three products&#8212;retained alkynes, allylic ethers, or (E)&#8208;alkenes&#8212;from a single substrate&#8211;catalyst pair under hydrogen. Mechanistic studies implicate &#960;&#8208;allyl and rhodium hydride intermediates, with solvent polarity and nucleophilicity steering the reaction pathway. Control experiments confirm the critical roles of both molecular hydrogen and the boron Lewis acid in enabling divergent selectivity. These findings demonstrate how rational secondary&#8208;sphere design can enable adaptive catalysis and provide a platform for programmable bond transformations in multifunctional substrates.

         <title>Deciphering Mn2+ Solvation and Interfacial Chemistry for Rechargeable Nonaqueous Mn&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy combining 2&#8208;methoxyethylamine (MOEA)&#8208;regulated Mn2+ solvation environment and indium nitride (InN)&#8208;enabled electrode interfacial engineering is implemented, improving the kinetics and reversibility of Mn plating/stripping in Mn&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Manganese emerges as a compelling metal anode for multivalent ion batteries given its favorable redox potential (&#8722;1.18&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode), high theoretical specific capacity (976 mAh g&#8722;1), and large abundance. However, its practical deployment is hindered by kinetic challenges, including strong Mn2+ solvation effects, electron repulsion from the half&#8208;filled 3d orbital, and surface passivation of oxide layer, which collectively contribute to excessive overpotential during the Mn plating/stripping process. To address these challenges, herein, we propose a synergistic strategy integrating Mn2+ solvation regulation using 2&#8208;methoxyethylamine (MOEA) and electrode interfacial engineering with indium nitride (InN). Spectroscopic and theoretical analyses reveal that MOEA&#8208;regulated Mn2+ solvation sheath reduces the energy barrier associated with charge transfer, while InN&#8208;coated Mn anode leverages abundant nucleation sites to facilitate Mn deposition. These concerted effects enable remarkable plating/stripping stability of Mn||Mn symmetric cells over 3400 h under 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.2 mAh cm&#8722;2. Full cells pairing Mn anodes with pyrene&#8211;4,5,9,10&#8211;tetraone (PTO) cathodes further validate the strategy's efficacy, delivering a specific capacity of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and a stable cycling for 400 cycles. This work provides fundamental insights into Mn2+ solvation and interfacial chemistry for rechargeable Mn&#8208;metal batteries.

An efficient strategy to introduce diverse N&#8208;containing groups onto polypropylene materials under mild conditions via C&#9472;H functionalization has been developed. A series of aminated polypropylenes retaining crystallinity and molecular weight could be obtained while exhibiting new properties not present in virgin PP, such as improved compatibility in mixed plastic blends, enhanced adhesion to metals, and fluorescence properties.








Abstract
Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most produced polymers. To meet the requirements of many modern technologies, it is very urgent to introduce diverse functional groups onto PP. Selective C&#9472;N bonds forming via C&#9472;H functionalization have been considered as a universal platform; however, it remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a mild, catalyst&#8208;free, and light&#8208;free C&#9472;H amination of both commodity and postconsumer PP using sodium N&#8208;chloro&#8208;amides as nitrogen sources. This method allows the efficient preparation of a variety of aminated PP materials (up to 2.4 mol% LOF) via direct functionalizations and subsequent functional group transformations. These aminated materials retain crystallinity and molecular weight while exhibiting new properties not present in virgin PP, such as improved compatibility in mixed plastic blends, enhanced adhesion to metals, and fluorescence properties. This work also provides a sustainable strategy to expand the use of PP waste.

         <title>Lattice Oxygen Activation Through Redox&#8208;Induced &#948;&#8208;MnO2/Co3&#8208;xMnxO4 Interfaces for Enhanced N2O Decomposition</title>

The Co&#8211;O covalency in spinel oxide is modulated through redox&#8208;induced &#948;&#8208;MnO2/Co3&#8208;xMnxO4 interfaces, activating lattice oxygen to favor a lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated Mars&#8211;van Krevelen mechanism for N2O decomposition, whereas pristine Co3O4 primarily follows the Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism.








Abstract
N2O decomposition over spinel catalysts suffers from a spin&#8208;forbidden oxygen recombination step, resulting in substantial kinetic barriers of O2 formation. Herein, we present a redox&#8208;induced interfacial engineering strategy to activate lattice oxygen in spinel oxides, thereby effectively overcoming the kinetic constraints associated with oxygen recombination. In a Co3O4&#8208;based model system, controlled permanganate etching partially substitutes Mn into octahedral Co3+ sites, while simultaneously generating heterointerfaces. The enhanced hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p orbitals and high Co&#8211;O&#8211;Mn covalency induced by the interface between &#948;&#8208;MnO2 and Co3&#8208;xMnxO4, lead to the formation of highly active lattice oxygen species adjacent to the interface. 18O isotope labeling experiment further confirms a dominant lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated Mars&#8211;van Krevelen mechanism for N2O decomposition, whereas pristine Co3O4 predominantly follows the Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism. Therefore, the optimized catalyst exhibits enhanced N2O decomposition activities, maintaining stability under impurity&#8208;rich conditions. This work offers a promising approach for the rational design of efficient catalysts for N2O abatement and provides mechanistic insights into redox&#8208;induced lattice oxygen activation.

         <title>Bioinformatics&#8208;Driven Design of Peptides for Membrane Stabilization During Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we developed class A &#945;&#8208;helix&#8208;based peptides through systematically analyzing the conserved 11&#8208;mer motifs of LEA proteins. The obtained ARE peptide exhibited optimal performance, being able to insert into phospholipids and increase membrane permeability to water during the freezing&#8208;thawing process. As a result, this class A &#945;&#8208;helix peptide succesfully alleviated the osmotic pressure, resulting in a 52% increase in post&#8208;thaw red blood cell recovery.








Abstract
During cryopreservation, cooling triggers membrane phase transitions from a liquid&#8208;crystalline to a gel phase, compromising membrane permeability, impairing water exchange, ultimately leading to cell death. Group 3 late embryogenesis abundant (G3LEA) proteins stabilize cell membranes under adverse circumstances through their functional&#160;11&#8208;mer repeats. Thus, we conducted a bioinformatics analysis of 11&#8208;mer repeats across LEA proteins and identified AKE, a class A &#945;&#8208;helix peptide that lowers the gel&#8208;to&#8208;liquid crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm). Structural optimization further established a key design principle: a class A &#945;&#8208;helix with a charge&#8208;segregated structure, featuring two positively charged faces separated by hydrophobic and negatively charged regions, designed to enhance membrane interactions by promoting electrostatic binding to phospholipid head groups while allowing hydrophobic regions to associate with lipid tails, potentially strengthening overall membrane affinity. Results confirmed that substituting lysine with arginine, which carries a more delocalized and stable positive charge, strengthened electrostatic interactions and reduced free energy. The optimized peptide, ARE, lowered&#160;Tm&#160;and reduced the extent of phase transition improved water permeability and osmotic resistance, leading to a 52% enhancement in post&#8208;thaw red blood cell recovery. By integrating structural design with charge modulation, this study provides a framework for developing membrane stabilizers through rational peptide engineering.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Enhanced&#8208;Emission Polymer Donor Improves the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells by Suppressing Nonradiative Recombination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent aggregation&#8208;enhanced&#8208;emission polymer donor, namely PiNTSO&#8208;F, was designed and incorporated into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, which optimizes the D&#8211;A interfaces, reduces the nonradiative recombination rate, and enhances charge generation efficiency. As a result, the ternary device achieves a low &#916;Vnr of 0.192&#160;V and an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.36%.








Abstract
Nonradiative voltage loss (&#916;Vnr) is a critical factor that limits the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). Introducing highly luminescent materials is a promising approach to reduce &#916;Vnr. The majority of prior works have focused on enhancing luminescence of low&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors, whereas highly luminescent donors have received far less attention. Herein, we designed and synthesized a highly luminescent polymer donor with aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission property, namely PiNTSO&#8208;F, and incorporated it into PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based system. Interestingly, PiNTSO&#8208;F was found to locate at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface, where it optimizes the interfacial morphology, energetic landscape, and charge dynamics of the active layer. Consequently, the nonradiative recombination rate in the ternary system is significantly reduced, while the interfacial charge generation efficiency is simultaneously improved to nearly unity, effectively minimizing &#916;Vnr of the device. As a result, the ternary devices achieve a low &#916;Vnr of 0.192&#160;V and a high efficiency of 20.36%. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for suppressing &#916;Vnr through developing the highly luminescent polymer donors as a third component, providing mechanistic insights that enable high&#8208;performance OSCs with minimized voltage loss.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controlled Protein Corona&#8208;Armored DNA Nanomachine for Multitype Biomarker Imaging in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;responsive protein corona (PC)&#8208;armored DNA nanomachine was developed for multitype biomarker imaging in living cells. The PC shell offers nuclease resistance, avoids undesirable PC formation during delivery, enhances tumor cell targeting, and promotes lysosomal escape.

DNA nanomachines have significant potential for biosensing because of their high programmability, signal amplification ability, and excellent biocompatibility. However, under physiological conditions, their performance is often hindered by insufficient endogenous driving forces, nuclease degradation, and lysosomal entrapment. In this study, we develop a protein corona (PC)&#8208;armored DNA nanomachine with spatiotemporal control for multiple intracellular biomarker imaging. By pre&#8208;assembling a UV&#8208;responsive PC shell, the DNA nanomachine forms a physical barrier that protects nucleic acids from nucleases, reduces uncontrollable PC formation during unimpaired operation, and enhances cellular uptake via PC&#8208;mediated targeting. After internalization, the retained PC promotes lysosomal escape, followed by light&#8208;triggered disassembly for precise cytoplasmic operation of the nanomachine. Notably, our nanomachine employs RNA as a track and the widely expressed intracellular RNase H enzyme as the driving force, circumventing sequence limitations and establishing a general operational platform. Through this modulation, we achieve in situ imaging of microRNA in U87 human glioblastoma cells and ATP in A549 lung carcinoma cells, pioneering a PC&#8208;enabled paradigm for DNA nanomachines and building a versatile intracellular diagnostic platform for precision medicine.

&lt;p&gt;A UV-responsive protein corona (PC)-armored DNA nanomachine was developed for multitype biomarker imaging in living cells. The PC shell offers nuclease resistance, avoids undesirable PC formation during delivery, enhances tumor cell targeting, and promotes lysosomal escape. Subsequent light activation ensures controlled cytoplasmic operation, while RNase H-driven walking, which is free from sequence limitations, establishes a versatile platform for intracellular multitype biomarker detection.

         <title>Hydrogen Affinity in Intermetallic Electrides as a Key Indicator of Catalytic Performance in Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We systematically investigated the structure&#8208;performance relationship of 13 isostructural ATmSi intermetallics for catalytic ammonia synthesis, focusing on their anionic electrons and lattice hydrogen. The A&#9472;A interlayer distance d is an indicator of anion electron density and catalytic performance. Critically, optimal catalytic activity requires a balanced hydrogen stability within the ATmSiH lattice. 








Abstract
Electrides have emerged as promising catalysts or catalyst supports for efficient ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. ATmSi compounds (A&#160;=&#160;rare earth/alkaline earth, Tm&#160;=&#160;transition metal) with a tetragonal CeFeSi&#8208;type structure represent a class of intermetallic electrides, where lattice atoms serve as active sites, offering significant potential for catalytic applications. However, with over 25 ATmSi compounds, their catalytic performance variations and optimization strategies remain poorly understood. In this study, we systematically investigated the structure&#8208;activity relationship of ATmSi compounds, focusing on their anionic electron properties and hydrogen storage capabilities. Analysis of lattice parameters revealed the A&#8211;A interlayer distance as a descriptor of anionic electron concentration, with the non&#8208;electride CaRuSi exhibiting a notable reduction in this distance due to minimal anionic electrons. The catalytic activities in ARuSi, ACoSi, and AFeSi systems all increase with the expansion of A&#8211;A interlayer spacing. Furthermore, hydrogen storage properties, where anionic electrons are replaced by hydride ions, were evaluated. It is critical for N2 hydrogenation. The hydrogen affinity, gauged by the desorption temperature, proved pivotal in determining catalytic efficiency, with optimal performance requiring balanced hydrogen binding strength. These findings provide critical insights for designing advanced catalysts for ammonia synthesis and potentially other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Reconfigurable Optical Structures Using Photomechanical Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial patterning via photodimerization generates localized photomechanical height changes on a single crystal surface. The dimer dissociation rate can be controlled by temperature or light exposure, creating a reconfigurable surface for optical applications.








Abstract
In crystal form, 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;9&#8208;anthracenecarboxylic acid (4F&#8208;9AC) undergoes a room temperature reversible intermolecular [4&#160;+&#160;4] photodimerization that can be harnessed for photomechanical actuation. This negative photochromic reaction enables high conversion throughout the crystal. Patterned 405&#160;nm excitation of single 4F&#8208;9AC crystals creates localized photo&#8208;dimer regions with an expansion of up to 3% of the total crystal thickness. These photoconverted regions cause reversible surface deformations and changes in birefringence that follow the reaction progress. Temperature dependent rate measurements of the photo&#8208;dimer dissociation yield an activation energy of 97&#160;kJ/mol, making the reversibility rate highly sensitive to temperature. By varying the crystal temperature and the light exposure level, the lifetime of the photomechanical features can be tuned from 40 milliseconds to minutes. This enables rapid updating of images and features using a commercial spatial light modulator. We use this capability to create dynamic surface relief gratings that can steer a diffracted 633&#160;nm probe beam in arbitrary directions. The rapid mechanical response of the crystalline systems permits write&#8211;erase cycles with a duration of&#160;1&#160;s, which compares favorably to polymer systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Electron Transfer in Inorganic&#8211;Organic Interfacial Electric Field Enabling Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noncovalent interface is established between a negatively charged CdS light&#8208;harvesting center and a Co(II)&#8208;bpy catalyst through surface functional groups. This interface promotes strong electronic interactions and efficient electron transfer, directing electrons towards the Co(II)&#8208;bpy high&#8208;energy orbitals. As a result, there is a significant improvement in CO2 reduction activity, achieved by effectively suppressing the H2 evolution reaction.








Abstract
The efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction has long been limited by the competing H2 evolution reaction. In this study, we present an innovative strategy for boosting high&#8208;throughput electron transfer to suppress H2 evolution, thereby enhancing CO2 reduction. By employing CdS and cobalt bipyridine as a model, we engineered the surface of CdS to create an electric field at the inorganic&#8211;organic interface. Through in situ and transient spectroscopy techniques, we discovered that CdS functionalized with &#9472;COOH groups demonstrates remarkable noncovalent interactions and improved charge transfer capabilities compared to those functionalized with &#9472;NH2 groups. The fast delivery of electrons on cobalt bipyridine facilitates the adsorbed CO2 to participate in the proton&#8208;electron coupling reaction, rather than allowing adsorbed protons to accept electrons directly. Consequently, the established CdS&#8208;COOH/Co(II)&#8208;bpy system achieved a CO production rate of 2.523&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 96.3%. This research presents an approach for creating efficient charge transport interfaces and provides a comprehensive strategy for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic CO2 reduction systems that effectively counteract the challenges posed by competing H2 evolution reactions.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Driven Ni3S4 Gradient in NiFe&#8208;LDH Enables Durable Industrial&#8208;Scale Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH gradient heterostructure nanosheets grown on iron foams are constructed by a corrosion engineering strategy at room temperature within just 1 h. When employed as the anode catalyst in an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer, the Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH/IF demonstrates low overpotentials along with exceptionally long&#8208;term stability, maintaining efficient pure water splitting for 1000 h at 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Designing low&#8208;cost yet highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is essential to enable sustainable green hydrogen generation. However, synthesis complexity, slow kinetics, and poor durability hinder industrial use. In this study, we present a corrosion&#8208;driven gradient engineering approach for the rapid, energy&#8208;free synthesis of Ni3S4/NiFe&#8208;LDH heterostructures on iron foam (IF) under ambient conditions. During spontaneous IF corrosion, a compositional and gradient structure forms, with Ni3S4 dominating the surface and NiFe&#8208;LDH enriching the core, establishing a continuous pathway for rapid electron transport. The catalyst exhibits superior OER performance, achieving low overpotentials of 297&#160;mV in 1&#160;M KOH and 326&#160;mV in simulated seawater at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Notably, in pure&#8208;water anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates industrial&#8208;grade performance, sustaining 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.85&#160;V with remarkable stability over 1,000 h of continuous operation. Operando spectroscopic studies unveil that SO42&#8722; leaching from surface Ni3S4 in the gradient structure provides dual protection against metal dissolution and chloride corrosion. Furthermore, the in situ formation of FeOOH synergistically stabilizes the catalytically critical Ni3+ species in NiOOH through strong Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Ni interfacial bonding, contributing to the exceptional durability. This work provides fundamental insights into corrosion&#8208;mediated catalyst design, offering a scalable pathway for developing industrial&#8208;grade electrocatalysts.

In this study, we present a corrosion-driven gradient engineering approach for the rapid, energy-free synthesis of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/NiFe-LDH heterostructures on iron foam (IF) under ambient conditions. During spontaneous IF corrosion, a compositional and gradient structure forms, with Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; dominating the surface and NiFe-LDH enriching the core, establishing a continuous pathway for rapid electron transport. The catalyst exhibits superior OER performance, achieving low overpotentials of 297&#160;mV in 1&#160;M KOH and 326&#160;mV in simulated seawater at 500&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Notably, in pure-water anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates industrial-grade performance, sustaining 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.85&#160;V with remarkable stability over 1,000 h of continuous operation. Operando spectroscopic studies unveil that SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; leaching from surface Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in the gradient structure provides dual protection against metal dissolution and chloride corrosion. Furthermore, the in situ formation of FeOOH synergistically stabilizes the catalytically critical Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species in NiOOH through strong Fe&#9472;O&#9472;Ni interfacial bonding, contributing to the exceptional durability. This work provides fundamental insights into corrosion-mediated catalyst design, offering a scalable pathway for developing industrial-grade electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design of Cryogenic Electrolyte with Organic&#8208;Free Solvation Structure for Wide&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming at broadening the temperature range of aqueous zinc metal batteries, a weak solvation shell electrolyte is proposed by introducing proline additive. By reconfiguring the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and facilitating rapid desolvation process, the designed electrolyte enables homogeneous zinc deposition and steady electrochemical performance without parasitic reaction across a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Albeit the promising performance at ambient temperatures, the development of zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) is still haunted by the freezing&#8208;prone characteristic of aqueous electrolytes and the deteriorative interface reaction in extreme scenarios. Especially at low&#8208;temperature conditions, the abundant hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) between H2O molecules inevitably drive the aqueous solution transform into an orderly frozen state, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired cryogenic electrolyte is proposed, and the strong interaction between proline additive and H2O solvent effectively disrupts the H&#8208;bond network, thereby depressing the freezing point while maintaining high ionic conductivity under extremely&#8208;low temperatures. Furthermore, the tailored weak and organic&#8208;free solvation structures facilitate rapid desolvation of Zn2+ ions, and the reduced H2O activity mitigates parasitic reactions on Zn anode surface, thus guaranteeing reversible zinc deposition and dendrite&#8208;free interface. Consequently, the anti&#8208;freezing electrolyte endows Zn||Zn cells with durable cyclic behavior over 2500&#160;h. The PANI||Zn cell&#160;demonstrates excellent temperature adaptability from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C, achieving a reversible capacity of 173.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 60 &#176;C and maintaining 93.6% capacity retention after 1300 cycles at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This work reports a practical electrolyte design strategy for ZMBs in harsh environments, promoting the future application of low&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant aqueous batteries.

         <title>Electrochemical Late&#8208;Stage Stitching of Tryptophan Peptides via N&#9472;S Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we present a versatile electrochemical platform for macrocyclization and stapling of endogenous peptides, featuring straightforward operation, rapid kinetics, and tunable ring size/geometry. Using sulfur&#8208;containing stapling reagents of varying lengths, tryptophan residues undergo rapid crosslinking cyclization, efficiently delivering 21&#8208; to 29&#8208;membered cyclopeptides with constrained conformations. This protocol enhances the bioactivity of linear peptide precursors, offering a novel strategy for cyclic peptide modification.








Abstract
Late&#8208;stage diversification of peptides via selective modification of endogenous amino acid side chains provides a powerful strategy to access analogues with enhanced bioactivity and tailored physicochemical properties, thereby facilitating peptide&#8208;based drug discovery. However, precise manipulation of short peptides comprising canonical amino acids&#8212;particularly control over backbone conformation&#8212;remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present a robust electrochemical strategy for constructing macrocyclic peptides through direct incorporation of diverse aryl sulfur linkers. This method enables tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective crosslinking via electrochemical reaction with aryl thiosulfonates, leading to efficient formation of S&#9472;N bonds. The resulting sulfur&#8208;bridged multi&#8208;aryl macrocycles act as conformationally adaptive scaffolds that reshape the peptide backbone architecture. This conformational remodeling grants access to previously inaccessible structural spaces that are critical for modulating biological activity.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Rich MOF&#8208;Material&#8208;Derived Metal Dual&#8208;Atom Platforms for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a general strategy to construct asymmetric dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) using energetic MOFs as precursors. The explosive decomposition of Zn&#8208;based EMOFs yields porous N&#8208;doped carbon frameworks embedding atomically dispersed Zn&#9472;M (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Fe, Mn, etc.) dual sites. The Zn&#9472;Co DACs achieves 98.95% Faradaic efficiency for nitrate reduction, with in situ XAS/DFT revealing the key N3Zn&#9472;CoN2 configuration. 








Abstract
The rational design of asymmetrically coordinated dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) offers new opportunities to overcome intrinsic limitations in selective multi&#8208;electron electrochemical reactions. Here, we present a general synthetic strategy that exploits high&#8208;energy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (EMOFs, such as nitrogen&#8208;rich MOFs) as versatile precursors to construct a diverse library of atomically dispersed and structurally asymmetric DACs. By leveraging the exothermic decomposition and gas&#8208;releasing nature of Zn&#8208;based EMOFs such as Zn(C2H2N3)2 (1,2,3&#8208;triazolate, MET&#8208;6), we achieve the in situ formation of porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon frameworks embedding various Zn&#9472;M (M&#160;=&#160;Co, Fe, Mn, Pd, Pt, Ni, Ru) dual&#8208;atom sites with tailored asymmetric coordination environments. This far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium route enables atomic dispersion while steering the formation of non&#8208;centrosymmetric metal sites that are otherwise challenging to access via conventional thermal treatments. Across the DACs library, the Zn&#9472;Co/NC member stands out for electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3RR), delivering a Faradaic efficiency of 98.95% toward NH3 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory calculations reveal that the asymmetric N3Zn&#9472;CoN2 configuration enhances electronic coupling between the two metal centers, optimizes *NOH adsorption, and lowers the activation barrier for key intermediates. This work establishes a broadly applicable route to asymmetric DACs and provides a platform for tailoring active&#8208;site configurations to diverse electrochemical transformations.

         <title>Iron (IV) Formation and the pH Dependent Kinetics of the Fenton Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kinetic framework captures the long&#8208;debated pH&#8208;dependent mechanism of the Fenton reaction. By incorporating iron speciation, the model quantitatively explains the shift from OH radical oxidation in acidic conditions to Fe(IV) formation near neutral pH. This framework corrects prior underestimations of rate constants and accurately reproduces the acceleration in iron oxidation by hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
Despite its widespread importance for biological and environmental chemistry and decades of study, the mechanism underlying the Fenton reaction is still a matter of some controversy. To elucidate the pH dependence of this complex reaction, a new kinetic model is developed to explain the increase in rate and mechanistic shift that occurs from acidic to neutral conditions. This mechanism originated from a re&#8208;analysis of a previously proposed model, which neglected explicit iron speciation, leading to unrealistic rate constants. Accounting for speciation suggests a much faster formation rate of Fe(IV), which is estimated to be on the order of 106&#160;M&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Expanding on prior kinetic studies that include speciation under acidic conditions, we propose a unified kinetic model that captures the pH&#8208;dependent rate acceleration in Fe(II) oxidation by H2O2, which is a significant step toward resolving the long&#8208;standing mechanistic ambiguity of Fenton chemistry.

Expanding on prior kinetic studies that include speciation under acidic conditions, we propose a unified kinetic model that captures the pH-dependent rate acceleration in Fe(II) oxidation by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is a significant step toward resolving the long-standing mechanistic ambiguity of Fenton chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Partial Water Dissociation by Protonated Carbon Nitride for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst reduces the bond dissociation energy of water to 1.48&#160;eV, enabling partial water dissociation for efficient hydrogenation reactions under visible light irradiation at a practical scale in a flow system.








Abstract
Catalytic hydrogenation using pressurized hydrogen at elevated temperature is of utmost importance in refinery and fine chemical industries, but heavily relies on the hydrocarbon reforming industry. Photocatalytic water dissociation provides a sustainable solution for hydrogenation; however, the strong O&#9472;H bond and instant recombination of generated hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radicals need to be solved. Here, we demonstrate efficient hydrogenation of unsaturated aromatics using water by a protonated graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst with dioxane as a hydroxyl radical trap under mild conditions. The dissociation energy of the H&#9472;O bond is reduced from 5.15 to only 1.48&#160;eV, enabling the formation of H atoms and surface adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OHads) under visible light. The &#8226;OHads reacts with dioxane, yielding value&#8208;added dioxane&#8208;2&#8208;ol and prolonging the lifetime of hydrogen atoms for hydrogenation. A high quantum efficiency of &#8764;6% can be realized under visible light irradiation for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic bromides and aldehydes with high conversion. This approach is scalable in a flow system, revealing financial and environmental potential for hydrogenation and deuteration at a practical level.

         <title>Mechanism of the Stoltz&#8211;Grubbs (KOtBu/Et3SiH) Silylation: Single&#8208;Electron Transfer is the Missing Link between the Heterolytic and Radical Pathways</title>

         <dc:description>
Ionic and radical mechanisms explain many, but not all, of the observed features of Stoltz&#8211;Grubbs (KOtBu/Et3SiH) C&#8211;H silylation reactions. Herein we show how a new mechanism, featuring hydride transfer and single electron transfer (SET), reconciles the reaction's ionic and radical characteristics and accounts for its previously unexplained features.








Abstract
A new mechanism for the Stoltz&#8211;Grubbs (KOtBu/Et3SiH) silylation of heteroarenes is reported that successfully resolves the important unexplained experimental features of the reaction. The mechanism combines hydride transfer, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and single electron transfer (SET) steps (with the substrate hydride adduct being identified as a new SET donor) and is supported by extensive theoretical calculations. Previously proposed heterolytic and radical mechanisms do not involve SET. The discovery of a mechanistic role for SET explains why the silylation reaction simultaneously displays both heterolytic and radical character, and why it does not require free silyl radicals. Previously unexplained experimental results from reactions of isotopically labelled reactants and on the inhibitory effects of electron&#8208;accepting additives can also be understood based on the SET mechanism.

         <title>Steam&#8208;Activated Lattice Oxygen Enhances Interfacial Redox Stability for Low&#8208;Temperature N2O Decomposition over Rh/CeO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature steam activation not only induces the aggregation of partial Rh species on the CeO2 surface but also activates interfacial lattice oxygen species, thereby enhancing O2 desorption capability at low temperatures and improving the catalytic performance of N2O decomposition.








Abstract
Activation of surface lattice oxygen is crucial for enabling low&#8208;temperature catalytic oxidation reactions. While earlier studies have hinted that steam treatment could enhance the activity of lattice oxygen in CeO2 supported catalysts, the mechanistic understanding remains superficial. Here, we unravel the origin and role of steam&#8208;activated lattice oxygen in promoting low&#8208;temperature N2O decomposition. Using a combination of isotope&#8208;labeled steam (H218O), in situ ambient&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP&#8208;XPS), and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we provide direct evidence that high&#8208;temperature steam induces lattice oxygen activation at the Rh&#8211;CeO2 interface. These activated oxygen species facilitate oxygen desorption and enhance the redox cycling stability of Rh and Ce species, dramatically improving catalytic activity at low temperatures. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked pathway for surface lattice oxygen activation and offer mechanistic insights to guide the rational design of efficient low&#8208;temperature redox catalysts.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Induced Bridged Electrolyte Design Strategy Mitigates Capacity Decay in Lithium&#8211;Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of anions on solvation structure and interphase composition/structure are demonstrated using an anion&#8208;induced bridged electrolyte design strategy. The multidentate coordination propensity of nitrate promotes the formation of densely packed ion pairs in the electrolyte, which could achieve anion&#8208;derived interphase, fast Li+ transfer kinetics, and anode/cathode compatibility, enabling record&#8208;long life in Li||SPAN batteries.








Abstract
Previous strategies have improved the compatibility of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) in ether&#8208;based electrolytes by constructing a relatively stable interphase, but the electrode degradation caused by sluggish kinetics has limited the practical implementation of SPAN cathodes. Here, we propose an anion&#8208;induced bridged electrolyte (AIBE) design strategy to simultaneously achieve anode/cathode compatibility, anion&#8208;derived interphase formation, and fast Li+ transfer kinetics in Li||SPAN batteries through utilizing small&#8208;sized nitrate (NO3&#8722;) anions with multidentate coordination propensity. One NO3&#8722; could coordinate with multiple Li+ ions to promote the formation of bridged complexes ([Li+&#8211;NO3&#8722;&#8211;Li+]) with reduced Li+&#8211;Li+ distances. These densely packed ion pairs create an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure and fast Li+ interfacial reaction kinetics. Simultaneously, the optimized AIBE facilitates the formation of a robust inorganic&#8208;rich interphase to suppress electrode degradation. This electrolyte mitigates SPAN cathode decay, enabling a Li||SPAN full cell to retain 80.5% capacity after 500 cycles. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell (50&#160;&#181;m Li, 4.0&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 SPAN, lean 1.52&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte) achieves 99.7% capacity retention after 95 cycles. This work elucidates the fundamental role of NO3&#8722; anions in modifying the solvation structure and interphase composition/structure, offering novel perspectives for advanced electrolytes for Li||SPAN batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement of Electron and Hole Transport by Pd Single Atoms and Gradient&#8208;Distributed Ti3+ Species for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Oxidation of CH4 to Oxygenates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiO2&#8208;based photocatalyst featuring atomically dispersed Pd and a gradient distribution of Ti3+ enables efficient photocatalytic oxidation of CH4 to liquid oxygenates at room temperature. Pd atoms enhance electron transfer and O2 activation, while Ti3+ promotes hole migration, thereby achieving a record C1 oxygenates yield with 91.3% selectivity through spatially separated charge carrier pathways.








Abstract
Photocatalytic oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates offers a sustainable strategy for utilizing natural gas and reducing carbon emissions. However, the efficiency of current photocatalysts remains limited by poor charge carrier utilization, particularly the ineffective migration of holes that are crucial for C&#9472;H bond activation. Herein, we report a rationally engineered TiO2 photocatalyst incorporating atomically dispersed Pd and a gradient distribution of Ti3+ species, achieving a remarkable C1 oxygenates yield of 8.14&#160;mmol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with 91.3% selectivity at room temperature, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that Pd single atoms accelerate electron transfer and facilitate O2 dissociation, while the gradient&#8208;distributed Ti3+ species promote hole migration from the bulk to the surface, enabling efficient CH4 activation. These spatially separated charge pathways synergistically promote the formation of &#8226;CH3 and &#8226;OOH radicals, which couple to generate CH3OOH and subsequently convert into methanol and formaldehyde.

         <title>Binding Modes Tuning Nitrite Reduction Reactivity at Iron(III) Centers Triggered by Hydrogen Atom, Hydride, and Proton Transfers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary&#8208;sphere effects control the nitrite binding mode (&#954;1&#8211;O or &#954;1&#8211;N) in an Fe(III) center, leading to strikingly different reduction pathways. The &#954;1&#8211;O isomer undergoes unprecedented Fe(III)&#8208;mediated hydrogen&#8208;atom and hydride transfer in addition to protonation, whereas the &#954;1&#8211;N isomer reacts exclusively via protonation. These results uncover new mechanistic possibilities for Fe&#8208;mediated nitrite reduction.








Abstract
To elucidate the mechanisms of iron&#8208;mediated nitrite reduction, we synthesized and fully characterized Fe(III)&#8208;NO2&#8722; complexes featuring distinct &#954;1&#8211;O (nitrito) and &#954;1&#8211;N (nitro) binding modes, supported by a tris(benzenethiolato)phosphine ligand derivative. Interconversion between these two linkage isomers is modulated by a Na+ cation in the secondary coordination sphere. These binding motifs direct divergent nitrite reduction pathways. For the &#954;1&#8211;O isomer, reduction is initiated by hydrogen atom or hydride transfer to yield an {FeNO}7 species, whereas protonation results in formation of an {FeNO}6 complex. Hydrogen atom transfer and protonation are accompanied by hydroxyl radical generation, while hydride transfer produces hydroxide. In contrast, the &#954;1&#8211;N isomer undergoes nitrite reduction exclusively via protonation. Detailed computational studies afford a mechanistic rationale for how nitrite binding modes govern distinct nitrite reduction trajectories.

Drawing inspiration from neurons, we show a calcium&#8208;coordinated multidimensional nanochannel gel polymer electrolyte, incorporating one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional of polyacrylamide, cellulose nanofibers&#8208;graphene oxide, and calcium ion&#8208;adsorbed single&#8208;layer montmorillonite. It displays remarkable tensile property and ionic conductivity. The tin&#8208;air battery exhibits an ultralong cycle life (195&#160;h) and an exceptional rate capability (50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Flexible high&#8208;performance tin&#8208;air batteries (FTABs) exhibit transformative potential for wearable electronics. Nonetheless, the rate performance and cycle life are still limited by the sluggish hydroxide ion transport in gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs), along with the inactive tin and dendrites. Herein, drawing inspiration from the structure of neurons, we show a calcium&#8208;coordinated multidimensional nanochannel GPE, incorporating one&#8208; and two&#8208;dimensional of polyacrylamide, cellulose nanofibers&#8208;graphene oxide, and calcium ion&#8208;adsorbed single&#8208;layer montmorillonite (PAM/CNF&#8208;GO/CaSMMT). The bionic GPEs demonstrate remarkable tensile property (1350%), and ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity (294 mS&#183;cm&#8722;1). The integration of kinetic isotope effect (KIE) technology and molecular dynamics simulations has, for the first time, elucidated the continuous multidimensional nanochannels and chain migration mechanism. The FTABs exhibit an ultralong cycle life up to 195 h, outperforming the previous tin&#8208;air batteries. In addition, the device achieves an exceptional rate capability of 50 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, while almost maintaining structural integrity under various deformations. This work has driven the development of flexible tin&#8208;air batteries and set a new benchmark for the next generation of wearable energy storage.

         <title>Cu&#8211;Ce Dual&#8211;Atom Sites Embedded in Zeolites Boost Resistance to Impurity Interference for Environmental Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding Cu&#8208;Ce dual&#8208;atom sites in zeolites enhances catalyst resistance to impurity poisoning for environmental applications. By implanting Ce into Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13, we increase the relative proportion of P&#8208;insensitive Z2Cu2&#8314; sites by forming [ZCe3+(OH)2]+ sites in the 8MRs, while Ce sites preferentially bind phosphorus. This dual function boosts phosphorus tolerance even after hydrothermal aging, offering a general strategy for robust emission control catalysts in challenging conditions.








Abstract
Biodiesel, a carbon&#8208;neutral alternative to fossil fuels, plays a vital role in decarbonizing transportation, with global production exceeding 40 million tons annually. However, its widespread use introduces elevated phosphorus and metal cations into vehicle exhaust, severely deactivating Cu&#8208;SSZ&#8208;13 catalysts for NOX reduction through pore blockage, framework degradation, and Cu sites loss. We present a Cu&#8211;Ce dual&#8208;atom catalyst embedded in SSZ&#8208;13 that maintains high performance in ammonia&#8208;selective catalytic reduction under phosphorus&#8208;rich conditions. Ce species, precisely positioned in eight&#8208;membered rings, displace P&#8208;sensitive [ZCu2+OH]+ sites, enriching the catalyst with P&#8208;tolerant Z2Cu2&#8314; species in six&#8208;membered rings. Concurrent Ce&#9472;P interactions restore the electronic environment of Cu sites, enhancing NH3/NO adsorption and redox cycling. This design sustains 90% NOX conversion and 100% N2 selectivity at 210&#160;&#176;C, even after phosphorus exposure. The strategy is broadly applicable to impurity&#8208;sensitive environmental reactions, including NH3 oxidation and the coupled removal of NOX with VOCs, offering a practical pathway to durable, poison&#8208;resistant catalysts for clean and sustainable mobility.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth Regulated Bond Polarizability in Layered Cuprates for Promoted Surface Reconstruction Toward C2+ Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rare&#8208;earth modulation strategy was reported to regulate the bond polarizability in layered cuprates to promote surface reconstruction toward high&#8208;efficiency C2+ electrosynthesis. The optimized Pr2CuO4 achieves &#8764;80% C2+ Faradaic efficiency and 376.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density, which could be attributed to the reconstruction&#8208;redirected dual active sites of strained Cu nanoparticles and Cu/Pr2CuO4 interface due to largest bond polarizability. 








Abstract
Copper (Cu) oxides hold great potential for electrochemical synthesis of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products from CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but a clear picture correlating chemical bond characteristics in pristine Cu oxides with inevitable reconstruction during CO2RR remains underexplored. Herein, we report our findings in the regulation of Cu&#9472;O bond polarizability in layered cuprates (Ln2CuO4, Ln&#160;=&#160;La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd) by an A&#8208;site rare&#8208;earth modulation strategy, to promote surface reconstruction toward high&#8208;efficiency C2+ electrosynthesis. In particular, the optimized Pr2CuO4 bulk material with largest bond polarizability exhibits the best performance, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;80% for C2+ products and a C2+ partial current density of 376.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.7&#160;V versus RHE as well as maintaining robust durability at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a membrane electrode assembly. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that larger Cu&#9472;O bond polarizability, characterized as increased bond length and decreased valence state, accelerates the Cu&#8208;O bond breaking that can lead to the formation of ultrasmall, highly dispersed, and strained Cu nanoparticles. These reconstructed metallic Cu particles, together with Cu/Pr2CuO4 interface, function as dual active sites to improve *CO coverage and lower the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling, resulting in the enhanced C2+ selectivity.

         <title>Chemical Fuel&#8208;Driven Stiffening of Transient Hydrogels via Vitrifiable Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a chemically fueled transient hydrogel that can reversibly and temporarily switch between soft rubbery and stiff glassy states. Mechanistically, a carbodiimide fuel triggers the transient conversion of carboxylic acids to hydrophobic anhydrides, substantially lowering the stiffening temperature of poly(zinc acrylate)&#8208;based copolymer hydrogels. An unprecedented stiffened modulus and modulus increase are achieved with tunable lifetimes.








Abstract
Fuel&#8208;driven transient materials that can temporally adjust their mechanical properties are ubiquitous in living systems, enabling biological functions to be maintained far from equilibrium. While numerous biomimetic transiently stiffened materials have been developed, their low stiffened moduli (typically in the kPa range) severely restrict their practical use in load&#8208;bearing applications. Here we report a chemically fueled transient hydrogel that can stiffen into a highly rigid glassy state via vitrifiable bicontinuous phase separation. The hydrogel is made from thermal&#8208;stiffening poly(zinc acrylate)&#8208;based copolymers, with the stiffening temperature being precisely regulated by the acrylic acid content. Carbodiimide triggers the temporary conversion of carboxylic acids to hydrophobic anhydrides, drastically lowering stiffening temperature and vitrifying polymer&#8208;rich phase under ambient conditions. Consequently, the initial soft hydrogel transforms into a transient glassy state, achieving an ultrahigh modulus of 115&#160;MPa and 920&#8208;fold modulus increase. This phase separation&#8208;mediated dissipative approach significantly enhances the mechanical properties of transient materials with tunable lifetimes.

         <title>Iridium Photosensitizers Immobilized on Metal&#8211;Organic Layers Lead to Enhanced Enantioselectivity in Ni/Ir Dual Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iridium photosensitizers were immobilized on metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) to construct heterogeneous Ni/Ir dual catalysts, achieving enhanced enantioselectivity in C(sp3)&#9472;H acylation of N&#8208;heterocycles. The MOL surface provides steric modulation and cooperative interactions, enabling up to 99%&#160;ee with excellent reusability.








Abstract
The Ir/Ni dual&#8208;catalytic system plays a crucial role in asymmetric photocatalysis for synthesizing enantioenriched compounds. However, challenges such as the high cost and limited sustainability of Ir complexes hinder its broader application. In this study, we designed three metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) and immobilized functionalized Ir photosensitizers (Ir&#8208;PSs) on their surfaces via coordination exchange or click chemistry, yielding six MOL&#8211;PSs hybrids. Chiral Ni complexes also adhere to the MOL surface through coordination bonds. These dual catalysts exhibited enantioselectivity (up to 99%&#160;ee) superior to that of Ir&#8208;PF6 in the asymmetric acylation of saturated N&#8208;heterocycles at &#945;&#8208;C(sp3)&#9472;H bonds. The enhanced enantioselectivity of the MOL&#8211;PSs over Ir&#8208;PF6 likely arises from steric change of chiral Ni complexes coordinating with hydroxyl or amine groups on the MOLs, which also form ion pairs with Ir&#8208;PSs. This strategy demonstrates broad applicability across diverse chiral ligands and substrates, underscoring the potential of using MOLs in asymmetric photocatalysis to enhance both enantioselectivity and catalyst reusability.

         <title>Fluorinated Lead&#8208;Chelating Molecules Boost Performance, Stability, and Safety of Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional fluorinated lead&#8208;chelating molecule&#8208;based interfacial modifier enables simultaneous surface defect passivation, interfacial band alignment, and Pb2+ sequestration in hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based planar&#8208;structured perovskite solar cells, leading to enhanced efficiency (20.78%), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;2000&#160;h), and improved environmental safety.








Abstract
Hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs) hold promise for low&#8208;cost, stable photovoltaics but suffer from poor interfacial charge extraction, inferior defect passivation, and unresolved environmental risk. Here, we reported a multifunctional interfacial engineering strategy using fluorinated lead&#8208;chelating (FLC) molecules containing sulfonate groups, fluoride atoms, and metal ions. Sulfonate groups coordinated with undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, fluoride atoms formed hydrogen bonds with organic cations, and K+ ions stabilized halide anions, synergistically passivating deep&#8208;level defects and enhancing thermal stability. FLC modification also reduced the perovskite work function (from &#8722;4.14 to &#8722;4.39 eV), improving energy level alignment and facilitating hole extraction at the perovskite/carbon interface. As a result, the optimized devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.7%, among the highest for fully solution&#8208;processed planar HTL&#8208;free C&#8208;PSCs. Unencapsulated devices retained over 93% of initial efficiency after 2000 h in ambient air or after 500 h at 60&#160;&#176;C. Importantly, strong FLC&#8208;Pb2+ chelation significantly reduced lead leakage from severely damaged devices under acidic aqueous environment (334.7 to 53.7&#160;mg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1), achieving &#8764;84% sequestration efficiency. This work presents a unified strategy to enhance efficiency, stability, and environmental safety of simplified perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Tubular All&#8208;Benzene Nanocarbon with Evolving Excited&#8208;State Chirality</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tubular all&#8208;benzene nanocarbons (TANCs) featuring triple covalent linkers have been constructed by coaxially stacked cycloparaphenylene units. The chiral&#8208;TANC exhibits dynamic helicity with ultrafast untwisting motions within 8&#160;ps following photoexcitation. 








Abstract
Molecular nanocarbons with precisely defined conjugated scaffolds can provide an ideal platform for investigating mechanistic insights into photophysical properties. Here, we report the synthesis and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic characterization of two isomeric tubular all&#8208;benzene nanocarbon (TANC) molecules, named meso&#8208; and chiral&#8208;TANC, respectively. Structurally, they feature triple covalent linkages, with different connectivity, between coaxially stacked cycloparaphenylene units. While meso&#8208;TANC maintains conformational rigidity, chiral&#8208;TANC shows photo&#8208;induced dynamic helicity. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) and time&#8208;resolved circularly polarized luminescence (TRCPL) spectroscopy demonstrate that chiral&#8208;TANC undergoes ultrafast relaxation accompanied by untwisting motions within 8&#160;ps upon photoexcitation, establishing the direct correlation between photo&#8208;induced conformational evolution and chiroptical dynamics in heteroatom&#8208;free, fully conjugated molecules.

         <title>A Triple Threat Against Ovarian Cancer: Os(II)&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib Conjugates for Photodynamic Therapy, Chemotherapy, and Immunogenic Cell Death Induction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>

A novel Os(II)&#8208;Pt(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib (Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer) conjugate enables triple&#8208;action anticancer therapy by integrating photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction into a single molecule. Upon near&#8208;infrared light activation, this heterobimetallic complex exhibits potent antiproliferative effects in ovarian cancer models, triggering key ICD hallmarks, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, and HMGB1 secretion.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based anticancer agents offer unique opportunities to integrate multiple therapeutic modalities within a single molecular framework. Herein, we present the first Osmium(II)&#8208;Platinum(IV)&#8208;Ceritinib conjugate (Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer) that synergistically combines photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and immunotherapy via immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction. This heterobimetallic complex features a photoactive osmium(II) polypyridyl core, a platinum(IV) prodrug derived from oxaliplatin, and the kinase inhibitor ceritinib as an axial ligand. Upon deep&#8208;red irradiation (&#955; = 740&#160;nm), the conjugate exhibits potent antiproliferative activity in ovarian 2D cancer cells and 3D tumour spheroids, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. In addition, Os&#8208;Pt&#8208;Cer effectively inhibits cancer cell migration. Mechanistic studies reveal that the conjugate induces hallmarks of ICD, including calreticulin exposure, ATP release, HMGB1 secretion and phagocytosis. This multifunctional approach highlights the potential of osmium(II)&#8208;platinum(IV) conjugates as promising candidates for overcoming resistance and immune evasion in high&#8208;grade ovarian carcinoma.

         <title>Boron&#8211;Oxygen Lewis Pairs Integrated Multi&#8208;Resonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter for High&#8208;Performance BT.2020 Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of a B&#8211;O Lewis pair into an MR&#8208;TADF molecule's skeleton results in a stable, saddle&#8208;shaped 3BON molecule, which exhibits highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emission at 440&#160;nm with a narrow FWHM of 18&#160;nm and a small &#916;EST of 0.12&#160;eV. The resulting OLEDs achieve a record EQEmax of 26.3% in the deep&#8208;blue region. 








Abstract
The quest for deep&#8208;blue emitters meeting the stringent BT.2020 color standard&#8212;requiring an ideal peak, narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM), and minimal singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting (&#916;EST)&#8212;is often hampered by the complex synthesis of multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules. This work introduces a novel, selective strategy: incorporating B&#8211;O Lewis pairs into an MR&#8208;TADF system via intramolecular electrophilic borylation. By carefully controlling a tandem bora&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction, we synthesized the saddle&#8208;shaped molecule 3BON, despite the typical vulnerability of annulated boron structures to retro&#8208;bora&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reactions. 3BON exhibits highly efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emission, with a peak at 440&#160;nm, a narrow FWHM of 18 nm, and a low &#916;EST of 0.12 eV. Compared to its parent emitter, DABNA&#8208;1, 3BON achieves a simultaneous blue&#8208;shift, narrowed FWHM, and reduced &#916;EST. Principal Interacting Orbital (PIO) analysis indicates that unique orbital interactions involving the B&#8211;O Lewis pairs destabilize energy levels, causing the blue&#8208;shifted emission. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) utilizing 3BON demonstrated state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. The device achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 24.8% (at 9 wt.%) with ultra&#8208;deep blue narrowband emission (443 nm peak, 24 nm FWHM; CIE: 0.1554, 0.0454), fully satisfying the BT.2020 standard. Furthermore, 3BON's unique saddle&#8208;shaped architecture imparts remarkable doping tolerance, with EQEmax climbing up to 26.3% across a wide 0.520 wt.% doping range. A hyperfluorescent (HF) device also showed excellent performance (EQEmax = 23.8%, 441 nm peak, 19 nm FWHM). These results represent one of the best BT.2020&#8208;compliant OLED performances reported to date.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Mediated Growth of Oriented Membrane from 2D&#8208;Structured Zirconium MOF for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly face&#8208;on oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membranes of Zr&#8208;TCA were successfully fabricated for gas separation. Fine balancing of the gel&#8208;to&#8208;membrane process enabled horizontal layer deposition and well crystal intergrowth. Unprecedented gas separation performance in terms of high permeance and selectivity was achieved for CO2/N2 mixture. 








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional structured metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;structured MOF) membranes with functionalized and ordered&#8208;direction pores hold significant promise for efficient CO2 separation. However, the direct synthesis of such membranes remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a novel organic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated conversion strategy for direct transformation of a preformed metal&#8211;organic gel (MOG) into an oriented membrane of 2D&#8208;structured MOF. The MOG is initially synthesized and subsequently dissociated to release Zr6 clusters, which promotes the nucleation and growth of the MOF structure. Small organic molecules of formic acid are employed to modulate the coordination between Zr6 clusters and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;&#8208;tricarboxyltriphenylamine ligand (TCA3&#8722;). By finely tuning the balance between crystallization and intergrowth kinetics, a highly oriented Zr&#8208;TCA membrane is fabricated, exhibiting excellent crystallinity and structural homogeneity. The resulting Zr&#8208;TCA membrane features nitrogen&#8208;functionalized, well&#8208;aligned pores oriented parallel to the direction of gas permeation; enabling outstanding CO2/N2 separation performance, with an exceptional CO2 permeance of 1857.3&#160;GPU and a high CO2/N2 selectivity of 39.2 at 0.12&#160;MPa and 25&#160;&#176;C.

Small organic molecules of formic acid are employed to modulate the coordination between Zr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; clusters and 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;-tricarboxyltriphenylamine ligand (TCA&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). By finely tuning the balance between crystallization and intergrowth kinetics, a highly oriented Zr-TCA membrane is fabricated, exhibiting excellent crystallinity and structural homogeneity. The resulting Zr-TCA membrane features nitrogen-functionalized, well-aligned pores oriented parallel to the direction of gas permeation; enabling outstanding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation performance, with an exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeance of 1857.3&#160;GPU and a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 39.2 at 0.12&#160;MPa and 25&#160;&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and CPL Property of Inner&#8208;Wall Modified Pagoda[5]Arenes Driven by Cavity Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of inner&#8208;wall modified pagoda[5]arene (P5) derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions via highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions between P5 and the guests. These derivatives displayed the fixed conformation and stable chirality. Particularly, the neutral inner&#8208;wall modified P5 was resolved by HPLC and exhibited mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism and strong circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Macrocyclic arenes with large cavities and chirality are attractive in supramolecular chemistry, but fixing their conformation and obtaining stable chirality remain significant challenges. The method of rim functionalization with bulky groups often involves multiple reactive sites, leading to poor selectivity and efficiency. Herein, the inner&#8208;wall modification as a promising yet underexplored strategy for achieving fixed conformation and stable chirality of pagoda[5]arene (P5) was developed. Consequently, a series of inner&#8208;wall modified P5 derivatives were obtained in high yields under mild conditions by the highly efficient and selective Diels&#8211;Alder (D&#8211;A) cycloadditions of P5 with (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(N&#8208;alkyl&#8208;4&#8208;pyridinium)ethylene guests, enabled by the guest pre&#8208;organization in the cavity microenvironment of P5. In contrast, reactions of 2,6&#8208;dimethoxyanthracene and the guests are not observed even at 170&#160;&#176;C due to the absence of the cavity microenvironment. Moreover, a neutral inner&#8208;wall modified derivative (P5py) was obtained by post&#8208;reaction demethylation. P5py exhibited stable planar chirality, and its enantiomers were efficiently resolved by chiral HPLC. Notably, the enantiomers showed mirror&#8208;imaged CD signals and strong CPL property. This work provides a new facile strategy for fixing the conformation and achieving the stable chirality of macrocyclic arenes with chiral large cavities, and thereby broadens their prospects for applications in supramolecular and materials chemistry.

         <title>Unbiased Photoelectrochemical H2O2 Production Using Boron Nitride for Both Photogenerated Hole Extraction and Oxygen Reduction Selectivity Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BVO/BN/FeNiOOH photoanode promotes water oxidation under light illumination, where BN acts as a hole extraction layer to promote charge separation. And the CoPc&#160;+&#160;BN cathode carries out continuous reduction of both anodically generated oxygen and atmospheric oxygen to H2O2, where BN as an electron acceptor to create electron&#8208;deficient sites for 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction.








Abstract
Unbiased photoelectrochemical (PEC) H2O2 production offers a sustainable alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, yet faces critical bottlenecks: inefficient charge separation, uncontrolled two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) pathways, and high&#8208;purity O2 requirements. Herein, we report an efficient unbiased PEC system for H2O2 production under ambient air. The key innovation involves the strategic implementation of boron nitride (BN) serves a dual role as a charge transfer mediator and ORR pathway modulator. At the photoanode, BN functions as a hole&#8208;extraction layer, because of elevating the valence band position of BiVO4 (BVO), effectively suppressing interfacial charge recombination between the BVO photoanode and the FeNiOOH cocatalyst, resulting in a photocurrent density achieving 6.08&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 VRHE. At the cathode, BN acts as a &#8220;reaction helmsman&#8221;, tuning the binding energy of the *OOH intermediate and enabling the CoPc&#160;+&#160;BN to achieve 97% 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity at &#8722;0.3 VAg/AgCl. As a result, the integrated system delivers a sustained H2O2 production rate of 1.22&#160;&#177;&#160;0.14&#160;mM cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 over 16 consecutive cycles. This study provides an innovative solution to address the key challenges in bias&#8208;free H2O2 production.

         <title>Electrochemical Assembly of a Defective Cu Catalyst for High Current CO2 Electrolysis to Methane in a Zero&#8208;Gap Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed an electrochemical assembly strategy that forms a Cu(111) catalyst with vacancy defects. Integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer system, this catalyst achieved a high methane FE of 71.46% at a total current of 1.5 A, with a corresponding production rate of 0.28&#160;&#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and stable operation over 10&#160;h.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis to methane offers a promising route toward enabling long&#8208;term storage of renewable energy. However, electrolysis in zero&#8208;gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) systems using conventional Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts is typically limited by relatively low methane productivity and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, we conceived an electrochemical assembly strategy that forms a Cu(111)&#8208;dominant catalyst with vacancy defects. In an MEA system at a total current of 1.5 A, the catalyst (Def&#8208;Cu6) achieved a record methane FE of 71.46% and production rate of 0.28&#160;&#181;mol s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, with relatively stable operation over 10&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal the crucial role of vacancy defects in a Cu(111) surface, which favors the hydrogenation of CO* and promotes methane formation over the competing CO* coupling pathway that leads to multicarbon products. Our findings demonstrate how vacancy defects can be tuned to control catalytic outcomes.

         <title>A Crystalline Bismuth(II) Radical Anion: Synthesis, Characterization, and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A T&#8208;shaped Bi(III) trisamide featuring a sterically demanding NNN pincer ligand was prepared. The planarization of the Bi center furnishes a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital with distinct Bi(6p) orbital character which unlocks clean one&#8208;electron reduction to afford a crystalline Bi(II) radical anion. Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis reveals the localization of the unpaired electron at the bismuth center further confirmed by reactivity studies.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of a planarized tris&#8208;amidobismuthane supported by a rigid, bulky NNN pincer ligand, which enforces a T&#8208;shaped geometry at the bismuth center. The Bi(NNN) complex features a low&#8208;lying LUMO with distinct Bi(6p) orbital character as shown by DFT calculations. Cyclic voltammetry reveals a fully reversible one&#8208;electron reduction at E1/2&#160;=&#160;&#8211;1.85&#160;V versus Fc0/+ in THF. Chemical reduction with KC8 in the presence of 4,7,13,16,21,24&#8208;hexaoxa&#8208;1,10&#8208;diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (222&#8208;crypt) enables the isolation of an unprecedented Bi(II) radical anion in high isolated yields. Multi&#8208;frequency EPR, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry complemented by theoretical calculations confirm localization of the unpaired electron on the bismuth center. Preliminary reactivity studies display radical reactivity as shown by single&#8208;electron transfer chemistry and radical coupling reactions.

Comprehensive spectroscopic analysis reveals the localization of the unpaired electron at the bismuth center further confirmed by reactivity studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the synthesis of a planarized tris-amidobismuthane supported by a rigid, bulky NNN pincer ligand, which enforces a T-shaped geometry at the bismuth center. The Bi(NNN) complex features a low-lying LUMO with distinct Bi(6p) orbital character as shown by DFT calculations. Cyclic voltammetry reveals a fully reversible one-electron reduction at &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#8211;1.85&#160;V versus Fc&lt;sup&gt;0/+&lt;/sup&gt; in THF. Chemical reduction with KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (222-crypt) enables the isolation of an unprecedented Bi(II) radical anion in high isolated yields. Multi-frequency EPR, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry complemented by theoretical calculations confirm localization of the unpaired electron on the bismuth center. Preliminary reactivity studies display radical reactivity as shown by single-electron transfer chemistry and radical coupling reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Inversely designing batteries for longevity: a hierarchical strategy that extends cycle life by separately and concurrently tuning design parameters and interfacial characteristics.








Abstract
Precise design and optimization of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) remain challenging due to their intricate, dynamic degradation mechanisms and the competitive interactions. Building upon a mechanism&#8208;driven LIB lifetime prediction model based on capacity degradation, we propose an inverse design and optimization procedure (IDOP) that integrates parameter sensitivity analysis (PSA) and multiobjective optimization (MOO). For modeling, we employ directly adjustable design parameters of the anode and electrolyte and indirectly derived interfacial characteristics of anode/electrolyte interface. The PSA results indicate that areal density, particle radius, and interface characteristics exert a significant influence on battery lifetime. Using data from a reference LiNi0.6Co0.1Mn0.3O2||graphite pouch cell for assessment, the MOO predicts a battery lifetime extension of up to 26.63% (70.97%) and 32.76% (138.41%) at 25 and 45 &#176;C by optimizing direct (indirect) factors, respectively. Evaluation of the MOO&#8208;optimized factors using the failure&#8208;mechanism&#8208;driven model demonstrates remarkable alignment in capacity degradation trajectories. The IDOP framework is a promising approach to improve the design and optimization efficiency for developing better LIBs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced [2&#960;+2&#963;] Cycloaddition Enabled by Cage&#8208;Confined Photocatalysis for Precise Bicyclo[2.1.1]Hexane Construction</title>

An efficient, visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] photocycloaddition between chalcones and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted BCBs was achieved through photoactive metal&#8211;organic cage (PMOC)confined catalysis. This strategy provides a highly atom economical and diastereoselective route to pharmaceutically relevant BCH bioisosteres, leveraging the unique spatial constraints of the supramolecular cage to control reactivity and selectivity. 








Abstract
We disclose a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced, diastereoselective [2&#960;+2&#963;] photocycloaddition between readily available chalcones and 1,3&#8208;disubstituted bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) promoted by photoactive metal&#8211;organic cage (PMOC). This confined supramolecular catalysis method enables efficient synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant bicyclo[2.1.1]hexane (BCH) bioisosteres with remarkable atom economy and excellent diastereoselectivities, necessitating only 0.1&#160;mol% catalyst loading. The success of this organic transformation arises from the synergistic action of the PMOC as a nanoreactor to combine selective substrate preorganization through host&#8211;guest interactions, efficient Ru(II)&#8208;mediated triplet energy transfer, and nano&#8208;spatial confinement effect that precisely control [2&#960;+2&#963;] cyclization geometry while preventing competitive homodimerization.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Ligand Regulation of Homogeneous Cation&#8211;Anion Distribution Enables Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 49, December 1, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;ligands additives, PCH and PBD achieve homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distribution in perovskite films via coordinated Pb2&#8314;/FA&#8314; passivation and I&#8722; stabilization. This optimized uniformity enables vacuum&#8208;flashed PSCs with a record 26.66% PCE (certified 26.33%) and exceptional stability (&gt;90% efficiency retention after 1100&#160;h MPPT at 60&#160;&#176;C), highlighting ion homogeneity as key for high performance.








Abstract
While amidine ligands are known to significantly enhance defect passivation in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their role in modulating perovskite film homogeneity through coordinated control of cation&#8211;anion distributions remains unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that a dual&#8208;ligand strategy utilizing pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;carboximidamide hydrochloride (PCH) and pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboximidamide dihydrochloride (PBD) achieves homogeneous cation&#8211;anion distributions, enabling high&#8208;performance PSCs. Incorporated into the precursor solutions, these dual&#8208;ligand additives distribute uniformly throughout the perovskite bulk. By simultaneously utilizing their pyridine and amidine groups to passivate Pb2&#8314; and FA&#8314; ions, as well as employing hydrogen bonding to stabilize I&#8722; ions, the uniformity of anions and cations within the film is enhanced. Vacuum flash&#8208;assisted solution&#8208;processed PSCs incorporating PBD&#8208;passivated films with optimized homogeneity achieved a PCE of 26.66% (certified 26.33%). Notably, these devices retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1100 h of continuous maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under operational conditions (60&#160;&#176;C, N2 atmosphere). This PCE value ranks among the highest reported to date for perovskite solar cells. Our findings highlight that achieving homogeneous cation&#8208;anion distribution is essential for designing effective passivators, thereby simultaneously advancing both the PCE and operational stability of PSCs.

         <title>Harnessing Solar Energy, Extending Storage, and Accelerated Release in &#8220;Twisted&#8221; Negative Photochromic Azo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report twisted (hetero)arylazonaphthalene derivatives exhibiting negative photochromism, sunlight&#8208;induced photon energy conversion through E&#8208;Z photoswitching in neutral and acidic media, extended storage through neutralization, and accelerated Z&#8208;E isomerization through strong acid, or triplet sensitization, useful for molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage materials. 








Abstract
We present a series of twisted (hetero)arylazonaphthalene derivatives exhibiting negative photochromism, sunlight&#8208;induced E&#8208;Z photoisomerization, and stimuli&#8208;responsive accelerated Z&#8208;E isomerization, toward the storage and release of energy in molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage materials. Through structural evidence from XRD studies and structure&#8208;property relationships, we envisaged that the geometrical azo&#8208;twist governs the negative photochromism. The salient features of these derivatives include superior sunlight&#8208;driven photoswitching and tuneable thermal half&#8208;lives (t1/2) of Z isomers (days to seconds) even under an acidic medium, and the Z&#8208;E isomerization under triplet photosensitization conditions, exemplifying multi&#8208;mode activation of catalytic Z&#8208;E relaxations on demand. Remarkably, a thin film of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix encapsulating these targets not only retains the photoswitching behavior but also shows sensitivity toward acids and bases. More importantly, the combination of sunlight&#8208;driven forward E&#8208;Z photoisomerization (charging) in acidic medium, storage (&#916;Hiso up to 35&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1), subsequent neutralization to extend the cis isomer's half&#8208;life, and the accelerated reverse Z&#8208;E isomerization (discharging) of these targets sheds new light on the development of MOST materials. Overall, the design of these azo compounds, their characteristics, and ease of functionalization, while retaining their features, render them suitable for applications in various domains.

         <title>Vertically Aligned Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Arrays as Protective Layers for Durable Zinc Anodes with Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;induced morphological regulation strategy via a facile and universal electrodeposition is developed to directly fabricate binder&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable morphologies as protective layers on Zn foil. Particularly, the VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn with vertically aligned MOF arrays possesses fast transport of Zn2+, stable Zn deposition/dissolution and suppressed dendrite formation.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety and low cost, yet side reactions and dendrite growth limit their practicality. Although protective layers on Zn anodes can address these issues, conventional protective layers containing polymer binders often hinder Zn2+ transport and Zn deposition/dissolution. In this study, we develop a ligand&#8208;induced morphological regulation strategy via an electrodeposition approach to directly fabricate binder&#8208;free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as protective layers on Zn anodes, including vertically aligned MOF arrays on Zn (VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn), shaggy horizontal nanosheets on Zn (SHN&#8208;ZnMI@Zn), and compact nanoparticles on Zn (CNP&#8208;ZnTPA@Zn). Among them, the VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn electrode exhibits an ultralow overpotential of 20&#160;mV and an extended cycle life of up to 2400&#160;h. Moreover, the VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn//MnO2@CC full cell exhibits exceptional durability with high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% and a capacity retention of 82% after 2000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Through electrochemical analyses, theoretical calculations, and finite element simulations, it is revealed that the vertically aligned MOFs channels, uniform electrical field distribution, and abundant deposition sites in VAA&#8208;ZnTMA@Zn facilitate accelerated Zn2+ transport and uniform Zn deposition, effectively suppressing dendrite formation. This work provides an efficient route toward durable Zn anodes for aqueous ZIBs.

&lt;p&gt;A ligand-induced morphological regulation strategy via a facile and universal electrodeposition is developed to directly fabricate binder-free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tunable morphologies as protective layers on Zn foil. Particularly, the VAA-ZnTMA@Zn with vertically aligned MOF arrays possesses fast transport of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, stable Zn deposition/dissolution and suppressed dendrite formation.

&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising for large-scale energy storage due to their high safety and low cost, yet side reactions and dendrite growth limit their practicality. Although protective layers on Zn anodes can address these issues, conventional protective layers containing polymer binders often hinder Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport and Zn deposition/dissolution. In this study, we develop a ligand-induced morphological regulation strategy via an electrodeposition approach to directly fabricate binder-free metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as protective layers on Zn anodes, including vertically aligned MOF arrays on Zn (VAA-ZnTMA@Zn), shaggy horizontal nanosheets on Zn (SHN-ZnMI@Zn), and compact nanoparticles on Zn (CNP-ZnTPA@Zn).
