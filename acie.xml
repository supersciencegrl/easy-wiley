      <title>Methanol synthesis at a wide range of H2/CO2 ratios over Rh&#8208;In bimetallic catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>Recent years have seen an increasing interest in capturing hydrogen generated from renewables with CO  2  to produce methanol. However, renewable hydrogen production is currently expensive and in limited quantity as compared to CO  2  . Excess CO  2  and limited H  2  in the feedstock gas mixture is not favourable for the CO  2  hydrogenation to methanol reaction, which causes low activity and poor methanol selectivity. Here we report a new class of Rh&#8208;In catalysts with optimal adsorption property to the intermediates of methanol production. The Rh&#8208;In catalyst can effectively catalyse methanol synthesis but inhibit reverse water&#8208;gas shift reaction under H  2  &#8208;deficient gas flow and shows the best competitive methanol productivity under industrially applicable conditions in comparison with the literature reported values. This work demonstrates a strong potential of Rh&#8208;In bimetallic composition, from which a convenient methanol synthesis based on flexible feedstock compositions (e.g. H  2  /CO  2  from biomass derivatives) with lower energy cost can be established.</dc:description>

      <title>Water&#8208;Soluble&#160;Polymers with Appending Porphyrins as Bioinspired Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular design to improve catalyst performance is significant but challenging. In enzymes, residue groups that are close to reaction centers play critical roles in regulating activities. Using this bioinspired strategy, we designed three water&#8208;soluble polymers with appending Co porphyrins and different side&#8208;chain groups to mimic enzyme reaction centers and activity&#8208;controlling residue groups, respectively. With these polymers, we achieved high hydrogen evolution efficiency in neutral aqueous media for electro&#8208; ( turnover frequency &#160;&gt; 2.3&#215;10  4  &#160;s  &#8211;1  ) and photo&#8208;catalysis (turnover number &gt; 2.7 &#215; 10  4  ). Porphyrin units are surrounded and protected by polymer chains, and more importantly, the activity can be tuned with different side&#8208;chain groups. Therefore, instead of revising molecular structures that is difficult from both design and synthesis points of view, we can use polymers to improve molecular solubility and stability and simultaneously regulate activity by using side&#8208;chain groups.</dc:description>

      <title>Fullerene&#8208;Based Molecular Torsion Balance for Investigating Noncovalent Interactions at C60 Surface</title>
      <dc:description>In order to investigate the nature and strength of noncovalent interactions at the fullerene surface, molecular torsion balances consisting of C60&#160;and organic moieties connected through a biphenyl linkage were designed, synthesized, and characterized. NMR spectroscopy combined with computational studies showed that the unimolecular system remains in equilibrium between well&#8208;defined folded and unfolded conformers owing to restricted rotation around the biphenyl C&#8211;C bond. The measured energy differences between the two conformers depend on the substituents and can, in turn, be ascribed to the differences in the intramolecular noncovalent interactions between the organic moieties and the fullerene surface.&#160;Notably, the results showed that fullerenes favor interacting with the&#160;p&#8208;faces of benzenes bearing electron&#8208;donating substituents.&#160;The correlation between the folding free energies and the corresponding Hammett constants of the substituents in the arene&#8208;containing&#160;torsion&#160;balances is reflective of the contributions of the electrostatic interactions and dispersion force to the face&#8208;to&#8208;face arene&#8211;fullerene interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enantioselective Intramolecular Allylic Substitution via Synergistic Palladium/Chiral Phosphoric Acid Catalysis: Insight into Stereoinduction through Statistical Modeling.</title>
      <dc:description>The mode of asymmetric induction in an enantioselective intramolecular allylic substitution reaction catalyzed by a combination of palladium and a chiral phosphoric acid was investigated by a combined experimental and statistical modeling approach. Experiments to probe nonlinear effects, the reactivity of deuterium&#8208;labeled substrates, and control experiments revealed that the nucleophilic attack to the &#960; &#8208;allylpalladium intermediate is the enantio&#8208;determining step, in which the chiral phosphate anion is involved in stereoinduction. Using multivariable linear regression analysis, we identified that the presence of multiple noncovalent interactions with the chiral environment of the phosphate anion are integral to enantiocontrol in the transition state. The synthetic protocol to form chiral pyrrolidines was further applied to the asymmetric construction of C &#8722; O bonds at fully&#8208;substituted carbon centers in the synthesis of chiral 2,2&#8208;disubstituted benzomorpholines.</dc:description>

      <title>Cationic Oligomer as an Organic Template for Direct Synthesis of Aluminosilicate ITH Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>Despite great progress in the synthesis of aluminosilicate zeolites, there are still a large number of zeolites that could not be prepared in the aluminosilicate form. One of typical examples is ITH zeolite, where direct synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH is currently still challenging. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the successful synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH zeolite using a simple cationic oligomer as an organic template. The key to this success is that the cationic oligomer has a strong complexation ability with aluminum species combined with a structural directing ability for the ITH structure similar to that of the conventional organic template. Physicochemical analysis shows that the aluminosilicate ITH zeolite has very high crystallinity, nanosheet&#8208;like crystal morphology, large surface area, fully four&#8208;coordinated Al species, and abundant acidic sites. More importantly, methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) tests reveal that the Al&#8208;ITH zeolite shows much higher selectivity for propylene and longer lifetime than commercial ZSM&#8208;5. FCC tests show that Al&#8208;ITH zeolite is a good candidate as a shape selective FCC additive for enhancing propylene and butylene selectivity.</dc:description>

One of typical examples is ITH zeolite, where direct synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH is currently still challenging. Herein, for the first time we demonstrate the successful synthesis of aluminosilicate ITH zeolite using a simple cationic oligomer as an organic template. The key to this success is that the cationic oligomer has a strong complexation ability with aluminum species combined with a structural directing ability for the ITH structure similar to that of the conventional organic template. Physicochemical analysis shows that the aluminosilicate ITH zeolite has very high crystallinity, nanosheet&#8208;like crystal morphology, large surface area, fully four&#8208;coordinated Al species, and abundant acidic sites. More importantly, methanol&#8208;to&#8208;propylene (MTP) tests reveal that the Al&#8208;ITH zeolite shows much higher selectivity for propylene and longer lifetime than commercial ZSM&#8208;5. FCC tests show that Al&#8208;ITH zeolite is a good candidate as a shape selective FCC additive for enhancing propylene and butylene selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Overriding Intrinsic Reactivity in Aliphatic C&#8211;H Oxidation: Preferential C3/C4 Oxidation of Aliphatic Ammonium Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective C&#8208;H oxidation of unactivated positions in aliphatic ammonium chains poses a tremendous synthetic challenge for which a solution has not been found yet. Here, we report preferential oxidation of the strongly deactivated C3/C4 positions of aliphatic ammonium substrates by employing a novel supramolecular catalyst. This chimeric catalyst was synthesized by linking the well&#8208;explored catalytic moiety Fe(pdp) to an alkyl ammonium binding molecular tweezer. The results highlight the vast potential of overriding the intrinsic reactivity in chemical reactions by guiding catalysis using supramolecular host structures that enable a precise orientation of the substrates.</dc:description>

      <title>Partially Pyrolyzed Binary Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Efficient Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of versatile materials for fabricating functional heterogeneous catalysts, but the most routine method is through carbonization to form porous carbon materials, which however inevitably losses their inherent MOFs characteristics. Herein, we developed a partially&#8208;controlled pyrolysis strategy to create evenly distributed NiO nanoparticles within NiFe&#8208;MOF nanosheets (MOF NSs) for electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The elemental Ni can be partially transformed to NiO and uniformly distributed on the surface of the MOF NSs, which is crucial for the formation of the particular structure. The optimized MOF NSs&#8208;300 exhibits the highest activity for ORR with near&#8208;zero overpotential and excellent H2O2 selectivity (~99%) in 0.1 M KOH solution. High&#8208;yield H2O2 production rate of 6.5 mol gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 has also been achieved by MOF NSs&#8208;300 at 0.1 M KOH and 0.6 V (vs.RHE). In contrast to completely pyrolyzed products, the enhanced catalytic activities of partially pyrolyzed MOF NSs&#8208;300 is mainly originated from the maintained MOF structure and the newly&#8208;generated NiO nanoparticles, forming the coordinatively unsaturated Ni atoms and tuning the performance towards electrochemical H2O2 synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>What&#8217;s Hot, What&#8217;s Not: The Trends of the Past 20 Years in the Chemistry of Odorants</title>
      <dc:description>This review is the sequel to the 2000 report on the recent advances in the chemistry of odorants and it summarizes the developments in fragrance chemistry over the past 20 years. Following the olfactory spectrum set out in that report, trendsetting so&#8208;called captive odorants (patent&#8208;protected ingredients unavailable to the market) are presented according to the main odor families: &#8220;fruity&#8221;, &#8220;marine&#8221;, &#8220;green&#8221;, &#8220;floral&#8221;, &#8220;spicy&#8221;, &#8220;woody&#8221;, &#8220;amber&#8221;, and &#8220;musky&#8221;. The design of odorants, their chemical synthesis, and their use in modern perfumery are illustrated with prominent examples. Also featured are new fruity odorants that provide signature in the top notes, as well as precursor technology. In the green domain, focus is on leafy notes and green pear. New benzodioxepines and benzodioxoles have modernized the marine family and required a revision of the existing olfactophore models. The replacement of Lilial and Lyral kept the industry busy in the floral domain with a plethora of new &#8216;muguets&#8217;. There was continued activity in the domain of rose odorants, especially in the area of rose ketones. Biotechnology became significant, for example, with Clearwood and Ambrofix, and the principal odorants of vetiver oil in the woody family have been found. Fourth and fifth families of musk odorants were also discovered and populated. Thus, new avenues for further explorations into fragrance chemistry have been opened.</dc:description>

Luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) shine brightly as mesoscopic aggregates, doing &#8220;useful work&#8221; that their molecular components are incapable to do. AIE studies offer exciting opportunities to raise the dimensionality of scientific research from micro to meso level.

Molecular packing of organic luminogens governs their photophysical behavior. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.201913393), E. Hamzehpoor and D.&#8197;F.

The co&#8208;alignment of carbonyl groups in sterically unencumbered TANGO derivatives leads to room temperature phosphorescence (triplet emission) with quantum yields up to 42&#8201;%, while the &#8776;60&#176; rotation due to bulky tert&#8208;butyl groups results in an almost pure fluorescence.

      <dc:description>
1,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles can be used to mimic disulfide bonds and overcome their redox instability. As T. Durek, D.&#8197;J. Craik, and co&#8208;workers show in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003435), the triazole motif can be incorporated into backbone cyclic peptides based on the sunflower trypsin inhibitor&#8208;1 scaffold. NMR and X&#8208;ray structural analyses show that the triazole linkage has exceptional mimicry, whilst maintaining activity and improving metabolic stability compared to its disulfide counterpart.

      <dc:description>
A photoactivatable prodrug approach overcomes the deactivation of drugs based on gold complexes caused by off&#8208;target binding to serum albumin. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202000528), T. Zou et&#8197;al. show that gold(III) hydride complexes are inert towards serum albumin in the dark. Once they enter tumor tissues, their thiol reactivity can be photochemically activated, thereby leading to potent inhibition of tumor thiol enzymes through the formation of Au&#8722;S bonds.

      <title>Molecular spring&#8208;like triple&#8208;helix coordination polymers as dual stress and thermally responsive crystalline metal&#8208;organic materials</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we present a new kind of elastic metal&#8208;organic materials (MOMs) that are capable of multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness based on dual stress and thermally responsive triple&#8208;helix coordination polymers.

      <title>Three&#8208;step Spin State Transition and Hysteretic Proton Transfer in the Crystal of an Iron(II) Hydrazone Complex</title>
      <dc:description>A proton&#8211;electron coupling system, exhibiting unique bistability or multistability of the protonated state, is an attractive target for developing new switchable materials on the basis of proton dynamics. In this paper, we present an iron(II) hydrazone crystalline compound, which displays the stepwise transition and bistability of proton transfer at the crystal level. These phenomena are realized through the coupling with spin transition. Although the multi&#8208;step transition with hysteresis has been observed in various systems (e.g., valence tautomerism), the corresponding behavior of proton transfer has not been reported in crystalline systems; thus, the described iron(II) complex is the first example. Furthermore, because proton transfer occurs only in one of the two ligands and p electrons redistribute in it, the dipole moment of the iron(II) complexes changes with the proton transfer, wherein the total dipole moment in the crystal was canceled out owing to the antiferroelectric&#8208;like arrangement. This study shows the potential for using the proton transfer phenomenon in the materials science field.</dc:description>

      <title>Revisiting the Polymerization of Diphenylacetylenes with Tungsten(VI) Chloride and Tetraphenyltin: An Alternative Mechanism by a Metathesis Catalytic System</title>
      <dc:description>An alternative reaction mechanism of the polymerization of diphenylacetylelnes using a catalytic system composed of tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin has been proposed through the optimization of reaction conditions and investigation of the effect of the electronic nature of diphenylacetylene monomers on the polymerizability. The detailed structures of the polymers have been suggested by mass spectrometric analysis of the obtained polymers and oligomers, which suggested that a phenyl group of tetraphenyltin has been introduced to an initiating end of the polymer chain. Mass spectrometric analysis also provided information about the termination processes of the polymerization. The experimental results strongly suggested that the polymerization of diphenylacetylenes using tungsten(VI) chloride and tetraphenyltin proceeds through a migratory insertion mechanism rather than the long&#8208;accepted metathesis mechanism.</dc:description>

      <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Trifluoromethylation of Phenol Derivatives via Aryl C&#8722;O Bond Activation</title>
      <dc:description>The increasing pharmaceutical importance of trifluoromethylarenes has stimulated the development of more efficient trifluoromethylation reaction. Tremendous efforts have focused on copper&#8208; and palladium&#8208;mediated/catalyzed trifluoromethylation of aryl halides. In contrast, no general method exists for the conversion of widely available inert electrophiles, such as phenol derivatives, into the corresponding trifluoromethylated arenes. We report herein a practical nickel&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation of phenol derivatives with readily available trimethyl(trifluoromethyl)silane (TMSCF3  ). The strategy relies on PMe3  &#8208;promoted oxidative addition and transmetalation, and CCl  3  CN&#8208;induced reductive elimination. The broad utility of this transformation has been demonstrated through the direct incorporation of trifluoromethyl to aromatic and heteroaromatic systems including bio&#8208;relevant compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic, Enantioselective Sulfenofunctionalization of Alkenes&#8212; Development and Recent Advances</title>
      <dc:description>The last decade has witnessed a burgeoning of new methods for the enantioselective vicinal difunctionalization of alkenes initiated by electrophilic sulfenyl group transfer. The addition of sulfenium ions to alkenes results in the generation of chiral, non&#8208;racemic thiiranium ions. These highly reactive intermediates are susceptible to attack by a myriad of nucleophiles in a stereospecific ring&#8208;opening event to afford anti 1,2&#8208;sulfenofunctionalized products. The practical application of sulfenium ion transfer has been enabled by advances in the field of Lewis base catalysis. This Review will chronicle the initial discovery and characterization of thiiranium ion intermediates followed by the determination of their configurational stability and the challenges of developing enantioselective variants. Once the framework for the reactivity and stability of thiiranium ions has been established, a critical analysis of pioneering studies will be presented.

      <title>A New Facet of the Pseudo&#8208;Element Concept: The Arachno&#8208;Zintl Ion (Sn5Sb3)3&#8722; and the Effects of Element Composition on the Structures of Isoelectronic Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Zintl anions are excellent examples of the application of isoelectronic considerations, also referred to as the  pseudo  &#8208;element concept. In its most general formulation, this concept states that isoelectronic atoms tend to form equal numbers of bonds. Hence, clusters such as Zintl ions usually retain their structure upon isoelectronic replacement of some or all atoms. Herein, we present a combined experimental and theoretical study on a deviation from this common observation. We report the formation of (Sn  5  Sb  3  )  3&#8722;  (  1  ), which is a rare example of an eight&#8208;vertex Zintl ion. Furthermore, it is an unprecedented example of a Zintl ion synthesized by solution means that has an  arachno  &#8208;type structure according to the Wade&#8208;Mingos rules, and thus fills a gap in the series of known compounds. Three structure&#8208;types of interest for (Sn  5  Sb  3  )  3&#8722;  were identified by means of quantum chemical calculations, one that matched the X&#8208;ray diffraction data, and two that that were reminiscent of fragments of known clusters. A comprehensive study on the isoelectronic series of clusters, (Sn  x  Sb  8&#8722;x  )  2&#8722;x  (x = 0 &#8211; 8), showed that the relative energies of these three isomers vary significantly with composition &#8211; independent of electron count &#8211; and that each is the global minimum at least once within the series. These results alter our understanding of the factors that determine the structures of multi&#8208;element clusters.</dc:description>

      <title>A Novel Side&#8208;Chain Liquid Crystal Elastomer Exhibiting Anomalous&#160;Reversible Shape Change</title>
      <dc:description>Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) have been actively investigated as stimuli&#8208;controlled actuators and soft robots. The basis of these applications is the ability of LCEs to undergo a reversible shape change upon a liquid crystalline (LC)&#8208;isotropic phase transition. When a mechanically stretched LCE strip with uniaxially aligned mesogens (i.e., monodomain) is heated into the isotropic phase, it contracts in length and elongates in width, while the opposite change occurs on cooling the strip back to the LC phase. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel LCE based on a side&#8208;chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP) and the finding of a unique property of the polymer. In contrast to known LCEs, this LCE exhibits a striking&#160;anomalous&#160;shape change. Subjecting a mechanically stretched monodomain strip to LC&#8208;disorder phase transition, both the length and width of the strip contract in isotropic phase, and both elongate in LC phase. We show that this thermally induced peculiar&#160;behaviour is the result of a subtle interplay between the relaxation of polymer main chain oriented along the stretching direction and the disordering of side&#8208;group mesogens oriented perpendicularly to the stretching direction. This finding points out potential design of LCEs of this peculiar type and possible applications to exploit.</dc:description>

      <title>Boosting Low Valent Al(I) Reactivity with a Potassium Reagent</title>
      <dc:description>It was anticipated that the potassium reagent RK (R = CH(SiMe3)2 or N(SiMe3)2) reacts with the low&#8208;valent Al(I) complex (DIPPBDI)Al (DIPPBDI = HC[C(Me)N(DIPP)]2, DIPP = 2,6&#8208;iPr&#8208;phenyl) to the anionic Al complex [(DIPPBDI)AlR]&#713;K+. However, instead deprotonation of the Me group in the ligand backbone was observed and the Al(I) complex [H2C=C(N&#8208;DIPP)&#8208;C(H)=C(Me)&#8208;N&#8208;DIPP]Al&#713;K+ crystallized as a bright&#8208;yellow product (1, 73%).

The rather short Al&#8208;K bonds (3.499(1)&#8208;3.588(1) &#197;) indicate tight bonding of the dimer. According to DOSY NMR, complex 1 is dimeric in benzene and monomeric in THF but slowly reacts with both solvents. In reaction with benzene, double C&#8208;H bond activation is observed and exclusively a product with a para&#8208;phenylene moiety was isolated. DFT calculations confirm that the anionic Al center in 1 is much more reactive than that in the parent complex (DIPPBDI)Al. Calculations on a full dimeric model system show that both metals, the Al(I) center and the K+ ion, work in concert. Synergy between these metals determines the reactivity of 1.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The major challenge, in solar water splitting to H 2  and O 2  , is in making a stable and affordable system for large&#8208;scale applications. We have designed, fabricated and tested a photoelectrochemical reactor composed of (i) an integrated device, to reduce the balance of system cost, (ii) concentrated sunlight, to reduce the photo&#8208;absorber cost, and (iii) alkaline electrolyte, to reduce catalyst cost and eliminate external thermal management needs. The system consists of an III&#8211;V&#8208;based photovoltaic cell integrated with Ni foil as an O 2  evolution catalyst that also protects the cell from corrosion. At low light concentration, without the use of optical lenses, the STH efficiency was 18.3% while at high light concentration (up to 207 suns) with the use of optical lenses, the STH efficiency was 13%. Catalytic tests conducted for over 100 hours at 100&#8208;200 suns showed no sign of degradation nor deviation from product stoichiometry (H 2  /O 2  =2).

      <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Chemically Stable Covalent Organic Frameworks via Hydrophobic Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>The development of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability is of critical importance for their practical uses. In this work, we for the first time demonstrate the stability of 3D COFs can be improved by periodic decoration of isopropyl groups on their backbones. Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of the alkyl groups, the resultant COFs show high crystallinity, permanent pores, and exceptional stability in harsh environments, such as strong acids (3 M HCl or 3 M H2SO4 for one week), a strong base (20 M NaOH for one week) and boiling water (100 &#186;C for one month). Furthermore, these highly&#8208;stable and hydrophobic COFs display excellent oil/water separation performance with &gt; 99% separation efficiency over a wide pH range. This work demonstrates the use of alkyl decoration in 3D COFs to tune their chemical stability and expand their potential applications.</dc:description>

Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of the alkyl groups, the resultant COFs show high crystallinity, permanent pores, and exceptional stability in harsh environments, such as strong acids (3 M HCl or 3 M H2SO4 for one week), a strong base (20 M NaOH for one week) and boiling water (100 &#186;C for one month). Furthermore, these highly&#8208;stable and hydrophobic COFs display excellent oil/water separation performance with &amp;gt; 99% separation efficiency over a wide pH range. This work demonstrates the use of alkyl decoration in 3D COFs to tune their chemical stability and expand their potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Deciphering the Intersystem Crossing in a Helical BODIPY for Recorded Low Dose Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Intersystem crossing (ISC) of triplet photosensitizers is a vital process for fundamental photochemistry and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the currently effective long wavelength operating photosensitizers have to rely on heavy atoms to enhance ISC. Unfortunately, the heavy atoms, besides their toxicity, can also cause significant reduction in the triplet lifetime of the photosensitizers, which is fundamentally detrimental to their applications. To overcome this challenge, herein we report the co&#8208;existence of efficient ISC and long triplet excited lifetime in a heavy atom&#8208;free Bodipy helicene molecule. Via advanced theoretical computation and time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we confirmed the ISC of the Bodipy is resulted from its twisted molecular structure and reduced symmetry. The twisted Bodipy shows exceptionally intense long wavelength absorption (&#949; = 1.76 &#215; 10  5  M  &#8722;1  cm  &#8722;1  at 630 nm), satisfactory triplet quantum yield (&#934;  T  = 52%) and long&#8208;lived triplet state (&#964;  T  = 492 &#956;s), leading to unprecedented performance as a triplet photosensitizer for PDT. Moreover, nanoparticles constructed with such helical Bodipy show surprisingly efficient PDT mediated antitumor immunity amplification with ultra&#8208;low dose (0.25 &#956;g/kg body weight), which is several hundred times lower than that of the existing PDT reagents. Our study paves the way to design the next generation of triplet photosensitizers.</dc:description>

The probe design involves conjugation of a seminaphthorhodafluor dye with a diselenide moiety. TrxR reduces the diselenide bond, triggering a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response of the probe. Kinetic studies reveal favorable binding of the probe with TrxR with a Michaelis&#8208;Menten constant (K  m  ) of 15.89 &#181;M.

      <title>Beyond Frameworks: Structuring Reticular Materials across Nano, Meso, and Bulk Regimes</title>
      <dc:description>Reticular materials are of high interest for diverse applications ranging from catalysis and separation to gas storage and drug delivery. These open, extended frameworks can be tailored to the intended application through crystal structure design. Implementing these materials in application settings, however, requires structuring beyond their lattices, in order to interface the functionality at the molecular level effectively with the macroscopic world. To overcome this barrier, efforts in expressing structural control across molecular, nano, meso, and bulk regimes is the essential next step. In this minireview, we discuss recent advances in using self&#8208;assembly as well as externally controlled tools to manufacture reticular materials throughout all length scales.

      <title>A Blinking Mesoporous TiO2&#8208;x Composed of Nanosized Anatase with Unusually Long&#8208;Lived Trapped Charge Carriers</title>
      <dc:description>A novel mesoporous TiO2&#8208;x material that is comprised of small, crystalline, vacancy&#8208;rich anatase nanoparticles that show unique optical, thermal and electronic properties is synthesized using polymer&#8208;derived mesoporous carbon (PDMC) as a template. The PDMC pores serve as physical barriers during the condensation and pyrolysis of a titania precursor, preventing the titania nanoparticles from growing beyond 10 nm in size. Unlike most titania nanomaterials, the particles remain in anatase phase and undergo no transition to rutile phase, and also become catalytically&#8208;active reduced TiO2&#8208;x, during pyrolysis. When exposed to a slow electron beam, the nanoparticles exhibit an unprecedented charge/discharge behavior, continuously lighting up and fading away for an average period of ca. 15 s, for an extended period of time. The nanoparticles also show a 50 nm&#8208;red&#8208;shift in their UV&#8208;vis absorption and long&#8208;lived charge carriers (electrons and holes) at room temperature in the dark, even long after UV irradiation. The potential of the new anatase nanoparticles as photocatalysts is demonstrated using CO2 reduction, in which they show a good activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Adaptive flexible sialylated nanogels as highly potent influenza A virus inhibitors</title>
      <dc:description>Flexible multivalent 3&#8208;D nanosystems which can deform and adapt onto the virus surface via specific ligand&#8208;receptor multivalent interactions can efficiently block the virus adhesion onto the cell. We here report on the synthesis of a 250 nm sized flexible sialylated nanogel which adapts onto the influenza A virus (IAV) surface via multivalent binding of its sialic acid (SA) residues with hemagglutinin spike proteins on the virus surface. We could demonstrate that the high flexibility of SA residues in the flexible nanogel improves IAV inhibition by 400 times as compared to a rigid sialylated nanogel in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. The flexible sialylated nanogel efficiently inhibits the Influenza A/X31 (H3N2) infection with IC50  values in low picomolar concentrations and also blocks the virus entry into MDCK&#8208;II cells.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;H Bond Formation at a Diiron Bridging Nitride</title>
      <dc:description>Despite their connection to ammonia synthesis, little is known about the ability of iron&#8208;bound, bridging nitrides to form N&#8211;H bonds. Herein we report a linear diiron bridging nitride complex supported by a redox&#8208;active macrocycle. The unique ability of the ligand scaffold to adapt to the geometric preference of the bridging species was found to facilitate the formation of N&#8211;H bonds via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer to generate a &#181;&#8208;amide product. The structurally analogous &#181;&#8208;silyl&#8208; and &#181;&#8208;borylamide complexes were shown to form from the net insertion of the nitride into the E&#8211;H bonds (E = B, Si). Protonation of the parent bridging amide produced ammonia in high yield, and treatment of the nitride with PhSH was found to liberate NH3 in high yield through a reaction that engages the redox&#8208;activity of the ligand during PCET.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The mechanism of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), which overcomes the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem in organic optoelectronics, is revealed by monitoring the real time structural evolution and dynamics of electronic excited state with frequency and polarization resolved ultrafast ultraviolet/infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

Without such a reaction mechanism, the electronic excitation is preserved in the molecular solids and the molecule fluoresces efficiently, aided by the very slow intermolecular charge and energy transfers due to the well separated molecular packing arrangement in solids.

      <title>The Enantioselective Preparation of Arenes with &#946;&#8208;Stereogenic Centers: Confronting the 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Olefin Problem Using CuH/Pd Cooperative Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Arenes with &#946;&#8208;stereogenic centers are important substructures in pharmaceuticals and natural products. Their synthesis traditionally involves two separate and individually challenging steps: enantioselective synthesis of a chiral main&#8208;group organometallic complex and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling with an aryl electrophile. We describe the development of asymmetric anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted olefins by dual palladium and copper hydride catalysis as a convenient and significantly more general alternative. This reaction is an efficient one&#8208;step process that addresses several limitations of the stepwise approaches. The use of cesium benzoate as a base and a common phosphine ligand for both the Cu&#8208; and Pd&#8208;catalyzed processes were important discoveries that allowed these challenging olefin substrates to be efficiently transformed to products. A variety of aryl bromide coupling partners, including numerous heterocycles, were coupled with 1,1&#8208;disubstituted alkenes to generate arenes with &#946;&#8208;stereogenic centers. Finally, the effect of the level of olefin substitution on reaction yield and enantioselectivity has been investigated.</dc:description>

      <title>Air, Moisture, Extreme pH Stable Cs2PtI6 Halide Perovskite for Photoelectrochemical Solar Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>Halide perovskites show incredible photovoltaic power conversion efficiency coupled with several hundreds of hours of device stability for finely tuned material compositions. It is expected to employ such a successful photovoltaic material in (photo)electrochemical(PEC) systems, including solar water splitting. However their stability is very poor in aqueous electrolyte medium and they decompose instantly, which limits their use in PEC systems. Here we report a vacancy ordered halide perovskite, Cs  2  PtI  6  , which shows extraordinary stability in ambient (1 year), aqueous medium of extreme acidic (pH 1), basic (pH 13) and electrochemical reduction conditions. We investigated their electrochemical and photoelectrochemical redox processes under various pH and applied potentials, and employed them as electrocatalyst&#160;and photoanode&#160;for hydrogen production and water oxidation respectively. The catalyst remains intact for at least 100 cycles of electrochemical cycling and six hours of hydrogen production at pH 1. The Cs  2  PtI  6  was employed as photoanode for PEC water oxidation and at pH 11, the material displayed photocurrent of 0.8 mA cm  &#8208;2  under simulated AM1.5G sunlight. Using constant voltage measurement, we found that Cs  2  PtI  6  exhibited over 12 hours of PEC stability without loss of performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Fast and Stable N&#8208;Terminal Cysteine Modification via Thiazolidino Boronate Mediated Acyl Transfer</title>
      <dc:description>We report herein a novel conjugation chemistry of N&#8208;terminal cysteines (NCys) that proceeds with fast kinetics and exquisite selectivity, allowing facile modification of NCys&#8208;bearing proteins in complex biological milieu. This new NCys conjugation proceeds with  a thiazolidine boronate (TzB) intermediate  that results from fast (  k  2  : ~5000 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) and reversible conjugation of NCys with 2&#8208;formylphenylboronic acid (FPBA). We have designed a FPBA derivative that upon TzB formation elicits an intramolecular acyl transfer to give N&#8208;acyl thiazolidines. In contrast to the quick hydrolysis of TzB, the N&#8208;acylated thiazolidines exhibit robust stability under physiologic conditions. The utility of the TzB mediated NCys conjugation is demonstrated by rapid and non&#8208;disruptive labeling of two enzymes. Furthermore, applying this chemistry to bacteriophage allows facile chemical modification of phage libraries, which greatly expands the chemical space amenable to phage display.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>By harnessing a highly efficient metal&#8208;catalysed tandem cycloaddition reaction as the key benzannulation step, a series of cyclopolyarene nanorings of varied sizes are obtained from poly(arylene&#8208;butadiynylene) macrocyclic precursors, which can be synthesized relatively conveniently. Interestingly, due to the nonparallel bond connectivity of the repeat unit, unique M&#246;bius topology is manifested by the cyclopolyarene nanorings composed of an odd number of repeat units, whereas cylindrical tubular structures with radial conjugation are formed with those consisting of an even number of repeat units.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By harnessing a highly efficient metal&#8208;catalysed tandem cycloaddition reaction as the key benzannulation step, a series of cyclopolyarene nanorings of varied sizes are obtained from poly(arylene&#8208;butadiynylene) macrocyclic precursors, which can be synthesized relatively conveniently. Interestingly, due to the nonparallel bond connectivity of the repeat unit, unique M&#246;bius topology is manifested by the cyclopolyarene nanorings composed of an odd number of repeat units, whereas cylindrical tubular structures with radial conjugation are formed with those consisting of an even number of repeat units.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Shedding Light on the Diverse Reactivity of an Al(I) Compound with N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
      <dc:description>The aluminum (I) compound NacNacAl (  1  ) shows diverse and substrate&#8208;controlled reactivity in reactions with  N  &#8208;heterocycles. DMAP, a basic substrate in which the 4&#8208;position is blocked, induces rearrangement of NacNacAl by shifting a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of the NacNac backbone to the aluminum center. In contrast, CH activation of the methyl group of 4&#8208;picoline takes place to produce a species with a reactive terminal methylene. Reaction of  1  with 3,5&#8208;lutidine results in the first example of an uncatalyzed, room temperature cleavage of an sp  2  C&#8208;H bond (in the 4&#8208;position) by Al(I). Another reactivity mode was observed for quinoline which undergoes 2,2&#8217;&#8208;coupling. Finally, reaction with phthalazine produces the product of N&#8208;N bond cleavage.</dc:description>

      <title>Selection of DNA&#8208;encoded Dynamic Chemical Libraries for Direct Inhibitor Discovery</title>
      <dc:description>Dynamic combinatorial library (DCL) is a powerful tool for ligand discovery in biomedical research; however, the development of DCL has been hampered by its low diversity. Recently, the concept of DNA encoding has been employed in DCL to create DNA&#8208;encoded dynamic libraries (DEDLs); however, all current DEDLs are limited to fragment identification, and a challenging process of fragment linking is required after selection. We report an anchor&#8208;directed DEDL approach that can identify full ligand structures from large&#8208;scale DEDLs. This method is also able to convert unbiased libraries to focused ones targeting specific protein classes. We demonstrated this method by selecting DEDLs against five proteins, and novel inhibitors have been identified for all targets. Notably, several selective BD1/BD2 inhibitors were identified from the selections against BRD4 (bromodomain 4), an important anti&#8208;cancer drug target. This work may provide a broadly applicable method for inhibitor discovery.</dc:description>
