         <title>Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Octahedral Cages with Three Types of Chirality towards Spontaneous Resolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is one of the most important intrinsic properties of (supra)molecules. In this study, we obtained enantiomeric metallo&#8208;supramolecular octahedra without using any chiral sources. Such cages were self&#8208;assembled by prochiral trispyridine ligand  L  based on a  C3h  truxene core and Cu(II) salts. Crystallization of the cages with BF4&#9472;&#160;as counterions afforded racemate crystals; while crystallizations of cages with ClO4&#9472;&#160;and OTf&#9472;&#160;as counterions resulted in conglomerates with spontaneous resolution. Three types of chirality were observed in each cage, including planar chirality of the truxene core, axial chirality from the pyridyl and truxene moieties, and propeller chirality of the pyridyl&#8208;Cu(II) coordination sites. The cages reported here are among the largest discrete synthetic metallo&#8208;supramolecules ever reported with chiral self&#8208;sorting behavior. Remarkably, the chiral cage exhibited very slow racemization even at low concentrations, suggesting their high stability in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Debromination of 2,3&#8208;Bis(dibromomethyl)&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;Bis(bromomethyl)naphthalene: Dimerization or Polymerization?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>C&#8208;C bond formation on metal surfaces has attracted great attention as a route toward novel molecular nanostructures under ultrahigh&#8208;vacuum conditions. Unlike the extensively explored reactions of aryl halides, we describe the on&#8208;surface dehalogenative homocoupling of benzylic bromides, namely bis&#8208;bromomethyl&#8208; and bis&#8208;  gem  &#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene as a potential route to either hydrocarbon dimers or conjugated polymers on Au (111). While bis&#8208;  gem  &#8208;(dibromomethyl) naphthalene affords different dimers with naphthocyclobutadiene as the key intermediate, bis&#8208;bromomethyl naphthalene furnishes a poly(  o  &#8208;naphthylene vinylidene) as a non&#8208;conjugated polymer which undergoes dehydrogenation toward its conjugated derivative poly(  o  &#8208;naphthylene vinylene) upon mild annealing. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and density functional theory calculations provides deep insights into the prevailing mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Demanding Flexible Phosphoric Acids for Constructing Efficient and Multi&#8208;Purpose Asymmetric Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of counterion enhanced catalysis to promote the asymmetric functionalization of enones was demonstrated. Combining the use of sterically demanding phosphoric acids with simple chiral diamines allowed for the preparation of simple ion&#8208;paired and highly tunable organocatalysts. The latter could be applied in four different asymmetric transformations, providing a highly enantioselective access to both product antipodes in all cases.







Abstract
Herein, we present a novel approach for various asymmetric transformations of cyclic enones. The combination of readily accessible chiral diamines and sterically demanding flexible phosphoric acids resulted in a simple and highly tunable catalyst framework. The careful optimization of the catalyst components led to the identification of a particularly powerful and multi&#8208;purpose organocatalyst, which was successfully applied for asymmetric epoxidations, aziridinations, aza&#8208;Michael&#8208;initiated cyclizations, as well as for a novel Robinson&#8208;like Michael&#8208;initiated ring closure/aldol cyclization. High catalytic activities and excellent stereocontrol was observed for all four reaction types, indicating the excellent versatility of our catalytic system. Furthermore, a simple change in the diamine's configuration provided easy access to both product antipodes in all cases.

         <title>Controlled Tetradeuteration of Straight&#8208;Chain Fatty Acids: Synthesis, Application, and Insight into the Metabolism of Oxidized Linoleic Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions has been developed. The use of four deuterium atoms in fatty acids as well as a diagnostic peak of phosphatidylcholines thus obtained enabled the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from an oxidized linoleic acid, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), to lysophosphatidylcholine.







Abstract
We describe a concise and reliable protocol for the precisely controlled tetradeuteration of straight&#8208;chain fatty acids (FAs) at the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions that is generally applicable to a variety of FAs, including trans&#8208;FAs, polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), and their oxidized derivatives. The precisely controlled introduction of four deuterium atoms into the FAs enables their persistent and quantitative tracking by LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis based on their molecular structures. In addition, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) species prepared from the tetradeuterated FAs thus obtained give a diagnostic peak, namely, a phosphocholine fragment that contains deuterium, in the LC&#8208;MS/MS analysis. With these features, the metabolism of a representative oxidized linoleic acid, that is, hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), was investigated, leading to the identification of acyltransferases that transfer the acyl moiety derived from HODE to lysophosphatidylcholine.

         <title>In Situ Hydrolysis of Block Copolymers at the Water&#8208;Oil Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;time pendant drop tensiometry of a toluene solution of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) in water was measured to monitor the conversion of PSM blocks into glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) blocks upon the addition of acid to the aqueous phase. This work provides opportunities to quantitatively monitor responsive block copolymers for structuring liquids.







Abstract
In situ manipulation of the chemical composition of block copolymers at the fluid interfaces affords a route by which the interfacial tension, the packing of the copolymers, and the penetration of the blocks into the two liquids can be controlled. Here, a series of linear block copolymers of poly(solketal methacrylate&#8208;b&#8208;styrene) (PSM&#8208;b&#8208;PS) are used, converting hydrophobic PSM block into a hydrophilic glycerol monomethacrylate (GM) block, that results in a marked decrease in the liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial tension. The kinetics of the first&#8208;order hydrolysis reaction was analyzed by monitoring the time&#8208;dependent interfacial tension as a function of pH, polymer concentration, molecular weight, and composition. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to measure the in&#8208;plane dynamics of the copolymers before and after hydrolysis. This work provides insights into a quantitative pathway by which in situ interfacial reactions may be performed and monitored in real time, completely changing the interfacial activity of the molecule.

         <title>Protocellular CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Based Diffusive Communication Using Transcriptional RNA Signaling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering synthetic biochemical machinery for information processing and communication is essential for the construction of artificial protocells with complex dynamic behaviors. Here we use synthetic transcriptional circuits to produce diffusive RNA signal that can regulate CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing and localization in a binary community of synthetic protocells.







Abstract
Protocells containing enzyme&#8208;driven biomolecular circuits that can process and exchange information offer a promising approach for mimicking cellular features and developing molecular information platforms. Here, we employ synthetic transcriptional circuits together with CRISPR/Cas&#8208;based DNA processing inside semipermeable protein&#8208;polymer microcompartments. We first establish a transcriptional protocell that can be activated by external DNA strands and produce functional RNA aptamers. Subsequently, we engineer a transcriptional module to generate RNA strands functioning as diffusive signals that can be sensed by neighboring protocells and trigger the activation of internalized DNA probes or localization of Cas nucleases. Our results highlight the opportunities to combine CRISPR/Cas machinery and DNA nanotechnology for protocellular communication and provide a step towards the development of protocells capable of distributed molecular information processing.

         <title>Switch from Anionic Polymerization to Coordinative Chain Transfer Polymerization: a Valuable Strategy to Make Olefin Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successive anionic polymerization and transmetallation reaction were used to design in situ macromolecular chain transfer agents involved in coordinative chain transfer copolymerization (CCTcoP) of ethylene and butadiene. Olefin block copolymers were formed for the first time by the switch from anionic polymerization to CCT(co)P.







Abstract
Anionic polymerization of butadiene or/and styrene is performed with lithium initiators, functional or not. The polymer chains are subsequently transferred to magnesium. The resulting polymeryl&#8208;magnesium compounds were combined with {(Me2Si(C13H8)2)Nd(&#956;&#8208;BH4)[(&#956;&#8208;BH4)Li(THF)]}2 metallocene complex to act as macromolecular chain transfer agents (macroCTAs) in coordinative chain transfer polymerization (CCTP) of ethylene (E) or its copolymerization (CCTcoP) with butadiene (B). Block copolymers were produced for the first time by this switch from anionic polymerization to CCTP. Hard and soft blocks such as PB, polystyrene (PS), poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (SBR) obtained by anionic polymerization and PE or poly(ethylene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) (EBR) produced by CCT(co)P were combined and the corresponding structures were characterized.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Trisubstituted Alkenes by Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Benzylation and Alkene Isomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8722;NiI catalyst promotes regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides to afford trisubstituted borylalkenes and styrenes. The reaction proceeds through branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation followed by trans&#8208;selective allyl isomerization.







Abstract
Catalytic strategies that provide stereoselective access to highly substituted alkenes from abundant monosubstituted substrates are exceedingly sought&#8208;after but rare. Here, we show that a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;NiI catalytic species mediates efficient union of electronically polarized terminal olefins with benzyl chlorides, in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate and trimethylamine additives, to generate trisubstituted boron&#8208; and arene&#8208;containing trans alkenes in excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities. Control experiments provide evidence for a mechanism involving branched&#8208;selective Heck&#8208;type benzylation that overrides substrate control, followed by trans&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift. The method represents a significant addition to the toolbox of reactions for the concise synthesis of unsaturated biologically active compounds.

         <title>Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting Under Visible Light Enabled by a Particulate Conjugated Polymer Loaded with Palladium and Iridium**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone) loaded with Pd/IrO2 facilitates stoichiometric overall water splitting for an extended period after the system stabilized, albeit currently with low activities. The study demonstrates the importance of co&#8208;catalysts for polymer photoatalysts and results were rationalized by transient absorption spectroscopy.







Abstract
Polymer photocatalysts have received growing attention in recent years for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Most studies report hydrogen production with sacrificial electron donors, which is unsuitable for large&#8208;scale hydrogen energy production. Here we show that the palladium/iridium oxide&#8208;loaded homopolymer of dibenzo[b,d]thiophene sulfone (P10) facilitates overall water splitting to produce stoichiometric amounts of H2 and O2 for an extended period (&gt;60&#8197;hours) after the system stabilized. These results demonstrate that conjugated polymers can act as single component photocatalytic systems for overall water splitting when loaded with suitable co&#8208;catalysts, albeit currently with low activities. Transient spectroscopy shows that the IrO2 co&#8208;catalyst plays an important role in the generation of the charge separated state required for water splitting, with evidence for fast hole transfer to the co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>Hydroxylated Multi&#8208;walled Carbon Nanotubes Covalently Modified with Tris(hydroxypropyl) Phosphine as a Functional Interlayer for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have successfully constructed a new type of intercalation membrane material by covalently grafting organic molecules tris (hydroxypropyl) phosphine (THPP) onto hydroxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNT&#8208;OH) as a functional interlayer for the advanced LSBs. The as&#8208;assembled interlayer has been demonstrated to be responsible for the fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as the formation of stable SEI layer. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we further found THPP plays a key role in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides into low&#8208;ordered lithium sulfides and suppressing the loss of polysulfides, thus rendering the as&#8208;designed lithium&#8208;sulfur battery in this work a high capacity, excellent rate performance and long&#8208;term stability. Even at low temperatures, the capacity decay rate was only 0.036% per cycle for 1700 cycles.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have successfully constructed a new type of intercalation membrane material by covalently grafting organic molecules tris (hydroxypropyl) phosphine (THPP) onto hydroxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT-OH) as a functional interlayer for the advanced LSBs. The as-assembled interlayer has been demonstrated to be responsible for the fast conversion kinetics of polysulfides, the inhibition of polysulfide shuttle effect, as well as the formation of stable SEI layer. By means of spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis, we further found THPP plays a key role in accelerating the conversion of polysulfides into low-ordered lithium sulfides and suppressing the loss of polysulfides, thus rendering the as-designed lithium-sulfur battery in this work a high capacity, excellent rate performance and long-term stability. Even at low temperatures, the capacity decay rate was only 0.036% per cycle for 1700 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Na/K Alloy Interfacial Synthesis of Functional Porous Carbon at Ambient Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functional groups in porous carbon generally suffer a severe loss during the high&#8208;temperature carbonization. Instead, the low&#8208;temperature synthesis of carbon featuring porous structures and abundant functional groups is not only a solution that evades the pitfalls of pyrolysis but also is of significance for the development of synthetic methodology. Herein, a liquid metal interfacial engineering strategy is reported for the synthesis of porous carbon using CCl4 as the carbon precursor and sodium&#8208;potassium alloy (NaK) as the reducing agent, which is superior to traditional synthetic methods because it enables the engineering of a highly active liquid metal alloy microemulsion to directly generate porous carbon at ambient temperature. As synthesized porous carbon featured abundant carbon&#8208;chlorine bonds can be tandem grafted with imidazole and 1,2&#8208;dibromoethane to achieve a CO2 cycloaddition catalyst, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity, in addition to exceptional stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar Energy Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When it comes to using solar energy to promote catalytic reactions, photocatalysis technology will be first thought. However, the sunlight can not only be directly converted to chemical energy through photocatalytic process, but can also be converted through different energy transfer pathways. Using sunlight as the energy source, photocatalytic reaction can proceed independently, and can also be coupled with other catalytic technologies to enhance overall catalytic efficiency. Therefore, sun light driven catalytic reactions are diversified, and need to be given a specific definition. We propose a timely perspective for the catalytic reactions driven by sunlight and give them a specific definition, namely Solar Energy Catalysis. The concept of different types of solar energy catalysis, such as photocatalysis, photothermal catalysis, solar cell powered electrocatalysis and pyroelectric catalysis, are highlighted. Finally, their limitations and future research direction are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free SF6 Activation: A New SF5&#8208;Based Reagent Enables Deoxyfluorination and Pentafluorosulfanylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of SF  6  , a potent greenhouse gas, under metal&#8208;free and visible light conditions is reported. Herein, mechanistic investigations including EPR spectroscopy, NMR studies and cyclic voltammetry allowed the rational design of a new fluorinating reagent which was synthesized from the 2&#8208;electron activation of SF  6  with commercially available TDAE. This new SF  5  &#8208;based reagent was efficiently employed for the deoxyfluorination of CO  2  and the fluorinative desulfurization of CS  2  allowing the formation of useful fluorinated amines. Moreover, for the first time we demonstrated that our SF  5  &#8208;based reagent could afford the mild generation of Cl&#8208;SF  5  gas. This finding was exploited for the chloro&#8208;pentafluorosulfanylation of alkynes and alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Photoluminescent Single&#8208;Chain Nanoparticles by Electrostatic Mediated Intramolecular Crosslinking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We reported large&#8208;scale synthesis of photoluminescent SCNPs by electrostatic mediated intramolecular crosslinking in a concentrated solution of 40 mg/mL by continuous addition of the free radical initiator. The example polymer of poly(vinyl benzyl chloride) was charged by quaternization with vinyl&#8208;imidazolium for the intramolecular crosslinking by using 2,2&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;2&#8208;phenylacetophenone (DMAP) as the radical initiator. Under the electrostatic repulsion thus interchain isolation, the intrachain crosslinking experiences the transition from coil through pearl&#8208;necklace to globular state. The SCNPs demonstrate strong photoluminescence at visible range when the non&#8208;emissive units are confined thereby. Composition and microstructure of the SCNPs are tunable. The example photoluminescent tadpole&#8208;like Janus SCNP can be used to selectively illuminate interfacial membranes while stabilizing the emulsions.</dc:description>

Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N&#8208;M bond structures and coordination is limited. Herein, we expand the coordination environments of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts by designing dual&#8208;metal active sites. The Ni&#8208;Fe catalyst displayed the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N&#8208;coordinated dual&#8208;metal site configurations are 2N&#8208;bridged (Fe&#8208;Ni)N6, in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual&#8208;metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single&#8208;metal sites (FeN4 or NiN4) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acetylene semihydrogenation is a key technology for producing polymer&#8208;grade ethylene from crude ethylene. Ni&#8208;based catalysts are promising alternatives to noble&#8208;metals for this process. However, achieving high catalytic activity and selectivity remains a big challenge. We report a novel catalyst design based on high&#8208;entropy intermetallics (HEI), which provide thermally stable isolated Ni without excess counterpart metals and achieve exceptionally high performance. Intermetallic NiGa was multi&#8208;metalized to a (NiFeCu)(GaGe), where the Ni and Ga sites were partially substituted with Fe/Cu and Ge, respectively, without altering the parent CsCl&#8208;type structure. The NiFeCuGaGe/SiO  2  HEI catalyst completely inhibited ethylene overhydrogenation even at complete acetylene conversion, and exhibited five&#8208;times higher activity than other 3d&#8208;transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The DFT study showed that the surface energy decreased by multi&#8208;metallization, which drastically weakened ethylene adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Ammonium Ion Battery: A New Strategy for Nonmetallic Ion Energy Storage System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetallic ammonium (NH  4  +  ) ion batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage system, which have the merit of low molar mass, sustainability, non&#8208;toxicity and non&#8208;dendrite. Herein, for the first time, we introduce the novel organic ammonium ion batteries (OAIBs). Significantly, a manganese&#8208;based Prussian white analogue (noted as MnHCF) as cathode exhibits a reversible capacity of 104 mAh g  &#8208;1  with 98% retention over 100 cycles. We further demonstrated the electrochemical performance of NH  4  +  ion full cell, which delivers a reversible capacity of 45 mAh g  &#8208;1  with a broad electrochemical window. Combining ex&#8208;situ XPS, ex&#8208;situ XRD results and electrochemical properties, the NH  4  +  ions storage mechanism of MnHCF in non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte is clearly revealed. This work verifies the feasibility of employing NH  4  +  ions as charge carriers in organic energy storage system and provides new insights for designing organic nonmetallic ion batteries with broad electrochemical windows and high energy density.</dc:description>

         <title>Anisotropy in a 2D Perovskite Ferroelectric Drives Self&#8208;Powered Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photoresponse for Ultraviolet Solar&#8208;Blind Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polarized&#8208;light detection in deep ultraviolet solar&#8208;blind region is indispensable for optoelectronic application. 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics with inherent anisotropy and bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) have become a robust candidate in this portfolio. We here report a wide band&#8208;gap 2D perovskite ferroelectric, (isobutylammonium)2(methylamium)Pb2Cl7 (1), in which BPVE behaves as self&#8208;driving source for solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet polarized&#8208;light detection. It exhibits a large dichroism ratio (~15.7) and superior BPVE&#8208;directed photocurrent (~3.6 &#956;A/cm2, under 266 nm). These attributes facilitate excellent self&#8208;powered polarized&#8208;light detection of high on/off contrast (~103) and polarization ratio (~2.5), beyond those of inorganic oxides (e.g., ZnO, 1.47; GaN, 1.38). This study highlights potential of 2D perovskite ferroelectrics for new optoelectronic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Proton&#8211;Electron Coupling in &#960;&#8208;Planar Metal Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) of metal complexes has been widely studied, especially in biochemistry and catalytic chemistry. Although metal complexes bearing redox&#8208;active ligands play a part in these research areas, those with &#960;&#8208;planar structure remain entirely unexplored, which are vital for future development of iono&#8208;electronics. Here, proton&#8211;electron coupling of a &#960;&#8208;planar nickel complex bearing redox&#8208;active N,S&#8208;ligands, Ni(itsq)2, was investigated by combining experimental and theoretical approaches. Strong proton&#8211;electron coupling was manifested in a large potential shift, which is twice greater than that of a typical PCET&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;planar metal complex with redox&#8208;inactive ligands, [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8211;. Theoretical calculations affirmed that the stabilization of frontier orbitals by protonation is greater in Ni(itsq)2 than that in [Ni(dcpdt)2]2&#8211;. These results indicate that &#960;&#8208;planar metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands are promising for developing novel PCET&#8208;type materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermal Alteration in Adsorption Sites over SAPO&#8208;34 Zeolite</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolites have found tremendous applications in the chemical industry. However, it is unclear about the dynamic nature of their active sites under the flow of adsorbate molecules for adsorption and catalysis, especially in operando conditions, which could be different from the as&#8208;synthesized structures. In the present study, we report a structural transformation of the adsorptive active sites in SAPO&#8208;34 zeolite by using acetone as a probe molecule under various temperatures. The combination of solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, in&#8208;situ variable&#8208;temperature synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffraction, and in&#8208;situ diffuse&#8208;reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy allow a clear identification and quantification that the chemisorption of acetone can convert the classical Br&#248;nsted acid site adsorption mode to an induced Frustrated Lewis Pairs adsorption mode at increasing temperatures. Such facile conversion is also supported by the calculations of ab&#8208;initio molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations. This work sheds new light on the importance of the dynamic structural alteration of active sites in zeolites with adsorbates at elevated temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Regulation of FeN4 Spin State by Neighboring Cu Atoms for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis in Flexible Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron, nitrogen&#8208;codoped carbon (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) nanocomposites have emerged as viable electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the formation of FeN  x  C  y  moieties.  In this study, results from first&#8208;principles calculations show a nearly linear correlation of the energy barriers of key reaction steps with the Fe magnetic moment. Experimentally, when single Cu sites are incorporated into Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C aerogels (denoted as NCAG/Fe&#8208;Cu), the Fe centers exhibit a reduced magnetic moment and markedly enhanced ORR activity within a wide pH range of 0~14  .

         <title>Anomalous Redox Features Induced by Strong Covalency in Layered NaTi1&#8208;yVyS2 Cathodes for Na&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rising demand for energy density of cathodes means the need to raise the voltage or capacity of cathodes. Transition metal (TM) doping has been employed to enhance the electrochemical properties in multiple aspects. The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, we found anomalous redox features in NaTi  1&#8208;y  V  y  S  2  . The first discharge platform potential (2.4 V) is significantly higher than that of undoped NaTiS  2  and NaVS  2  (both around 2.2 V), and the energy density is raised by 15%. We speculate that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong hybridization in Ti&#8208;V&#8208;S system. Ti  3+  and V  3+  undergo charge transfer, form a more stable Ti (t  2g  0  e  g  0  ) and V (t  2g  3  e  g  0  ) electronic configuration. Our results state that higher voltage of cathode materials could be achieved by strong TM&#8208;ligand covalency, and this conclusion provides the possible opportunities to explore high voltage materials for future layered cathodes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The rising demand for energy density of cathodes means the need to raise the voltage or capacity of cathodes. Transition metal (TM) doping has been employed to enhance the electrochemical properties in multiple aspects. The redox voltage of doped cathodes usually falls in between the voltage of undoped layered cathodes. However, we found anomalous redox features in NaTi  1-y  V  y  S  2  . The first discharge platform potential (2.4 V) is significantly higher than that of undoped NaTiS  2  and NaVS  2  (both around 2.2 V), and the energy density is raised by 15%. We speculate that the anomalous voltage is mainly attributed to the strong hybridization in Ti-V-S system. Ti  3+  and V  3+  undergo charge transfer, form a more stable Ti (t  2g  0  e  g  0  ) and V (t  2g  3  e  g  0  ) electronic configuration. Our results state that higher voltage of cathode materials could be achieved by strong TM-ligand covalency, and this conclusion provides the possible opportunities to explore high voltage materials for future layered cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Growth of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Assemblies on Cu(100) and Cu(111): from Single Molecules to Magic&#8208;Number Islands</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have superior properties as building blocks of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs). Understanding the influence of the substrate in the molecular arrangement is a fundamental step before employing these ligands in technological applications. Herein, we study the molecular arrangement of a model NHC on Cu(100) and Cu(111). While mostly disordered phases appear on Cu(100), on Cu(111) well&#8208;defined structures are formed, evolving from magic&#8208;number islands to molecular ribbons with coverage. This work presents the first example of magic&#8208;number islands formed by NHC assemblies on flat surfaces. Intermolecular interactions, diffusion and commensurability are key factors explaining the observed arrangements. These results shed light on the molecule&#8208;substrate interaction and open the possibility of tuning nanopatterned structures based on NHC assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Heavy Atom&#8208;Free, Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted, and Activatable Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy with Real&#8208;Time In&#8208;Situ Therapeutic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free and mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizers (PSs) with the real&#8208;time in situ self&#8208;reporting ability was constructed for photodynamic cancer therapy. Based on the platform, activatable PSs were further developed, and their ability in either selective killing of cancer cells over normal cells or in effectively ablating an implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.







Abstract
Based on spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing mechanism, two heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free photosensitizers (PSs) BDP1/BDP2 with absorption maxima at 506&#8197;nm/660&#8197;nm were constructed for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The long triplet state lifetimes and large singlet oxygen quantum yields, coupled with the mitochondria&#8208;targeted feature, made them highly phototoxic toward cancer cells. Moreover, the PDT&#8208;promoted cell apoptosis could be monitored by an obvious fluorescence off&#8208;on response of the two PSs due to the concomitant activation of extensive mitophagy, thus facilitating timely therapeutic feedback to avoid under&#8208; or over&#8208;treatment. Importantly, such design allows the activatable PSs Glu&#8208;BDP1/Glu&#8208;BDP2 to be fabricated by attaching &#947;&#8208;glutamyl, a substrate of &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase, to the alkoxyaniline unit of BDP1/BDP2, and their ability in either selectively killing cancer cells over normal cells or in ablating implanted tumour without damage to healthy tissue was demonstrated.

         <title>(PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6: A Robust Tetravalent Phosphaza&#8208;adamantane Scaffold for Molecular and Macromolecular Construction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new air&#8208;stable and thermally robust tetrahedral tetravalent inorganic cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 has been achieved. This cage allows four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions on its periphery to give unprecedented molecular and macromolecular constructs. This utility is shown by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion and the first all P/N polyphazene network material.







Abstract
Tetraarylmethanes and adamantanes are important rigid covalent connectors that play a four&#8208;way scaffolding role in molecular and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis of a new tetravalent phosphaza&#8208;adamantane cage, (PNSiMe3)4(NMe)6 (2), that shows high thermal, air, and redox stability due to its geometry. It nevertheless participates in covalent four&#8208;fold functionalization reactions along its periphery. The combination of a robust core and reactive corona makes 2 a convenient inorganic scaffold upon which tetrahedral molecular and macromolecular chemistry can be constructed. This potential is demonstrated by the synthesis of a tetrakis(bis(phosphine)iminium) ion (in compound 3) and the first all P/N poly(phosphazene) network (5).

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Cyclopropane&#8208;Fused N&#8208;Heterocycles Enabled by Underexplored Diazo Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles from readily available amines was achieved. Key to the disclosed strategy was the development and implementation of reactive &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, providing access to structurally and functionally diverse products. Application of the method is showcased in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.







Abstract
Cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles are featured in various biologically active compounds and represent attractive scaffolds in medicinal chemistry. However, synthesis routes to access structurally and functionally diverse cyclopropane&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocycles remain underexplored. Leveraging novel &#945;&#8208;diazo acylating agents, we report a general approach for the direct and modular synthesis of cyclopropane&#8208;fused lactams from unsaturated amines. The operationally simple transformation, which proceeds through successive acylation, (3+2) cycloaddition and fragmentation, tolerates a broad range of functional groups and yields a wide spectrum of complex molecular scaffolds, including fused, bridged and spiro ring systems. We demonstrate the utility of this transformation in the concise syntheses of therapeutic agents milnaciprane and amitifadine.

         <title>Pentafluorophosphato&#8208;Phenylalanines: Amphiphilic Phosphotyrosine Mimetics Displaying Fluorine&#8208;Specific Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The more fluorine the better? Pentafluorophosphato amino acids A and B are stable new molecular entities showing surprisingly high binding affinities to the phosphotyrosine binding site of a protein tyrosine phosphatase&#8212;better than the current gold standard for phosphotyrosine mimetics. PF5 motifs display remarkable fluorine&#8208;specific interactions and thus might enable a new class of potent tools for medicinal chemistry and chemical biology.







Abstract
Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF5&#8208;amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono&#8208;anionic PF5 motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein&#8208;binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8722;F&#8208;bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25&#8208; to 30&#8208;fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.

&lt;p&gt;Phosphotyrosine residues are essential functional switches in health and disease. Thus, phosphotyrosine biomimetics are crucial for the development of chemical tools and drug molecules. We report here the discovery and investigation of pentafluorophosphato amino acids as novel phosphotyrosine biomimetics. A mild acidic pentafluorination protocol was developed and two PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-amino acids were prepared and employed in peptide synthesis. Their structures, reactivities, and fluorine-specific interactions were studied by NMR and IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and in bioactivity assays. The mono-anionic PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; motif displayed an amphiphilic character binding to hydrophobic surfaces, to water molecules, and to protein-binding sites, exploiting charge and H&#8722;F-bonding interactions. The novel motifs bind 25- to 30-fold stronger to the phosphotyrosine binding site of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B than the best current biomimetics, as rationalized by computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Design of a Novel Tubulin Inhibitor with a Unique Mechanism of Action</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antitubulin drugs are used very successfully in chemotherapy but their chemical structures are complex. Based on a previously performed crystallographic fragment screen, we here rationally designed the small molecule tubulin inhibitor Todalam. The compound displays a unique molecular mechanism of action by targeting a novel binding site in tubulin.







Abstract
In this study, we capitalized on our previously performed crystallographic fragment screen and developed the antitubulin small molecule Todalam with only two rounds of straightforward chemical synthesis. Todalam binds to a novel tubulin site, disrupts microtubule networks in cells, arrests cells in G2/M, induces cell death, and synergizes with vinblastine. The compound destabilizes microtubules by acting as a molecular plug that sterically inhibits the curved&#8208;to&#8208;straight conformational switch in the &#945;&#8208;tubulin subunit, and by sequestering tubulin dimers into assembly incompetent oligomers. Our results describe for the first time the generation of a fully rationally designed small molecule tubulin inhibitor from a fragment, which displays a unique molecular mechanism of action. They thus demonstrate the usefulness of tubulin&#8208;binding fragments as valuable starting points for innovative antitubulin drug and chemical probe discovery campaigns.

         <title>Divergent Asymmetric Synthesis of Panowamycins, TM&#8208;135, and Veramycin&#8197;F Using C&#8722;H Insertion with Donor/Donor Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total Synthesis Shell Game: The asymmetric first synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM&#8208;135, veramycin&#8197;F, and two unnatural isomers in a stereoselective fashion, featuring a dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reaction with donor/donor carbenes in the key step to construct the isochroman core. These syntheses reveal a structural misassignment for panowamycin&#8197;A and computational NMR studies unveil the correct configuration of the natural isomer, which was also synthesized.







Abstract
Panowamycins are a group of isochroman&#8208;based natural products first isolated from Streptomyces sp. K07&#8208;0010 in 2012 by Satoshi &#332;mura and co&#8208;workers that exhibit modest anti&#8208;trypanosomal activity. Herein we demonstrate the first syntheses of these natural products and their epimers. Stereoselective dirhodium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H insertion reactions with a donor/donor carbene construct the substituted isochroman core in the key bond&#8208;forming step. The syntheses are completed without the use of protecting groups and feature a late&#8208;stage Wacker oxidation. Incongruent NMR spectra between natural and synthetic samples revealed the structural misassignment of panowamycin&#8197;A and veramycin&#8197;F. Computational NMR studies suggested panowamycin&#8197;A to be an alternate diastereomer, which was confirmed by synthesizing this isomer. Concurrent with this work, in 2021 Mahmud and co&#8208;workers came to the same conclusion with an updated NMR analysis of panowamycin&#8197;A. In a divergent, asymmetric sequence, we report the synthesis of panowamycin&#8197;A, panowamycin&#8197;B, TM&#8208;135, and veramycin&#8197;F.

         <title>Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodeacetoxylation of Aryl Acetates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich aryl acetates derived from (renewable) phenolics were selectively reduced to the corresponding arenes using pinacolborane (HBpin) and a nickel&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic system in the green solvent dimethylcarbonate (DMC). The method is applicable to 4&#8208;propylguaiacyl acetate derived from pine wood.







Abstract
Acetate serves as a renewable and easily installed leaving group for selective deoxygenation of phenolics (ArOH). Ni&#8208;catalyzed hydrodeacetoxylation of aryl acetates (Ar&#8722;OAc) with HBpin in a green carbonate solvent selectively delivers the corresponding deoxygenated arenes (ArH). The method is also applicable to highly challenging guaiacyl and syringyl acetates, leaving &#8722;OMe groups intact without arene reduction. Renewable 4&#8208;propylguaiacol obtained from pine can also be transformed without significant loss in yield versus oil derived feedstock. The observed chemoselectivity for Ar&#8722;OAc versus ArO&#8722;Ac bond cleavage was rationalized based on mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. ArOH side&#8208;product formation is attributed to direct competitive Ni&#8208;catalyzed reduction of the C=O bond. Hydrodeacyloxylation of a set of aryl alkanoates featured interesting chemoselectivity with a dramatic influence of the length and structure of the alkyl chain on catalysis.

         <title>Concentrated Aqueous Peroxodicarbonate: Efficient Electrosyn&#8208; thesis and Use as Oxidizer in Epoxidations, S&#8208;, and N&#8208;Oxidations</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical synthesis of concentrated (&#8776;1.0&#8201;m) peroxodicarbonate solutions was achieved by a newly designed electrolysis cell with an elaborate heat&#8208;transfer system, a ternary K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 electrolyte, and the use of high current densities of above 3&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Peroxodicarbonate solutions were shown to be powerful and green oxidizers, permitting N&#8208; and S&#8208;oxidations as well as epoxidations.







Abstract
Peroxodicarbonates are of substantial interest as potentially powerful and sustainable oxidizers but have so far been accessible only in low concentrations with unsatisfactory energy efficiency. Concentrated (&gt;&#160;0.9&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1) peroxodicarbonate solutions have now been made accessible by the electrolysis of aqueous K2CO3/Na2CO3/KHCO3 solutions at high current density of 3.33&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an efficiently cooled circular flow reactor equipped with a boron&#8208;doped diamond anode and a stainless&#8208;steel cathode. Their synthetic potential as platform oxidizers was clearly demonstrated in transformations including sulfoxidation, N&#8208;oxidation, and epoxidation.

         <title>Adsorption in Reversed Order of C2 Hydrocarbons on an Ultramicroporous Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) shows a reversed adsorption order for C2 hydrocarbons. The C2 hydrocarbon uptake of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follow the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2 and not the usual C2H2&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H6.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks have been widely studied in the separation of C2 hydrocarbons, which usually preferentially bind unsaturated hydrocarbons with the order of acetylene (C2H2)&gt;ethylene (C2H4)&gt;ethane (C2H6). Herein, we report an ultramicroporous fluorinated metal&#8208;organic framework Zn&#8208;FBA (H2FBA=4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoic acid)), shows a reversed adsorption order characteristic for C2 hydrocarbons, that the uptake for C2 hydrocarbons of the framework and the binding affinity between the guest molecule and the framework follows the order C2H6&gt;C2H4&gt;C2H2. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm that the completely reversed adsorption order behavior is attributed to the close van der Waals interactions and multiple cooperative C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonds between the framework and C2H6. Moreover, Zn&#8208;FBA exhibits a high selectivity of about 2.9 for C2H6 over C2H4 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar. The experimental breakthrough studies show that the high&#8208;purity C2H4 can be obtained from C2H6 and C2H4 mixtures in one step.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Directed Regulation of Structures and Luminescence of Heterometallic Clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions were employed to direct the regulation of the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Two novel clusters with triangular bipyramidal CAu6Ag5 (2) and hexagram&#8208;like CAu6Ag6 (3) cores were obtained from the CAu6Ag4 type precursor 1. They exhibit red&#8208; or blue&#8208;shifted luminescence, respectively. Remarkably, the quantum yields of 2 and 3 are one order of magnitude higher than 1.







Abstract
Anions have been used to regulate the structures and luminescence of heterometallic clusters. Introducing ClO4&#8722; into orange&#8208;emissive, butterfly&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag4](BF4)6 (1, PPhpy2=bis(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenylphosphine) leads to the formation of red&#8208;emissive [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag5(ClO4)3](ClO4)4 (2) with a novel trigonal bipyramidal structure; employing PhCO2&#8722; gives yellow&#8208;emissive, hexagram&#8208;like [(C)(Au&#8208;PPhpy2)6Ag6(PhCO2)3](BF4)5 (3). Notably, 1 exhibits weak luminescence in CH2Cl2/CH3OH=1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (v&#8201;:&#8201;v) with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.05, whereas it was dramatically increased to 0.49 and 0.83 for 2 and 3, respectively. Theoretical calculation confirms that the involvement of anions in the electronic structures is responsible for the shifts of emission. The high QYs of 2 and 3 are attributed to the protection provided by ligands and anions. This work demonstrates that anions may serve as an extra designable factor beyond just counterions for functional metal clusters.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Adhesive and Conductive Gels with Anion&#8208;Coordinated Triple Helicate Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of functional gels with anion&#8208;coordinated architecture junctions will open up a new avenue for the design and fabrication of a broad range of smart materials. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202201793), Dong Yang and co&#8208;workers report a series of C2&#8208;symmetric anion&#8208;binding ligands equipped with ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged bis(urea) and amine or amide ends, which generated A2L3 triple helical architectures upon self&#8208;assembly with phosphate ions. Hierarchical intermolecular hydrogen bonds among the terminal amine/amide groups and urea moieties resulted in the formation of functional gels.

         <title>Formation of Breslow Intermediates from N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Aldehydes Involves Autocatalysis by the Breslow Intermediate, and a Hemiacetal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Breslow intermediates (BIs) are pivotal species in the Umpolung catalysis effected by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), ranging from vitamin B1 dependent enzymes to highly selective organocatalytic processes. For their formation from aldehydes and NHCs, a long&#8208;standing riddle has been the mechanism by which the zwitterionic primary intermediate is converted to the BI, as the C&#8208;to&#8208;O 1,2&#8208;H&#8208;shift involved is kinetically highly disfavored. The kinetic study by Albrecht Berkessel et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202117682) shows that under aprotic conditions, the BI itself effects this critical H&#8208;shift in an autocatalytic fashion.

         <title>Photoinduced &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H Amination of Cyclic Amine Scaffolds Enabled by Polar&#8208;Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H amination of cyclic amines has been developed that allows a convenient approach to the highly valuable &#945;&#8208;amino derivatives. The reaction proceeds via a relay cycle engaging a series of polar and radical processes, triggered by initial access to the key iminium intermediate using only 1&#8211;2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of oxidant as initiator. This protocol is practical and sustainable, and shows excellent applicability.







Abstract
Herein, we report a polar&#8208;radical relay strategy for &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H amination of cyclic amines with N&#8208;chloro&#8208;N&#8208;sodio&#8208;carbamates. The relay is initiated by in situ generation of cyclic iminium intermediate using N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) oxidant as an initiator, which then operates through a series of polar (addition and elimination) and radical (homolysis, hydrogen&#8208; and halogen atom transfer) reactions to enable the challenging C&#8722;N bond formation in a controlled manner. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;amino cyclic amines were readily accessed with excellent regioselectivity, and the superb applicability was further demonstrated by functionalization of biologically relevant compounds.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report a polar-radical relay strategy for &#945;-C&#8722;H amination of cyclic amines with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-chloro-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-sodio-carbamates. The relay is initiated by in situ generation of cyclic iminium intermediate using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-iodosuccinimide (NIS) oxidant as an initiator, which then operates through a series of polar (addition and elimination) and radical (homolysis, hydrogen- and halogen atom transfer) reactions to enable the challenging C&#8722;N bond formation in a controlled manner. A broad range of &#945;-amino cyclic amines were readily accessed with excellent regioselectivity, and the superb applicability was further demonstrated by functionalization of biologically relevant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Molecular trefoil knots are usually covalently assembled from rationally designed building blocks with multiple functional groups. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202200748), Jie&#8208;Sheng Huang, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers report the use of monoalkynes and a mononuclear AuI compound for the self&#8208;assembly of Au&#8722;C bonded Au15 trefoil knots featuring non&#8208;covalent AuI&#8211;AuI interactions. The structures, solution behavior, and photoluminescence properties of the Au15 and Au9M6 (M = Cu/Ag) trefoil knots were studied.

         <title>Membrane Cholesterol Depletion Enhances Enzymatic Activity of Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (NPs) are used for enzyme delivery because of their unique biointerface and loading capabilities. It is demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of the NPs is negatively correlated to the level of cholesterol within the cell membranes, providing a facile and practical approach for the design of enzyme&#8208;loaded nanotherapeutics.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework nanoparticles (MOF NPs) have been increasingly used to encapsulate therapeutic enzymes for delivery. To better interface these MOF NPs with biological systems, researchers have coated them with natural cell membranes, enabling biomimicking properties suitable for innovative biomedical applications. Herein, we report that the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs can be significantly enhanced by reducing membrane cholesterol content. We demonstrate such cholesterol&#8208;enzymatic activity correlation using zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 MOF NPs to encapsulate catalase, horseradish peroxidase, and organophosphate hydrolase, respectively. MOF NPs coated with membranes of human red blood cells or macrophages show similar outcomes, illustrating the broad applicability of this finding. The mechanistic investigation further reveals that reducing cholesterol levels effectively enhances membrane permeability likely responsible for the increased enzymatic activity. These results also imply a facile approach to tailoring the enzymatic activity of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated MOF NPs by simply tuning the membrane cholesterol level.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Assisted Hydrophobic Li+&#8208;Solvated Structure for Stabilizing Dual Electrode Electrolyte Interphases through Suppressing LiPF6 Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have been drawn much attention due to their high energy density. However, the hydrolysis of LiPF  6  in commercial carbonate electrolytes will deteriorate the electrode electrolyte solid interphases and structural collapse of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes, leading to the uncontrollable Li dendrites growth and fast capacity fading. Herein, a hydrophobic Li  +  &#8208;solvated structure is designed by inducing the hexafluoroisopropyl acrylate (HFAC) into the electrolyte system. Due to the the alkene groups and non&#8208;polar perfluorocarbon (&#8208;CF  2  CF  2  CF  3  ) chain, the HFAC could help to form a hydrophobic surface around Li ion solvation aggregates to protect the LiPF  6  against the attack from trace H  2  O, improving the stability of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and structure of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. Moreover, the HFAC could also help to form an organic SEI layer with rich polar C&#8208;F bonds, which can fast capture Li ions to restrain the dendrite growth. Therefore, the Li||Li symmetric cells show a stable cycling performance up to 500 h at a current density of 1 mA cm  &#8208;2  . When paired with LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cathode&#65292;the Li metal cells show good cycling stability, exhibiting a specific capacity of 111 mA h g  &#8208;1  at 1C with a capacity retention of 74% after 200 cycles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Determining the affinity of proteins for uranyl is key to understand the toxicity of this cation and to further develop decorporation strategies. However, usual techniques to achieve that goal often require specific equipment and expertise. Here, we propose a simple, efficient, fluorescence&#8208;based method to assess the affinity of proteins and peptides for uranyl, at equilibrium and in buffered solution. We first designed and characterized an original uranyl&#8208;binding fluorescent probe. We then built a reference scale for uranyl affinity in solution, relying on signal quenching of our fluorescent probe in presence of high&#8208;affinity uranyl&#8208;binding peptides. We finally validated our approach by re&#8208;evaluating the uranyl&#8208;binding affinity of four native proteins. We envision that this tool will facilitate the reliable and reproducible assessment of affinities of peptides and proteins for uranyl.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8211;H Activation Facilitated by a Transient Directing Group</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed C(alkenyl)&#8211;H alkenylation enabled by a transient directing group (TDG) strategy is described. The dual catalytic process takes advantage of reversible condensation between an alkenyl aldehyde substrate and an amino acid TDG to facilitate coordination of the metal catalyst and subsequent C(alkenyl)&#8211;H activation by a tailored carboxylate base. The resulting palladacycle then engages an acceptor alkene, furnishing a 1,3&#8208;diene with high regio&#8208; and  E/Z  &#8208;selectivity. The reaction enables the synthesis of enantioenriched atropoisomeric 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted 1,3&#8208;dienes, which have seldom been examined in previous literature. Catalytically relevant alkenyl palladacycles were synthesized and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the energy profiles of the C(alkenyl)&#8211;H activation step and the stereoinduction model were elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Introducing 4s&#8208;2p Orbital Hybridization to Stabilize Spinel Oxide Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxides composed of oxygen framework and interstitial cations are promising cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the instability of oxygen framework under harsh operating conditions results in fast battery capacity decay, due to the weak orbital interactions between cations and oxygen (mainly 3d&#8208;2p interaction). Here, a robust and endurable oxygen framework is created by introducing strong 4s&#8208;2p  &#160;  orbital hybridization into the structure using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 oxide as an example. The modified oxide delivers extraordinarily stable battery performance, achieving 71.4% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1 C. This work shows that an orbital&#8208;level understanding can be leveraged to engineer high structural stability of the anion oxygen framework of oxides. Moreover, the similarity of oxygen lattice between oxide electrodes makes this approach extendable to other electrodes, with orbital&#8208;focused engineering a new avenue for the fundamental modification of battery materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1,4,5,8,9,12&#8208;hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) is one of the smallest polyheterocyclic aromatic building blocks for forming conjugated metal&#8722;organic frameworks (cMOFs). However, the strong inter&#8208;molecular steric hindrance impedes the growth of HAT&#8208;based cMOFs. Here we employ on&#8208;surface synthesis to grow single&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional cMOFs of M  3  (HAT)  2  (M= Ni, Fe, Co). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) analysis, we resolve that the frameworks comprise a hexagonal lattice of HAT molecules and a Kagome lattice of metal atoms. The DFT analysis indicates that Ni, Co and Fe carry a magnetic moment of 1.1, 2.5, and 3.7 &#956;B, respectively. We anticipate that the small &#960;&#8208;conjugated core of HAT and strong bidentate chelating coordination gives rise to appealing electronic and magnetic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of Multifunctional and Non&#8208;stereoselective Oxidoreductase RubE7/IstO, Expanding the Functional Diversity of the Flavoenzyme Superfamily</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional, non&#8208;stereoselective FMN&#8208;dependent enzyme, RubE7/IstO, catalyzes both the reduction of three spatially different bonds and dehydrogenation of a tropolone ring. The crystal structure of IstO revealed that a big catalytic pocket permits free rotation of the substrate, resulting in nonselective reduction reactions. Molecular docking and site mutation studies showed that His106 is important for the reversible dehydrogenation reaction.







Abstract
Flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes enable a broad range of redox transformations and generally act as monofunctional and stereoselective catalysts. Herein, we report the investigation of a multifunctional and non&#8208;stereoselective FMN&#8208;dependent oxidoreductase RubE7 from the rubrolone biosynthetic pathway. Our study outlines a single RubE7&#8208;catalysed sequential reduction of three spatially distinct bonds in a tropolone ring and a reversible double&#8208;bond reduction and dehydrogenation. The crystal structure of IstO (a RubE7 homologue) with 2.0&#8197;&#197; resolution reveals the location of the active site at the interface of two monomers, and the size of active site is large enough to permit both flipping and free rotation of the substrate, resulting in multiple nonselective reduction reactions. Molecular docking and site mutation studies demonstrate that His106 is oriented towards the substrate and is important for the reverse dehydrogenation reaction.

The first example of catalytic enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides with thioketones is presented, catalyzed by chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/Co&#921;&#921; complexes. This method provides a rapid and facile access to a series of optically active tetrasubstituted thiiranes with good outcomes (up to 99&#8201;% yield, 97&#8201;% ee). The origin of stereoselectivity was well elucidated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report the first example of enantioselective (2+1) cycloaddition of thioketones with &#945;&#8208;diazo pyrazoleamides for the direct synthesis of tetrasubstituted thiiranes. In the presence of chiral N,N&#8242;&#8208;dioxide/cobalt(&#921;&#921;) complexes (2&#8211;5&#8197;mol%), excellent efficiency (up to 99&#8201;% yield within 15&#8197;mins) and high stereoselectivity (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and 97&#8201;% ee) are available. Elaborations of thiiranes via desulfuration have also been conducted to deliver tetrasubstituted olefins. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reaction initiates from a doublet state cobalt(&#921;&#921;) carbenoid, which is followed by a quartet cobalt(&#921;&#921;)&#8208;bound thiocarbonyl ylide pathway. This work provides a route for the selective construction of tetrasubstituted thiiranes and olefins that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Fluorination and Betaine Modification Augment the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier&#8208;Crossing Ability of Cylindrical Polymer Brushes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>

It is found that fluorination augments the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) penetration of cylindrical polymer brushes by altering the surface state, and betaine modification achieves this function via a betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries.







Abstract
Blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB)&#8208;crossing ability of drugs is of paramount importance for the treatments of central nervous system diseases. However, the known methods for drug transport across the BBB are generally complicated and inefficient, and exhibit serious side effects in some cases. Herein, we report an exciting finding that fluorination and betaine modification can significantly augment the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of cylindrical polymer brushes (CPBs), which was demonstrated by the comparison with the CPBs modified with alkyl and poly(ethylene glycol) chains, respectively. We surmise that fluorination enhances the BBB penetration of the CPBs by increasing the hydrophobicity and reducing the surface energy, and betaine medication achieves this function via a betaine transporter BGT1 expressed on brain capillaries. By means of an in vitro BBB model, we demonstrated that the CPBs penetrated the BBB through transendothelial transport. This work provides a novel strategy for enhancing the BBB&#8208;crossing ability of nanomaterials.

         <title>Structurally Disordered RuO2 Nanosheets with Rich Oxygen Vacancies for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural disorder enhanced catalytic performance is demonstrated for carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets. The improved activity is ascribed to the disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus resulting in a low endothermic potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) and a high efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate pollutants to ammonia has emerged as an attractive alternative for ammonia synthesis. Currently, many strategies have been developed for enhancing nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) efficiency, but the influence of the degree of structural disorder is still unexplored. Here, carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets with adjustable crystallinity are synthesized by a facile molten salt method. The as&#8208;synthesized amorphous RuO2 displays high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (97.46&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.42&#8201;%), greatly outperforming the crystalline counterparts. The disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies is revealed to modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus lowering the energy of the potential&#8208;determining step (NH2*&#8594;NH3*).

         <title>Reversibly Photoswitching Upconversion Nanoparticles for Super&#8208;Sensitive Photoacoustic Molecular Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An upconverting nanoparticle probe can be switched on and off by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light for multiple cycles of photoacoustic imaging (PA). Through reversible modulation of the probe PA activation state, a background&#8208;free PA signal can be recovered in imaging 0.05&#8197;nM of the probe in hemoglobin (Hb) solution and 104 labeled cancer cells subcutaneously implanted in mice.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) imaging uses light excitation to generate the acoustic signal for detection and improves tissue penetration depth and spatial resolution in the clinically relevant depth of living subjects. However, strong background signals from blood and pigments have significantly compromised the sensitivity of PA imaging with exogenous contrast agents. Here we report a nanoparticle&#8208;based probe design that uses light to reversibly modulate the PA emission to enable photoacoustic photoswitching imaging (PAPSI) in living mice. Such a nanoprobe is built with upconverting nanocrystals and photoswitchable small molecules and can be switched on by NIR light through upconversion to UV energy. Reversibly photoswitching of the nanoprobe reliably removed strong tissue background, increased the contrast&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and thus improved imaging sensitivity. We have shown that PAPSI can image 0.05&#8197;nM of the nanoprobe in hemoglobin solutions and 104 labeled cancer cells after implantation in living mice using a commercial PA imager.

         <title>A Crystalline Partially Fluorinated Triazine Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline, partially fluorinated triazine covalent organic framework (COF) was constructed with broad visible&#8208;light responsiveness, improved charge separation and transfer, and enhanced O2 affinity. The COF exhibited attractive photocatalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for H2O2 production under visible&#8208;light irradiation, and with higher activity than previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.







Abstract
A partially fluorinated, metal&#8208;free, imine&#8208;linked two&#8208;dimensional triazine covalent organic framework (TF50&#8208;COF) photocatalyst was developed. Fluorine (F)&#8208;substituted and nonsubstituted units were integrated in equimolar amounts on the edge aromatic units, where they mediated two&#8208;electron O2 photoreduction. F&#8208;substitution created an abundance of Lewis acid sites, which regulated the electronic distribution of adjacent carbon atoms and provided highly active sites for O2 adsorption, and widened the visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive range of the catalyst, while enhancing charge separation. Varying the proportion of F maximized the interlayer interactions of TF50&#8208;COF, resulting in improved crystallinity with faster carrier transfer and robust photostability. The TF50&#8208;COF catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and stability in O2 photoreduction into H2O2, with a high H2O2 yield rate of 1739&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 5.1&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm, exceeding the performance of previously reported nonmetal COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Environmentally Benign Biosynthesis of Hierarchical MOF/Bacterial Cellulose Composite Sponge for Nerve Agent Protection</title>

Biosynthesized MOF&#8208;based sponge composite materials feature hierarchical pores and tunable MOF loading. They can be used for efficient nerve agent simulant catalytic hydrolysis and toxic nerve agent capture.







Abstract
The fabrication of MOF polymer composite materials enables the practical applications of MOF&#8208;based technology, in particular for protective suits and masks. However, traditional production methods typically require organic solvent for processing which leads to environmental pollution, low&#8208;loading efficiency, poor accessibility, and loss of functionality due to poor solvent resistance properties. For the first time, we have developed a microbial synthesis strategy to prepare a MOF/bacterial cellulose nanofiber composite sponge. The prepared sponge exhibited a hierarchically porous structure, high MOF loading (up to &#8776;90&#8201;%), good solvent resistance, and high catalytic activity for the liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state hydrolysis of nerve agent simulants. Moreover, the MOF/ bacterial cellulose composite sponge reported here showed a nearly 8&#8208;fold enhancement in the protection against an ultra&#8208;toxic nerve agent (GD) in permeability studies as compared to a commercialized adsorptive carbon cloth. The results shown here present an essential step toward the practical application of MOF&#8208;based protective gear against nerve agents.

         <title>NIRII&#8208;HDs: A Versatile Platform for Developing Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorogenic Probes for Reliable In Vivo Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;HD&#8208;like dyes (NIRII&#8208;HDs) with bright and stable NIR&#8208;II emission together with proper pKa is reported. By decorating the tunable hydroxyl group, the novel NIR&#8208;II dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 can serve as an effective platform to design various activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for reliable in vivo bioimaging with high contrast.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) activatable fluorescent probes can potentially provide a high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep tissue penetration. However, most of the reported NIR&#8208;II activatable small&#8208;molecule probes exhibit poor versatility owing to the lack of a general and stable optically tunable group. In this study, we designed NIRII&#8208;HDs, a novel dye scaffold optimized for NIR&#8208;II probe development. In particular, dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 showed the best optical properties such as proper pKa value, excellent stability, and high NIR&#8208;II brightness, which can be beneficial for in vivo imaging with high contrast. To demonstrate the applicability of the NIRII&#8208;HD5 dye, we designed three target&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for ROS, thiols, and enzymes. Using these novel probes, we not only realized reliable NIR&#8208;II imaging of different diseases in mouse models but also evaluated the redox potential of liver tissue during a liver injury in vivo with high fidelity.

         <title>Selective Electrooxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Alcohols to Aldehydes in a Neutral Medium: Promoted Water Dissociation over a Nickel&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to produce 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) was achieved in neutral medium over single&#8208;atom Ru supported on NiO (Ru1&#8208;NiO). Single&#8208;atom Ru sites boost HMF oxidation by facilitating water dissociation, which generates electrophilic OH* as a key reactant. The substrate scope was extended to produce aldehydes from various biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Key: Ni (light gray), Ru (green), O (red), C (dark gray), H (white).







Abstract
The biomass&#8208;derived alcohol oxidation reaction (BDAOR) holds great promise for sustainable production of chemicals. However, selective electrooxidation of alcohols to value&#8208;added aldehyde compounds is still challenging. Herein, we report the electrocatalytic BDAORs to selectively produce aldehydes using single&#8208;atom ruthenium on nickel oxide (Ru1&#8208;NiO) as a catalyst in the neutral medium. For electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), Ru1&#8208;NiO exhibits a low potential of 1.283&#8197;V at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and an optimal 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF) selectivity of 90&#8201;%. Experimental studies reveal that the neutral electrolyte plays a critical role in achieving a high aldehyde selectivity, and the single&#8208;atom Ru boosts HMF oxidation in the neutral medium by promoting water dissociation to afford OH*. Furthermore, Ru1&#8208;NiO can be extended to selective electrooxidation of a series of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols to corresponding aldehydes, which are conventionally difficult to obtain in the alkaline medium.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide Production via Ammonia Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ceria&#8208;supported gold nanoparticles (2&#8211;3&#8197;nm) are highly active and selective for N2O production via NH3 oxidation, exhibiting superior stability and two orders of magnitude higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art system. The interplay between interfacial Au&#948;+ species and active oxygen species supplied by ceria is key to the unprecedented performance.







Abstract
The production of nitrous oxide, N2O, via NH3 oxidation is not on a practical scale due to the lack of a suitable catalyst. Instead, it is produced via thermal decomposition of NH4NO3, rendering N2O too costly and limiting its prospective uses. Herein, we report CeO2&#8208;supported Au nanoparticles (2&#8211;3&#8197;nm) as a highly selective catalyst for low&#8208;temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher space&#8211;time yield than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Mn&#8722;Bi/&#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and remarkable stability over 70&#8197;h on stream. The reaction proceeds via a Mars&#8211;van Krevelen mechanism, with the density of interfacial Au&#948;+ species and the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 identified as the key performance descriptors. The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3 oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization in selective oxidations.

         <title>Reconfiguration and Reorganization of Bottlebrush Polymer Surfactants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key stages of bottlebrush random copolymer (BRCP) assembly at fluid interfaces are shown in the picture: Diffusion of BRCP from oil solution to the interface, reconfiguration to a hydrophilic&#8208; and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformation and interfacial adsorption (lhs), and reorganization of the BRCPs assembled at the liquid interface by in&#8208;plane diffusion (rhs).







Abstract
Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), having randomly distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, are shown to reconfigure into hydrophilic&#8208;rich and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformations at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to reduce interfacial energy.

&lt;p&gt;Key stages of bottlebrush random copolymer (BRCP) assembly at fluid interfaces are shown in the picture: Diffusion of BRCP from oil solution to the interface, reconfiguration to a hydrophilic- and hydrophobic-rich conformation and interfacial adsorption (lhs), and reorganization of the BRCPs assembled at the liquid interface by &lt;i&gt;in-plane&lt;/i&gt; diffusion (rhs).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), having randomly distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, are shown to reconfigure into hydrophilic-rich and hydrophobic-rich conformations at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to reduce interfacial energy.

         <title>Theoretical Optimization of Compositions of High&#8208;Entropy Oxides for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy oxides are investigated theoretically as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction. The energetics of the reaction is calculated on individual active sites following two different pathways, and it is shown that the overpotential and preferred pathway depend on the local atomic environment. A surface model is constructed in order to identify the composition that maximises the catalytic activity.







Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides are oxides consisting of five or more metals incorporated in a single lattice, and the large composition space suggests that properties of interest can be readily optimised. For applications within catalysis, the different local atomic environments result in a distribution of binding energies for the catalytic intermediates. Using the oxygen evolution reaction on the rutile (110) surface as example, here we outline a strategy for the theoretical optimization of the composition. Density functional theory calculations performed for a limited number of sites are used to fit a model that predicts the reaction energies for all possible local atomic environments. Two reaction pathways are considered; the conventional pathway on the coordinatively unsaturated sites and an alternative pathway involving transfer of protons to a bridging oxygen. An explicit model of the surface is constructed to describe the interdependency of the two pathways and identify the composition that maximizes catalytic activity.

         <title>Integrated Ring&#8208;Chain Design of a New Fluorinated Ether Solvent for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated fluorinated ring&#8208;chain molecular approach was developed through structural modification of a low&#8208;cost, commercial ether for a new solvent 2&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;dioxolane (cFTOF), which served as a single ether solvent for lithium&#8208;metal batteries combining high&#8208;voltage stability up to 6&#8197;V, and regulated Li+ solvation structure, increasing Li+ ion&#8208;pairing with FSI anions in a low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration electrolyte system.







Abstract
Ether&#8208;based electrolytes offer promising features such as high lithium&#8208;ion solvation power and stable interface, yet their limited oxidation stability impedes application in high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Whereas the fluorination of the ether backbone improves the oxidative stability, the resulting solvents lose their Li+&#8208;solvation ability. Therefore, the rational molecular design of solvents is essential to combine high redox stability with good ionic conductivity. Here, we report the synthesis of a new high&#8208;voltage fluorinated ether solvent through integrated ring&#8208;chain molecular design, which can be used as a single solvent while retaining high&#8208;voltage stability. The controlled Li+&#8208;solvation environment even at low&#8208;salt&#8208;concentration (1&#8197;M or 2&#8197;M) enables a uniform and compact Li anode and an outstanding cycling stability in the Li|NCM811 full cell (20&#8197;&#956;m Li foil, N/P ratio of 4). These results show the impact of molecular design of electrolytes towards the utilization of LMBs.

         <title>Construction of an Autocatalytic Hybridization Assembly Circuit for Amplified In Vivo MicroRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;reproducing dandelion&#8208;like autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit was proposed for in vivo amplified bioimaging research where the initiator promoted the autonomous cross&#8208;activation of the cascade hybridization reaction (CHR) and catalytic DNA assembly (CDA) components.







Abstract
Lowly expressed analyte in complex cytoplasmic milieu necessitates the development of non&#8208;enzymatic autocatalytic DNA circuits with high amplification and anti&#8208;interference performance. Herein, we engineered a versatile and robust stimuli&#8208;responsive autocatalytic hybridization assembly (AHA) circuit for high&#8208;performance in vivo bioanalysis. Under a moderately confined condition, the initiator motivated the autonomous and cooperative cross&#8208;activation of cascade hybridization reaction and catalytic DNA assembly for generating an exponentially amplified readout without the parasite steric hindrance and random diffusion side effects. The AHA circuit was systematically investigated by a series of experimental studies and theoretical simulations. The successively guaranteed target recognition and synergistically accelerated signal&#8208;amplification enabled the sensitive and selective detection of analyte, and realized the robust miRNA imaging in living cells and mice. This autocatalytic DNA circuit could substantially expand the toolbox for accurate diagnosis and programmable therapeutics.

         <title>Characterization of a Nitrogenase Iron Protein Substituted with a Synthetic [Fe4Se4] Cluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic [Fe4Se4] compound is incorporated into the nitrogenase iron protein, showing redox properties distinct from its [Fe4S4] counterpart that can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.







Abstract
The Fe protein of nitrogenase plays multiple roles in substrate reduction and cluster maturation via its redox&#8208;active [Fe4S4] cluster. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a water&#8208;soluble [Fe4Se4] cluster that is used to substitute the [Fe4S4] cluster of the Azotobacter vinelandii Fe protein (AvNifH). Biochemical, EPR and XAS/EXAFS analyses demonstrate the ability of the [Fe4Se4] cluster to adopt the super&#8208;reduced, all&#8208;ferrous state upon its incorporation into AvNifH. Moreover, these studies reveal that the [Fe4Se4] cluster in AvNifH already assumes a partial all&#8208;ferrous state ([Fe4Se4]0) in the presence of dithionite, where its [Fe4S4] counterpart in AvNifH exists solely in the reduced state ([Fe4S4]1+). Such a discrepancy in the redox properties of the AvNifH&#8208;associated [Fe4Se4] and [Fe4S4] clusters can be used to distinguish the differential redox requirements for the substrate reduction and cluster maturation of nitrogenase, pointing to the utility of chalcogen&#8208;substituted FeS clusters in future mechanistic studies of nitrogenase catalysis and assembly.

         <title>Insights into Dynamic Surface Bromide Sites in Bi4O5Br2 for Sustainable N2 Photofixation</title>

Photocatalytic N2 reduction on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 nanosheets reveals a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of the catalyst surface. Creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle.







Abstract
Simulating photosynthesis has long been one of the ideas for realizing the conversion of solar energy into industrial chemicals. Heterogeneous N2 photofixation in water is a promising way for sustainable production of ammonia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the complex aqueous photocatalytic N2 reduction is still lacking. In this study, a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of catalyst surface for N2 reduction are revealed on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 (BOB) nanosheets, in which the creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle. Our rapid scan in situ FT&#8208;IR spectra verify that photocatalytic N2 reduction proceeds through an associative alternating mechanism on BOB surface with bromine vacancies (BrV&#8208;BOB). This work provides a new strategy to combine light&#8208;dependent facilitated reaction with light&#8208;independent regeneration of catalyst for advancing sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Serviced&#8208;Track 3D DNA Walker for Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Exosomes by Glycoprotein Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>

Exploiting target exosomes (Exos) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track: A self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of tumor Exos is constructed using split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous walking powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly. This STDW allows the direct detection of tumor Exos in serum and clinical samples.







Abstract
Sensitive and accurate analysis of low&#8208;concentration of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (Exos) in biofluids is essential for noninvasive cancer diagnosis but is still challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;sensitive methods with low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;operation. Herein, exploiting target Exos as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track for the first time, we developed a self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free detection of tumor Exos using exosomal glycoprotein, which was enabled by split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous running powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). Benefiting from high selectivity and sensitivity of the STDW assay, direct detection of tumor Exos in cell culture medium and serum could also be realized. Furthermore, this method exhibited high accuracy in clinical sample analysis, offering the potential for early cancer diagnosis and postoperative response prediction.

A 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthr&#8208;acene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) with both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions is developed for solar steam generation (SSG) and delivers an excellent water evaporation up to 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation.







Abstract
The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) (TPAD&#8208;COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD&#8208;COF serving as a highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under 1 sun irradiation. Further extension of the light absorption range of the TPAD&#8208;based COF is realized through post&#8208;synthetic modification by chelating BF2 moieties. Systematic control experiments and analysis confirm that the hydrophilicity of photothermal conversion materials plays a more dominant role in the current TPAD&#8208;based COFs for SSG.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Atropisomeric Acridinium Salts by the Catalyst&#8208;Controlled Cyclization of ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide Iminiums</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of catalyst stereocontrol in Friedel&#8211;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclizations through ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums was demonstrated. Upon stereoconvergent activation using chiral Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts (HB*), enantioselectivity was governed by means of ion&#8208;pairing catalysis. Combined with a stereospecific oxidation, atropisomeric acridinium salts were accessible with up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 e.r. and 96&#8201;% yield.







Abstract
Quinone methides are fundamental intermediates for a wide range of reactions in which catalyst stereocontrol is often achieved by hydrogen bonding. Herein, we describe the feasibility of an intramolecular Friedel&#8211;Crafts 6&#960; electrocyclization through ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums stereocontrolled by a contact ion pair. A disulfonimide catalyst activates racemic trichloroacetimidate substrates and imparts stereocontrol in the cyclization step, providing a new avenue for selective ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminium functionalization. A highly stereospecific oxidation readily transforms the enantioenriched acridanes into rotationally restricted acridiniums. Upon ion exchange, the method selectively affords atropisomeric acridinium tetrafluoroborate salts in high yields and an enantioenrichment of up to 93&#8201;:&#8201;7 e.r. We envision that ion&#8208;pairing catalysis over ortho&#8208;quinone methide iminiums enables the selective synthesis of a diversity of heterocycles and aniline derivatives with distinct stereogenic units.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks for Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (COF&#8208;TfpBpy) showed excellent activity for H2O2 photosynthesis with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.57&#8201;% at 298&#8197;K and 1.08&#8201;% at 333&#8197;K. The photocatalytic process involves a 2&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation and 2&#8201;e&#8722; oxygen reduction from water and air. The photocatalytic H2O2 solution can be directly used for Rhodamine B degradation and sterilization of E.&#8197;coli.







Abstract
Synthesizing H2O2 from water and air via a photocatalytic approach is ideal for efficient production of this chemical at small&#8208;scale. However, the poor activity and selectivity of the 2&#8201;e&#8722; water oxidation reaction (WOR) greatly restricts the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production. Herein we prepare a bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (denoted as COF&#8208;TfpBpy) for H2O2 production from water and air. The solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency at 298&#8197;K and 333&#8197;K is 0.57&#8201;% and 1.08&#8201;%, respectively, which are higher than the current reported highest value. The resulting H2O2 solution is capable of degrading pollutants. A mechanistic study revealed that the excellent photocatalytic activity of COF&#8208;TfpBpy is due to the protonation of bipyridine monomer, which promotes the rate&#8208;determining reaction (2&#8201;e&#8722; WOR) and then enhances Yeager&#8208;type oxygen adsorption to accelerate 2&#8201;e&#8722; one&#8208;step oxygen reduction. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the COF&#8208;catalyzed photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and air; and paves the way for wastewater treatment using photocatalytic H2O2 solution.

&lt;p&gt;A bipyridine-based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (COF-TfpBpy) showed excellent activity for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photosynthesis with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.57&#8201;% at 298&#8197;K and 1.08&#8201;% at 333&#8197;K. The photocatalytic process involves a 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; water oxidation and 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction from water and air. The photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution can be directly used for Rhodamine B degradation and sterilization of &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesizing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water and air via a photocatalytic approach is ideal for efficient production of this chemical at small-scale. However, the poor activity and selectivity of the 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; water oxidation reaction (WOR) greatly restricts the efficiency of photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Herein we prepare a bipyridine-based covalent organic framework photocatalyst (denoted as COF-TfpBpy) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production from water and air. The solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency at 298&#8197;K and 333&#8197;K is 0.57&#8201;% and 1.08&#8201;%, respectively, which are higher than the current reported highest value. The resulting H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution is capable of degrading pollutants. A mechanistic study revealed that the excellent photocatalytic activity of COF-TfpBpy is due to the protonation of bipyridine monomer, which promotes the rate-determining reaction (2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR) and then enhances Yeager-type oxygen adsorption to accelerate 2&#8201;e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; one-step oxygen reduction. This work demonstrates, for the first time, the COF-catalyzed photosynthesis of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from water and air; and paves the way for wastewater treatment using photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The first Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric &#947;&#8208;allylic alkylation of free dienolates, generated in situ by Sc&#8208;mediated Meinwald rearrangement of vinyloxiranes has been established. This protocol affords synthetically versatile &#947;&#8208;allylic crotonaldehydes in high efficiency with excellent regio&#8208; and enantioselectivities.







Abstract
An unprecedented asymmetric &#947;&#8208;allylic alkylation of free dienolates via Sc/Ir dual catalysis is reported, which affords a range of synthetically versatile &#947;&#8208;allylic crotonaldehydes in high efficiency with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and enantioselectivities. The dienolates bearing no essential auxiliary groups were generated in situ by scandium triflate&#8208;mediated Meinwald rearrangement of vinyloxiranes atom&#8208;economically. With the assistance of computational density functional theory calculations, a Sc/Ir bimetallic catalytic cycle was proposed to illustrate the reaction mechanism.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Phase Approach to Fusicoccane Synthesis To Uncover a Compound That Reduces Tumourigenesis in Pancreatic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;phase route for the synthesis of fusicoccane diterpenes enabled the total synthesis of alterbrassicicene D (1) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (2) and the structural determination of 2. The route yielded 15&#8197;g of 3 in eight steps from (R)&#8208;limonene and 720&#8197;mg of the penultimate intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. This penultimate intermediate was found to have tumourigenesis&#8208;abolishing potential.







Abstract
Alterbrassicicene D (1) and 3(11)&#8208;epoxyhypoestenone (2) were synthesised via a two&#8208;phase approach featuring concise construction of the 5&#8208;8&#8208;5 tricyclic intermediate and a tandem base&#8208;mediated epoxide opening&#8211;transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition cascade to forge the complex skeleton of 2. The route is scalable and we generated 15&#8197;g of the tricyclic intermediate in 8 steps from (R)&#8208;limonene and 720&#8197;mg of the penultimate bioactive intermediate in a protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free manner. Our synthesis enabled the structural determination of 2 and provided materials for preliminary anticancer evaluation. The penultimate intermediate showed therapeutic potential in terms of its ability to dramatically reduce the tumourigenic potential of PANC&#8208;1 pancreatic cancer cells according to a limiting dilution tumour&#8208;initiating assay. Our synthetic approach will facilitate unified access to naturally occurring fusicoccanes and their derivatives for anticancer evaluation.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Protein Modification with Reducing Carbohydrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with diverse reducing carbohydrates was developed. This method enabled the efficient and selective installation of GlcNAc moieties with a stable native&#8208;like linkage and subsequent enzymatic construction of defined oligosaccharides on proteins.







Abstract
Protein glycosylation plays critical roles in many biological processes. However, the fundamental study and application of glycobiology are hindered by the heterogeneousness of oligosaccharides in natural glycoproteins and the difficulty in constructing glycoproteins of human design. Herein, we describe a semisynthetic method to site&#8208;specifically modify proteins with reducing carbohydrates. The method involves the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified aspartate, which was subsequently quantitatively converted into alanine&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydrazide (A&#946;z), and chemoselective conjugation of A&#946;z with a range of readily available reducing carbohydrates. The resulting A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc is a close mimic of native N&#8208;GlcNAc and could be installed on various proteins, including IL&#8208;17A and RNase A. Notably, A&#946;z&#8208;linked GlcNAc on proteins reacted with biantennary oligosaccharide oxazoline derivatives through endoglycosidase&#8208;catalyzed transglycosylation reactions to enable the assembly of homogeneous glycans on proteins.

         <title>DREAMTIME NMR Spectroscopy: Targeted Multi&#8208;Compound Selection with Improved Detection Limits</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DREAMTIME NMR overcomes spectral overlap and increases sensitivity, opening a new world for targeted NMR detection. A user can define any unique suite of compounds and isolate them without complex sample preparation. DREAMTIME can be directly joined to any existing NMR experiment (1D, nD or MRI) and holds promise for all areas of science from chemical engineering, through environmental monitoring, to medical diagnosis.







Abstract
NMR/MRI are critical tools for studying molecular structure and interactions but suffer from relatively low sensitivity and spectral overlap. Here, a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) approach, termed DREAMTIME, is introduced that provides &#8220;a molecular window&#8221; inside complex systems, capable of showing only what the user desires, with complete molecular specificity. The user chooses a list of molecules of interest, and the approach detects only those targets while all other molecules are invisible. The approach is demonstrated in whole human blood and urine, small living aquatic organisms in 1D/2D NMR, and MRI. Finally, as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, once overlap is removed via DREAMTIME, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;focusing&#8221; approach can be used to increase sensitivity. In human blood and urine, sensitivity increases of 7&#8211;12 fold over standard 1H NMR are observed. Applicable even to unknowns, DREAMTIME has widespread application, from monitoring product formation in organic chemistry to monitoring/identifying suites of molecular targets in complex media or in vivo.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer and Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light Emission</title>

A novel donor&#8208;pillar[5]arene&#8208;acceptor structure with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property shows a twisted conformation and intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). Balancing of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission via viscosity and polar guest generates the single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission.







Abstract
The fabrication of single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission (SMWLE) materials has become a highly studied topic in recent years and through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is emerging as an important concept in this field. However, the preparation of ideal TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional pillar[5]arene (TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA) with a linear donor&#8208;spacer&#8208;acceptor structure and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. The bulky pillar[5]arene between the donor and acceptor induces a twisted conformation and a non&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in intramolecular TSCT. In addition, the AIE feature and pillar[5]arene cavity endow TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA with responsiveness to viscosity and polar guests, by which the TSCT emission is triggered. The combination of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission of TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA generates SMWLE. Therefore, we provide a new and versatile strategy for the construction of TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials.

         <title>Multiple Emission of Phosphonium Fluorophores Harnessed by the Pathways of Photoinduced Counterion Migration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of a series of multipolar donor&#8211;acceptor phosphonium fluorophores (D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;)nA+[X&#8722;] have been investigated. These dyes exhibit steady&#8208;state panchromatic luminescence attributed to the photoinduced counterion migration. The intra&#8208;ion&#8208;pair dynamics and the fluorescence response can be rationally tuned on the molecular level that might broaden the scope of functionalities and stimulate the development of new ionic systems.







Abstract
In the emerging field of intramolecular charge transfer induced counterion migration, we report the new insights into photophysical features of luminescent donor&#8211;acceptor phosphonium dyes (D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;)nA+[X&#8722;] (&#960;=&#8722;(C6H4)x&#8722;). The unique connectivity of the phosphorus atom affords multipolar molecules with a variable number of arms and the electronic properties of the acceptor group. In the ion&#8208;paired form, the transition from dipolar to quadrupolar configuration enhances the low energy migration&#8208;induced band by providing the additional pathways for anion motion. The multipolar architecture, adjustable lengths of the &#960;&#8208;spacers and the nature of counterions allow for efficient tuning of the emission and achieving nearly pure white light with quantum yields around 30&#8201;%. The methyl substituent at the phosphorus atom reduces the rate of ion migration and suppresses the red shifted bands, simultaneously improving total emission intensity. The results unveil the harnessing of the multiple emission of phosphonium fluorophores by anion migration via structure and branching of donor&#8211;acceptor arms.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Cages with {SiW9Ni4} Polyoxotungstate Nodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discrete metal&#8211;organic cages with polyoxotungstate nodes were assembled from a tritopic Keggin cluster, {SiW9Ni4}, and rigid dicarboxylates. Varying the bend angles of the linkers from 122&#176; to 180&#176; allows a set of POM2nL3n&#8208;type cages to be realized. The fact they can serve as highly effective photocatalysts for CO2 reduction opens up future opportunities for novel functions and applications by taking advantage of the confinement effect of their void spaces.







Abstract
A tritopic, Ni&#8208;substituted Keggin cluster, {SiW9Ni4}, assembles with rigid dicarboxylate linkers to give rise to a set of discrete, POM2nL3n&#8208;type structures (POM={SiW9Ni4}) with defined interior voids. The outcome of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assemblies of these polyhedral cages&#8212;from fused dimers to trigonal prisms&#8212;was found to be sensitive to bend angles of the ditopic ligands, which vary from 122&#176; to 180&#176;. These polyoxotungstate&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic polyhedra, when coupled with [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 as a photosensitizer and triethanolamine as the electron donor, serve as highly effective catalysts for CO2 reduction, with turnover numbers up to 328 and CO selectivity as high as 96.2&#8201;%. The inner cavities of such cage structures, if functionalized or of sufficient size to encapsulate targeted guest molecules, could present a new strategy towards functional materials for potential applications.

         <title>Predicting the Solubility of Inorganic Ion Pairs in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using alkali&#8208;polyoxometalate salts, a previously&#8208;undescribed solubility trend in polyoxometalate chemistry was discovered, termed anomalous solubility. Mapping charge&#8208;density on inorganic polyatomic anions along with an artificial neural network accurately describes and predicts solubility trends of alkali&#8208;anion pairs. Solubility experiments to validate computation lead to new POMs discovery.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs), ranging in size from 1 to 10&#8217;s of nanometers, resemble building blocks of inorganic materials. Elucidating their complex solubility behavior with alkali&#8208;counterions can inform natural and synthetic aqueous processes. In the study of POMs ([Nb24O72H9]15&#8722;, Nb24) we discovered an unusual solubility trend (termed anomalous solubility) of alkali&#8208;POMs, in which Nb24 is most soluble with the smallest (Li+) and largest (Rb/Cs+) alkalis, and least soluble with Na/K+. Via computation, we define a descriptor (&#963;&#8208;profile) and use an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict all three described alkali&#8208;anion solubility trends: amphoteric, normal (Li+&gt;Na+&gt;K+&gt;Rb+&gt;Cs+), and anomalous (Cs+&gt;Rb+&gt;K+&gt;Na+&gt;Li+). Testing predicted amphoteric solubility affirmed the accuracy of the descriptor, provided solution&#8208;phase snapshots of alkali&#8211;POM interactions, yielded a new POM formulated [Ti6Nb14O54]14&#8722;, and provides guidelines to exploit alkali&#8211;POM interactions for new POMs discovery.

         <title>Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular machine is presented that uses the light&#8208;powered unidirectional rotation trajectory of a molecular motor to actively thread a tetraethylene glycol chain through a macrocyclic ring. This molecular setup thus realizes the miniaturization of macroscopic threading providing a fundamental entry step into mechanical molecular weaving or sewing processes.







Abstract
Molecular motors transform external energy input into directional motions and offer exquisite precision for nano&#8208;scale manipulations. To make full use of molecular motor capacities, their directional motions need to be transmitted and used for powering downstream molecular events. Here we present a macrocyclic molecular motor structure able to perform repetitive molecular threading of a flexible tetraethylene glycol chain through the macrocycle. This mechanical threading event is actively powered by the motor and leads to a direct translation of the unidirectional motor rotation into unidirectional translation motion (chain versus ring). The mechanism of the active mechanical threading is elucidated and the actual threading step is identified as a combined helix inversion and threading event. The established molecular machine function resembles the crucial step of macroscopic weaving or sewing processes and therefore offers a first entry point to a &#8220;molecular knitting&#8221; counterpart.

         <title>Design of Near&#8208;Infrared Nonfullerene Acceptor with Ultralow Nonradiative Voltage Loss for High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Ternary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with an over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 is designed and synthesized. The PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based binary cell exhibits the lowest nonradiative voltage loss of 0.15&#8197;eV ever achieved by organic solar cells (OSCs). Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8208;based semitransparent (ST)&#8208;OSCs, for the first time, achieve a power conversion efficiency of 14&#8201;% with an average visible transmittance over 20&#8201;%.







Abstract
Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) are considered as one of the most valuable applications of OSCs and a strong contender in the market. However, the optical band gap of current high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs is still not low enough to achieve the optimal balance between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). An N&#8208;substituted asymmetric nonfullerene acceptor SN with over 40&#8197;nm bathochromically shifted absorption compared to Y6 was designed and synthesized, based on which the device with PM6 as donor obtained a PCE of 14.3&#8201;%, accompanied with a nonradiative voltage loss as low as 0.15&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, ternary devices with the addition of SN into PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 can achieve a PCE of 17.5&#8201;% with an unchanged open&#8208;circuit voltage and improved short&#8208;circuit current. Benefiting from extended NIR absorption and lowered voltage loss, ST&#8208;OSCs based on PM6&#8201;:&#8201;SN&#8201;:&#8201;Y6 were fabricated and the optimized device demonstrated a PCE of 14.0&#8201;% at an AVT of 20.2&#8201;%, which is the highest PCE at an AVT over 20&#8201;%.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Library with Precise pH Tunability by Co&#8208;Polymerization with Non&#8208;Ionizable Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy for the development of an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive nanoparticle library with precisely tuned pH transitions (pHt=4.0&#8211;7.4) was proposed through co&#8208;polymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The nanoprobe library exhibits excellent barcode imaging of endosome maturation and precise cancer imaging.







Abstract
Precise monitoring of the subtle pH fluctuation during biological events remains a big challenge. Previously, we reported an ultra&#8208;pH&#8208;sensitive (UPS) nanoprobe library with a sharp pH response using co&#8208;polymerization of two tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers with distinct pKa. Currently, we have generalized the UPS nanoparticle library with tunable pH transitions (pHt) by copolymerization of a tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomer with a series of non&#8208;ionizable monomers. The pHt of nanoparticles is fine&#8208;tuned by the non&#8208;ionizable monomers with different hydrophobicity. Each non&#8208;ionizable monomer presents a constant contribution to pH tunability regardless of tertiary amine&#8208;containing monomers. Based on this strategy, we produced two libraries of nanoprobes with continuous pHt covering the entire physiological pH range (5.0&#8211;7.4) for fluorescent imaging of endosome maturation and cancers. This generalized strategy provides a powerful toolkit for biological studies and cancer theranostics.

         <title>Tailoring a Nanochaperone to Regulate &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanochaperone for &#945;&#8208;synuclein was designed and fabricated to prevent the misassembly of &#945;&#8208;synuclein. The nanochaperone, termed &#945;S&#8208;nChap, dynamically and transiently captures monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its oligomerization. Moreover, &#945;S&#8208;nChap tightly captures oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and inhibits its fibrillization.







Abstract
Protein misassembly leads to the formation of dysfunctional and toxic molecular species relating to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Here, we tailored a nanochaperone (&#945;S&#8208;nChap) for &#945;&#8208;synuclein to regulate its assembly. The &#945;S&#8208;nChap is capable of i)&#8197;specifically recognizing &#945;&#8208;synuclein; ii)&#8197;dynamically capturing and stabilizing monomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein and retarding oligomerization; iii)&#8197;tightly capturing oligomeric &#945;&#8208;synuclein to prevent fibrillization; and iv)&#8197;transporting &#945;&#8208;synuclein oligomers to the lysosomal degradation system. The regulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein assembly by &#945;S&#8208;nChap was studied in vitro. Moreover, the role of &#945;S&#8208;nChap preventing &#945;&#8208;synuclein pathology in cells and protecting neurons from apoptosis was investigated. The strategy of tailoring a nanochaperone to regulate aberrant assembly of pathogenic proteins provides important insights into protein misfolding diseases. We foresee that &#945;S&#8208;nChap has therapeutic value for Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Asymmetrical&#8208;Dendronized TADF Emitters for Efficient Non&#8208;doped Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs by Eliminating Degenerate Excited States and Creating Solely Thermal Equilibrium Routes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two asymmetric &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half&#8208;dendronized&#8208;half&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; TADF emitters eliminate degenerate excited states, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin&#8208;flip process. AEE properties can minimize the exciton quenching. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit protects the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay. Non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a remarkably high EQEmax of 24.0&#8201;% and low roll&#8208;off are achieved.







Abstract
The mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in dendrimers is not clear.

&lt;p&gt;Two asymmetric &#8220;half-dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half-dendronized-half-encapsulated&#8221; TADF emitters eliminate degenerate excited states, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin-flip process. AEE properties can minimize the exciton quenching. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit protects the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay. Non-doped OLEDs with a remarkably high EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 24.0&#8201;% and low roll-off are achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) in dendrimers is not clear. We report that fully-conjugated or fully-nonconjugated structures cause unwanted degenerate excited states due to multiple identical dendrons, which limit their TADF efficiency. We have synthesized asymmetrical &#8220;half-dendronized&#8221; and &#8220;half-dendronized-half-encapsulated&#8221; emitters. By eliminating degenerate excited states, the triplet locally excited state is &#8805;0.3&#8197;eV above the lowest triplet charge-transfer state, assuring a solely thermal equilibrium route for an effective spin-flip process. The isolated encapsulating tricarbazole unit can protect the TADF unit, reducing nonradiative decay and enhancing TADF performance. Non-doped solution-processed devices reach a high external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 24.0&#8201;% (65.9&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 59.2&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with CIE coordinates of (0.24, 0.45) with a low efficiency roll-off and EQEs of 23.6&#8201;% and 21.3&#8201;% at 100 and 500&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Soluble and Perfluorinated Polyelectrolyte for Safe and High&#8208;Performance Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel design principle of polymerization and fluorination for salt anions has been proposed and lithiated Nafion (LN) was suggested as a representative soluble lithium salt for the polyelectrolyte solution to improve the Li+ transfer number and produce a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Furthermore, the perfluorinated backbone of LN delivers the polyelectrolyte solution low flammability. Thus, making the Li&#8722;O2 batteries realize all&#8208;round performance amelioration.







Abstract
The severe performance degradation of high&#8208;capacity Li&#8722;O2 batteries induced by Li dendrite growth and concentration polarization from the low Li+ transfer number of conventional electrolytes hinder their practical applications. Herein, lithiated Nafion (LN) with the sulfonic group immobilized on the perfluorinated backbone has been designed as a soluble lithium salt for preparing a less flammable polyelectrolyte solution, which not only simultaneously achieves a high Li+ transfer number (0.84) and conductivity (2.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1), but also the perfluorinated anion of LN produces a LiF&#8208;rich SEI for protecting the Li anode from dendrite growth. Thus, the Li&#8722;O2 battery with a LN&#8208;based electrolyte achieves an all&#8208;round performance improvement, like low charge overpotential (0.18&#8197;V), large discharge capacity (9508&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycling performance (225&#8197;cycles). Besides, the fabricated pouch&#8208;type Li&#8211;air cells exhibit promising applications to power electronic equipment with satisfactory safety.

         <title>A Pair of Atypical KAS III Homologues with Initiation and Elongation Functions Program the Polyketide Biosynthesis in Asukamycin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
KAS IIIs are known to be involved in the initiation step of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In vitro reconstitution of the upper triene chain of asukamycin unveils two highly unusual KAS IIIs which both exhibit initiation and iterative elongation activity. Together with the permissive ketoreductase and dehydratase, these C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes can synthesize a large variety of polyenes.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Ketoacyl&#8208;ACP synthase III (KAS III) is a class of important C&#8722;C bond&#8208;forming enzymes that mostly catalyze the initiation of polyketide and fatty acid biosynthesis. In this study, we elucidated an unusual polyketide synthase (PKS) system that involves two unique KAS IIIs (AsuC3 and C4) in the biosynthesis of the upper triene chain of asukamycin. Significantly, AsuC3 and C4 have both initiation and iterative elongation activity, while being functionally biased toward the elongation and initiation steps, respectively. Mutational analysis revealed that their catalytic activities rely on the catalytic triad Cys&#8208;His&#8208;Asn. Unlike other KAS IIIs, AsuC3 and C4 are very promiscuous and can accept various lengths of acyl&#8208;CoAs with either cyclic, branched or linear acyl moieties. By cooperation with the permissive ketoreductase (AsuC7) and dehydratase (AsuC8/C9), a large variety of polyenes can be efficiently synthesized. This study significantly broadens the understanding of KAS IIIs and polyketide biosynthesis.

         <title>Soft Alloys Constructed with Distinct Mesoatoms via Self&#8208;Sorting Assembly of Giant Shape Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional metal alloy&#8208;originated superlattices with large volume asymmetry were successfully constructed in soft matter by blending binary giant shape amphiphiles, especially including a first experimentally observed CaCu5 phase in soft matter. Furthermore, the thermodynamic origin of these superlattices was also quantitatively analyzed by isoperimetric quotient.







Abstract
The packing structures of spherical motifs affect the properties of resultant condensed materials such as in metal alloys. Inspired by the classic metallurgy, developing complex alloy&#8208;like packing phases in soft matter (also called &#8220;soft alloys&#8221;) is promising for the next&#8208;generation superlattice engineering. Nevertheless, the formation of many alloy&#8208;like phases in single&#8208;component soft matter is usually thermodynamically unfavourable and technically challenging. Here, we utilize a novel self&#8208;sorting assembly approach to tackle this challenge in binary blends of soft matter. Two types of giant shape amphiphiles self&#8208;sort to form their discrete spherical motifs, which further simultaneously pack into alloy&#8208;like phases. Three unconventional spherical packing phases have been observed in these binary systems, including MgZn2, NaZn13, and CaCu5 phases. It's the first time that the CaCu5 phase is experimentally observed in soft matter. This work demonstrates a general approach to constructing unconventional spherical packing phases and other complex superlattices in soft matter.

         <title>Emissive Platinum(II) Macrocycles as Tunable Cascade Energy Transfer Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emissive PtII macrocycles decorated with hydrophobic alkyl chains are developed as scaffolds for artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems with sequential energy transfer capabilities. These molecules have tunable aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) properties and form spherical aggregates upon self&#8208;assembly in water&#8211;acetone medium. A strategy to control the light&#8208;harvesting efficiency by changing hydrophobic chain length is shown.







Abstract
Developing artificial light&#8208;harvesting scaffolds with a cascade energy transfer process is significant for better understanding of photosynthesis. Here, we report [3+3] self&#8208;assembled PtII fluorescent macrocycles (3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b) as light&#8208;harvesting platforms with cascade energy transfer. The PtII macrocycles aggregate into nanospheres and show emission&#8208;enhancement characteristics upon increasing water content in acetone medium. These aggregates (3aa and 3ba) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin&#8208;Y (ESY). In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two&#8208;step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.

These aggregates (&lt;b&gt;3a&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3b&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) serve as energy donors when mixed with the hydrophobic dye Eosin-Y (ESY). In the presence of a second dye, Nile Red (NiR), an unusual sequential two-step energy transfer takes place from the macrocycles to NiR. In this case, ESY acts as a bridge in the relay mode. Additionally, a unique strategy to control such an energy transfer process by tuning the chain length of the alkyl group attached to the periphery of the macrocycles is demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cystine Knot Peptides with Tuneable Activity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separate approaches for tuning the activity of cystine knot peptides are reported. Protease inhibitors were designed that had light&#8208;controlled activity and could be switched ON against new targets, or had an affinity tag that allowed inhibitors to be switched OFF. These peptides enabled modulation of target activity with exquisite temporal control.







Abstract
Knottins are topologically complex peptides that are stabilised by a cystine knot and have exceptionally diverse functions, including protease inhibition. However, approaches for tuning their activity in situ are limited. Here, we demonstrate separate approaches for tuning the activity of knottin protease inhibitors using light or streptavidin. We show that the inhibitory activity and selectivity of an engineered knottin can be controlled with light by activating a second mode of action that switches the inhibitor ON against new targets. Guided by a knottin library screen, we also identify a position in the inhibitor's binding loop that permits insertion of a biotin tag without impairing activity. Using streptavidin, biotinylated knottins with nanomolar affinity can be switched OFF in activity assays, and the anticoagulant activity of a factor XIIa inhibitor can be rapidly switched OFF in human plasma. Our findings expand the scope of engineered knottins for precisely controlling protein function.

         <title>A Rational Biphasic Tailoring Strategy Enabling High&#8208;Performance Layered Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational biphasic tailoring strategy to prepare layered composite cathodes with the desired phase ratio is proposed. Benefiting from the reversible phase transition within transition metal slabs and the decreased structure strain at the phase boundary of the intergrowth structure during Na extraction and insertion, the Com&#8208;NaNMFT composite material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes usually exhibit high compositional diversity, thus providing controllable electrochemical performance for Na&#8208;ion batteries. These abundant components lead to complicated structural chemistry, closely affecting the stacking preference, phase transition and Na+ kinetics. With this perspective, we explore the thermodynamically stable phase diagram of various P2/O3 composites based on a rational biphasic tailoring strategy. Then a specific P2/O3 composite is investigated and compared with its monophasic counterparts. A highly reversible structural evolution of P2/O3&#8211;P2/O3/P3&#8211;P2/P3&#8211;P2/Z/O3&#8242;&#8211;Z/O3&#8242; based on the Ni2+/Ni3.5+, Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3.8+/Mn4+ redox couples upon sequential Na extraction/insertion is revealed. The reduced structural strain at the phase boundary alleviates the phase transition and decreases the lattice mismatch during cycling, endowing the biphasic electrode a large reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with the energy density approaching 514&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Linker Molecules Convert Commercial Fluorophores into Tailored Functional Probes during Biolabelling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore functionality with a click: A new biolabelling strategy using bespoke linker structures is introduced that allows to convert commercially available fluorophores into functional probes with high photostability (self&#8208;healing dyes) or dyes with the ability to sense bivalent metal ions resulting in blinking emission.







Abstract
Many life&#8208;science techniques and assays rely on selective labeling of biological target structures with commercial fluorophores that have specific yet invariant properties. Consequently, a fluorophore (or dye) is only useful for a limited range of applications, e.g., as a label for cellular compartments, super&#8208;resolution imaging, DNA sequencing or for a specific biomedical assay. Modifications of fluorophores with the goal to alter their bioconjugation chemistry, photophysical or functional properties typically require complex synthesis schemes. We here introduce a general strategy that allows to customize these properties during biolabelling with the goal to introduce the fluorophore in the last step of biolabelling. For this, we present the design and synthesis of &#8216;linker&#8217; compounds, that bridge biotarget, fluorophore and a functional moiety via well&#8208;established labeling protocols. Linker molecules were synthesized via the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) which facilitates a modular design of linkers with diverse functional properties and bioconjugation&#8208; and fluorophore attachment moieties. To demonstrate the possibilities of different linkers experimentally, we characterized the ability of commercial fluorophores from the classes of cyanines, rhodamines, carbopyronines and silicon&#8208;rhodamines to become functional labels on different biological targets in vitro and in vivo via thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry. With our strategy, we showed that the same commercial dye can become a photostable self&#8208;healing dye or a sensor for bivalent ions subject to the linker used. Finally, we quantified the photophysical performance of different self&#8208;healing linker&#8211;fluorophore conjugates and demonstrated their applications in super&#8208;resolution imaging and single&#8208;molecule spectroscopy.

         <title>Highly Efficient Conversion of Propargylic Alcohols and Propargylic Amines with CO2 Activated by Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8</title>

The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 with a yolk&#8211;shell structure was synthesized, and it represents the first noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can effectively catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 under mild conditions.







Abstract
The cyclization reactions of propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 are important in industrial applications, but it was a great challenge that non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts catalyzed both reactions under mild conditions. Herein, the catalyst Cu2O@ZIF&#8208;8 was prepared by encapsulating Cu2O nanoparticles into robust ZIF&#8208;8, and it can effectively catalyze the cyclization of both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 into valuable &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonates and oxazolidinones with turnover numbers (TONs) of 12.1 and 19.6, which can be recycled at least five times. The mechanisms were further uncovered by NMR, FTIR, 13C isotope&#8208;labeling experiments and DFT calculations, in which Cu2O and DBU can synergistically activate the C&#8801;C bond and the hydroxy/amino group of substrates. Importantly, it is the first example of a noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalyst that can catalyze both propargylic alcohols and propargylic amines with CO2 simultaneously.

         <title>Back Cover: Ceria&#8208;Supported Gold Nanoparticles as a Superior Catalyst for Nitrous Oxide Production via Ammonia Oxidation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 19/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A game of two halves Direct ammonia oxidation unlocks a pathway towards affordable and efficient production of nitrous oxide, a highly promising agent for selective oxidation reactions, but necessitates the development of suitable catalysts. In their Research Article (e202200772), Javier P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the synergistic interaction between Au nanoparticles and CeO2 support results in a material with unprecedented levels of N2O selectivity and productivity, far surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art systems.

         <title>Inside Cover: Active Mechanical Threading by a Molecular Motor (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 19/2022)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular motor setup that allows harnessing the trajectory of directional motor rotation for an active mechanical threading process is presented by Henry Dube and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202201882). The motor is embedded into a macrocycle and its indane&#8208;based rotor fragment then serves as a &#8220;revolving door&#8221; in the light&#8208;driven rotation. In this way a process akin to macroscopic threading of a needle is miniaturized to the molecular level, offering a first entry point to mechanical molecular knitting or weaving processes.

Metal alloy superlattices with large volume asymmetry were constructed based on self&#8208;sorting assembly of binary giant shape amphiphiles, as reported by Zebin Su, Stephen Z.&#8197;D. Cheng et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202200637). MgZn2, NaZn13, and CaCu5 superlattices were observed in soft matters, and the thermodynamic origin of their formation was quantitatively analyzed.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Linker Molecules Convert Commercial Fluorophores into Tailored Functional Probes during Biolabelling (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 19/2022)</title>

The Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi&#8208;4CR) was applied by Andreas Herrmann, Thorben Cordes, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202112959) to synthesize a library of linker molecules (illustrated as the ESA space gateway) to link biological targets (the space shuttle) to commercially available fluorescent dyes (the Orion service modules). The modular design of the Ugi&#8208;4CR allows the addition of different functional groups to the linkers, which in turn alter the properties of the fluorophore. Functional groups were introduced that turned a variety of fluorophores into highly stable self&#8208;healing dyes or metal&#8208;chelating dyes during biolabelling.

         <title>From Structural Design to Functional Construction: Amine Molecules in High&#8208;Performance Formamidinium&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural design of amine molecules is effective for functional construction of perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer in perovskite solar cells. High&#8208;efficiency and robust perovskite solar cells can be achieved through crystal regulation of formamidinium&#8208;based perovskites and improvement of the specific perovskite properties including defect condition, charge transfer, and moisture resistance.







Abstract
Formamidinium (FA) based perovskites are considered as one of the most promising light&#8208;absorbing perovskite materials owing to their narrower band gap and better thermal stability compared to conventional methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Constant improvement by using various additives stimulates the potential application of these perovskites. Amine molecules with different structures have been widely used as typical additives in FA&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, and decent performances have been achieved. Thus, a systematic review focusing on structural regulation and functional construction of amines in FA&#8208;based perovskites is of significance. Herein, we analyze the construction mechanism of different structural amines on the functional perovskite crystals. The influence of amine molecules on specific perovskite properties including defect conditions, charge transfer, and moisture resistance are evaluated. Finally, we summarize the design rules of amine molecules for the application in high&#8208;performance FA&#8208;based perovskites and propose directions for the future development of additive molecules.

         <title>Molecular Catalysts for the Reductive Homocoupling of CO2 towards C2+ Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview summarizes recent progress in molecular catalysis of CO2 and CO homocoupling through thermochemical and electrochemical reductive approaches. Particular attention is paid to C&#8722;C coupling processes that generate multicarbon products. The current challenges in this rapidly growing field are described and perspectives for possible future developments are outlined.







Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into multicarbon (C2+) compounds by reductive homocoupling offers the possibility to transform renewable energy into chemical energy carriers and thereby create &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; fuels or other valuable products. Most available studies have employed heterogeneous metallic catalysts, but the use of molecular catalysts is still underexplored. However, several studies have already demonstrated the great potential of the molecular approach, namely, the possibility to gain a deep mechanistic understanding and a more precise control of the product selectivity. This Minireview summarizes recent progress in both the thermo&#8208; and electrochemical reductive homocoupling of CO2 toward C2+ products mediated by molecular catalysts. In addition, reductive CO homocoupling is discussed as a model for the further conversion of intermediates obtained from CO2 reduction, which may serve as a source of inspiration for developing novel molecular catalysts in the future.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Erectones A and B, and the Revised Structure of Hyperelodione D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of hyperelodione D leads to its structural reassignment via a concise total synthesis. The key step is a bioinspired, Diels&#8211;Alder cascade reaction between E,E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;farnesene and a naturally occurring quinone that generates three rings and six stereocentres.







Abstract
The field of biomimetic synthesis seeks to apply biosynthetic hypotheses to the efficient construction of complex natural products. This approach can also guide the revision of incorrectly assigned structures. Herein, we describe the evolution of a concise total synthesis and structural reassignment of hyperelodione D, a tetracyclic meroterpenoid derived from a Hypericum plant, alongside some biogenetically related natural products, erectones A and B. The key step in the synthesis of hyperelodione D forms six stereocentres and three rings in a bioinspired cascade reaction that features an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, an intramolecular Prins reaction and a terminating cycloetherification.

         <title>Designing a Network of Crystalline Polymers for a Scalable, Nonfluorinated, Healable and Amphiphobic Solid Slippery Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A healable amphiphobic solid slippery coating is derived through the formation of a crystalline network of &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymers in a porous polymeric coating, where the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction provided a porous and substrate&#8208;independent polymeric coating to develop a non&#8208;fluorinated and optically transparent slippery interface for sliding beaded droplets of water, crude/refined oils and polar/non&#8208;polar solvents.







Abstract
The fluorinated&#8208;liquid infused amphiphobic slippery interfaces exhibiting superior sliding of the beaded oil/water droplets, often suffer from durability and contamination issues. Here, the ability of 1)&#8197;hexagonal packing of hydrocarbon sides in a selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer and 2)&#8197;its reversible phase transition at 51&#8201;&#176;C was rationally exploited to achieve temperature&#8208;assisted rapid (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitive (50 times) self&#8208;healable amphiphobic solid&#8208;slippery coating on both planar and geometrically&#8208;complex substrates. The selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer was strategically infused in a porous, hydrophilic and thick (&#8776;4.8&#8197;&#956;m) polymeric coating. The resultant solid and smooth interface exhibited sliding of beaded droplets of various liquids, including droplets of water, polar (ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, 1&#8208;hexanol, DMSO, DMF), and non&#8208;polar (decane, dodecane, diiodomethane) organic solvents, edible (vegetable oil), motor, engine (petrol, diesel, kerosene) and crude oils.

&lt;p&gt;A healable amphiphobic solid slippery coating is derived through the formation of a crystalline network of &#8220;comb-like&#8221; polymers in a porous polymeric coating, where the 1,4-conjugate addition reaction provided a porous and substrate-independent polymeric coating to develop a non-fluorinated and optically transparent slippery interface for sliding beaded droplets of water, crude/refined oils and polar/non-polar solvents.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Promoted ZnMe/ZnPh Exchange in Eight&#8208;Coordinate [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the 8&#8208;coordinate RuZn4 heterobimetallic complex [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2] with ZnPh2 leads to complete ZnMe/ZnPh exchange to form [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2]. Both species exhibit equilibria in solution with their alternative 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers and DFT calculations define facile isomerisation and hydride&#8208;assisted ZnMe/ZnPh exchange pathways.







Abstract
The syntheses, reactivity and electronic structure analyses of [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2], 1&#8201;a, and [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2], 2&#8201;b, are reported. 1&#8201;a exhibits an 8&#8208;coordinate Ru centre with axial phosphines and a symmetrical (2&#8201;:&#8201;2) arrangement of ZnMe ligands in the equatorial plane. The ZnMe ligands in 1&#8201;a undergo facile, sequential exchange with ZnPh2 to give 2&#8201;b, which shows a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 arrangement of ZnPh ligands. Both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b exist in equilibrium with their respective 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers. Mechanisms for ZnMe/ZnPh exchange and isomerisation are proposed using DFT calculations. The relationships of these {Ru(ZnR)4H2} species to isoelectronic Group 8 transition metal polyhydrides and related Schlenk equilibria in the Negishi reaction are discussed.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Aminocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of simple imide&#8208;directed intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of aminocyclopropanes enabled by iridium catalysis has been developed. The reaction proceeds via six&#8208;membered metallacycles. The method could tolerate a broad spectrum of functional groups, affording a vast array of chiral aminocyclopropanes (36 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controllable C&#8722;H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we disclose the first example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aminocyclopropanes by using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six&#8208;membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36 examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C&#8722;H borylation, C&#8722;B bond transformations, and conversion of the directing group.

         <title>Chiral Symmetry Breaking of Monoacylated Anhydroerythritols and meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols through Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>

The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols and acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols with a cis configuration revealed that four compounds crystallized as a racemic conglomerate.

Abstract
We developed a chiral symmetry breaking method for monoacylated meso diols. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols, meso cyclic diols with a cis configuration, revealed that the O&#8208;(p&#8208;anisoyl) derivative crystallized as a racemic conglomerate of the P212121 crystal system. It was confirmed that the substrate racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Evaporating the solvent gradually from the solution or Viedma ripening to promote crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals. These results provide the first successful example of asymmetric expression and amplification by deracemization of sugar derivatives without an external chemical chiral source. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols. Three O&#8208;monoacylated substrates were successfully deracemized to 99&#8201;% ee by Viedma ripening. We also developed asymmetric desymmetrization of meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols by combining acylation and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Electrophile Synthesis of Di(hetero)arylmethanes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfinative C&#8722;C Coupling</title>

         <dc:description>
Benzylic halides and heteroaryl halides are directly coupled using Pd&#8208;catalysis and a simple sulfinate transfer reagent. The reactions proceed by formation of an intermediate benzylic sulfinate, formed in situ, and deliver di(hetero)arylmethane products. The reactions use only commercial components, and no stoichiometric metal reductant is needed.







Abstract
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling to access medicinally relevant di(hetero)arylmethanes is reported. The method is reductant&#8208;free, and involves a sulfinate transfer reagent and a Pd&#8208;catalyst mediating the union of two electrophilic coupling partners; a (hetero)aryl halide and a benzyl halide. We establish for the first time that benzyl sulfinates, generated in situ, undergo efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl halides to generate di(hetero)arylmethanes. The reaction can be extended to benzylic pseudohalides derived from benzyl alcohols. The reactions are straightforward to perform and scalable, and all reaction components are commercially available.

The reactions proceed by formation of an intermediate benzylic sulfinate, formed in situ, and deliver di(hetero)arylmethane products. The reactions use only commercial components, and no stoichiometric metal reductant is needed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient Pd-catalyzed one-pot desulfinative cross-coupling to access medicinally relevant di(hetero)arylmethanes is reported. The method is reductant-free, and involves a sulfinate transfer reagent and a Pd-catalyst mediating the union of two electrophilic coupling partners; a (hetero)aryl halide and a benzyl halide. We establish for the first time that benzyl sulfinates, generated in situ, undergo efficient Pd-catalyzed desulfinative cross-coupling with (hetero)aryl halides to generate di(hetero)arylmethanes. The reaction can be extended to benzylic pseudohalides derived from benzyl alcohols. The reactions are straightforward to perform and scalable, and all reaction components are commercially available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Studying the Key Intermediate of RNA Autohydrolysis by Cryogenic Gas&#8208;Phase Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA autohydrolysis is a generic phenomenon in solution and proceeds via a 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic nucleotide intermediate. Cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in combination with DFT calculations show that the structure of c&#8208;fragments generated by the dissociation of RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase is equal to the key intermediate of RNA autohydrolysis. Furthermore, the data show that the nucleobase in cytidine phosphate readily tautomerizes in the gas phase.







Abstract
Over the course of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic, mRNA&#8208;based vaccines have gained tremendous importance. The development and analysis of modified RNA molecules benefit from advanced mass spectrometry and require sufficient understanding of fragmentation processes. Analogous to the degradation of RNA in solution by autohydrolysis, backbone cleavage of RNA strands was equally observed in the gas phase; however, the fragmentation mechanism remained elusive. In this work, autohydrolysis&#8208;like intermediates were generated from isolated RNA dinucleotides in the gas phase and investigated using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets. Data from both experiment and density functional theory provide evidence for the formation of a five&#8208;membered cyclic phosphate intermediate and rule out linear or six&#8208;membered structures. Furthermore, the experiments show that another prominent condensed&#8208;phase reaction of RNA nucleotides can be induced in the gas phase: the tautomerization of cytosine. Both observed reactions are therefore highly universal and intrinsic properties of the investigated molecules.

         <title>Estimating Phosphorescent Emission Energies in IrIII Complexes Using Large&#8208;Scale Quantum Computing Simulations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) quantum method was used to calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in phosphorescent IrIII complexes. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 logical qubits. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals studied, setting an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.







Abstract
Here we calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in nine phosphorescent iridium complexes using the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method to determine if quantum simulations have any advantages over classical methods. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 fully&#8208;connected logical qubits. Since such devices do not yet exist, we demonstrate the iQCC method using a purpose&#8208;built quantum simulator on classical hardware. The results are compared to a selection of common DFT functionals, ab initio methods, and empirical data. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals, but with a better correlation coefficient, demonstrating that it is better at predicting the structure&#8211;property relationship. Results indicate that the iQCC method has the required accuracy to design organometallic complexes when deployed on emerging quantum hardware and sets an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Catalyzed by a Single H&#8208;Bond Donor Organocatalyst</title>

A simple prolinamide bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor urea function catalyzes the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction between tryptamines and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses.







Abstract
The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far&#8208;less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl&#8208;urea organocatalysts bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic isotope effect using C2&#8208;deuterium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208; and the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating Colloidal Co&#8208;Assemblies That Accelerate Their Own Destruction via Chemo&#8208;Structural Feedback</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;structural feedback mechanism is introduced in co&#8208;assembling microgels (MGs), whereby the co&#8208;assemblies promote their own destruction. The key concept uses co&#8208;assembly&#8208;triggered proximity effects of enzymes immobilized on individual MGs so that the co&#8208;assembly enhances an enzymatic cascade for deactivator production.







Abstract
Biological self&#8208;assemblies self&#8208; and cross&#8208;regulate each other via chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and feedback. Although artificial transient self&#8208;assemblies have been realized via activation/deactivation CRNs, the transient structures themselves do mostly not engage in the CRN. We introduce a rational design approach for chemo&#8208;structural feedback, and present a transient colloidal co&#8208;assembly system, where the formed co&#8208;assemblies accelerate their destruction autonomously. We achieve this by immobilizing enzymes of a deactivating acid&#8208;producing enzymatic cascade on pH&#8208;switchable microgels that can form co&#8208;assemblies at high pH. Since the enzyme partners are immobilized on individual microgels, the co&#8208;assembled state brings them close enough for enhanced acid generation. The amplified deactivator production (acid) leads to an almost two&#8208;fold reduction in the lifetime of the transiently formed pH&#8208;state. Our study thus introduces versatile mechanisms for chemo&#8208;structural feedback.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Induced Emergent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex has been developed that forms fluorescent complexes with nucleotides, but only in the presence of ATP. A chiral assembly is generated that exhibits circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a glum factor as high as 0.20. This discrimination of ATP from other nucleotides should allow applications in encryption.







Abstract
Biomimetic ATP&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly is important to understand various biological processes and dissipative systems. Here, we report an ATP&#8208;driven chiral assembly exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) via the interaction of an achiral terpyridine&#8208;based ZnII complex with nucleotides. It was found that while the metal complexes could co&#8208;assemble with the nucleotides to form fluorescent assemblies, only a combination of furan&#8208;substituted terpyridine complex and ATP showed an intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor (glum) as high as 0.20. This means that the complex could recognize ATP using CPL as a readout signal, thus providing an example of ATP encryption. Interestingly, when ATP was transferred into ADP or AMP under enzymatic hydrolysis, the CPL decreases or disappears. Addition of ATP generates CPL again, thus producing an ATP&#8208;induced CPL system. This work presents the first example of ATP&#8208;induced CPL and encryption.

     alt="ATP-Induced Emergent Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Encryption"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An achiral terpyridine-based Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex has been developed that forms fluorescent complexes with nucleotides, but only in the presence of ATP. A chiral assembly is generated that exhibits circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; factor as high as 0.20. This discrimination of ATP from other nucleotides should allow applications in encryption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomimetic ATP-driven supramolecular assembly is important to understand various biological processes and dissipative systems. Here, we report an ATP-driven chiral assembly exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) via the interaction of an achiral terpyridine-based Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex with nucleotides. It was found that while the metal complexes could co-assemble with the nucleotides to form fluorescent assemblies, only a combination of furan-substituted terpyridine complex and ATP showed an intense CPL with a dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) as high as 0.20. This means that the complex could recognize ATP using CPL as a readout signal, thus providing an example of ATP encryption. Interestingly, when ATP was transferred into ADP or AMP under enzymatic hydrolysis, the CPL decreases or disappears. Addition of ATP generates CPL again, thus producing an ATP-induced CPL system. This work presents the first example of ATP-induced CPL and encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovery of Two Polymorphs of TiP4N8 Synthesized from Binary Nitrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary TiIV nitridophosphate TiP4N8 has been prepared under high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature conditions and subsequent annealing in silica ampoules. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps and predict the thermochemistry of two polymorphs. The synthesis of TiP4N8 shows a promising route to new ternary nitrides with semiconducting properties.







Abstract
TiP4N8 was obtained from the binary nitrides TiN and P3N5 upon addition of NH4F as a mineralizer at 8&#8197;GPa and 1400&#8201;&#176;C. An intricate interplay of disorder and polymorphism was elucidated by in situ temperature&#8208;dependent single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and the investigation of annealed samples. This revealed two polymorphs, which consist of dense networks of PN4 tetrahedra (degree of condensation &#954;=0.5) and either augmented triangular TiN7 prisms or triangular TiN6 prisms for &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8, respectively. The structures of TiP4N8 exhibit body&#8208;centered tetragonal (bct) framework topology. DFT calculations confirm the measured band gaps of &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;TiP4N8 (1.6&#8211;1.8&#8197;eV) and predict the thermochemistry of the polymorphs in agreement with the experiments.

         <title>Organoplatinum Compounds as Anion&#8208;Tuneable Uphill Hydroxide Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 19, May 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active and directional hydroxide transport is realized by using PtII organometallic compounds as carriers based on their hydrolysis reaction combined with the different permeability of the neutral form and the charged form PtII aqua species. These compounds can transport hydroxide selectively &#8220;uphill&#8221;, a gradient in a liposomal system producing a transmembrane pH gradient, and tuneable activity is achieved by adding anions through a ligand&#8208;exchange reaction.







Abstract
Active transport of ions uphill, creating a concentration gradient across a cell membrane, is essential for life. It remains a significant challenge to develop synthetic systems that allow active uphill transport. Here, a transport process fuelled by organometallic compounds is reported that creates a pH gradient. The hydrolysis reaction of PtII complexes results in the formation of aqua complexes that established rapid transmembrane movement (&#8220;flip&#8208;flop&#8221;) of neutral Pt&#8722;OH species, leading to protonation of the OH group in the inner leaflet, generating OH&#8722; ions, and so increasing the pH in the intravesicular solution. The organoplatinum complex effectively transports bound hydroxide ions across the membrane in a neutral complex. The initial net flow of the PtII complex into the vesicles generates a positive electric potential that can further drive uphill transport because the electric potential is opposed to the chemical potential of OH&#8722;. The OH&#8722; ions equilibrate with this transmembrane electric potential but cannot remove it due to the relatively low permeability of the charged species. As a result, effective hydroxide transport against its concentration gradient can be achieved, and multiple additions can continuously drive the generation of OH&#8722; against its concentration gradient up to &#916;pH&gt;2. Moreover, the external addition of different anions can control the generation of OH&#8722; depending on their anion binding affinity. When anions displayed very high binding affinities towards PtII compounds, such as halides, the external anions could dissipate the pH gradient. In contrast, a further pH increase was observed for weak binding anions, such as sulfate, due to the increase of positive electric potential.

         <title>MOF Synthesis Prediction Enabled by Automatic Data Mining and Machine Learning**
</title>

An approach to rationalize and accelerate MOF discovery by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure is reported. The prediction is based on machine learning models, trained on the SynMOF database, constructed via automatic data mining of synthesis parameters from the literature. The model outperforms human expert predictions according to a synthesis survey.







Abstract
Despite rapid progress in the field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the potential of using machine learning (ML) methods to predict MOF synthesis parameters is still untapped. Here, we show how ML can be used for rationalization and acceleration of the MOF discovery process by directly predicting the synthesis conditions of a MOF based on its crystal structure. Our approach is based on: i)&#8197;establishing the first MOF synthesis database via automatic extraction of synthesis parameters from the literature, ii)&#8197;training and optimizing ML models by employing the MOF database, and iii)&#8197;predicting the synthesis conditions for new MOF structures. The ML models, even at an initial stage, exhibit a good prediction performance, outperforming human expert predictions, obtained through a synthesis survey. The automated synthesis prediction is available via a web&#8208;tool on https://mof&#8208;synthesis.aimat.science.

         <title>Electrochemistry in Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new strategies to advance the fundamental understanding of electrochemistry is crucial to mitigating multiple contemporary technological challenges. In this regard, magnetoelectrochemistry offers many strategic advantages in controlling and understanding electrochemical reactions that might be tricky to regulate in conventional electrochemical fields. However, the topic is highly interdisciplinary, combining concepts from electrochemistry, hydrodynamics, and magnetism with experimental outcomes that are sometimes unexpected. In this review, we survey recent advances in using a magnetic field in different electrochemical applications organized by the effect of the generated forces on fundamental electrochemical principles and focus on how the magnetic field leads to the observed results. Finally, we discuss the challenges that remain to be addressed to establish robust applications capable of meeting present needs by overcoming existing limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries towards practical working conditions through cathode&#8208;electrolyte synergy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercialization of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is still hindered by the unsatisfactory cell performance under practical working conditions, which is mainly caused by the sluggish cathode redox kinetics, severe polysulfide shuttling, and poor Li striping/platting reversibility. Herein, we reported an effective strategy by combining Se&#8208;doped S hosted in an ordered macroporous framework with highly fluorinated ether (HFE)&#8208;based electrolyte to simultaneously address the afore&#8208;mentioned issues in both cathode and anode. A reversible and stable high areal capacity of &gt; 5.4 mAh cm  &#8208;2&#160;  with high coulombic efficiency &gt; 99.2% can be achieved under high areal Se/S loading (5.8 mg cm  &#8208;2  ), while the underlying mechanism was further revealed through synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes and Time&#8208;of&#8208;Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS). The practical application potential was further evaluated at low (0&#160; &#730; C) and high (55&#160; &#730; C) temperatures under high areal Se/S loading (&gt; 5.0 mg cm  &#8208;2  ) and thin Li metal (40&#160; &#181; m).</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Aryl trifluoromethyl diazomethanes    2&#8208;R    (R = Ph, OMe, CF  3  ) are readily decomposed by the (o&#8208;carboranyl)diphosphine gold(I) complex    1   .  The resulting  &#945;  &#8208;CF  3  substituted carbene complexes  3&#8208;R  have been characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography (for  3&#8208;Ph  ). The bonding situation was thoroughly assessed by computational means, showing stabilization of the electrophilic carbene center by  &#960;  &#8208;donation from the aryl substituent and backdonation from Au, as enhanced by the chelating P^P ligand.

         <title>Multicolor Zinc(II)&#8208;coordinated Hydrazone&#8208;based Bistable Photoswitches for Rewritable Transparent Luminescent Labels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Repeatable printing of invisible multicolor luminescence patterns with long retention times on transparent substrates is of significant importance, but it remains a formidable challenge. Here, two novel hydrazone&#8208;based on/off fluorescent photoswitches with decent emission quantum efficiencies, good reversible photoisomerization properties, and extremely long thermal half&#8208;lives, were designed and synthesized. Excitingly, X&#8208;ray crystallography data of both Z and E isomers of one hydrazone&#8208;based photoswitch were obtained. Multiple emission colors of blue, cyan, green, yellow, and orange can be obtained readily for these two photoswitches upon coordination with various zinc salts. Moreover, the photo&#8208;controlled rewritable printing of invisible multicolor images with high resolution was achieved by using these photoswitches. Importantly, the legibility of the printed patterns can last at least over 3 months without detectable emission intensity loss under ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;Sequence High&#8208;Specificity Dual&#8208;Reporter Unlocking of Fluorescent Probe Enables the Precise Identification of Atherosclerotic Plaques</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of atherosclerotic&#160;plaques is the root cause of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Effective CVD interventions thus call for precise identification of the plaques to aid clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of such diseases. In this study, we introduce a dual&#8208;target sequentially activated fluorescence reporting system, termed  i  n&#8208;  s  equence  h  igh&#8208;sp  e  cificity dual&#8208;  r  eporter un  lock  ing (iSHERLOCK), to precisely identify the&#160; atherosclerotic plaques  in vivo  and  ex vivo  . ISHERLOCK was achieved by creating a three&#8208;in&#8208;one fluorescent probe that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of lipid droplets and hypochlorous acid via &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; and ratiometric readouts, respectively. Based on this format, the upregulated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress&#8212;the two hallmarks of atherosclerosis (AS)&#8212;were specifically measured in the atherosclerotic&#160;plaques, breaking through the barrier of precise tissue biopsy of AS and thus aiding effective CVD stewardship.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Alloy PtWMn as a Mn Nanoreservoir for High&#8208;field MRI Monitoring and Highly Selective Ferroptosis Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferroptosis exhibits a potential to damage drug&#8208;resistant cancer cells. However, it is still restricted with the &#8220;off&#8208;target&#8221; toxicity from the undesirable leakage of metal ions from ferroptosis agents, and lack of reliable imaging for monitoring ferroptosis process in living system. Herein, we develop a novel ternary alloy PtWMn nanocube as a Mn reservoir, and further design a microenvironment&#8208;triggered nanoplatform that can accurately release Mn ions within tumor to increase ROS generation, produce O  2  and consume excess glutathione for synergistically enhancing nonferrous ferroptosis. Moreover, this nanoplatform exerts the responsive signal in high&#8208;field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which enables the real&#8208;time report of Mn release and the monitoring of ferroptosis initiation through the signal changes of T  1  &#8208;/T  2  &#8208;MRI. Thus, our nanoplatform provides a novel strategy to reserve, deliver and precisely release Mn ions for MRI&#8208;guided high&#8208;specificity ferroptosis therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocaging of Activity&#8208;based Ubiquitin Probes via a C&#8208;Terminal Backbone Modification Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaged, activity&#8208;based ubiquitin (Ub) probes (Ub&#8208;ABPs) have been developed for the time&#8208;resolved probing of deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activities, but many Ub&#8208;ABPs are still challenging to photocage because their warheads (e.g. propargylamide (PA) or dehydroalanine (Dha)) are difficult to temporally block and activate. Here, we describe a new C&#8208;terminal backbone modification strategy for the construction of photocaged Ub&#8208;ABPs in which a light&#8208;sensitive group is placed at the backbone amide bond of the Ub Gly75. This strategy enabled the facile generation of cell&#8208;permeable photocaged Ub&#8208;PA and Dha probes that could be activated to capture DUBs after photo&#8208;irradiation, and were used to profile DUBs in cells under specially designed conditions (e.g. in cells experiencing oxidative stress) or DUBs with isopeptide linkage selectivity. This backbone modification strategy is anticipated to provide a general solution to the development of photocaged Ub ABPs bearing any warheads for DUB profiling.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas Phase Mechanism of O&#8226;&#8722;/Ni2+&#8208;mediated Methane Conversion to Formaldehyde</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The gas phase reaction of NiAl  2  O  4  +  with CH  4  is studied by mass spectrometry in combination with vibrational action spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Two product ions, NiAl  2  O  4  H  +  and NiAl  2  O  3  H  2  +  , are identified in the mass spectra. The DFT calculations predict that the global minimum&#8208;energy isomer of NiAl  2  O  4  +  contains Ni in the +II oxidation state and features a terminal Al&#8211;O  &#8226;&#8722;  oxygen radical site. They show that methane can react along two competing pathways leading to formation of either a methyl radical (CH  3  &#8226;  ) or formaldehyde (CH  2  O). Both reactions are initiated by hydrogen atom transfer from methane to the terminal O  &#8226;&#8722;  site, followed by either CH  3  &#8226;  loss or CH  3  &#8226;  migration to an O  2&#8722;  site next to the Ni  2+  center. The CH  3  &#8226;  attaches as CH  3  +  to O  2&#8722;  and its unpaired electron is transferred to the Ni&#8208;center reducing it to Ni  +  . The proposed mechanism is experimentally confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy of the reactant and two different product ions.</dc:description>

         <title>ESA&#8217;s Cometary Mission Rosetta &#8211; Re&#8208;Characterization of the COSAC Mass Spectrometry Results</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The most pristine material of the Solar System is assumed to be preserved in comets in the form of dust and ice as refractory matter. ESA&#8217;s mission Rosetta and its lander Philae had been developed to investigate the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov&#8208;Gerasimenko&#160;in situ. Twenty&#8208;five minutes after the initial touchdown of Philae on the surface of comet 67P in November 2014, a mass spectrum was recorded by the time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer COSAC onboard Philae. The new characterization of this mass spectrum through non&#8208;negative least squares fitting and Monte Carlo simulations reveals the chemical composition of comet 67P. A suite of 12 organic molecules, 9 of which also found in the original analysis of this data, exhibit high statistical probability to be present in the grains sampled from the cometary nucleus. These volatile molecules are among the most abundant in the comet&#8217;s chemical composition and represent an inventory of the first raw materials present in the early Solar System.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks and Their Derivatives via Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational synthesis of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with predicted structure has been a long&#8208;term challenge. Herein, by using the efficient, simple, low&#8208;cost, and scalable mechanosynthesis, we demonstrate that reticular chemistry is applicable to HOF assemblies based on building blocks with different geometry, connectivity, and functionality. The obtained crystalline HOFs show uniform nano&#8208;size morphology, which is challenging or unachievable for conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Furthermore, the one&#8208;pot mechanosynthesis generated a series of Pd@HOF composites with noticeably different CO oxidation activities. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS studies indicate that the most efficient composite, counterintuitively, shows the weakest CO affinity to Pd sites while the strongest CO affinity to HOF matrix, revealing the vital role of porous matrix to the catalytic performance. This work paves a new avenue for rational synthesis of HOF and HOF&#8208;based composites for broad application potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Head Terpene Cyclizations by Optically Active Hexameric Resorcin[4]arene Capsule Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of enantioenriched hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules have been synthesized. These large molecular containers, with an inner volume of approximately 1400&#8197;&#197;3, enable the enantioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;head cyclization of terpenes within their interior.







Abstract
Molecular capsules enable the conversion of substrates inside a closed cavity, mimicking to some extent enzymatic catalysis. Chirality transfer from the molecular capsule onto the encapsulated substrate has been only studied in a few cases. Here we demonstrate that chirality transfer is possible inside a rather large molecular container of approximately 1400&#8197;&#197;3. Specifically, we present 1) the first examples of optically active hexameric resorcin[4]arene capsules, 2) their ability to enantioselectively catalyze tail&#8208;to&#8208;head terpene cyclizations, and 3) the surprisingly high sensitivity of enantioselectivity on the structural modifications.

         <title>Lewis Base&#8208;Catalysed Enantioselective Radical Conjugate Addition for the Synthesis of Enantioenriched Pyrrolidinones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a catalytic asymmetric protocol for the preparation of chiral pyrrolidinones proceeding via a radical pathway. The chemistry exploits the combination of photoredox catalysis and Lewis base catalysis to realise the first example of asymmetric radical conjugate addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides and esters. The reaction is initiated by photoredox activation of N&#8208;arylglycines to generate, upon decarboxylation, &#945;&#8208;amino radicals. These radicals are then intercepted stereoselectively by &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acyl ammonium intermediates, whose formation is mastered by a chiral isothiourea organocatalyst. Cyclisation leads to catalyst turnover and formation of enantioenriched pyrrolidinones. The utility of the protocol was demonstrated with application to the synthesis of biologically&#8208;active &#947;&#8208;amino butyric acids.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Production and Water Desalination with On&#8208;demand Electricity Output Enabled by Electrochemical Neutralization Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production can be achieved by using renewables or decoupling sluggish oxygen evolution reaction from overall water splitting, which, however, still needs electricity input. Herein, we realize hydrogen production and water desalination with on&#8208;demand electricity output by electrochemical neutralization chemistry coupling acidic hydrogen evolution and alkaline hydrazine oxidation with the ionic exchange. The electrochemical neutralization cells allow efficient use of not only chemical energy but also the low&#8208;grade heat from the surroundings to output 0.81 kWh electricity for per m  3  hydrogen. Cell function can be rapidly switched to electricity output with high peak power density up to 85.5 mW cm  &#8211;2  or spontaneous hydrogen production at a high rate up to 70.1 mol h  &#8211;1  m  &#8211;2  without breaking cell operation or changing cell configuration. Fast water desalination is simultaneously achieved at a high salt removal rate of 56.1 mol h  &#8722;1  m  &#8211;2  without external electricity supply.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;surface Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;doped Graphene Nanoribbon with Multiple Substitutional Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Doped graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with heteroatoms are a principal strategy to fine&#8208;tune the electronic structures of GNRs for future device applications.  Here, we successfully synthesized N=9 nitrogen&#8208;doped armchair GNR on the Au(111) surface. Due to the flexibility of precursor molecules, three different covalent bonds (C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, N&#8208;N) are formed in the GNR backbone.  Scanning tunneling spectroscopy analysis together with band structure calculations reveals that the bandgap of the N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNRs (C&#8208;C) will be enlarged compared to pristine 9&#8208;AGNRs, and the C&#8208;N bond and N&#8208;N bond at the isolated site of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8208;C) will introduce new defect states near the Fermi level. DFT calculation shows that the electronic structure of N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8208;C) is semiconductor characters, while N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (C&#8208;N) and N&#8208;9&#8208;AGNR (N&#8208;N) are metallic characters. Our results provide a promising route for creating more complex molecular heterostructures with tunable bandgaps, which may be useful for future molecular electronics and memory device applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Back&#8208;gated van der Waals Heterojunction Manipulates Local Charges toward Fine&#8208;tuning Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The charge redistribution plays a prominent role in interpreting the intrinsic electrocatalytic mechanism. Constructing a quantitative relationship between the local charges and electrochemical performance can fundamentally update the design philosophies rather than exhaustive methods. Herein, we exerted an external electric field in the CoPc/MoS2 heterojunction to finely manipulate the intermolecular charge transfer. The injected charges (e&#8722;) from CoPc to MoS2 will migrate to natural S vacancies and enhance the Mo&#8722;H bonding. Moreover, the bandgap of MoS2 and CoPc can be readily tuned by the electric field, verifying band engineering at the heterointerface. The in&#8208;situ photoluminescence spectra and the gate&#8208;dependent electrochemical measurement discover the linear correlation between the charge accumulation and HER activity. This approach provides a new fingerpost for catalysts design, enabling precise regulation of the electronic configuration to improve catalytic activity</dc:description>

         <title>A Valence&#8208;Engineered Self&#8208;Cascading Antioxidant Nanozyme for the Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antioxidant treatment strategy by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a highly effective disease treatment option. Nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities can cope with the diverse ROS environment. However, lack of design strategies and limitation of negative correlation for nanozymes with multiple antioxidant activities hindered their development. To overcome these difficulties, here we used ZnMn  2  O  4  as a model to explore the role of Mn valency at the octahedral site via a valence&#8208;engineered strategy, and found that its multiple antioxidant activities are positively correlated with the content of Mn  4+  . Therefore, through this strategy, a self&#8208;cascading antioxidant nanozyme LiMn  2  O  4  was constructed, and its efficacy was verified at the cellular level and in an inflammatory bowel disease model. This work not only provides guidance for the design of multiple antioxidant nanozymes, but also broadens the biomedical application potential of multiple antioxidant nanozymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Soft Electrodes for Electrochemical and Electrophysiological Monitoring of Beating Cardiomyocytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many cells in vivo have their inherent motions, which involve numerous biochemical and biophysical  signals synergistically regulating cell behaviors and functions. However, existing methods offer little information about the concurrently chemical and physical responses of dynamically pulsing cells. Here, we report a soft electrode with electrospun poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)&#8208;based nanomesh to fully comply with spontaneous motions of cells. Moreover, this electrode demonstrated excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical performance and cellular biocompatibility. Cardiomyocytes cultured thereon exhibited autonomous and rhythmic contractility, and synchronously induced mechanical deformation of the underlying electrode, which allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of nitric oxide release and electrophysiological activity of cardiomyocytes. This work provides a promising way toward recording chemical and electrical signals of biological systems with their natural motions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Chemical Crosslinking for Profiling RNA&#8208;Protein Interactions in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic interactions between RNAs and proteins play crucial roles in regulating diverse cellular processes. Proteome&#8208;wide characterization of these interactions in their native cellular context remains desirable but challenging. Herein, we developed a photocatalytic crosslinking (PhotoCAX) strategy coupled with mass spectrometry (PhotoCAX&#8208;MS) and RNA sequencing (PhotoCAX&#8208;seq) for the study of the composition and dynamics of protein&#8208;RNA interactions. By integrating the blue light&#8208;triggered photocatalyst with a dual&#8208;functional RNA&#8208;protein crosslinker (RP&#8208;linker) and the phase separation&#8208;based enrichment strategy, PhotoCAX&#8208;MS revealed a total of 2,044 RBPs in human HEK293 cells. We further employed PhotoCAX to investigate the dynamic change of RBPome in macrophage cells upon LPS&#8208;stimulation, as well as the identification of RBPs interacting directly with the 5&#8217;untranslated regions of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfur in Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfur has been important in dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) since the beginning of the field. Mainly as part of disulfides and thioesters, dynamic sulfur&#8208;based bonds (DSBs) have a leading role in several remarkable reactions. Part of this success is due to the almost ideal properties of DSBs for the preparation of dynamic covalent systems, including high reactivity and good reversibility under mild aqueous conditions, the possibility of exploiting supramolecular interactions, access to isolable structures and easy experimental control to turn the reaction on/off. DCC is currently witnessing an increase in the importance of DSBs. The chemical flexibility offered by DSBs opens the door to multiple applications. This review presents an overview of all the DSBs used in DCC, their applications, and remarks on the interesting properties that they confer on dynamic chemical systems, especially those containing several DSBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically Bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Plate Z&#8208;Scheme Junction with Strong Internal Electric Field for Selective Photo&#8208;oxidation of Aromatic Alcohols</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route, which provides a powerful driving force, abundant atomic&#8208;level charge flow highways and a decreased energy barrier for directional migration and spatial separation of photocharges, greatly improving the photocatalytic activity for selective photo&#8208;oxidation of aromatic alcohols.







Abstract
Inferior contact interface and low charge transfer efficiency seriously restrict the performance of heterojunctions. Herein, chemically bonded &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl (M=Nb, Ta) dot&#8208;on&#8208;plate Z&#8208;scheme junctions with strong internal electric field are crafted by an in situ growth route. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the internal electric field provides a powerful driving force for vectorial migration of photocharges between Bi4MO8Cl and &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, and the interfacial Fe&#8722;O bond not only serves as an atomic&#8208;level charge flow highway but also lowers the charge transfer energy barrier, thereby accelerating Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and realizing effective spatial charge separation. Impressively, &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Bi4MO8Cl manifests a significantly improved photocatalytic activity for selective oxidation of aromatic alcohols into aldehydes (Con. &#8805;92&#8201;%, Sel. &#8805;96&#8201;%), with a performance improvement of one to two orders of magnitude. This work presents atomic&#8208;level insight into interfacial charge flow steering.

         <title>Syntheses of Covalent Organic Frameworks via a One&#8208;Pot Suzuki Coupling and Schiff's Base Reaction for C2H4/C3H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;pot strategy is used to prepare covalent organic frameworks (COFs) via a Suzuki coupling reaction and Schiff's base reaction by using diamino&#8208;aryl halide and dialdehyde aryl&#8208;borate compounds as monomers. The resulting COFs are used for C2H4/C3H6 separation. This work provides a novel modular approach involving irreversible coupling reactions for constructing COF materials.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) featuring permanent porosity, designable topologies, and tailorable functionalities have attracted great interest in the past two decades. Developing efficient modular approaches to rationally constructing COFs from a set of molecules via covalent linking has been long pursued. Herein, we report a facile one&#8208;pot strategy to prepare COFs via an irreversible Suzuki coupling reaction followed by a reversible Schiff's base reaction without the need for intermediate isolation. Gram&#8208;scale ordered frameworks with kgm topology and rich porosities can be obtained by using diamino&#8208;aryl halide and dialdehyde aryl&#8208;borate compounds as monomers. The resultant microporous CR&#8208;COFs were used for efficient C2H4/C3H6 separation. This strategy reduces the waste generated and efforts consumed by stepwise reactions and relative purification processes, making the large&#8208;scale syntheses of stable COFs feasible. Moreover, it offers a novel modular approach to designing COF materials.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Phase Magnetic Mechanistic Study of Ni&#8208;Seamed Pyrogallol[4]arene Nanocapsules Reveal Presence of Novel Cylindrical and Spherical Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First solution&#8208;phase magnetic study of Ni&#8208;seamed pyrogallol4]arene leads to the discovery of novel hydrogen&#8208;bonded 8&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius dimeric sphere, Ni&#8208;seamed 13&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius sphere and a Ni&#8208;seamed 11&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius tubular nanoassemblies.







Abstract
The magnetic properties of nickel&#8208;seamed C&#8208;pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC3Ni) hexamers and dimers are studied for the first time in solution. The combination of small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer measurements of the solution species reveal their paramagnetic and weakly antiferromagnetic behaviour. Surprisingly, the magnetic results indicated the presence of an unprecedented 13&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius species, larger than both the dimeric and hexameric nanocapsules with both octahedral and square&#8208;planar metal centers. To confirm the presence of this novel species, we performed a mechanistic study of PgC3Ni as a function of temperature and solvent and deduced the presence of two additional new species: a) an 11&#8197;&#197; cylinder with Ni atoms seaming the tubular framework and b) an 8&#8197;&#197;&#8208;radius sphere with non&#8208;interacting Ni centers located within the internal cavity. Select parameters that shift the equilibrium towards desired species are also identified.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnetic properties of nickel-seamed &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;-pyrogallol[4]arene (PgC&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Ni) hexamers and dimers are studied for the first time in solution.

         <title>Bifunctionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Pore&#8208;Size&#8208;Dependent Enantioselective Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porosity is fundamental in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) but has always been underestimated for luminescent sensing applications. A simple and general synthetic strategy was developed for isoreticular MOFs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes, which revealed the fundamentals of the pore effect in luminescent sensors.







Abstract
Porosity is a fundamental property of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the role of the pore size has always been underestimated in MOF&#8208;based luminescent sensors for enantioselective sensing. The construction of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOFs) with variable pore sizes and the synergy between chirality and luminescence is challenging. Herein, a general strategy was developed to introduce chirality into two well&#8208;known IRMOF&#8208;74 analogs with nanochannels of identical shapes but different pore sizes by functionalizing the open metal site under mild conditions. To enhance the detection accuracy, a second luminescent center was introduced into the IRMOF&#8208;74 system to achieve ratiometric sensing. The two bifunctionalized IRMOF&#8208;74 compounds exhibited pore&#8208;size&#8208;dependent sensing performance for enantiomers. This study not only provides a convenient method to construct chiral MOFs as advanced sensing materials but also reveals the fundamental of the pores in MOF&#8208;based luminescent sensors.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;Surfactant Assemblies: Responsiveness to Orthogonal Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalently modifying a polyoxometalate with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin has led to the formation of a polyoxometalate/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin hybrid. The hybrid, when dissolved in water, can assemble at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces with ligands dissolved in toluene, thereby generating polyoxometalate surfactants (POMSs) with pH, redox or guest&#8211;competitive responsiveness.







Abstract
Integrating different types of supramolecular interactions opens the possibility to generate nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface that are responsive to multiple stimuli. Here we develop a covalently modified polyoxometalate/&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (POM/&#946;&#8208;CD) organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid, consisting of a negatively charged POM cluster with &#946;&#8208;CD host groups. The POM/&#946;&#8208;CD hybrid can be dispersed in water and interacts at a water/oil interface with ligands dissolved in an oil phase through electrostatic or host&#8211;guest interactions, thereby generating POM&#8208;surfactants (POMSs) having pH, redox, and guest&#8208;competitive responsiveness, respectively. By taking advantage of the jamming of POMSs at the interface, a reconfigurable all&#8208;liquid system could be produced that is responsive to orthogonal changes in the external environment.

         <title>Fluorescent Organic &#960;&#8208;Radicals Stabilized with Boron: Featuring a SOMO&#8211;LUMO Electronic Transition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy of emissive and stable &#960;&#8208;radicals is established based on incorporation of a boron atom at a position distant from the radical center. SOMO&#8211;LUMO electronic transition in the boron&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;radicals gives rise to intense red fluorescence, irrespective of solvent polarity, different from donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;type emissive &#960;&#8208;radicals.







Abstract
We report on the fluorescence properties of a new class of emissive and stable &#960;&#8208;radicals that contain a boron atom at a position distant from the radical center. A fully planarized derivative exhibited an intense red fluorescence with high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;F &gt;0.67) even in polar solvents. To elucidate the origin of this phenomenon, we synthesized another boron&#8208;stabilized radical that contains a bulky aryl group on the boron atom. A comparison of these derivatives, as well as with conventional donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A)&#8208;type emissive &#960;&#8208;radicals, unveiled several characteristic features in their photophysical properties. A theoretical analysis revealed that the SOMO&#8211;LUMO electronic transition generates an emissive D1 state. Unlike conventional D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;radicals, this state does not undergo significant structural relaxation. The boron&#8208;stabilized &#960;&#8208;radicals demonstrated promising potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes as an emitting material.

         <title>Direct and Simultaneous Identification of Multiple Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species in Living Cells Using a SERS Borrowing Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A SERS&#8208;borrowing&#8208;strategy&#8208;based Au@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoprobe (Au@Pt NP) was developed for simultaneous and direct spectroscopic detection and identification of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS). Triphenylphosphine&#8208;functionalized Au@Pt&#8208;TPP NPs were able to locate to the mitochondria for the detection and identification of different mitochondrial ROS simultaneously in living cells under oxidative stress.







Abstract
Identification of different mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) simultaneously in living cells is vital for understanding the critical roles of different ROS in biological processes. To date, it remains a great challenge to develop ROS probes for direct and simultaneous identification of multiple ROS with high specificity. Herein, we report a SERS&#8208;borrowing&#8208;strategy&#8208;based nanoprobe (Au@Pt core&#8211;shell nanoparticles) for simultaneous and direct identification of different ROS by their distinct Raman fingerprints. Isotope substitution experiments and DFT calculations confirmed the ability of Au@Pt nanoprobe to capture and identify different mitochondrial ROS (i.e. &#8901;OOH, H2O2, and &#8901;OH). When functionalized with triphenylphosphine (TPP), the Au@Pt&#8208;TPP nanoprobe located to mitochondria and detected multiple ROS simultaneously in living cells under oxidative stimulation. Our method offers a new tool for the study of the functions of various ROS in biological processes.

         <dc:description>
Silver ions, olefin carriers, are generally vulnerable to hydrogen present in olefin/paraffin mixture feed. Ionic liquid solubilizes and stabilizes silver ion carriers for olefins by forming aggregates. The aggregates significantly enhance carrier stability against reduction by hydrogen.







Abstract
Separation of olefins from their paraffin analogs relies on energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation. Facilitated transport&#8208;based membranes that reversibly and selectively bind olefins, but not paraffins, could save considerable amounts of energy. However, the chemical instability of the silver ion olefin&#8208;binding carriers in such membranes has been a longstanding roadblock for this approach. We discovered long&#8208;term carrier stability against extended exposure to hydrogen, a common contaminant in such streams. Based on UV/Vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy, along with XRD analysis results, certain ionic liquids solubilize silver ions, and anion aggregates surrounding the silver ion carriers greatly attenuate their reduction by hydrogen. Here, we report the stability of olefin/paraffin separation properties under continuous exposure to high pressure hydrogen, which addresses a critical technical roadblock in membrane&#8208;based olefin/paraffin separation.

Significant oxygen reduction reaction reactivity enhancements are observed when aqueous solutions containing iron oxide clusters {Fe28} are used as electrolyte. Mechanistic, experimental and theoretical studies explore possible roles of this polyion in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key energy conversion process, which is critical for the efficient operation of fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries. Here, we report the significant enhancement of the ORR&#8208;performance of commercial platinum&#8208;on&#8208;carbon electrocatalysts when operated in aqueous electrolyte solutions (pH&#8197;5.6), containing the polyoxoanion [Fe28(&#956;3&#8208;O)8(L&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;tart)16(CH3COO)24]20&#8722;. Mechanistic studies provide initial insights into the performance&#8208;improving role of the iron oxide cluster during ORR. Technological deployment of the system is demonstrated by incorporation into a direct formate microfluidic fuel cell (DFMFC), where major performance increases are observed when compared with reference electrolytes. The study provides the first examples of iron oxide clusters in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Hydrogen Isotope Effects on Aqueous Electrolyte for Electrochemical Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical isotope effects between heavy water (D2O) and light water (H2O) were revealed to shed light on rational electrolyte design towards the realization of high&#8208;performance aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
As two stable hydrogen isotopes, protium and deuterium show magnified isotope effects in physicochemical properties due to the significantly varied atomic masses. In this work, aqueous electrolytes based on heavy water (D2O) and light water (H2O) were prepared to reveal the electrochemical isotope effects between the hydrogen isotopes. The covalent hydrogen&#8211;oxygen bond and intermolecular hydrogen bond in D2O are much stronger than those in H2O, making them thermodynamically more stable. Compared with the H2O&#8208;based electrolyte, the D2O&#8208;based electrolyte shows a broader electrochemical window, a higher percentage of coordinated water and a longer lifetime of hydrogen bond. Because of the above electrochemical isotope effects, the D2O&#8208;based electrolyte shows high anodic stability against operation of high&#8208;voltage layered oxide cathode materials including LiCoO2 and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, which enables long cycle life and favorable rate performance of aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A New Cation&#8208;Ordered Structure Type with Multiple Thermal Redistributions in Co2InSbO6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corundum&#8208;derived Co2InSbO6 undergoes an unprecedented sequence of cation rearrangements on heating, from a previously unreported ordered&#8208;R32 type distribution to two successive ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 type arrangements.







Abstract
Cation ordering in solids is important for controlling physical properties and leads to ilmenite (FeTiO3) and LiNbO3 type derivatives of the corundum structure, with ferroelectricity resulting from breaking of inversion symmetry in the latter. However, a hypothetical third ABO3 derivative with R32 symmetry has never been observed. Here we show that Co2InSbO6 recovered from high pressure has a new, ordered&#8208;R32 A2BCO6 variant of the corundum structure. Co2InSbO6 is also remarkable for showing two cation redistributions, to (Co0.5In0.5)2CoSbO6 and then Co2InSbO6 variants of the ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 A2BCO6 structure on heating. The cation distributions change magnetic properties as the final ordered&#8208;LiNbO3 product has a sharp ferrimagnetic transition unlike the initial ordered&#8208;R32 phase. Future syntheses of metastable corundum derivatives at pressure are likely to reveal other cation&#8208;redistribution pathways, and may enable ABO3 materials with the R32 structure to be discovered.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on Ordered Silicon Nanowire Array Photocathodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction on an Au&#8208;decorated ordered silicon nanowire (O_SiNW) array photocathode provides a new path to green ammonia production with an outstanding Faradaic efficiency at low overpotentials using solar energy.







Abstract
As a new path to &#8220;green&#8221; ammonia production, photoelectrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (PEC NO3RR) is investigated for the first time. An Au&#8208;decorated ordered silicon nanowire (O_SiNW) array photocathode demonstrates 95.6&#8201;% of Faradaic efficiency (FE) to ammonia at 0.2&#8197;VRHE, which represents a more positive potential than the thermodynamic reduction potential of nitrate by utilizing photovoltage. The high FE is possible because both Si and Au surfaces are inactive for competing water reduction to hydrogen. The O_SiNW array structure is favorable to promote the PEC NO3RR relative to planar Si or randomly&#8208;grown Si nanowire, by enabling the uniform distribution of small Au nanoparticles as an electrocatalyst and facilitating the mass transport during the reaction. The results demonstrate the feasibility of PEC nitrate conversion to ammonia and would motivate further studies and developments.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer State in Spiro Compact Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads Based on Pyromellitimide&#8208;Derived Rhodamine: Charge Transfer Dynamics and Electron Spin Polarization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyad is prepared by linking the electron donor and acceptor via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the electron donor and acceptor is completely inhibited, the dyad shows a long&#8208;lived 3CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s) with a high energy level (ca. 2.61&#8197;eV), the electron spin multiplicity of the CT state was confirmed with time&#8208;resolved EPR spectra.







Abstract
We observed a long&#8208;lived charge transfer (CT) state in a novel orthogonal compact electron donor&#8211;acceptor dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and pyromellitimide (PI),or thionated PI, as electron acceptor. The two parts in the dyads are connected via a spiro quaternary carbon atom, thus the torsion between the donor and acceptor is completely inhibited, which is beneficial to reduce the reorganization energy and to exploit the Marcus inverted region effect to prolong the CT state lifetime. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra show that the charge separation is rather fast, while nanosecond transient absorption spectra confirmed the formation of long&#8208;lived CT state (2.6&#8197;&#956;s). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra determined the spin multiplicity of the long living state and assigned it to a 3CT state. Replacement of an oxygen atom in the PI part with a sulfur atom favoring classical intersystem crossing processes, causes a consistently shortening of the lifetime of the 3CT state (0.29&#8197;&#956;s).

         <title>LiNbO3&#8208;Type Polar Antiferromagnet InVO3 Synthesized under High&#8208;Pressure Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InVO3 was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO3&#8208;type structure under high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions. The high&#8208;pressure InVO3 phase is a potential multiferroic exhibiting polarization and magnetic ordering.







Abstract
The ambient pressure cation disordered InVO3 bixbyite has been predicted to form a GdFeO3&#8208;type perovskite phase under high pressure and high temperature. Contrary to the expectation, InVO3 was found to crystallize in the polar LiNbO3&#8208;type structure with a calculated spontaneous polarization as large as 74&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Antiferromagnetic coupling of V3+ magnetic moments and a cooperative magnetic ground state below about 10&#8197;K coupled with a polar structure suggest an intriguing ground state of the novel LiNbO3&#8208;type high&#8208;pressure InVO3 structure.

         <title>The Mechanochemistry of Carboranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed o&#8208;carborane as a new mechanophore that possesses an unexpected combination of force&#8208;free stability and force&#8208;coupled activity. By contrast, m&#8208;carborane, which has a different regiochemistry maintained its high mechanical stability. This fundamental research straightforwardly presents new insights into the remarkable &#8220;expandability of the C&#8722;C covalent bond&#8221; in o&#8208;carborane by applying external force stimuli.







Abstract
We developed o&#8208;carborane as a new mechanophore by showing that the o&#8208;carborane cluster is the preferred scission site in chain&#8208;centered polymers through ultrasonication mechanochemistry. Mechanistic studies are consistent with a predominately homolytic mechanism of chain scission. The mechanically generated monocarbaborane fragments are highly reactive toward alcohol nucleophiles. By contrast, carborane with a different regiochemistry (m&#8208;carborane) maintained its high mechanical stability. DFT simulations provide insights into the origins of carborane's mechanical lability. This fundamental research provides a new stimulus for carborane cage activation.

         <title>Ferroelectric Polymer Drives Performance Enhancement of Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of ferroelectric polymer polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) as additive into non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells substantially enhances the built&#8208;in electric field. The promoted exciton separation, significantly accelerated charge transport, reduced the charge recombination, as well as the optimized film morphology were observed in the device, leading to a significantly improved device performance.







Abstract
Enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field to promote charge dynamitic process is of great significance to boost the performance of the non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs), which has rarely been concerned. In this work, we introduced a cheap ferroelectric polymer as an additive into the active layers of non&#8208;fullerene OSCs to improve the device performance. An additional and permanent electrical field was produced by the polarization of the ferroelectric dipoles, which can substantially enhance the built&#8208;in electric field. The promoted exciton separation, significantly accelerated charge transport, reduced the charge recombination, as well as the optimized film morphology were observed in the device, leading to a significantly improved performance of the PVDF&#8208;modified OSCs with various active layers, such as PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9, PM6&#8201;:&#8201;IT&#8208;4F and PTB7&#8208;Th&#8201;:&#8201;Y6. Especially, a record efficiency of 17.72&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;Y6&#8208;based OSC and an outstanding efficiency of 18.17&#8201;% for PM6&#8201;:&#8201;BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSC were achieved.

         <title>Robust Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Passivation for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crosslinked and compact membrane is constructed throughout the perovskite film by a self&#8208;assembly strategy based on cholesterol&#8208;based molecules. This enables durable passivation against harsh conditions and effective defects passivation from surface toward inner grain boundaries. The modified planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit a 23.34&#8201;% champion efficiency and remain almost unchanged after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h.







Abstract
Defect passivation via post&#8208;treatment of perovskite films is an effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the passivation durability is still an issue due to the weak and vulnerable bonding between passivating functional groups and perovskite defect sites. Here we propose a cholesterol derivative self&#8208;assembly strategy to construct crosslinked and compact membranes throughout perovskite films. These supramolecular membranes act as a robust protection layer against harsh operational conditions while providing effective passivation of defects from surface toward inner grain boundaries. The resultant PSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 23.34&#8201;% with an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.164&#8197;eV. The unencapsulated devices retain 92&#8201;% of their initial efficiencies after 1600&#8197;h of storage under ambient conditions, and remain almost unchanged after heating at 85&#8201;&#176;C for 500&#8197;h in a nitrogen atmosphere, showing significantly improved stability.

         <title>Enhancing Circulation and Tumor Accumulation of Carboplatin via an Erythrocyte&#8208;Anchored Prodrug Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carboplatin&#8208;based platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes is reported. The as&#8208;prepared prodrug ERY1&#8208;PtIV has a prolonged circulatory half&#8208;life, enhanced tumor accumulation, and improved antitumor effect compared to carboplatin in vivo via this erythrocyte&#8208;anchored strategy.







Abstract
The short circulatory half&#8208;lives and low tumor accumulation of carboplatin greatly limit the drug's efficacy in vivo. Herein, we address these challenges by using a prodrug strategy and present the rational design of a novel platinum(IV) anticancer prodrug that can hitchhike on erythrocytes. This prodrug, designated as ERY1&#8208;PtIV, can bind to erythrocytes efficiently and stably, possessing a circulatory half&#8208;life 18.5&#8197;times longer than that of carboplatin in mice. This elongated circulatory half&#8208;life enables platinum to accumulate at levels 7.7&#8197;times higher than with carboplatin, with steady levels in the tumors. As a consequence, the ERY1&#8208;PtIV prodrug is proved to exhibit significantly enhanced antitumor activity and reduced side effects compared with carboplatin. Collectively, our novel approach highlights an efficient strategy to utilize intrinsic erythrocytes as auto&#8208;binding carriers to enhance the tumor accumulation and subsequent antitumor efficacy of platinum drugs.

         <title>Controlling Thermal Expansion in Supramolecular Halogen&#8208;Bonded Mixed Cocrystals through Synthetic Feed and Dynamic Motion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy has been developed for controlling thermal expansion using a mixed cocrystal approach, wherein thermal expansion is tuned by controlling the synthetic feed and functionality of the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor molecules. The appearance and composition of the bulk material is similar across the series, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray diffraction and SEM&#8208;EDS; however, expansion behaviors differ due to the dynamic motion ability of the acceptor molecules.







Abstract
Control over thermal expansion (TE) behaviors in solid materials is often accomplished by modifying the molecules or intermolecular interactions within the solid. Here, we use a mixed cocrystal approach and incorporate molecules with similar chemical structures, but distinct functionalities. Development of mixed cocrystals is at a nascent stage, and here we describe the first mixed cocrystals sustained by one&#8208;dimensional halogen bonds. Within each mixed cocrystal, the halogen&#8208;bond donor is fixed, while the halogen&#8208;bond acceptor site contains two molecules in a variable ratio. X&#8208;ray diffraction demonstrates isostructurality across the series, and SEM&#8208;EDS shows equal distribution of heavy atoms and similar atomic compositions across all mixed cocrystals. The acceptor molecules differ in their ability to undergo dynamic motion in the solid state. The synthetic equivalents of motion capable and incapable molecules were systematically varied to yield direct tunabililty in TE behavior.

         <title>Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acids Derivatives via a Spin&#8208;Center Shift</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DMAP&#8208;boryl radical breaks the &#945;&#8722;C&#8722;O bond of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides and esters via a spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) mechanism, enabling the facile conversion of abundantly available and/or naturally occurring &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acids to value&#8208;added alkylated products.







Abstract
A strategically distinct dehydroxylative alkylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives with alkenes is developed. The reaction starts with the attack of a 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)&#8208;boryl radical to the carbonyl oxygen atom, followed by a spin&#8208;center shift (SCS) to trigger the C&#8722;O bond scission. The resulting &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radicals couple with a wide range of alkenes to furnish various alkylated products. This strategy allows for the efficient conversion of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides and esters derived from several biomass molecules and natural products to value&#8208;added compounds. Experimental and computational studies verified the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Cobalt/Salox&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C&#8722;H Functionalization of Arylphosphinamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective C&#8722;H annulation of arylphosphinamides with alkynes and allenes using a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalyst is reported. This new methodology provides an efficient approach for the synthesis of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds with excellent enantioselectivities (45 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Previous methods on CoIII&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8722;H activation rely on the use of tailor&#8208;made cyclopentadienyl&#8208;ligated CoIII complexes, which require lengthy steps for the preparation. Herein, we report an unprecedented enantioselective C&#8722;H functionalization enabled by a simple cobalt/salicyloxazoline (Salox) catalysis. The chiral Salox ligands can be easily prepared in one step from salicylonitrile and chiral amino alcohols. A broad range of P&#8208;stereogenic compounds were synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities (45 examples, up to 99&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;% ee). The isolation and characterization of several intermediates provided insights into the generation of active catalytic cobalt species, the action of Salox, and the mode of stereocontrol.

         <title>Steering Self&#8208;Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional Iptycenes on Au(111) by Tuning Molecule&#8208;Surface Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivation of Au(111) with an iodine monolayer provides effective means to steer the adsorption of three&#8208;dimensional (f)antrip molecules. The stronger interaction on pristine Au(111) favours adsorption with two anthracene blades flat, promoting self&#8208;assembly of a densely packed structure. By contrast, on passivated Au(111) f(antrip) adsorbs with its three anthracene blades edge&#8208;on, giving rise to self&#8208;assembly of a porous structure.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of three&#8208;dimensional molecules is scarcely studied on surfaces. Their modes of adsorption can exhibit far greater variability compared to (nearly) planar molecules that adsorb mostly flat on surfaces. This additional degree of freedom can have decisive consequences for the expression of intermolecular binding motifs, hence the formation of supramolecular structures. The determining molecule&#8208;surface interactions can be widely tuned, thereby providing a new powerful lever for crystal engineering in two dimensions. Here, we study the self&#8208;assembly of triptycene derivatives with anthracene blades on Au(111) by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, Near Edge X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure and Density Functional Theory. The impact of molecule&#8208;surface interactions was experimentally tested by comparing pristine with iodine&#8208;passivated Au(111) surfaces. Thereby, we observed a fundamental change of the adsorption mode that triggered self&#8208;assembly of an entirely different structure.

         <title>Investigation of the Molecular Landscape of Bacterial Aromatic Polyketides by Global Analysis of Type&#8197;II Polyketide Synthases</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The global distribution and structural diversity of bacterial aromatic polyketides were assessed by pan&#8208;genomic analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. Such a global atlas will guide genome mining efforts to fully exploit natural products, as exemplified by the discovery of the unusual angular naphthopyrans from a rare actinobacterium.







Abstract
Aromatic polyketides biosynthesized by microorganisms are a prominent class of natural products widely used in clinical treatments. Although genome mining approaches have accelerated the discovery of these molecules, the molecular diversity, abundance, and distribution of bacterial aromatic polyketides at a global scale remain elusive. Here, we provide a global atlas of bacterial aromatic polyketides based on large&#8208;scale analysis of type&#8197;II polyketide synthases. We first established the chain length factor protein as a marker that can predict both chemical class and molecular uniqueness of the biosynthetic product, and analyzed the abundance, taxonomic distribution, estimated structural diversity, and the total number of aromatic polyketides in bacteria. We further show the identification of oryzanaphthopyrans with an unprecedented angular naphthopyran scaffold from a rare actinobacterium by genome mining guided by the global atlas. These results serve as a compass for exploiting the entire type&#8197;II polyketide synthase&#8208;derived aromatic polyketides in bacteria.

         <title>Triggering near&#8208;infrared luminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine by charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;state dependent &#8220;on&#8208;off&#8221; molecular photo&#8208;switches are of present interest for novel optoelectronics. We have used mass&#8208;selective ion beam deposition into solid Ne at 5&#8197;K to compare the spectral properties of vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc&#8901;) with its singly charged cation. Electron detachment from VOPc&#8901; leads to a diradical cation (VOPc+..) which shows profound NIR photoluminescence. By contrast, VOPc&#8901; is essentially non&#8208;emissive.







Abstract
Probing electrofluorochromism (EFC) at the molecular level remains challenging. Here we study the strongly charge state&#8208;dependent photoluminescence of vanadyl phthalocyanine. We report vibrationally resolved absorption and laser&#8208;induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of samples comprising both the mass&#8208;selected neutral molecule (VOPc&#8901;, a stable radical) and its cation produced upon electron ionization (EI) isolated in 5&#8197;K neon matrices. Ionization of the essentially non&#8208;emissive VOPc&#8901; forms a high&#8208;spin diradical cation (VOPc+..) which shows profound photoluminescence (PL) in the NIR range. This unique phenomenon is potentially of interest for NIR&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;optic devices.

         <title>Chemiexcitation&#8208;Triggered Prodrug Activation for Targeted Carbon Monoxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new prodrug strategy, namely chemiexcitation triggered prodrug activation, is proposed herein to achieve targeted CO delivery to the tumor site. The CO release from a photoresponsive CO prodrug is activated by chemical energy transfer instead of by UV irradiation. As such, the inherent limitations with light irradiation are perfectly addressed.







Abstract
Photolysis&#8208;based prodrug strategy can address some critical drug delivery issues, which otherwise are very challenging to tackle with traditional prodrug strategy. However, the need for external light irradiation significantly hampers its in vivo application due to the poor light accessibility of deep tissue. Herein, we propose a new strategy of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation, wherein a photoresponsive prodrug is excited for drug payload release by chemiexcitation instead of photoirradiation. As such, the bond&#8208;cleavage power of photolysis can be employed to address some critical drug delivery issues while obviating the need for external light irradiation. We have established the proof of concept by the successful development of a chemiexcitation responsive carbon monoxide delivery platform, which exhibited specific CO release at the tumor site and pronounced tumor suppression effects. We anticipate that such a concept of chemiexcitation&#8208;triggered prodrug activation can be leveraged for the targeted delivery of other small molecule&#8208;based drug payloads.

         <title>The Limited Palette for Photonic Block&#8208;Copolymer Materials: A Historical Problem or a Practical Limitation?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of block&#8208;copolymers into photonic films and pigments has drawn significant attention due to the tunability of the optical response. In this Scientific Perspective we identify and rationalize the limited range of monomers and polymerization methods employed to produce such structurally colored materials to date. By considering historical development and practical limitations, new strategies are proposed to inspire new research directions.







Abstract
Block&#8208;copolymer self&#8208;assembly has proven to be an effective route for the fabrication of photonic films and, more recently, photonic pigments. However, despite extensive research on this topic over the past two decades, the palette of monomers and polymers employed to produce such structurally colored materials has remained surprisingly limited. In this Scientific Perspective, the commonly used block&#8208;copolymer systems reported in the literature are summarized (considering both linear and brush architectures) and their use is rationalized from the point of view of both their historical development and physicochemical constraints. Finally, the current challenges facing the field are discussed and promising new areas of research are highlighted to inspire the community to pursue new directions.

         <title>Integrating Unexpected High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility and Low&#8208;Threshold Lasing Action in an Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic semiconductor, 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2) was designed and synthesized. Comprehensive characterizations demonstrate that LD&#8208;2 combines the properties of high charge carrier mobility of 2.7&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and superior lasing characteristics (low threshold of Eth=9.43&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Eth=9.93&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at the peaks of 420&#8197;nm and 443&#8197;nm), which demonstrates promising potential for integrated optoelectronic device applications.







Abstract
Integrating high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and low&#8208;threshold lasing action in an organic semiconductor is crucial for the realization of an electrically pumped laser, but remains a great challenge. Herein, we present an organic semiconductor, named as 2,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (LD&#8208;2), which shows an unexpected high charge&#8208;carrier mobility of 2.7&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and low&#8208;threshold lasing characteristic of 9.43&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 9.93&#8197;&#956;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and high&#8208;quality factor (Q) of 2131 and 1684 at emission peaks of 420 and 443&#8197;nm, respectively. Detailed theoretical calculations and photophysical data analysis demonstrate that a large intermolecular transfer integral of 10.36&#8211;45.16&#8197;meV together with a fast radiative transition rate of 8.0&#215;108&#8197;s&#8722;1 are responsible for the achievement of the superior integrated optoelectronic properties in the LD&#8208;2 crystal. These optoelectronic performances of LD&#8208;2 are among the highest reported low&#8208;threshold lasing organic semiconductors with efficient charge transport, suggesting its promise for research of electrically pumped organic lasers (EPOLs).

         <title>Photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;Cycloadditions of Alkenylboronates and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A process for the synthesis of cyclobutylboronates by [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition is presented. The reaction is enabled by triplet energy transfer to an alkenylboronate, which is an underexplored photochemical process. The process operates with a wide array of alkenylboronates and alkenes to generate a diverse range of products. The utility of the products is demonstrated in the synthesis of melicodenine&#8197;C.







Abstract
A new strategy for the synthesis of highly versatile cyclobutylboronates via the photosensitized [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of alkenylboronates and alkenes is presented. The process is mechanistically different from other processes in that energy transfer occurs with the alkenylboronate as opposed to the other alkene. This strategy allows for the synthesis of an array of diverse cyclobutylboronates. The conversion of these adducts to other compounds as well as their utility in the synthesis of melicodenine&#8197;C is demonstrated.

         <title>Reaction Rate Acceleration of Cooperative Catalytic Systems: Metal Nanoparticles and Lewis Acids in Arene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arene hydrogenation was greatly accelerated by a cooperative catalytic system that consisted of heterogeneous Rh&#8208;Pt nanoparticles and Lewis acids. Remarkably, particularly challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents could be smoothly hydrogenated.







Abstract
Employing two distinct catalysts in one reaction medium synergistically is a powerful strategy for activating less reactive substrates. Although the approach has been well&#8208;developed in homogeneous conditions, it remains challenging and rare in heterogeneous catalysis, especially under gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid multiphase reaction conditions. Here, we describe the development of cooperative and synergistic catalyst systems of heterogeneous Rh&#8208;Pt bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts, Rh&#8208;Pt/DMPSi&#8208;Al2O3, and Sc(OTf)3 in the liquid phase for the hydrogenation of arenes under very mild conditions. Dramatic rate acceleration was achieved with cooperative activation. Remarkably, more challenging substrates that contained strong electron&#8208;donating groups and sterically hindered substituents were smoothly hydrogenated. Mechanistic insights into the cooperative activation of an aromatic substrate by heterogeneous metal nanoparticles and a soluble Lewis acid was obtained by kinetic studies and by direct observation of 1H and 45Sc NMR spectra.

         <title>Histidine&#8208;Mediated Ion Specific Effects Enable Salt Tolerance of a Pore&#8208;Forming Marine Antimicrobial Peptide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of density functional theory, synchrotron small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, mutational studies, and antimicrobial assays show that the histidine residues of a marine antimicrobial peptide coordinate sodium ions and the phosphate in headgroups of lipids to maintain the activity of the peptide at high salt concentrations. The placement of histidines in the &#945;&#8208;helical conformation of the peptide is critical.







Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) preferentially permeate prokaryotic membranes via electrostatic binding and membrane remodeling. Such action is drastically suppressed by high salt due to increased electrostatic screening, thus it is puzzling how marine AMPs can possibly work. We examine as a model system, piscidin&#8208;1, a histidine&#8208;rich marine AMP, and show that ion&#8208;histidine interactions play unanticipated roles in membrane remodeling at high salt: Histidines can simultaneously hydrogen&#8208;bond to a phosphate and coordinate with an alkali metal ion to neutralize phosphate charge, thereby facilitating multidentate bonds to lipid headgroups in order to generate saddle&#8208;splay curvature, a prerequisite to pore formation. A comparison among Na+, K+, and Cs+ indicates that histidine&#8208;mediated salt tolerance is ion specific. We conclude that histidine plays a unique role in enabling protein/peptide&#8208;membrane interactions that occur in marine or other high&#8208;salt environment.

         <title>Guided Synthesis of a Mo/Zn Dual Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Synergistic Effect and Peroxidase&#8208;like Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis strategy for a dual single&#8208;atom nanozyme has been developed by using a macroscopic polymer aerogel as the supporting substrate and supramolecular coordination complexes/polyoxometalates as the metal precursor. The nanozyme with high catalytic activity and super&#8208;long stability has been applied in the detection of various analytes including intracellular H2O2, glucose in serum, cholesterol, and ascorbic acid in commercial beverages.







Abstract
We present a facile route towards a dual single&#8208;atom nanozyme composed of Zn and Mo, which utilizes the non&#8208;covalent nano&#8208;assembly of polyoxometalates, supramolecular coordination complexes as the metal&#8208;atom precursor, and a macroscopic amphiphilic aerogel as the supporting substrate. The dual single&#8208;atoms of Zn and Mo have a high content (1.5 and 7.3&#8197;wt%, respectively) and exhibit a synergistic effect and a peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The Zn/Mo site was identified as the main active center by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation. The detection of versatile analytes, including intracellular H2O2, glucose in serum, cholesterol, and ascorbic acid in commercial beverages was achieved. The nanozyme has an outstanding stability and maintained its performance after one year's storage. This study develops a new peroxidase&#8208;like nanozyme and provides a robust synthetic strategy for single&#8208;atom catalysts by utilizing an aerogel as a facile substrate that is capable of stabilizing various metal atoms.

         <title>Cold Denaturation of Proteins in the Absence of Solvent: Implications for Protein Storage**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't put your protein in the &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C freezer: a well&#8208;known fact for biochemists and here it is demonstrated why this is right even in a vacuum. Variable&#8208;temperature ion mobility allows measurement of the structure of isolated proteins at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. For three isotypes of monoclonal antibody, it is found that there is substantial structural rearrangement at 250&#8197;K (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C), indicating a cold denaturation transition. At deep&#8208;freezing temperatures (&#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C) the structure is unaffected.







Abstract
The effect of temperature on the stability of proteins is well explored above 298&#8197;K, but harder to track experimentally below 273&#8197;K. Variable&#8208;temperature ion mobility mass spectrometry (VT IM&#8208;MS) allows us to measure the structure of molecules at sub&#8208;ambient temperatures. Here we monitor conformational changes that occur to two isotypes of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on cooling by measuring their collision cross sections (CCS) at discrete drift gas temperatures from 295 to 160&#8197;K. The CCS at 250&#8197;K is larger than predicted from collisional theory and experimental data at 295&#8197;K. This restructure is attributed to change in the strength of stabilizing intermolecular interactions. Below 250&#8197;K the CCS of the mAbs increases in line with prediction implying no rearrangement. Comparing data from isotypes suggest disulfide bridging influences thermal structural rearrangement. These findings indicate that in vacuo deep&#8208;freezing minimizes denaturation and maintains the native fold and VT IM&#8208;MS measurements at sub ambient temperatures provide new insights to the phenomenon of cold denaturation.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Spiroketals and Spiroaminals via Gold and Iridium Sequential Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective cascade reaction between racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)phenols and alkynols/alkynamides was realized by using a gold and iridium sequential catalytic system. In this procedure, the in situ&#8208;generated exocyclic vinyl ethers or enamides undergo the asymmetric allylation/spiroketalization with &#960;&#8208;ally&#8208;Ir amphiphilic species, which provides an efficient and straightforward access to spiroketals and spiroaminals with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, racemic 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines were also suitable in this reaction along with a kinetic resolution process, affording enantioenriched spiroaminals and 2&#8208;(1&#8208;hydroxyallyl)anilines in good yields. The synthetic utility of this method has been demonstrated by efficient enantioselective synthesis of the analogue of Paecilospirone.</dc:description>

         <title>Proteoform&#8208;Selective Imaging of Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unraveling the complexity of biological systems relies on the development of new approaches for spatially resolved proteoform&#8208;specific analysis of the proteome. Herein, we employ nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (nano&#8208;DESI MSI) for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of biological tissues. Nano&#8208;DESI generates multiply charged protein ions, which is advantageous for their structural characterization using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) directly on the tissue. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments demonstrate that nano&#8208;DESI MSI combined with on&#8208;tissue top&#8208;down proteomics is ideally suited for the proteoform&#8208;selective imaging of tissue sections. Using rat brain tissue as a model system, we provide the first evidence of differential proteoform expression in different regions of the brain.</dc:description>

         <title>Sulfone&#8208;Decorated Conjugated Organic Polymers Activate Oxygen for Photocatalytic Methane Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidizing CH  4  into liquid products with O  2  under mild conditions still mainly relies on metal catalysis. We prepared a series of sulfone&#8208;modified conjugated organic polymers and found that the catalyst with proper S(VI) content (0.10) could drive O  2  &#8594;H  2  O  2  &#8594;&#8226;OH to oxidize CH  4  into CH  3  OH and HCOOH directly and efficiently at room temperature under light irradiation. Experimental results showed that after 4 h reaction, decomposition rate and residual amounts of H  2  O  2  were 81.21% and 4.83 mmol g  cat  &#8208;1  respectively, and CH  4  conversion rate was 22.81%. Mechanism studies revealed that illumination could induce the homolytic dissociation of S=O bonds on catalyst to produce oxygen and sulfur radicals, where the &#8226;O could adsorb and activate CH  4  , and the &#8226;S could supply electrons for  1  O  2  to generate H  2  O  2  and then for decomposing the H  2  O  2  into &#8226;OH timely to oxidize CH  4  . This research provided a novel organic catalysis approach for oxygen activation and utilization.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed aminoalkynylation of electronically unbiased olefins with iodoalkynes is reported. The picolinamide auxiliary enables for the first time the  syn  &#8208;selective aminoalkynylation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trisubstituted alkenes to afford the corresponding pyrrolidines in up to 97% yield and as single diastereomers. Furthermore, through a C&#8211;H activation approach, the picolinamide allows the rapid synthesis of functionalized olefins, which are suitable cyclization precursors. Facile and orthogonal deprotection of the amides and Si  i  Pr  3  &#8208;acetylenes in the products, and a subsequent Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Free Copying of 12 Bases of RNA with Dinucleotides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of complementary strands is the reaction underlying the replication of genetic information. It is likely that the earliest self&#8208;replicating systems used RNA as genetic material. How RNA was copied in the absence of enzymes and what sequences were most likely to have supported replication is not clear.&#160; Here we show that mixtures of dinucleotides with C and G as bases copy an RNA sequence of up to 12 nucleotides in dilute aqueous solution. Successful enzyme&#8208;free copying occurred with  in situ  activation at 4 &#176;C and pH 6.0. Dimers were incorporated in favor of monomers when both competed as reactants, and little misincorporation was detectable in mass spectra. Simulations using experimental rate constants confirmed that mixed C/G sequences are good candidates for successful replication with dimers. Because dimers are intermediates in the synthesis of longer strands, our results support evolutionary scenarios encompassing formation and copying of RNA strands in enzyme&#8208;free fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping Active Site Geometry to Activity in Immobilized Frustrated Lewis Pair Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immobilization of molecular catalysts imposes spatial constraints on their active site. We reveal that in bifunctional catalysis such constraints can also be utilized as an appealing handle to boost intrinsic activity through judicious control of the active site geometry. To demonstrate this, we develop a pragmatic approach, based on nonlinear scaling relationships, to map the spatial arrangements of the acid&#8208;base components of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to their performance in the catalytic hydrogenation of CO_2. The resulting activity map shows that fixing the donor&#8208;acceptor centers at specific distances and locking them into appropriate orientations leads to an unforeseen many&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic activity of FLPs compared to their unconstrained counterparts.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Arene Ligand as Stereocontroller for Asymmetric C&#8208;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of chiral ligands is the most fundamental task in metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis. In the last 60 years, various kinds of ligands have been sophisticatedly developed. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge to develop practically useful chiral &#951;6&#8208;arene ligands, thereby seriously hampered the asymmetric synthesis promoted by arene&#8208;metal catalysts. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a class of readily tunable, C2 symmetric chiral arene ligands derived from [2.2]paracyclophane. Its ruthenium(II) complexes have been prepared and successfully applied in the enantioselective C&#8208;H activation to afford a series of axially chiral isoquinolones (up to 99% yield and 96% ee). This study not only lays chemists'&#160;longstanding doubts about whether it is possible to use chiral arene ligand to stereocontrol ruthenium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric C&#8208;H activation, but also opens up a new avenue to achieve asymmetric C&#8208;H activation.</dc:description>

Its ruthenium(II) complexes have been prepared and successfully applied in the enantioselective C-H activation to afford a series of axially chiral isoquinolones (up to 99% yield and 96% ee). This study not only lays chemists'&#160;longstanding doubts about whether it is possible to use chiral arene ligand to stereocontrol ruthenium(II)-catalyzed asymmetric C-H activation, but also opens up a new avenue to achieve asymmetric C-H activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Porphyrazine&#8208;linked Fused Aromatic Networks with High Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused aromatic networks (FANs) have been studied in efforts to overcome the low physicochemical stability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), while preserving crystallinity. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a highly stable and crystalline FAN (denoted as Pz&#8208;FAN) using pyrazine&#8208;based building blocks to form porphyrazine (Pz) linkages via irreversible reaction. Unlike most COFs and FANs, which are synthesized from two different building blocks, the new Pz&#8208;FAN is formed using a single building block by self&#8208;cyclotetramerization. Controlled and optimized reaction conditions resulted in highly crystalline Pz&#8208;FAN with physicochemical stability. The newly prepared Pz&#8208;FAN displayed a high magnitude (1.16 &#215; 10  &#8722;2  S cm  &#8722;1  ) of proton conductivity compared to other reported FANs and polymers. Finally, the Pz&#8208;FAN&#8208;based membrane was evaluated for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which showed maximum power and current densities of 192 mW cm  &#8722;2  and 481 mA cm  &#8722;2  , respectively.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquity of sulfur&#8208;containing molecules in biologically active natural products and pharmaceuticals has long attracted synthetic chemists to develop efficient strategies towards their synthesis. The strategy of direct &#945;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8722;H modification of sulfides provides a streamlining access to complex sulfur&#8208;containing molecules. Herein, we report a photoinduced chemo&#8208;, site&#8208; and stereoselective &#945;&#8208;C(sp  3  )&#8722;H functionalization of sulfides using isatins as the photoredox reagent and coupling partner catalyzed by chiral gallium(III)&#8210; N  ,  N'  &#8208;  dioxide complex. The reaction proceeds through a verified single electron transfer (SET) mechanism with high efficiency, excellent functional group tolerance, as well as a broad substrate scope. Importantly, this cross&#8208;coupling protocol is highly selective for the direct late&#8208;stage functionalization of methionine&#8208;related peptides, regardless of the inherent structural similarity and complexity of diverse residues.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non&#8208;invasive treatment modality against a range of cancers and nonmalignant diseases, however one must be aware of the risk of causing phototoxic reactions after treatment. We herein report a bioinspired design of next&#8208;generation photosensitizers (PSs) that not only effectively produce ROS but undergo fast metabolism after treatment to overcome undesirable side effects. We constructed a series of  b  &#8208;pyrrolic ring&#8208;opening secochlorins, termed beidaphyrin (  BP  ), beidapholactone (  BPL  ), and their zinc(II) derivatives (  ZnBP  and  ZnBPL  ), featuring intense near&#8208;infrared absorption and effective O  2  photosensitization. Irradiation of  ZnBPL  led to a non&#8208;cytotoxic, metabolizable beidaphodiacetamide (  ZnBPD  ) via in situ generated O  2  &#8226;&#8722;  but not  1  O  2  , as revealed by mechanistic studies including time&#8208;resolved absorption, kinetics, and isotope labeling. Furthermore, water&#8208;soluble  ZnBPL  showed an effective therapeutic outcome, fast metabolism, and negligible phototoxic reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Transmetalation between Copper and Palladium Nanoparticle Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The localized surface plasmon resonance effect of Cu nanoparticles enhances transmetalation and phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu surface to the Pd surface by low&#8208;flux visible light. This feature enables a choice between the cross&#8208;coupling product and homo&#8208;coupling product dependent on wavelength.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;plasmon&#8208;mediated phenylacetylide intermediate transfer from the Cu to the Pd surface affords a novel mechanism for transmetalation, enabling wavelength&#8208;tunable cross&#8208;coupling and homo&#8208;coupling reaction pathway control. C&#8722;C bond forming Sonogashira coupling and Glaser coupling reactions in O2 atmosphere are efficiently driven by visible light over heterogeneous Cu and Pd nanoparticles as a mixed catalyst without base or other additives. The reaction pathway can be controlled by switching the excitation wavelength. Shorter wavelengths (400&#8211;500&#8197;nm) give the Glaser homo&#8208;coupling diyne, whereas longer wavelength irradiation (500&#8211;940&#8197;nm) significantly increases the degree of cross&#8208;coupling Sonogashira coupling products. The ratio of the activated intermediates of alkyne to the iodobenzene is wavelength dependent and this regulates transmetalation. This wavelength&#8208;tunable reaction pathway is a novel way to optimize the product selectivity in important organic syntheses.

         <title>A Pd&#8722;H/Isothiourea Cooperative Catalysis Approach to anti&#8208;Aldol Motifs: Enantioselective &#945;&#8208;Alkylation of Esters with Oxyallenes**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperation between isothiourea and Pd catalysts enables the preparation of anti&#8208;aldol products via enantioselective alkylation of esters with oxyallenes. Key to the successful development of this method was the recognition that Pd&#8722;H intermediates could be leveraged within this cooperative framework giving access to oxygen&#8208;substituted &#960;(allyl)Pd intermediates. Preliminary deuterium&#8208;tracking experiments support the proposed reaction pathway.







Abstract
The biological and therapeutic significance of natural products is a powerful impetus for the development of efficient methods to facilitate their construction. Accordingly, and reflecting the prevalence of &#946;&#8208;oxy&#8208;carbonyl motifs, a sophisticated arsenal of aldol&#8208;based strategies has evolved that is contingent on the generation of single enolate isomers. Since this has the potential to compromise efficiency in reagent&#8208;based paradigms, direct catalysis&#8208;based solutions would be enabling. To complement the array of substrate&#8208;based strategies, and regulate enolate geometry at the catalyst level, a direct catalytic alkylation of esters with oxyallenes has been developed. Synergizing metal hydride reactivity with Lewis base catalysis has resulted in a broad reaction scope with useful levels of stereocontrol (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Facile derivatization of these ambiphilic linchpins is demonstrated, providing access to high&#8208;value vicinal stereocenter&#8208;containing motifs, including 1,2&#8208;amino alcohols.

         <title>Catalytic DNA Polymerization Can Be Expedited by Active Product Release**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the primer exchange reaction is a strongly peaked function of the binding strength between the reactant and catalyst strands. This trend holds for many catalytic reactions and is known as Sabatier's principle. A helicase that consumes ATP to selectively remove the products from the catalysts can speed up the reaction in the strong&#8208;binding regime and reduce the dependency of the catalytic rate on the binding strength.







Abstract
The sequence&#8208;specific hybridization of DNA facilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA dehybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi&#8208;step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP&#8208;dependent helicase, Rep&#8208;X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep&#8208;X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.

&lt;p&gt;The rate of the primer exchange reaction is a strongly peaked function of the binding strength between the reactant and catalyst strands. This trend holds for many catalytic reactions and is known as Sabatier's principle. A helicase that consumes ATP to selectively remove the products from the catalysts can speed up the reaction in the strong-binding regime and reduce the dependency of the catalytic rate on the binding strength.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence-specific hybridization of DNA facilitates its use as a building block for designer nanoscale structures and reaction networks that perform computations. However, the strong binding energy of Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing that underlies this specificity also causes the DNA dehybridization rate to depend sensitively on sequence length and temperature. This strong dependency imposes stringent constraints on the design of multi-step DNA reactions. Here we show how an ATP-dependent helicase, Rep-X, can drive specific dehybridization reactions at rates independent of sequence length, removing the constraints of equilibrium on DNA hybridization and dehybridization. To illustrate how this new capacity can speed up designed DNA reaction networks, we show that Rep-X extends the range of conditions where the primer exchange reaction, which catalytically adds a domain provided by a hairpin template to a DNA substrate, proceeds rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Biostable L&#8208;DNA Hydrogel with Improved Stability for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA hydrogels have attracted more and more attentions due to their excellent permeability, high mechanical strength together with thixotropy, versatile programmability and good biocompatibility. However, the moderate biostability and immune stimulation of DNA arose as big concerns for future potential clinical applications. Here, we reported a novel l&#8208;DNA hydrogel by self&#8208;assembly, which inherited the extraordinary physical properties of d&#8208;DNA hydrogel. With the mirror&#8208;isomerized deoxyribose, this hydrogel exhibited improved biostability, which withstood fetal bovine serum (FBS) at least one month without obviously decay on its mechanical properties. Low inflammatory response of l&#8208;DNA hydrogel has been verified both  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Hence, this l&#8208;DNA hydrogel with outstanding biostability and biocompatibility can be anticipated to serve as an ideal 3D cell culture matrix and implanted bio&#8208;scaffold for long&#8208;term biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Beyond Bioisosteres: Divergent Synthesis of Azabicyclohexanes and Cyclobutenyl Amines from Bicyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of two divergent and complementary Lewis acid catalyzed additions of bicyclobutanes to imines is described. Microscale high&#8208;throughput experimentation was integral to the discovery and optimization of both reactions.  N  &#8208;arylimines undergo formal (3+2) cycloaddition with bicyclobutanes to yield azabicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes in a single step; in contrast,  N  &#8208;alkylimines undergo an addition/elimination sequence to generate cyclobutenyl methanamine products with high diastereoselectivity. These new products contain a variety of synthetic handles for further elaboration, including many functional groups relevant to pharmaceutical synthesis. The divergent reactivity observed is attributed to differences in basicity and nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom in a common carbocation intermediate, leading to either nucleophilic attack (  N  &#8208;aryl) or E1 elimination (  N  &#8208;alkyl).</dc:description>

         <title>A Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Machine Controls K+ Channel Transport and Induces Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of artificial ion channels with high activity, selectivity and gating function is challenging. Herein, we designed the light&#8208;driven motor molecule  MC2  , which provides new design criteria to overcome these challenges.  MC2  forms a selective K  +  channel through a single molecular transmembrane mechanism, and the light&#8208;driven rotary motion significantly accelerates ion transport, which endows the irradiated motor molecule with excellent cytotoxicity and cancer cell selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the rotary motion of  MC2  promotes K  +  efflux, generates reactive oxygen species and eventually activates caspase&#8208;3&#8208;dependent apoptosis in cancer cells. Combined with the spatiotemporally controllable advantages of light, we believe this strategy can be exploited in the structural design and application of next&#8208;generation synthetic cation transporters for the treatment of cancer and other diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Layered Organic Metal Chalcogenides (OMCs): from Bulk to 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The modification of inorganic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with organic functional motifs is in high demanded for the optimization of their pristine properties, but it is still a daunting challenge. Organic metal chalcogenides (OMCs) are a type of newly&#8208;emerging 2D materials, with metal chalcogenide layers covalently anchored by long&#8208;range ordered organic functional motifs, which are extremely desirable but impossible to achieve in traditional 2D materials. Both the inorganic layer and organic functional motifs of OMCs are highly designable and thus provide this type of 2D materials with enormous varieties on their structure and property. This review aims to review the latest developments in OMCs and their bulk precursors. Firstly, the structure types of the bulk precursors for OMCs are introduced. Second, the synthesis and applications of OMC 2D materials in photoelectricity, catalysis, sensors, and energy transfer are explored. Finally, the remarks on the challenges and perspectives for future research on OMCs are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Ligand&#8208;Controlled Remote para&#8208;Selective C&#8211;H Activation and Borylation of Twisted Aromatic Amides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A method of para selective borylation of aromatic amides is described. The borylation proceeded via an unprecedented substrate&#8211;ligand distortion between the twisted aromatic amides and a newly designed ligand framework (defa) that is different from the traditionally used ligand (dtbpy) for the C&#8211;H borylation reactions. The designed ligand framework (defa) has led to the development of a new type of catalytic system that shows excellent para selectivity for a range of aromatic amides. Moreover, the designed ligand has shown excellent reactivity and selectivity for a range of heterocyclic aromatic amides. The identification of key transition states and intermediates using the DFT computations associated with the three regio&#8208;isomeric pathways revealed that the most efficient catalytic pathway with the defa ligand leads to the para borylation while in the case of bpy the borylation at the para and meta sites compete.</dc:description>
