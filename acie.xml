      <title>Discovery of a novel Mycobacterial F&#8208;ATP synthase inhibitor and its potency in combination with diarylquinolines</title>
      <dc:description>The F  1  F  O  &#8208;ATP synthase is required for growth and viability of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  . Bedaquiline validated this target clinically. We showed recently that a mycobacterium&#8208;specific loop of the enzyme&#8217;s rotary &#947; subunit plays a role in coupling of ATP synthesis within the enzyme complex. Here, we report the discovery of a novel antimycobacterial, termed GaMF1, targeting this &#947; subunit loop. Biochemical and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance studies show that GaMF1 inhibits ATP synthase activity by binding to the loop. GaMF1 is bactericidal and is active against multidrug&#8208; as well as Bedaquiline&#8208;resistant strains. Chemistry efforts on the scaffold revealed a dynamic structure activity relationship and delivered analogues with nanomolar potencies. Combining GaMF1 with bedaquiline or novel diarylquinoline analogues showed potentiation without inducing genotoxicity or phenotypic changes in a human embryonic stem cell reporter assay. These results suggest that GaMF1 presents an attractive lead for the discovery of a novel class of anti&#8208;tuberculosis F&#8208;ATP synthase inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>The Interplay between Lead Vacancy and Water Rationalizes the Puzzle of Charge Carrier Lifetimes in CH3NH3PbI3: Time&#8208;Domain Ab Initio Analysis</title>
      <dc:description>The perovskite excited&#8208;state lifetimes exhibit the conflicting experimental results exposure to humidity, which should correlate with defects because they inevitably present in perovskite films. Nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics combined with time&#8208;domain density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the formation energy of a lead vacancy decreases from 0.29 eV in pristine MAPbI  3  (MA= CH  3  NH  3  +  ) to over &#8208;2 eV in the perovskite in the presence water regardless of its oxidation states, indicating that the lead vacancy is a major defect and which can spontaneously form in the moist environment. The lead vacancy reduces NA coupling by localizing hole for decreasing the overlap with electron, slowing electron&#8208;hole recombination by a factor of 2. By creating a deep electron trap state due to formation of an iodine dimer in presence of the lead vacancy interacting strongly with water molecules, the electron gets rapidly trapped on 4 ps and then recombines with the valence band free hole within sub&#8208;1 ns. The over 3 times acceleration relative to the pristine system is owing to enhanced NA couplings. By eliminating the  mid&#8208;gap state due to dissociation of the iodine dimer with accepting two photoexcited electrons,  the electron&#8208;hole recombination reduces by a factor of over 2 compared to the pristine MAPbI  3  , arising due to the reduced overlap between electron and hole. The calculated recombination time scales show excellent agreement with experiment. These phenomena arise due to a complex interplay of the unusual chemical, structural, electrostatic and quantum properties of halide perovskites. The simulations rationalize the positive and negative effects of water on the solar cell performance exposure to humidity. The detailed mechanistic understanding of the complex charge&#8208;phonon dynamics of perovskite in the presence of defects and water molecules provides key insights for a broad range of solar and electro&#8208;optic applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Coupling Magnetic Single&#8208;Crystal Co2Mo3O8 with Ultrathin Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Layer for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal oxides as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) provide a promising route to face the energy and environmental crisis issues. Although palmeirite oxide A  2  Mo  3  O  8  as OER catalyst has been explored, the correlation between its active sites (tetrahedral or octahedral site) and OER performance is elusive so far. Here, we present a magnetic functioned Co  2  Mo  3  O  8  @NC&#8208;800 composed of highly crystallized Co  2  Mo  3  O  8  nanosheets and ultrathin N&#8208;rich carbon layer as an efficient OER catalyst. The catalyst exhibits favorable performance with overpotential of 331&#8239;mV@10&#8239;mA&#8239;cm  &#8722;2  and 422 mV@40&#8201;mA&#8201;cm  &#8208;2  , and a full water&#8208;splitting electrolyzer with it as anode catalyst shows a cell voltage of 1.67 V@10 mA cm  &#8208;2  in alkaline. Combined HAADFSTEM, magnetic and computational results show that the vital factors influencing the OER performance of the catalyst can be attributed to the tetrahedral Co sites (high spin, t  2  3  e  4  ), which improve the OER kinetics of rate&#8208;determining step to form *OOH.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Chiral optical metamaterials with delicate structures are in high demand in various fields due to their strong light&#8211;matter interactions.

Meanwhile, the nanoparticles synthesized with Cys&#8208;Gly exhibited a rhombic dodecahedron&#8208;like outline with curved edges and elliptical cavities on each face. Intermediate morphology analysis indicated that &#947;&#8208;Glu&#8208;Cys generated an intermediate morphology of concave hexoctahedron, while Cys&#8208;Gly formed a concave rhombic dodecahedron.

      <title>Predictable selectivity in remote C&#8208;H Oxidation of steroids via analysis of substrate binding mode</title>
      <dc:description>Predictability is a key requirement to encompass late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization in synthetic routes. However, prediction (and control) of reaction selectivity is usually challenging, especially for complex substrate structures and elusive transformations such as remote C(  sp  3  )&#8208;H oxidation, as it requires to distinguish a specific C&#8208;H bond from many others with similar reactivity. Herein, we develop a strategy for predictable, remote C&#8208;H oxidation that entails substrate binding to a supramolecular Mn or Fe catalyst followed by elucidation of the conformation of the host&#8208;guest adduct via NMR analysis or, more easily, docking of crystal structures. These analyses indicate which remote C&#8208;H bonds are suitably oriented for the oxidation before carrying out the reaction, enabling prediction of site&#8208;selectivity. We applied this strategy to late&#8208;stage C(  sp  3  )&#8208;H oxidation of aminosteroids at C15 (or C16) positions, with a selectivity tunable by modification of catalyst chirality and metal.</dc:description>

      <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Lead&#8208;Free 0D Perovskites Through Doping Strategy Achieving A Boost of PLQY from &lt; 2% to 90%</title>
      <dc:description>Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) lead&#8208;free perovskites have unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Here, we report undoped and Sb&#8208;doped all inorganic, lead&#8208;free, 0D perovskite single crystals A  2  InCl  5  (H  2  O) (A = Rb, Cs), which exhibit greatly enhanced yellow emission. To study the effect of coordination H  2  O, Sb&#8208;doped A  3  InCl  6  (A = Rb, Cs) are also synthesized and further studied. The photoluminescence (PL) color changes from yellow to green emission. Interestingly, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) realizes a great boost from &lt; 2% to 85&#8208;95% through doping Sb  3+  . We further explore the effect of Sb  3+  dopants and the origin of bright emission by ultrafast transient absorption techniques. In addition, undoped and Sb&#8208;doped 0D rubidium indium chloride perovskites show excellent stability. These findings not only provide a way to design a set of new high&#8208;performance 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites, but also reveal the relationship between structure and PL properties.</dc:description>

Here, we report undoped and Sb&#8208;doped all inorganic, lead&#8208;free, 0D perovskite single crystals A  2  InCl  5  (H  2  O) (A = Rb, Cs), which exhibit greatly enhanced yellow emission. To study the effect of coordination H  2  O, Sb&#8208;doped A  3  InCl  6  (A = Rb, Cs) are also synthesized and further studied. The photoluminescence (PL) color changes from yellow to green emission. Interestingly, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) realizes a great boost from &amp;lt; 2% to 85&#8208;95% through doping Sb  3+  . We further explore the effect of Sb  3+  dopants and the origin of bright emission by ultrafast transient absorption techniques. In addition, undoped and Sb&#8208;doped 0D rubidium indium chloride perovskites show excellent stability. These findings not only provide a way to design a set of new high&#8208;performance 0D lead&#8208;free perovskites, but also reveal the relationship between structure and PL properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethane through Stabilization of an Ethoxy Intermediate</title>
      <dc:description>Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethane is seldom observed because of the generally higher selectivity towards methane, ethylene, and ethanol. Consequently, little experimental evidence for its reaction mechanism exists and thus remains largely unknown. Here, by combining electrochemistry with in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure and in&#8208;situ Raman techniques, we study iodide&#8208;derived copper (ID&#8208;Cu) and oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) systems to obtain a deeper understanding of the CO2 to ethane mechanism. With trace iodine species on the surface and positively charged Cu species, production of ethane is significantly more favored on ID&#8208;Cu compared to OD&#8208;Cu, with higher selectivity and faster kinetics. For the first time, it is experimentally found that the formation of ethane follows the same pathway to ethylene and ethanol, and better stabilization of the late stage ethoxy intermediate can steer the reaction to ethane over ethanol.</dc:description>

The Fmoc group is readily removed after ligation reaction by short exposure (&lt;7 min) to 20% piperidine at pH 11 in aqueous condition at room temperature.

This material has been synthesized using an  in&#8208;situ  method as a gel, under which imine&#8208;hydrolysis and metalation reactions are coupled.

Although the integration of plasticity and elasticity on a crystal is theoretically possible and it benefits the rich and complex deformations which are highly demanded for applications, the integration is hard to be realized practically. Here, we show that through utilizing different modes of external forces for influencing molecular packing of different crystallographic directions, plastic helical twisting and elastic bending can both be achieved for a crystal and they can even be realized simultaneously. Detailed crystallographic analyses and contrast experiments disclose the mechanisms behind these two kinds of distinct deformations and their mutual compatibility. Based on the plastically twistable nature of the crystal, a new application field of flexible organic single crystals, namely polarization rotators, is successfully opened up.</dc:description>

      <title>Strong Visible Light&#8208;Absorbing Cuprous Sensitizers for Dramatically Boosting Photocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>Developing strong visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing (SVLA) earth&#8208;abundant photosensitizers (PSs) for significantly improving the utilization of solar energy is highly desirable, yet it remains a great challenge. Herein, we adopt a though&#8208;bond energy transfer&#160;(TBET) strategy by bridging boron dipyrromethene (Bodipy) and a Cu(I) complex with an electronically conjugated bridge, resulting in the first SVLA Cu(I) PSs (  Cu&#8208;2  and  Cu&#8208;3  ).  Cu&#8208;3  possesses an extremely high molar extinction coefficient of 162260 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 518 nm, over 62 times higher than that of traditional Cu(I) PS (  Cu&#8208;1  ). Remarkably, the photooxidation activity of  Cu&#8208;3  is substantially greater than that of  Cu&#8208;1  and noble&#8208;metal PSs (Ru(bpy)  3  2+  and Ir(ppy)  3  +  ) for both energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer reactions. Femto&#8208; and nanosecond transient absorption and theoretical investigations demonstrate that a &#8220;ping&#8208;pong&#8221; energy&#8208;transfer process in  Cu&#8208;3  involving a forward singlet TBET from Bodipy to the Cu(I) complex and a backward triplet&#8208;triplet energy transfer greatly contributed to the long&#8208;lived and Bodipy&#8208;localized triplet excited state.</dc:description>

      <title>Strain Influences the Hydrogen Evolution Activity and Absorption Capacity of Palladium</title>
      <dc:description>Strain&#8208;engineering can be used to increase the activity and selectivity of an electrocatalyst. Tensile strain is known to improve the electrocatalytic activity of palladium electrodes for reduction of carbon dioxide or dioxygen, but determining how strain affects the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is complicated by the fact that palladium can absorb hydrogen concurrently with HER. We report here a custom electrochemical cell that applies tensile strain to a flexible working electrode that enabled us to resolve how tensile strain affects hydrogen absorption and HER activity for a thin film palladium electrocatalyst. When the electrodes were subjected to mechanically&#8208;applied tensile strain, the amount of hydrogen that absorbed into the palladium decreased, and HER electrocatalytic activity increased. This study showcases how strain can be used to modulate the hydrogen absorption capacity and HER activity of palladium.</dc:description>

      <title>Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Based Supramolecular Frameworks Assembled through the Outer Surface Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Porous materials, especially the metal&#8208;organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks and supramolecular organic frameworks are widely used in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. Cucurbit[  n  ]urils (Q[  n  ]s) are expected to become basic building units because they possess neutral electrostatic potential cavities, negative electrostatic potential portal carbonyls and positive electrostatic potential outer surfaces, which may result in the formation of Q[  n  ]&#8208;based supramolecular frameworks (QSFs) assembled through the inclusion of Q[  n  ]s with guests, the coordination of Q[  n  ]s with metal ions and the outer surface interaction of Q[  n  ]s (OSIQ). This review summarizes the various QSFs assembled via OSIQs, and the QSFs can be classified as being assembled by i) self&#8208;induced OSIQ; ii) anion&#8208;induced OSIQ and iii) aromatic&#8208;induced OSIQ. The design and construction of QSFs through OSIQs with novel structures and specific functional properties may establish a new research direction in Q[  n  ] chemistry.</dc:description>

      <title>Dual&#8208;shelled RbLi(Li3SiO4)2:Eu2+@Al2O3@ODTMS phosphor as a stable green emitter for high&#8208;power LED Backlights</title>
      <dc:description>The stability of luminescent materials is a key factor for the practical application in white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Poor chemical stability of narrow&#8208;band green&#8208;emitting RbLi(Li  3  SiO  4  )  2  :Eu  2+  (RLSO:Eu  2+  ) phosphor hinders its further commercialization even if it possesses excellent stability against thermal quenching. Herein, we propose an efficient protection scheme by combining the surface coating of amorphous Al  2  O  3  and hydrophobic modification by octadecyltrimethoxysilane (ODTMS) to construct the moisture&#8208;resistant dual&#8208;shelled RLSO:Eu  2+  @Al  2  O  3  @ODTMS composite. The growth mechanisms of both Al  2  O  3  inorganic layer and silane organic layer on the phosphor surface are investigated, which can remarkably improve the water&#8208;stability of this narrow&#8208;band green emitter. The evaluation result of the white LED by employing this composite as green component demonstrates that RLSO:Eu  2+  @Al  2  O  3  @ODTMS is a promising candidate for the high&#8208;performance display backlights, and this dual&#8208;shelled strategy provides an alternative method to improve the moisture&#8208;resistant property of humidity&#8208;sensitive phosphors.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical modification of cellulose nanocrystal reducing end&#8208;groups</title>
      <dc:description>Native plant cellulose has an intrinsic supramolecular structure. Consequently, it can be isolated as nanocellulose species, which can be utilized as building blocks for renewable nanomaterials. The structure of cellulose also permits its end&#8208;wise modification, i.e., chemical reactions exclusively on one end of a cellulose chain or a nanocellulose particle. The premises for end&#8208;wise modification have been known for decades. Nevertheless, different approaches for the reactions have emerged only recently, because of formidable synthetic and analytical challenges involved with the issue, including the adverse reactivity of the cellulose reducing end and the low abundance of newly introduced functionalities. This review gives a full account of the scientific underpinnings and challenges related to end&#8208;wise modification of cellulose nanocrystals. Furthermore, we present how the chemical modification of cellulose nanocrystal ends may be applied to directed assembly, resulting in numerous possibilities for construction of new materials, such as responsive liquid crystal templates or composites with tailored interactions.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we report a strategy for the synthesis of&#160; crystalline porous c ovalent organic frameworks via&#160; t opology&#8208;templated polymerization. The template is based on imine&#8208;linked frameworks and their (001) facet s &#160;seed the C=C bond formation&#160; reaction to constitute 2D&#160; sp  2  &#160;carbon&#8208;conjugated frameworks. This strategy&#160; is applicable to&#160; templates&#160; with&#160; different topologies, enables designed synthesis of frameworks that cannot be prepared via direct polymerization, and creates a series of sp  2  &#160;carbon frameworks with tetragonal, hexagonal, and kagome topologies. The &#160; sp  2  &#160;carbon frameworks are highly luminescent even in the solid state and&#160; exhibit&#160; topology&#160; dependent&#160; &#960; transmission and exciton migration ; these key fundamental &#960; functions are unique to &#160;sp  2  &#160;carbon&#8208;conjugated frameworks and&#160; c annot be accessible by imine&#8208;linked frameworks, amorphous analogues, and 1D conjugated polymers. These results&#160; demonstrate an unprecedented strategy for structural and functional designs of covalent organic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Highly Efficient Dimeric Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroarylation of Internal Alkynes</title>
      <dc:description>We have developed a general and site&#8208;predictable manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of internal alkynes in the presence of water, under an air atmosphere without the involvement of ligand. The unique catalytic feature of this reaction is highlighted by comparison with other widely used transition metal catalysts including palladium, rhodium, nickel or copper.

      <title>Metal&#8208;like Ductility in Organic Plastic Crystals: Role of Molecular Shape and Dihydrogen Bonding Interactions in Aminoboranes
</title>
      <dc:description>
Slip slidin&#8217; away: Aminoborane crystals can be deformed mechanically while retaining high crystallinity because multiple slip planes exist in their high&#8208;symmetry structures. The presence of dihydrogen bonds in a similar semiglobular system, BH3NHMe2, negates ductility. Mechanically castable plastic crystals are appealing for applications such as ferroelectrics and soft robotics.







Abstract
Ductility is a common phenomenon in many metals but is difficult to achieve in molecular crystals. Organic crystals bend plastically on one or two face&#8208;specific directions but fracture when stressed in any other arbitrary directions. An exceptional metal&#8208;like ductility and malleability in the isomorphous crystals of two globular molecules, BH3NMe3 and BF3NMe3, is reported, with characteristic tensile stretching, compression, twisting, and thinning. The mechanically deformed samples, which transition to lower symmetry phases, retain good long&#8208;range order amenable to structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Molecules in these high&#8208;symmetry crystals interact through electrostatic forces (B&#8722;&#8722;N+) to form columnar structures with multiple slip planes and weak dispersive forces between columns. On the other hand, the limited number of facile slip planes and strong dihydrogen bonding in BH3NHMe2 negates ductility. Our study has implications for the design of soft ferroelectrics, solid electrolytes, barocalorics, and soft robotics.

     alt="Metal&#8208;like Ductility in Organic Plastic Crystals: Role of Molecular Shape and Dihydrogen Bonding Interactions in Aminoboranes&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slip slidin&lt;/b&gt;&#8217; &lt;b&gt;away&lt;/b&gt;: Aminoborane crystals can be deformed mechanically while retaining high crystallinity because multiple slip planes exist in their high&#8208;symmetry structures. The presence of dihydrogen bonds in a similar semiglobular system, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NHMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, negates ductility. Mechanically castable plastic crystals are appealing for applications such as ferroelectrics and soft robotics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ductility is a common phenomenon in many metals but is difficult to achieve in molecular crystals. Organic crystals bend plastically on one or two face&#8208;specific directions but fracture when stressed in any other arbitrary directions. An exceptional metal&#8208;like ductility and malleability in the isomorphous crystals of two globular molecules, BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is reported, with characteristic tensile stretching, compression, twisting, and thinning. The mechanically deformed samples, which transition to lower symmetry phases, retain good long&#8208;range order amenable to structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Molecules in these high&#8208;symmetry crystals interact through electrostatic forces (B&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to form columnar structures with multiple slip planes and weak dispersive forces between columns. On the other hand, the limited number of facile slip planes and strong dihydrogen bonding in BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NHMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; negates ductility. Our study has implications for the design of soft ferroelectrics, solid electrolytes, barocalorics, and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asymmetric Electrochemical Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of electrochemical transformations in asymmetric synthesis is described in this Minireview. Three major types of catalytic enantioselective strategies in electrosynthesis, including electrochemical activation of chiral catalyst&#8208;bound substrates, asymmetric cascade electrochemical processes, and chemically modified chiral electrodes, are discussed.







Abstract
The field of electrochemical synthesis has developed rapidly over the last decade and has provided alternative synthetic methods with the absence of stoichiometric amounts of chemical oxidants or reductants. Although sustainable electrosynthetic procedures have been developed, relatively few examples of highly enantioselective catalytic electrosynthesis have been reported to date. The development of general strategies for electrochemical enantiocontrol has thus proven to be a considerable challenge. This Minireview highlights the current knowledge and recent advances in the synthetic utility of electrochemical transformations for asymmetric synthesis. Specifically, three major types of catalytic enantioselective strategy in electrosynthesis are outlined, including electrochemical activation of chiral catalyst&#8208;bound substrates, asymmetric cascade electrochemical processes, and chemically modified chiral electrodes.

      <title>Revisiting the Limiting Factors for Overall Water&#8208;Splitting on Organic Photocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>In pursuit of inexpensive and earth abundant photocatalysts for solar hydrogen production from water, conjugated polymers have shown potential to be a viable alternative to widely used inorganic counterparts. The photocatalytic performance of polymeric photocatalysts, however, is very poor in comparison to that of inorganic photocatalysts. Most of the organic photocatalysts are active in hydrogen production only when a sacrificial electron donor (SED) is added into the solution, and their high performances often rely on presence of noble metal co&#8208;catalyst (e.g. Pt). For pursuing a carbon neutral and cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production, unassisted hydrogen production solely from water is one of the critical requirements to translate a mere bench&#8208;top research interest into the real world applications. Although this is a generic problem for both inorganic and organic types of photocatalysts, organic photocatalysts are mostly investigated in the half&#8208;reaction and have so far shown limited success in hydrogen production from overall water&#8208;splitting. To make progress, this article exclusively discusses critical factors that are limiting the overall water&#8208;splitting in organic photocatalysts. Additionally, we also have extended the discussion to stability issues and the accurate reporting of the hydrogen production, and issues to be resolved to reach 10% STH (solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen) conversion efficiency.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular sieving of C2&#8208;C3 alkene from alkyne with tuned threshold pressure in robust layered metal&#8208;organic frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>C2&#8208;C3  &#160;alkyne/alkene separation is of great importance to industry, however, designing materials for an efficient molecular sieving of alkenes from alkynes with substantial alkyne capacity remains challenging. Here, it is first reported that two novel hydrolytically&#8208;stable layered metal&#8208;organic frameworks, [Cu(dps)2(GeF6)] (GeFSIX&#8208;dps&#8208;Cu, dps=4,4'&#8208;dipyridylsulfide) and [Zn(dps)2(GeF6)] (GeFSIX&#8208;dps&#8208;Zn), can achieve almost complete exclusion of both C3H6  and C2H4  from their alkyne analogues. Furthermore, GeFSIX&#8208;dps&#8208;Cu displays a notable advanced threshold pressure for alkynes adsorption and thus substantial uptakes at lower pressures, providing record C3H4/C3H6  uptake ratios&#160;and capacity&#8208;enhanced C2H2/C2H4  sieving for a wide composition range. Evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and modelling, metal substitution from Zn to Cu affords a fine tuning of linker rotation and layer stacking, creating slightly expanded pore aperture and interlayer space coupled with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and allowing easier entrance of alkyne while excluding alkene. Breakthrough experiments confirmed the tunable sieving performance of these MOFs for both C3H4/C3H6  and C2H2/C2H4  mixtures.</dc:description>

Here, it is first reported that two novel hydrolytically&#8208;stable layered metal&#8208;organic frameworks, [Cu(dps)2(GeF6)] (GeFSIX&#8208;dps&#8208;Cu, dps=4,4'&#8208;dipyridylsulfide) and [Zn(dps)2(GeF6)] (GeFSIX&#8208;dps&#8208;Zn), can achieve almost complete exclusion of both C3H6  and C2H4  from their alkyne analogues. Furthermore, GeFSIX&#8208;dps&#8208;Cu displays a notable advanced threshold pressure for alkynes adsorption and thus substantial uptakes at lower pressures, providing record C3H4/C3H6  uptake ratios&#160;and capacity&#8208;enhanced C2H2/C2H4  sieving for a wide composition range. Evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and modelling, metal substitution from Zn to Cu affords a fine tuning of linker rotation and layer stacking, creating slightly expanded pore aperture and interlayer space coupled with multiple hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites and allowing easier entrance of alkyne while excluding alkene. Breakthrough experiments confirmed the tunable sieving performance of these MOFs for both C3H4/C3H6  and C2H2/C2H4  mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>SLIM: A short&#8208;linked, highly redox&#8208;stable trityl label for high sensitivity&#160;in cell&#160;EPR distance measurements</title>
      <dc:description>The understanding of biomolecular function is coupled to knowledge about the structure and dynamics of these biomolecules, preferably acquired under native conditions. In this regard, pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy (PDS) in conjunction with site&#8208;directed spin labeling (SDSL) is an important method in the toolbox of biophysical chemistry.

      <title>Target Directed Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition for Assembling HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA Binding Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>The highly conserved HIV&#8208;1 transactivation response element (TAR) binds to the trans&#8208;activator protein Tat and facilitates the viral replication in its latent state. The inhibition of Tat&#8211;TAR interactions by selectively targeting   TAR RNA has been used as a strategy to develop potent anti&#8208;viral agents.   Therefore, HIV&#8208;1   TAR RNA represents   a paradigmatic system for therapeutic intervention. Herein, we have employed biotin tagged   TAR RNA to assemble its own ligands from a pool of reactive azide&#8208;alkyne building blocks. In order to identify binding sites and selectivity of ligands the in situ cycloaddition has been further performed using control nucleotide (TAR DNA and TAR RNA w/b) templates. The hit triazole linked thiazole peptidomimetic products were isolated from the biotin tagged target templates using streptavidin beads. The major triazole lead generated by the TAR RNA presumably binds in the bulge region, shows specificity for TAR RNA over TAR DNA and inhibits Tat&#8208;TAR interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Achieve Superior Electrocatalytic Performance by Surface Copper Vacancy Defects during Electrochemical Etching Process</title>
      <dc:description>Vacancy defects of catalyst has been extensively studied and proven to be beneficial to various electrocatalytic reactions. However, it remains a great challenge to systematically study the effects of vacancy defects on the electrocatalytic reaction during electrochemical process. Herein, an ultra&#8208;stable three&#8208;dimensional PtCu nanowire networks (NNWs) with ultrafine size, self&#8208;supporting rigid structure, and Cu vacancy defects has been successfully developed. The vacancy defect&#8208;rich PtCu NNWs exhibits an outstanding performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), in which the mass activity is 14.1 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20%.wt, JM), and is the best performance currently. In addition, the mass activity of the PtCu NNWs for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is 17.8 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the introduction of Cu vacancy enhances the adsorption capacity of Pt atoms to HO* intermediate and simultaneously weakens the adsorption for O* intermediate. The excellent performances of PtCu NNWs for ORR and MOR can be attributed to the self&#8208;supporting structure, massive Cu vacancy defects, and synergistic electronic interaction on various active sites. This work presents a facile strategy to assemble efficient electrocatalysts with abundant vacancy defects, at the same time, provides an insight into the ORR mechanism in acidic solution.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The incorporation of impurity ions or doping is a promising method for controlling the electronic and optical properties and the structural stability of halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs). Herein, we establish relationships between rare earth ions doping and intrinsic emission of lead&#8208;free double perovskite Cs  2  AgInCl  6  NCs to impart and tune the optical performances in the visible light region. Tb  3+  ions were incorporated into Cs  2  AgInCl  6  NCs and occupied In  3+  sites verified by both crystallographic analyses and first&#8208;principles calculations. Trace amount of Bi doping endowed the characteristic emission (  5  D  4  &#8594;  7  F  6&#8208;3  ) of Tb  3+  ions with new excitation peak at 368 nm rather than single characteristic excitation at 290 nm of Tb  3+  . By controlling Tb  3+  ions concentration, the emission colors of Cs  2  AgInCl  6  :Bi,Tb NCs could be continuously tuned from green to orange, due to the efficient energy transfer channel from self&#8208;trapped excitons to Tb  3+  ions. Our study provides the salient features of the material design of lead&#8208;free perovskite NCs and to expand their luminescence applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Constructing adaptive photosensitizers via supramolecular modification based on pillararene host&#8722;guest interactions</title>
      <dc:description>In order to promote the development of photodynamic therapy (PDT), the undesired side effects including low tumor specificity and &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon should be avoided. An effective solution is to construct an adaptive photosensitizer that can be activated to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we design and synthesize a supramolecular switch based on a host&#8211;guest complex containing a water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene (  WP5  ) and an AIEgen photosensitizer (  G  ). The formation of host&#8211;guest complex  WP5  &#8835;  G  quenches the fluorescence and inhibits ROS generation of  G  . Benefitting from the pH&#8208;responsiveness of  WP5  , the binding site between  G  and  WP5  is changed in acidic environment through a shuttle movement. As a consequence, the fluorescence and ROS generation of the host&#8211;guest complex can be switched on at pH 5.0. This work offers a new paradigm for construction of adaptive photosensitizers by using a supramolecular method.</dc:description>

Chemical intuition tells us that pressure increases ordering in most known materials. The discovery of pressure&#8208;induced disorder in double perovskites Y2CoIrO6 and Y2CoRuO6 is in contrast to traditional theories of order&#8211;disorder mechanisms and calls for to reconsideration of pressure effects in solid state sciences.

&lt;p&gt;Chemical intuition tells us that pressure increases ordering in most known materials. The discovery of pressure&#8208;induced disorder in double perovskites Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CoIrO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CoRuO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is in contrast to traditional theories of order&#8211;disorder mechanisms and calls for to reconsideration of pressure effects in solid state sciences.

      <title>Radical Chemistry and Reaction Mechanisms of Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation over Hexagonal Boron Nitride Catalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride is an emerging catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to produce olefins with high selectivity and activity. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002440), V. Fung, W. Huang, Z. Wu, and co&#8208;workers report the first direct experimental evidence of gas&#8208;phase methyl radicals (CH3&#8901;) in propane ODH over boron&#8208;based catalysts. The presence of gas&#8208;phase radicals is shown to be partially responsible for the generation of cracking products (C2 and C1) in propane ODH.

      <title>Activity&#8208;Based Sensing: A Synthetic Methods Approach for Selective Molecular Imaging and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
ABSolute selectivity: Stemming from supramolecular chemical receptors that rely on lock&#8208;and&#8208;key binding, activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS) methods utilizing a variety of chemical reaction approaches offer the highly selective detection of small molecules and metals in biological systems. This Review discusses key design principles, reaction development, and sensing methods, and gives an outlook on this emerging field.







Abstract
Emerging from the origins of supramolecular chemistry and the development of selective chemical receptors that rely on lock&#8208;and&#8208;key binding, activity&#8208;based sensing (ABS)&#8212;which utilizes molecular reactivity rather than molecular recognition for analyte detection&#8212;has rapidly grown into a distinct field to investigate the production and regulation of chemical species that mediate biological signaling and stress pathways, particularly metal ions and small molecules. Chemical reactions exploit the diverse chemical reactivity of biological species to enable the development of selective and sensitive synthetic methods to decipher their contributions within complex living environments. The broad utility of this reaction&#8208;driven approach facilitates application to imaging platforms ranging from fluorescence, luminescence, photoacoustic, magnetic resonance, and positron emission tomography modalities. ABS methods are also being expanded to other fields, such as drug and materials discovery.

      <title>Sustainable Peptide Synthesis Enabled by a Transient Protecting Group</title>
      <dc:description>The growing interest in synthetic peptides has prompted the development of viable methods for their sustainable production. Currently, large amounts of toxic solvents are required for peptide assembly from protected building blocks and switching to water as reaction medium remains a major hurdle in peptide chemistry. We report an aqueous solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis strategy that is based on a water&#8208;compatible 2,7&#8208;disulfo&#8208;9&#8208;fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Smoc) protecting group. This approach enables peptide assembly under aqueous conditions, real&#8208;time monitoring of building block coupling and efficient post&#8208;synthetic purification. The procedure for the synthesis of all natural and several non&#8208;natural Smoc&#8208;protected amino acids is described, as well as assembly of 22 peptide sequences and the fundamental issues of SPPS, among them protecting group strategy, coupling and cleavage efficiency and stability under aqueous conditions, and crucial side reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Prospect of Sulfurized Pyrolyzed Poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) Cathode Materials for Rechargeable Lithium Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Attention S@pPAN: As the representative of molecular scale sulfur composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) has attracted great attention owing to its superior electrochemical behavior. It avoids polysulfides dissolving and provides an alternative solid&#8211;solid conversion (SSC) process. Several research directions are proposed to build better batteries based on the promising S@pPAN composite.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are one of the most promising next&#8208;generation batteries owing to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density and that sulfur is an abundant resource. During the past 20&#8197;years, various sulfur materials have been reported. As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attention S@pPAN&lt;/b&gt;: As the representative of molecular scale sulfur composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) has attracted great attention owing to its superior electrochemical behavior. It avoids polysulfides dissolving and provides an alternative solid&#8211;solid conversion (SSC) process. Several research directions are proposed to build better batteries based on the promising S@pPAN composite.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are one of the most promising next&#8208;generation batteries owing to their ultra&#8208;high theoretical energy density and that sulfur is an abundant resource. During the past 20&#8197;years, various sulfur materials have been reported. As a molecular&#8208;scale sulfur&#8208;composite cathode, sulfurized pyrolyzed poly(acrylonitrile) (S@pPAN) exhibits several competitive advantages in terms of its electrochemical behavior. Although it was first reported in 2002 S@pPAN is currently attracting increasing attention. In this Minireview, we summarize its molecular model and explore the correlation between its structure and its exceptional electrochemical performance. We classify the modification strategies into three types, including material improvement, binder, and electrolyte screening. Several research and development directions are also suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Molecular Springs: Integration of Complex Dynamic Architectures into Functional Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Spring fever: Supramolecular springs are defined as helical molecules or assemblies thereof in which the pitch can be modulated by external stimuli to achieve full control over the extension&#8211;contraction motion. In this Minireview, the structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and spring&#8208;like materials triggered by external stimuli are highlighted for potential future applications in responsive macroscopic devices.







Abstract
Molecular/supramolecular springs are artificial nanoscale objects possessing well&#8208;defined structures and tunable physicochemical properties. Like a macroscopic spring, supramolecular springs are capable of switching their nanoscale conformation as a response to external stimuli by undergoing mechanical spring&#8208;like motions. This dynamic action offers intriguing opportunities for engineering molecular nanomachines by translating the stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoscopic motions into macroscopic work. These nanoscopic objects are reversible dynamic multifunctional architectures which can express a variety of novel properties and behave as adaptive nanoscopic systems. In this Minireview, we focus on the design and structure&#8211;property relationships of supramolecular springs and their (self&#8208;)assembly as a prerequisite towards the generation of novel dynamic materials featuring controlled movements to be readily integrated into macroscopic devices for applications in sensing, robotics, and the internet of things.

      <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Nonheme Iron Oxidation Catalysis: Involvement of Oxoiron(V) Oxidants in Cleaving Strong C&#8722;H Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of bio&#8208;inspired catalytic nonheme iron systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. This Review highlights recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the pathways that can be accessed by these systems to form high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.







Abstract
Nonheme iron enzymes generate powerful and versatile oxidants that perform a wide range of oxidation reactions, including the functionalization of inert C&#8722;H bonds, which is a major challenge for chemists. The oxidative abilities of these enzymes have inspired bioinorganic chemists to design synthetic models to mimic their ability to perform some of the most difficult oxidation reactions and study the mechanisms of such transformations. Iron&#8208;oxygen intermediates like iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo and high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species have been trapped and identified in investigations of these bio&#8208;inspired catalytic systems, with the latter proposed to be the active oxidant for most of these systems. In this Review, we highlight the recent spectroscopic and mechanistic advances that have shed light on the various pathways that can be accessed by bio&#8208;inspired nonheme iron systems to form the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo intermediates.

      <title>Phenotyping Reveals Targets of a Pseudo&#8208;Natural&#8208;Product Autophagy Inhibitor</title>
      <dc:description>
The Cinchona alkaloid scaffold was synthetically merged with the indole ring system, and the bioactivities of the products in phenotypic assays revealed a novel class of autophagy inhibitors, azaquindoles. Subsequent characterization of potent azaquindole&#8208;1 in the morphological cell painting assay guided target identification efforts. In contrast to the parent Cinchona alkaloids, azaquindoles selectively inhibit starvation&#8208; and rapamycin&#8208;induced autophagy by targeting the lipid kinase VPS34.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural&#8208;product (NP) design combines natural product fragments to provide unprecedented NP&#8208;inspired compounds not accessible by biosynthesis, but endowed with biological relevance. Since the bioactivity of pseudo&#8208;NPs may be unprecedented or unexpected, they are best evaluated in target agnostic cell&#8208;based assays monitoring entire cellular programs or complex phenotypes. Here, the Cinchona alkaloid scaffold was merged with the indole ring system to synthesize indocinchona alkaloids by Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation. Exploration of indocinchona alkaloid bioactivities in phenotypic assays revealed a novel class of azaindole&#8208;containing autophagy inhibitors, the azaquindoles. Subsequent characterization of the most potent compound, azaquindole&#8208;1, in the morphological cell painting assay, guided target identification efforts. In contrast to the parent Cinchona alkaloids, azaquindoles selectively inhibit starvation&#8208; and rapamycin&#8208;induced autophagy by targeting the lipid kinase VPS34.

      <title>Salts of HCN&#8208;Cyanide Aggregates: [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and [CN(HCN)3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>
Flexible cyanides: Bulky cations and fast crystallization allowed the isolation and structurally characterization of examples of HCN&#8208;cyanide aggregates [CN(HCN)2)]&#8722; and [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; in the solid state. X&#8208;ray structure elucidation revealed hydrogen&#8208;bridged linear [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; molecular ions in the crystal.







Abstract
Although pure hydrogen cyanide can spontaneously polymerize or even explode, when initiated by small amounts of bases (e.g. CN&#8722;), the reaction of liquid HCN with [WCC]CN (WCC=weakly coordinating cation=Ph4P, Ph3PNPPh3=PNP) was investigated. Depending on the cation, it was possible to extract salts containing the formal dihydrogen tricyanide [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and trihydrogen tetracyanide ions [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; from liquid HCN when a fast crystallization was carried out at low temperatures. X&#8208;ray structure elucidation revealed hydrogen&#8208;bridged linear [CN(HCN)2]&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped [CN(HCN)3]&#8722; molecular ions in the crystal. Both anions can be considered members of highly labile cyanide&#8208;HCN solvates of the type [CN(HCN)n]&#8722; (n=1, 2, 3 &#8230;) as well as formal polypseudohalide ions.

      <title>From Decades to Minutes: Steps Toward the Structure of Strychnine 1910&#8211;1948 and the Application of Today's Technology</title>
      <dc:description>
Strychnine was the last and greatest of natural products whose structure was determined using the classical methods. This 40&#8208;year story is told by following the trail of 20 key publications, mostly by Robert Robinson, leading up to his tentative, and ultimately R.&#8197;B. Woodward's, conclusive assignment. Modern quantum mechanical computations are used to select the actual strychnine structure from Robinson's many working hypotheses.







Abstract
Between 1910 and 1947, Robert Robinson (primarily), among others, published numerous proposed structures for strychnine. Robinson published 17 of his strychnine papers with his doctoral advisor William Henry Perkin,&#8197;Jr., though all but two appeared after Robinson had taken his first permanent academic position. This Essay analyzes 20 key publications leading up to Robinson's (correct, then incorrect, then correct again though not definitively) proposal and Woodward's assignment of the actual structure of strychnine. We subjected the assignment of the strychnine structure to a modern computational quantum chemistry workflow. By computing, with density functional theory, 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR chemical shifts for the literature&#8208;proposed strychnine structures, we were able to rule out most incorrect structures. 13C&#8197;NMR predictions were better at this, but 1H&#8197;NMR chemical shifts were helpful. A comparison is made between the consequences of publishing erroneous ideas in the first half of the 20th century and doing so in the 21st century.

      <title>Lewis Acid Coordination Redirects S&#8208;Nitrosothiol Signaling Output</title>
      <dc:description>
S&#8208;Nitrosothiols (RSNOs) serve as air&#8208;stable reservoirs for nitric oxide in biology and are responsible for a myriad of physiological responses. O&#8208;coordination by a Lewis acid both dramatically facilitates RSNO reduction and changes its signaling output from NO to N2O, following protonation of the Lewis acid capped hyponitrite that forms upon reduction.







Abstract
S&#8208;Nitrosothiols (RSNOs) serve as air&#8208;stable reservoirs for nitric oxide in biology. While copper enzymes promote NO release from RSNOs by serving as Lewis acids for intramolecular electron&#8208;transfer, redox&#8208;innocent Lewis acids separate these two functions to reveal the effect of coordination on structure and reactivity. The synthetic Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 coordinates to the RSNO oxygen atom, leading to profound changes in the RSNO electronic structure and reactivity. Although RSNOs possess relatively negative reduction potentials, B(C6F5)3 coordination increases their reduction potential by over 1&#8197;V into the physiologically accessible +0.1&#8197;V vs. NHE. Outer&#8208;sphere chemical reduction gives the Lewis acid stabilized hyponitrite dianion trans&#8208;[LA&#8208;O&#8208;N=N&#8208;O&#8208;LA]2&#8722; [LA=B(C6F5)3], which releases N2O upon acidification. Mechanistic and computational studies support initial reduction to the [RSNO&#8208;B(C6F5)3] radical anion, which is susceptible to N&#8722;N coupling prior to loss of RSSR.

The synthetic Lewis acid B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coordinates to the RSNO oxygen atom, leading to profound changes in the RSNO electronic structure and reactivity. Although RSNOs possess relatively negative reduction potentials, B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; coordination increases their reduction potential by over 1&#8197;V into the physiologically accessible +0.1&#8197;V vs. NHE. Outer&#8208;sphere chemical reduction gives the Lewis acid stabilized hyponitrite dianion &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;[LA&#8208;O&#8208;N=N&#8208;O&#8208;LA]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; [LA=B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], which releases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O upon acidification. Mechanistic and computational studies support initial reduction to the [RSNO&#8208;B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] radical anion, which is susceptible to N&#8722;N coupling prior to loss of RSSR.&lt;/p&gt;
