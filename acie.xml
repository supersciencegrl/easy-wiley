      <title>Integrating Biomass into Organonitrogen Chemical Supply Chain: Production of Pyrrole and D&#8208;Proline from Furfural</title>
      <dc:description>Production of renewable, high&#8208;value N&#8208;containing chemicals from lignocellulose will expand product diversity and increase the economic competitiveness of biorefinery. Herein, we report a single&#8208;step conversion of furfural to pyrrole in 75% yield as a key N&#8208;containing building block, achieved via tandem decarbonylation&#8208;amination reactions over tailor&#8208;designed Pd@S&#8208;1 and H&#8208;beta zeolite catalytic system. Pyrrole was further transformed into DL&#8208;proline in two steps following carboxylation with CO  2  and hydrogenation over Rh/C catalyst. After treating with  Escherichia coli  , valuable D&#8208;proline was obtained in theoretically maximum yield (50%) bearing 99% ee. The report here establishes a route bridging commercial commodity feedstock from biomass with high&#8208;value organonitrogen chemicals through pyrrole as a hub molecule.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthetic Tailoring of Graphene Nanostructures with Zigzag&#8208;Edged Topologies: Progress and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>Both experimental and theoretical investigations have revealed that the chemical and physical properties of graphene are crucially determined by their topological structures. Therefore, the atomically precise synthesis of graphene nanostructures is essential for studying their fundamental physiochemical properties as well as their introduction in promising applications. Among the large family of graphene nanostructures, those containing rich or fully zigzag&#8208;edged structures exhibit unique electronic, magnetic, and optoelectronic properties owing to their spin&#8208;polarized edge state. Prominent examples include the open&#8208;shell biradical peri&#8208;tetracene, &#960;&#8208;extended triangulene with triradicals, and fully zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with localized edge states. Recent progress in the development of synthetic methodologies and strategies as well as characterization methods has rendered access to this class of unprecedented graphene nanostructures with rich zigzag edges, which used to be a purely molecular objective in theoretical chemistry. Thus, clear insight into the structure&#8208;property relationships has become possible before exploring future applications in organic carbon&#8208;based electronic and spintronic devices. In this minireview, we discuss the recent progress in the controlled synthesis of zigzag&#8208;edged graphene nanostructures with different topologies through a bottom&#8208;up synthetic strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Manipulation of Stacking Arrangements in Three&#8208;Dimensional Zeolites Built from Two&#8208;Dimensional Zeolitic Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thin zeolitic nanosheets have emerged as fascinating materials for catalysis and separation. The controllability of nanosheets stacking is extremely challenging in the chemistry of two&#8208;dimensional zeolitic materials. So far, the organization of zeolitic nanosheets in hydrothermal synthesis has been limited by the lack of tunable control over the guest&#8208;host interactions between organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDAs) and zeolitic nanosheets. Here, we report a direct synthetic methodology that enables systematic manipulation of the aluminosilicate MWW&#8208;type nanosheets stacking. Variable control of guest&#8208;host interactions is rationally achieved by synergistically altering the charge density of OSDAs and synthetic silica&#8208;to&#8208;alumina composition. These finely&#8208;controlled interactions allow the successful preparation of series of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) zeolites with MWW&#8208;layer stacking in wide ranges from variations of disorder to fully&#8208;order, leading to tunable catalytic activity in cracking reaction. These results highlight unprecedented opportunities to modulate zeolitic nanosheets arrangement in 3D zeolites whose structure can be tailored for catalysis and separation.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling Oxidation State of Pt Single&#8208;Atoms for Maximizing Catalytic Activity</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as promising materials in heterogeneous catalysis. Previous studies reported controversial results about the relative level in activity for SACs and nanoparticles (NPs). These works have focused on the effect of metal atom arrangement, without considering the oxidation state of SACs. Here, we immobilized Pt single&#8208;atoms on defective ceria, and controlled the oxidation state of Pt SACs, from highly oxidized (Pt0: 16.6 at%) to highly metallic state (Pt0: 83.8 at%). The Pt SACs with controlled oxidation state were then employed for oxidation of CO, CH4, or NO, and their activity was compared with Pt NPs. The highly oxidized Pt SACs presented poorer activity than Pt NPs, whereas metallic Pt SACs showed higher activity. The Pt SAC reduced at 300 &#176;C showed the highest activity for all the oxidations. The Pt SACs with controlled oxidation state revealed a crucial missing link between activity and SACs.</dc:description>

      <title>Toward Efficient Synthesis of Chiral Zeolites: A Rational Strategy for Fluoride&#8208;Free Synthesis of STW&#8208;Type Zeolite</title>
      <dc:description>The STW&#8208;type zeolite is significantly attractive for developing novel enantioselective syntheses/separation of chiral compounds because it is the only chiral zeolitic microporous material whose enantioenriched synthesis has been achieved. Besides the conventional industries where zeolites are used, STW should have diverse industrial applications such as in the pharmaceutical and food industries. However, the toxic and caustic fluoride required for synthesizing STW severely hinders its commercialization by mass production. Here, we report the first example of fluoride&#8208;free STW synthesis, where the two roles of fluoride&#8212;formation of a zeolitic framework rich in tetravalent T&#8208;atoms and promotion of double 4&#8208;membered ring unit formation&#8212;were substituted by dry gel conversion and Ge addition, respectively. The obtained STW was highly crystalline, with a similar micropore volume and thermal stability as those of original fluoride&#8208;based STW. Our approach is promising not only for the fluoride&#8208;free synthesis of enantiomeric STW but also for general fluoride&#8208;free syntheses.</dc:description>

      <title>Removal of Organic Micropollutants from Water by Macrocycle&#8208;Containing Covalent Polymer Networks</title>
      <dc:description>Access to clean drinking water is a recognized societal need that touches on the health and livelihood of millions of people worldwide. This is providing an incentive to develop new water&#8208;treatment technologies. Traditional technologies, while widespread, are usually inefficient at removing organic pollutants from sewage or so&#8208;called grey water. Macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks have begun to attract attention in the context of water treatment owing to the inherent stability provided by the polymer backbones and their ability to capture micropollutant guests as the result of tunable macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions. In this minireview, we summarize recent advances (from 2016 to mid&#8208;2020) involving the removal of organic micropollutants from water using macrocycle&#8208;containing covalent polymer networks.

      <title>Ammonia oxidation enhanced by photopotential generated by plasmonic excitation of a bimetallic electrocatalyst</title>
      <dc:description>We study how visible light influences the activity of an electrocatalyst composed of Au and Pt nanoparticles. The bimetallic composition imparts a dual functionality: the Pt component catalyses the electrochemical oxidation of ammonia to liberate hydrogen and the Au component absorbs visible light by the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances. Under visible&#8208;light excitation, this catalyst exhibits enhanced electrochemical ammonia oxidation kinetics, outperforming previously reported electrochemical schemes. We trace the enhancement to a photochemical potential resulting from electron&#8211;hole carriers generated in the electrocatalyst by plasmonic excitation. The photopotential responsible for enhanced kinetics scales linearly with the light intensity&#8211;a general design principle for eliciting superlative photoelectrochemical performance from catalysts comprised of plasmonic metals or hybrids.

      <title>Suppressing Interfacial Charge Recombination in Electron Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 21%</title>
      <dc:description>The performances of reported electron transport layer (ETL)&#8208;free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still inferior to ETL&#8208;containing devices. This is mainly due to severe interfacial charge recombination occurred at the transparent conducting oxide (TCO)/perovskite interface, where the photo&#8208;injected electrons in the TCO can travel back to recombine with holes in the perovskite layer. Herein, we for the first time demonstrate that a non&#8208;annealed, insulating, amorphous metal oxyhydroxide, atomic&#8208;scale thin interlayer (~3 nm) between the TCO and perovskite facilitates electron tunnelling and suppresses the interfacial charge recombination. This largely reduced the interfacial charge recombination loss and achieved a record efficiency of 21.1% for  n&#8208;i&#8208;p  structured ETL&#8208;free PSCs, outperforming their ETL&#8208;containing metal oxide counterparts (18.7%), as well as narrowing the efficiency gap with high&#8208;efficiency PSCs employing highly crystalline TiO  2  ETLs.</dc:description>

      <title>Ferromagnetically Coupled S = 1 Chains in Crystals of Verdazyl&#8208;Nitronyl Nitroxide Diradicals</title>
      <dc:description>Thermally stable organic diradicals with a triplet ground state along with large singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap have significant potential for advanced technological applications. A series of phenylene&#8208;bridged diradicals with oxoverdazyl and nitronyl nitroxide units were synthesized  via  a palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the corresponding iodoverdazyls with a nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide gold(I) complex with high yields (up to 82%). The synthesized diradicals exhibit high stability and do not decompose in an inert atmosphere up to 180 &#176;C. The magnetic properties of prepared phenylene&#8208;coupled diradicals were investigated and magneto&#8208;structural correlations were established. For the studied diradicals, both substantial antiferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#187; &#8208;64&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) and ferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#179; 25 and 100&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) intramolecular exchange interactions were observed. The sign of the exchange interaction is determined both by the bridging moiety (  para  &#8208; or  meta  &#8208;phenylene) and by the type of oxoverdazyl block (  C  &#8208;linked or  N  &#8208;linked). Upon crystallization, diradicals with the triplet ground state form unique one&#8208;dimensional exchange&#8208;coupled chains with strong intra&#8208; and weak inter&#8208;diradical ferromagnetic coupling.</dc:description>

The magnetic properties of prepared phenylene&#8208;coupled diradicals were investigated and magneto&#8208;structural correlations were established. For the studied diradicals, both substantial antiferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#187; &#8208;64&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) and ferromagnetic (D  E  ST  &#179; 25 and 100&#160;cm  &#8211;1  ) intramolecular exchange interactions were observed. The sign of the exchange interaction is determined both by the bridging moiety (  para  &#8208; or  meta  &#8208;phenylene) and by the type of oxoverdazyl block (  C  &#8208;linked or  N  &#8208;linked). Upon crystallization, diradicals with the triplet ground state form unique one&#8208;dimensional exchange&#8208;coupled chains with strong intra&#8208; and weak inter&#8208;diradical ferromagnetic coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Surface Reconstruction of Ultrathin Palladium Nanosheets during Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>A surface reconstructing phenomenon is discovered on a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin Pd nanosheets catalyst for aqueous CO2 electroreduction. The pristine nanosheets with dominant (111) facet sites are transformed into crumpled sheet&#8208;like structures prevalent in electrocatalytically active (100) sites. The reconstruction increases the density of active sites and reduces the CO binding strength on Pd surfaces, remarkably promoting the CO2 reduction to CO. A high CO faradaic efficiency of 93% is achieved with a site&#8208;specific activity of 6.6 mA cm&#8208;2 at a moderate overpotential of 590 mV on reconstructed 50 nm Pd nanosheets. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest the CO intermediate as a key factor driving the structural transformation during CO2 reduction. This study highlights the dynamic nature of defective metal nanosheets under reaction conditions and suggests new opportunities in surface engineering of 2D metal nanostructures to tune their electrocatalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Negative pressure pyrolysis induced highly accessible single sites dispersed on 3D graphene frameworks for enhanced oxygen reduction</title>
      <dc:description>The surface structure of supports is related to the properties of catalytic sites and their spatial structure also plays a dominant role in the mass transfer during catalysis process. Herein, we report a negative pressure pyrolysis to access dense single metal sites (Co, Fe, Ni etc.) with high accessibility dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) graphene frameworks (GFs), during which the differential pressure between inside and outside of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) promotes the cleavage of the derived&#8208;carbon layers and gradual expansion of mesopores. In situ transmission electron microscopy and Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller tests reveal the formed 3D GFs possess an enhanced mesoporosity and external surface area, which greatly favor the mass transport and utilization of metal sites. This contributes to an excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity (with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.901 V vs. RHE). Theoretical calculations verify that selective carbon cleavage near Co centers can efficiently lower the overall ORR theoretical overpotential in comparison with intact atomic configuration. This work discovers the structure&#8208;property correlations that provides an idea of designing highly accessible catalysts for practical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Invoked Through Norbornyl&#8208;Driven Intermolecular Interaction Intensification with Anomalous Reversible Solid&#8208;State Photochromism</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, norbornyl (NB), a bulky annular nonconjugated (CN&#8208;type) spacer, is melded into &#960; systems to construct two groups of ladder&#8208;type room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) luminogens. The effect of the CN&#8208;type moiety on &#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions, packing modes and RTP performance is explored systematically. The experimental and computational results demonstrate the versatility of NB in reducing &#960;&#8722;&#960; distances and synergistically intensifying the intermolecular interactions, which not only induces intersystem crossing from S 1  to T n  but also diminishes the nonradiative decay of triplet excitons. Impressively, 1800&#8208;fold phosphorescence lifetime enhancement is achieved in comparison with the reference compounds without NB. The molecular packing and RTP performance can be further modulated by the length of the backbones and terminal end&#8208;groups. It is quite peculiar that NB&#8208;annulated phthalic acid exhibits reversible photochromism in the solid state, likely due to the formation of persistent radical pairs.

      <dc:description>The utilization of N&#8208;centered radicals to synthesize nitrogen&#8208;containing compounds has attracted considerable attention recently, due to their powerful reactivities and the concomitant construction of C&#8722;N bonds. However, the generation and control of N&#8208;centered radicals remain particularly challenging.

Furthermore, after the kinetic studies, Raman spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, the reaction mechanism is thoroughly investigated, revealing the aminations likely involve the directly homolytic cleavage of N&#8722;H bonds and subsequently controllable 1,5&#8208; or 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>We report the reconfigurable assembly of rod&#8208;shaped eutectic gallium&#8208;indium alloy (EGaIn) liquid metal colloidal motors by mimicking the dandelion flower&#8217;s growing process. The EGaIn nanorod with a diameter of 210 nm and a length of 850 nm was synthesized via an ultrasound&#8208;assisted physical dispersion and demonstrated to be a core&#8208;shell structure with a 30 nm GaOOH shell and zero&#8208;valent liquid core. The EGaIn motors could autonomously move at a speed of 41.2 &#956;m/s under an acoustic field. By modulating the frequency of applied acoustic field, these acoustically&#8208;driven EGaIn colloidal motors could self&#8208;organize into various stripe and round patterns and then a stably dandelion flower&#8208;like cluster, like a flower&#8217;s growing process. This dandelion flower&#8208;like EGaIn colloidal motor clusters could collectively move and redisperse by changing the applied acoustic frequency. Numerical simulation reveals that the reconfigurable EGaIn dandelion flower&#8208;like clusters were synergistically performed by the acoustic propulsion in combination with steric repulsion and hydrodynamics. Compared with passive nanospheres, the EGaIn colloidal motors were proved with promising ability of locomotion and assembly. Such an active dandelion flower&#8208;like cluster provides a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solution to prepare reconfigurable active liquid metal colloidal assembles with controlled shapes and locomotion.</dc:description>

      <title>A Gallium(III) Complex that Engages Protein Disulfide Isomerase A3 (PDIA3) as an Anticancer Target</title>
      <dc:description>Gallium(III)&#8208;based drugs have gained momentum in cancer therapy for the relevance to iron&#8208;dependent anticancer activity. Judicious choice of ligands is critical to design Ga(III) drugs with improved oral bioavailability, antitumor efficacy and even the distinct mechanism from simple Ga(III) salts. Herein, we first describe Ga(III) complexes of planar tetradentate salen ligands (salen=2,3&#8208;bis[(4&#8208;dialkylamino&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxybenzylidene)amino] but&#8208;2&#8208;enedinitrile)) as well as labile axial solvent ligands, which display tumor growth inhibition  in vitro  and  in vivo  comparable to cisplatin. Extensive chemical biology approaches employing confocal fluorescence microscopy, western blotting, mRNA profiling, chemical proteomics and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) provide compelling evidences that PDIA3, one member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response functionally, is a direct target of  Ga&#8208;1  in&#8197;vitro  and in cells. This work offers a new route to designing and synthesizing Ga&#8208;based drugs supported by planar tetradentate ligands, and reveals that PDIA3 inhibition is an important target that triggers ER stress, mitochondria dysfunction, and subsequent cell death.</dc:description>

      <title>How to Remove the Capping Agent from Pd Nanocubes without Destructing Their Surface Structure for the Maximization of Catalytic Activity?</title>
      <dc:description>We report a robust method for effectively removing the chemisorbed Br&#8722; ions, a capping agent, from the surface of Pd nanocubes to maximize their catalytic activity. The Br&#8722; ions can be removed by simply heating the sample in water, but the desorption of Br&#8722; ions will expose the underneath Pd atoms to the O2 from air for the formation of a relatively thick oxide layer. During potential cycling, the oxide layer evolves into detrimental features such as steps and terraces. By introducing a trace amount of hydrazine into the system, the Br&#8722; ions can be removed by heating without forming a thick oxide layer. The as&#8208;cleaned nanocubes show greatly enhanced activity toward formic acid oxidation. This cleaning method can also remove Br&#8722; ions from Rh nanocubes and it is expected to work for other combinations of nanocrystals and capping agents.</dc:description>

      <title>Water&#8208;Induced Structural Dynamic Process in Molecular Sieve&#160;under Mild Hydrothermal Conditions: A Novel Ship&#8208;in&#8208;Bottle Strategy for Acidity Identification and Catalyst Modification</title>
      <dc:description>Water is the most important and universal substance in nature. People have been striving to pursue and discover water&#8208;related processes and imitate these important discoveries for the benefit of mankind. As a successful example of human imitating the formation of natural materials, molecular sieves have been synthesized under hydrothermal condition and applied in industry.

Dynamic and reversible breakage&#8208;bonding of T&#8208;O&#8208;T bonds in silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) occurs due to interactions between gaseous water and molecular sieve framework under mild hydrothermal conditions and is confirmed by successful detection of the incorporation of  17  O from H  2  17  O into molecular sieve framework. Successfully encapsulation of bulky molecules trimethylphosphine and pyridine (kinetic diameters much larger than the pore size of SAPO&#8208;34) into CHA cavities consolidated the water&#8208;induced dynamic process. Consequently, new insights into the dynamic features of molecular sieve in the atmosphere of water are provided.

      <dc:description>The electroreduction of carbon dioxide using renewable electricity is an appealing strategy for the sustainable synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Extensive research has focused on the production of ethylene, ethanol and  n  &#8208;propanol, but more complex C  4  molecules have been scarcely reported.

Electrolyses of possible molecular intermediates, coupled with density functional theory, led us to propose that CO  2  first electroreduces to acetaldehyde&#8212;a key C  2  intermediate to 1&#8208;butanol.

      <title>Tuning Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance in Metalloporphyrin&#8208;based Wires via Supramolecular Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Nature has developed amazing supramolecular constructs to deliver outstanding charge transport capabilities using metalloporphyrin&#8208;based supramolecular arrays.

Herein, we reported an interesting finding that renal clearable near&#8208;infrared emitting glutathione coated silver nanoparticles of ~2nm (GS&#8208;AgNPs) can selectively accumulate in the submandibular salivary gland, followed by being excreted in its   excretory duct.

      <title>Identifying the Geometric Site Dependence of Spinel Oxides for the Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
      <dc:description>Co&#8208;based spinel oxides are considered as promising catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high&#8208;value chemicals. Co  3  O  4  &#160;is of mixed valences with the presence of both Co  2+  &#160;and Co  3+  &#160;at different atom locations. Identifying the activity of each atomic site is critical to propose the design principle of advanced electrocatalysts, and tuning the geometrical sites at the atom level in Co  3  O  4  &#160;could lead to significant modifications&#160;on its electronic and thus modulate the catalytic activities for the electrooxidation of HMF. A typical spinel lattice contains a tetrahedral Co  2+  &#160;site and two octahedral Co  3+  &#160;sites. In this work, the impact of different sites in Co  3  O  4  was uncovered by selectively building block in the tetrahedral site and&#160;the octahedral site by Zn  2+  &#160;and Al  3+  &#160;respectively. It was found that the Co  3+  &#160;in octahedral site tends to be oxidized to the high valence of cobalt oxyhydroxide as the active centers and thus has higher activity than tetrahedral Co  2+  &#160;sites for HMF oxidation. The NH  3  &#160;TPD results indicate that the tetrahedral Co  2+  &#160;has abundant Lewis acidic adsorption sites in Co  3  O  4&#160;  and CoAl  2  O  4,  &#160;and the tetrahedral sites can provide chemical adsorption sites for HMF oxidation. Based on the finding of the geometric site dependence, the HMF oxidation activity was further improved by the replacement with Cu  2+  &#160;in the tetrahedral site of spinel oxides (CuCo  2  O  4  ). The CuCo  2  O  4  &#160;shows 4&#8208;fold enhancement for the HMF oxidation&#160;relative to Co  3  O  4  &#160;and shows a record performance among Co&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

      <title>Integrating Time&#8208;Resolved Imaging Information by Single&#8208;Luminophore Dual Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
      <dc:description>The fact that the lifetime of photoluminescence often is difficult to access because of&#160; the weakness of the emission signals, seriously limits the possibility to gain local bioimaging information in time&#8208;resolved luminescence probing. We herein aim to provide a solution to this problem by creating a general photophysical strategy based on the use of molecular probes designed for single&#8208;luminophore dual thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The structural and conformational design makes the dual TADF strong both in diluted solution and in aggregated state, enabling less sensitivity to oxygen quenching and a unique dual&#8208;channel time&#8208;resolved imaging capability. As the two TADF signals show mutual complementarity during probing, a dual&#8208;channel mean lifetime mapping is established to reduce the time&#8208;resolved&#160; imaging distortion by 30&#8208;40%. Consequently, the leading intracellular local imaging information is serialized and integrated as compared to any single time&#8208;resolved signal, leading to a significant improvement of the probing capacity.</dc:description>

      <title>DMSO Enabled Selective Radical O&#8208;H Activation of 1,3(4)&#8208;Diols</title>
      <dc:description>Selectivity control is one of the central topics in organic chemistry. Although the alkoxyl radical induced unprecedented transformations have drawn more attentions, compared to the booming selective C&#8208;H activation, the selective radical O&#8208;H activation remains less explored. Herein, we report a novel selective radical O&#8208;H activation strategy of diols by combining spatial effect with proton coupled electron transfer (PCET). The common molecule DMSO is found to be an essential reagent that enables the regioselective transformation of diols. Mechanistic studies indicated the existence of the alkoxyl radical and the selective interaction between DMSO and hydroxyls. Moreover, the distal C&#8208;C cleavage is realized by this selective alkoxyl radical initiation protocol.</dc:description>

      <title>Catalytic oxidation of CO on a curved Pt(111) surface: simultaneous ignition at all facets through a transient CO&#8208;O complex</title>
      <dc:description>The catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) on transition metals, such as platinum (Pt), is commonly viewed as a sharp transition from the CO&#8208;inhibited surface to the active metal, covered with oxygen (O). However, we find that minor amounts of O are present in the CO&#8208;poisoned layer that explain why, surprisingly, CO desorbs at stepped and flat Pt crystal planes at once, regardless of the reaction conditions. Using near&#8208;ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoemission and a curved Pt(111) crystal we probe the chemical composition at surfaces with variable step density during the CO oxidation reaction. The systematic analysis of carbon and oxygen core levels across the curved crystal reveals that, right before light&#8208;off, subsurface O builds up within (111) terraces. This is key to trigger the simultaneous ignition of the catalytic reaction at different Pt surfaces, as indicated by ab&#8208;initio theory: a CO&#8208;Pt&#8208;O complex is formed that equals the CO chemisorption energy at terraces and steps, leading to the abrupt desorption of poisoning CO from all crystal facets at the same temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Identification of amino acid residues responsible for C&#8208;H activation in type&#8208;III copper enzymes by generating tyrosinase activity in a catechol oxidase</title>
      <dc:description>Tyrosinases (TYRs) catalyze the hydroxylation of phenols and the oxidation of the resulting  o  &#8208;diphenols to  o  &#8208;quinones, while catechol oxidases (COs) exhibit only the latter activity. Aurone synthase (AUS) is not able to react with classical tyrosinase substrates like tyramine and  L  &#8208;tyrosine, while it can hydroxylate its natural substrate isoliquiritigenin. The structural difference of TYRs, COs and AUS at the base of their divergent catalytic activities is still a puzzle. Therefore, a library of 39 mutants of AUS from  Coreopsis grandiflora  (  Cg  AUS) was generated and the activity studies proved that the reactivity of the three conserved histidines (HisA  2  , HisB  1  and HisB  2  ) is tuned by their adjacent residues (HisB  1  +1, HisB  2  +1 and waterkeeper residue) either to react as stronger bases or / and to stabilize a position permissive for substrate proton shuffling. In the newly proposed monophenolase reaction cycle the deprotonation of the incoming monophenolic substrate  en route  to the active  oxy&#8208;  site is supported by one of the three conserved histidines HisA  2  , HisB  1  and HisB  2  , initiating the C&#8208;H activation in TYRs in contrast to COs. In particular, we present mutants with a TYR activity of the same order of magnitude as found in natural plant TYRs, which is a strong indication that the molecular basis of TYR against CO activity has been revealed.

      <title>Tillandsia&#8208;inspired Hygroscopic Photothermal Organogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
      <dc:description>Tillandsia species with degenerated roots have evolved into hygroscopic leaves that absorb moisture from air, transport water molecules from the leaves surface to internal network via osmotic pressure and further hold them for sustainable growing requirements. This interesting biological adaptability has inspired us to develop an integrated hygroscopic photothermal organogel (POG) to achieve a solar&#8208;powered atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). The well&#8208;designed hydrophilic co&#8208;polymeric skeleton is fabricated to accommodate hygroscopic glycerin medium, which enables the POG self&#8208;contained property, mechanically flexibility and synergistic enhancement of moisture sorption. Moreover, the glycerin in the POG allows a rapid water diffusion driven by osmotic effect, thereby quickly reactivating the sorption binding sites for continuous and high&#8208;capacity moisture sorption. In addition, the integration of interpenetrated photothermal component of poly&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;dopamine (P&#8208;Py&#8208;DA) can endow the POG an efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal property for controllable solar&#8208;driven interfacial water releasing. As a result, the integrated POG presents the superhigh equilibrium moisture sorption of 16.01 kg m &#8208;2  at the RH of 90%, and daily water production as high as 2.43 kg m &#8208;2  day &#8208;1  is achieved in actual outdoor experiments.

Herein we report a robust method for the on&#8208;resin preparation of allenamide&#8208;modified peptides, an unexplored functionality for peptides that provides a versatile chemical tool for chemoselective inter&#8208; or intramolecular bridging reactions with thiols. The bridging reaction is biocompatible, occurring spontaneously at pH 7.4 in catalyst free aqueous media. Employing this &#8220;click&#8221; approach, a model peptide was successfully modified with a diverse range of alkyl and aryl thiols with excellent conversions. Furthermore, this technique was demonstrated as a valuable tool to induce spontaneous intramolecular cyclisation by preparation of an oxytocin analogue where the native disulfide bridge was replaced by a vinyl sulfide moiety that in turn was formed via thia&#8208;Michael addition of a cysteine thiol to the allenamide handle.</dc:description>

      <title>General synthesis of single&#8208;atom catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions and room&#8208;temperature Na&#8208;S batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been successfully used for various electrochemical reactions. The synthetic methods for different single metal atoms are specific, however; it is extremely challenging to develop a universal synthesis method for a large range of single&#8208;atom metals. Herein, we report a comprehensive strategy to synthesize a full range of single&#8208;atom metals on carbon matrix, including vanadium (V1), manganese (Mn1), iron (Fe1), cobalt (Co1), nickel (Ni1), copper (Cu1), germanium (Ge1), molybdenum (Mo1), ruthenium (Ru1), rhodium (Rh1), palladium (Pd1), silver (Ag1), indium (In1), tin (Sn1), tungsten (W1), iridium (Ir1), platinum (Pt1), lead (Pb1), and bismuth (Bi1). The extensive applications of various SACs are manifested via their ability to electro&#8208;catalyze typical hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and conversion reactions in novel room&#8208;temperature sodium sulfur batteries (RT&#8208;Na&#8208;S). The enhanced performances for these electrochemical reactions stem from the ability of different single active atoms on local structures to tune their electronic configuration. Significantly, the electrocatalytic behaviors of diverse SACs, assisted by density functional theory calculations, are systematically revealed by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and in&#8208;situ transmission electronic microscopy, providing a strategic library for the general synthesis and extensive applications of SACs in energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is intrinsically associated with lasing applications. Inefficient photon energy transfer to ASE is a long&#8208;standing issue for organic semiconductors that consist of multiple competing radiative decay pathways, far from being rationally regulated from the perspective of molecular arrangements. Herein, we achieve controllable molecular packing motifs by halogen&#8208;bonded cocrystallization, leading to ten times increased radiative decay rate, four times larger ASE radiative decay selectivity and thus remarkable ASE threshold decrease from 223 to 22 &#956;J/cm  2  albeit with a low photoluminescence quantum yield. We have made an in&#8208;depth investigation on the relationship between molecular arrangements, vibration modes, radiative decay profiles and ASE properties. The results suggest that cocrystallization presents a powerful approach to tailor the radiative decay pathways, which is fundamentally important to the development of organic ASE and lasing materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Efficient Trapping of Trace Acetylene from Ethylene in an Ultramicroporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework via Synergistic Effect of High&#8208;Density Open Metal Sites and Electronegative Sites</title>
      <dc:description>Acetylene removal from ethylene is a crucial step in the production of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene, but remains as a daunting challenge due to the similar physicochemical properties between acetylene and ethylene, and is currently met industrially by energy&#8208;intensive cryogenic distillation processes. Herein, we report a robust ultramicroporous metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), Ni3(pzdc)2(7Hade)2 for efficient C2H2/C2H4 separation. Interestingly, this MOF is constructed by hydrogen&#8208;bonding linked one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chains, and features both high&#8208;density open metal sites (OMSs, 2.7 nm&#8208;3) and electronegative oxygen and nitrogen sites arranged on the pore surface as cooperative binding sites. Notably, such cooperative binding sites rarely co&#8208;exist in other MOFs due to the strong coordination tendency between metal ions and electronegative or basic sites in organic linkers. Systematic studies by theoretical calculations as well as in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) experiments provide evidence for the synergistic adsorption mechanism. As expected, Ni3(pzdc)2(7Hade)2 with S&#8208;shaped 1D pore channels exhibits excellent trace C2H2 capture performance at 0.01 bar with a C2H2 uptake of 60.6 cm3 cm&#8208;3 and high C2H2/C2H4 selectivity, making it a promising material for trace C2H2 trapping from C2H2/C2H4 mixtures.</dc:description>

Compared to edge&#8208;to&#8208;face counterparts, polynorbornenes with face&#8208;to&#8208;face aligned donor and acceptor exhibit much larger oscillator strength and higher photoluminescence quantum yield up to 81% in neat film owing to the enforced cofacial &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions.

      <title>The Power of Iodane&#8208;Guided C&#8722;H Coupling: A Group&#8208;Transfer Strategy in Which a Halogen Works for Its Money</title>
      <dc:description>
I of the tiger: The iodine atom in Ar&#8722;I bonds is commonly conceived as a leaving group. This Minireview discusses a powerful alternative reactivity of iodine substituents by which &#955;3&#8208;iodoarenes direct C&#8722;H coupling events at the corresponding aromatic ring.







Abstract
Hypervalent organoiodane reagents are ubiquitous in organic synthesis, both as oxidants and as electrophilic group&#8208;transfer agents. In addition to these hallmark applications, a complementary strategy is gaining momentum that exploits the ability of &#955;3&#8208;iodanes to undergo iodine&#8208;to&#8208;arene group transfer, for example, via iodonio&#8208;Claisen&#8208;type rearrangement processes. This Minireview discusses recent advances in the use of this method to access a variety of the C&#8722;H&#8208;functionalized iodoarenes. While Section&#8197;2 is focused on the ortho C&#8722;H propargylation, allylation, and the more unusual para C&#8722;H benzylation, Section&#8197;3 is devoted to the C&#8208;arylation of enol and phenol substrates. The accompanying discussion includes mechanistic considerations and goes into the synthetic applications of the final iodoarene cores. The Minireview concludes with further conceptual extensions of the method, including the use of non&#8208;conventional coupling partners (for example, cyanoalkylation), improved access to &#955;3&#8208;iodane building blocks, and the development of iterative approaches to polysubstituted iodoarenes.

In addition, the first NH&#8208;bridged acyclic dimeric cyclophosphazane has been also produced.

      <title>Polysubstituted 5&#8208;Phenylazopyrimidines: Extremely Fast Non&#8208;ionic Photochromic Oscillators</title>
      <dc:description>
Non&#8208;ionic polysubstituted azopyrimidines with strong push&#8211;pull character are promising candidates for extremely fast photochromic oscillators. The fast oscillation is based on photoinduced (E)&#8208;to&#8208;(Z) isomerization of the azo group and the accordingly very fast (Z)&#8208;to&#8208;(E) thermal relaxation. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202007065), E. Proch&#225;zkov&#225;, M. Cig&#225;&#328; et&#8197;al. demonstrate how the relaxation lifetime can be tuned by proper substitution over 8 orders of magnitude from hundreds of milliseconds to several nanoseconds.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Biomolecule&#8208;Based Hydrogels and Their Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Having control: Stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with triggered stiffness properties are attracting growing interest as smart materials for different applications. The Review discusses the design of biomolecule&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels and their applications as self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;memory, and controlled drug&#8208;release matrices, as well as mechanical actuators. Surface&#8208;confined switchable hydrogels and their uses are also introduced.







Abstract
This Review presents polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins as functional stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer scaffolds that yield hydrogels with controlled stiffness. Different physical or chemical triggers can be used to structurally reconfigure the crosslinking units and control the stiffness of the hydrogels. The integration of stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular complexes and stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecular units as crosslinkers leads to hybrid hydrogels undergoing reversible triggered transitions across different stiffness states. Different applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogels are discussed. The assembly of stimuli&#8208;responsive biomolecule&#8208;based hydrogel films on surfaces and their applications are discussed. The coating of drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles with stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels for controlled drug release is also presented.

      <title>Reversible Luminescent Switching in an Organic Cocrystal: Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Induced Crystal&#8208;to&#8208;Crystal Phase Transformation</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transformation of organic cocrystals under multiple external stimuli, such as solvent vapor and heating, accompanied by reversible luminescent switching, is demonstrated by B. Xu et&#8197;al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202002220). The results indicate that the luminescence switching originates from the unique molecular rearrangement of a hydrogen/halogen bond&#8208;directed stack to a &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;directed stack in response to an external stimulus.

      <title>PI by NMR: Probing CH&#8211;&#960; Interactions in Protein&#8211;Ligand Complexes by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
The CH&#8211;&#960; interactions between the CH donor groups of Trp81&#8208;&#950; and Trp81&#8208;&#951; with the aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems of ligand 3 (stylized in blue and green, respectively) are illustrated in the cover picture. The backdrop shows a NMR chemical shift scale into which the Trp81 CH cross peaks are schematically drawn. In the complexed form the CH groups are shifted by up to 2.3&#8197;ppm as they are shielded by the aromatic ring systems of the ligand. As explained by G. Platzer, M. Mayer et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202003732), these upfield shifts are indicative of favorable CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, which are difficult to detect directly in solution by other methods.

      <title>Solar&#8208;Assisted eBiorefinery: Photoelectrochemical Pairing of Oxyfunctionalization and Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Solar eBiorefinery: Inspired by natural photosynthesis, biocatalytic photoelectrochemical (PEC) platforms are gaining prominence for the conversion of solar energy into useful chemicals by combining redox biocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. Deliberate integration of&#160;PEC&#160;systems with redox biocatalytic reactions can simultaneously produce valuable chemicals on both electrodes using solar&#8208;powered electrons and water. C.&#8197;B. Park et&#8197;al. demonstrate in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006893) how this study offers a new direction for solar biotransformation toward eBiorefinery for sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals.
