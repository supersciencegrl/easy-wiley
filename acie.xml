         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia with Copper Supported Rhodium Cluster and Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) provides a promising solution for restoring the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle while enabling a sustainable and decentralized route to source ammonia. Here, we demonstrate a novel electrocatalyst for NITRR consisting of Rh clusters and single&#8208;atoms dispersed onto Cu nanowires (NWs), which delivers a partial current density of 162 mA cm&#8722;2 for NH3 production and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93% at &#8722;0.2 V vs. RHE. The highest ammonia yield rate reached a record value of 1.27 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Detailed investigations by electron spin resonance, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory modeling suggest that the high activity originates from the synergistic catalytic cooperation between Rh and Cu sites, whereby adsorbed hydrogen on Rh sites transfer to vicinal *NO intermediate species adsorbed on Cu promoting the hydrogenation and ammonia formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;binary Encoded Nucleic Acid Barcodes Directly Readable by a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely simple molecular barcoding strategy is proposed based on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic DNA oligomers and direct nanopore decoding. The composition of the barcode probe is highly programmable, and in principle 14n unique step&#8208;shaped barcode patterns can be generated without nanopore sequencing. Different protein and microRNA targets were identified using this strategy, showing its generality in single molecule sensing.







Abstract
A large collection of unique molecular barcodes is useful in the simultaneous sensing or screening of molecular analytes. Though the sequence of DNA has been widely applied to encode for molecular barcodes, decoding of these barcodes is normally assisted by sequencing. We here demonstrate a barcode system based solely on self&#8208;assembly of synthetic nucleic acids and direct nanopore decoding. Each molecular barcode is composed of &#8220;n&#8221; distinct information nodes in a non&#8208;binary manner and can be sequentially scanned and decoded by a Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) nanopore. Nanopore events containing step&#8208;shaped features were consistently reported. 14 unique information nodes were developed which in principle could encode for 14n unique molecular barcodes in a barcode containing &#8220;n&#8221; information nodes. These barcode probes were adapted to detect different antibody proteins or cancer&#8208;related microRNAs, suggesting their immediate application in a wide variety of sensing applications.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Fluorescent Monitoring of Kinetically Controlled Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly of Atom&#8208;Precise Cu8 Nanocluster</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the scheme of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), optical&#8208;engineering was performed for real&#8208;time monitoring of the self&#8208;assembly process of Cu8a with various kinetic long&#8208;lived intermediates, leading to a structure&#8211;property relationship being established.







Abstract
Kinetically stable and long&#8208;lived intermediates are crucial in monitoring the progress and understanding of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of diverse aggregated structures with collective functions. Herein, the complex dynamics of an atomically precise CuI nanocluster [Cu8(tBuC6H4S)8(PPh3)4] (Cu8a) is systematically investigated. Remarkably, by monitoring the aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and electron microscopy of the kinetically stable intermediates in real time, the directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) process of Cu8a is deduced. The polymorphism and different emission properties of Cu NCs aggregates were successfully captured, allowing the structure&#8211;optical property relationship to be established. More importantly, the utilization of a mathematical &#8220;permutation and combination&#8221; ideology by introducing a heterogeneous luminescent agent of a carbon dot (CD) to Cu8a aggregates enriches the &#8220;visualization&#8221; fluorescence window, which offers great potential in real time application for optical sensing of materials.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aqueous Two&#8208;Phase Microcapsules for On&#8208;Demand Drug Release</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic fabrication (left) is used to prepare a two aqueous phase microcapsule (right), which releases a model drug payload on demand in response to focused ultrasound actuation.







Abstract
Traditional implanted drug delivery systems cannot easily change their release profile in real time to respond to physiological changes. Here we present a microfluidic aqueous two&#8208;phase system to generate microcapsules that can release drugs on demand as triggered by focused ultrasound (FUS). The biphasic microcapsules are made of hydrogels with an outer phase of mixed molecular weight (MW) poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate that mitigates premature payload release and an inner phase of high MW dextran with payload that breaks down in response to FUS. Compound release from microcapsules could be triggered as desired; 0.4&#8197;&#956;g of payload was released across 16 on&#8208;demand steps over days. We detected broadband acoustic signals amidst low heating, suggesting inertial cavitation as a key mechanism for payload release. Overall, FUS&#8208;responsive microcapsules are a biocompatible and wirelessly triggerable structure for on&#8208;demand drug delivery over days to weeks.

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes via Catalytic Rhodium to Gold(III) Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic method for the straightforward synthesis of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported via an unprecedented, redox&#8208;neutral Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation. A rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor delivers the monocyclometalated (C^N) gold(III) species.







Abstract
A catalytic method to synthesize a broad array of cyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) complexes is reported here. An unprecedented Rh&#8208;to&#8208;AuIII transmetalation allows the facile transfer of (C^N) ligands between these two metals in a redox&#8208;neutral process. The reaction employs commercially available precursors and proceeds under mild and environmentally benign conditions. Both experimental and computational studies support a multistep transmetalation from rhodium to gold as the underlying mechanism for these transformations. This process involves first, a rate&#8208;determining transfer of the C ligand followed by the subsequent incorporation of the N donor to form the monocyclometalated (C^N)gold(III) species.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Insulator&#8208;Semiconductor Anodes for Ultrastable and Site&#8208;Selective Upconversion Photoinduced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (up to 35&#8197;h) for the generation of intense anti&#8208;Stokes photoinduced electrochemiluminescence onto the whole surface of the metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) photoanode or at a specifically&#8208;chosen location. These results provide solutions for overcoming the instability that has hampered the practical application of upconversion photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL).







Abstract
Photoinduced electrochemiluminescence (PECL) allows the electrochemically assisted conversion of low&#8208;energy photons into high&#8208;energy photons at an electrode surface. This concept is expected to have important implications, however, it is dramatically limited by the stability of the surface, impeding future developments. Here, a series of metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor (MIS) junctions, using photoactive n&#8208;type Si (n&#8208;Si) as a light absorber covered by a few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick protective SiOx/metal (SiOx/M, with M=Ru, Pt, and Ir) overlayers are investigated for upconversion PECL of the model co&#8208;reactant system involving the simultaneous oxidation of tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine. We show that n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Pt and n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir exhibit high photovoltages and record stabilities in operation (35&#8197;h for n&#8208;Si/SiOx/Ir) for the generation of intense PECL with an anti&#8208;Stokes shift of 218&#8197;nm. We also demonstrate that these surfaces can be employed for spatially localized PECL. These unprecedented performances are extremely promising for future applications of PECL.

         <title>Ratiometric and Colorimetric Optical Thermometers Using Emissive Dimeric and Trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}n Moieties Generated in d&#8211;f Heterometallic Assemblies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and {[AuI(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 ions were incorporated in two different supramolecular matrices with GdIII and YIII. The resulting materials exhibit characteristic Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational peaks investigated by ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The formation of Au2 and Au3 moieties yields strong photoluminescence with rich color tunability, providing high&#8208;performance colorimetric and ratiometric thermometer abilities.







Abstract
Gold complexes can generate excimers ([Au2]&#8594;[Au2]*) and exciplexes ([Au3]&#8594;[Au3]*) with light excitation. Four GdIII and YIII complexes were assembled with dimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}2 and trimeric {[Au(SCN)2]&#8722;}3 bis(thiocyanato)gold(I) counterions. The vibrational signature associated with the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au vibrational mode was probed with ultralow frequency (ULF) Raman spectroscopy as a function of temperature. Emission spectroscopy was used to explore photophysical properties. Two broad features in the high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions were associated with the fluorescence and phosphorescence of the gold entities, respectively. Temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence measurements showed that the emission color can be tuned from blue to green via cyan and white. Hence, these complexes can act as colorimetric thermometers. Additionally, a ratiometric thermal sensing ability was incorporated with high sensitivity up to 5&#8201;%&#8201;K&#8722;1 in the cryogenic temperature range.

         <title>Tandem Macrolactone Synthesis: Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Exiguolide by a Macrocyclization/Transannular Pyran Cyclization Strategy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catalytic tandem reaction integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition was developed to access tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones in a single step from readily available linear precursors. To illustrate the feasibility of the synthetic strategy, an antitumor marine macrolide, (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, was synthesized in just 13 steps from a commercially available compound.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyran&#8208;containing macrolactones were synthesized by integrating Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, macrocyclic ring&#8208;closing metathesis, and transannular oxa&#8208;Michael addition under gold and ruthenium catalysis. Single&#8208;step access to a variety of 14&#8208; to 20&#8208;membered macrolactones containing a tetrahydropyran ring was possible from readily available linear precursors in good yields and with moderate to excellent diastereoselectivity. A 13&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;exiguolide, an anticancer marine macrolide, showcased the feasibility of our tandem reaction sequence for macrolactone synthesis and also demonstrated the power of transannular reactions for rapid assembly of the tetrahydropyran rings of the target natural product.

         <title>An Isolable Vinylidene ortho&#8208;Quinone Methide: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methide (VQM), including crystallographic analysis, is described. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM causes its high reactivity, making it capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient aryl group. This study paves an avenue for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.







Abstract
Commonly, an elusive intermediate is generated from a precursor and then trapped and consumed in a reaction. Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been demonstrated as transient axially chiral intermediates in asymmetric catalysis due to their orthogonal &#960;&#8208;bonds forming an allene motif. The current understanding of VQMs is primarily based on time&#8208;resolved absorption, trapping experiments and computational studies. Herein, we report the first isolation and comprehensive characterization of a VQM, including crystallographic analysis. The disturbed aromaticity of the VQM led to its high reactivity as an electrophile or a 4&#960;&#8208;component capable of asymmetric dearomatization of an electron&#8208;deficient phenyl group. Notably, the VQM could be isolated in enantiomerically enriched form, and the subsequent transformation was stereospecific, indicating that the generation of the VQM was involved in the enantiodetermining step. This study paves the way for the direct application of VQMs as starting materials.

         <title>Highly Stable and Reactive Platinum Single Atoms on Oxygen Plasma&#8208;Functionalized CeO2 Surfaces: Nanostructuring and Peroxo Effects</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>

Pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface with oxygen plasma assists the formation of highly dense and stable Pt single atoms resistant to sintering under CO oxidation conditions. The effect is assigned to plasma&#8208;induced oxide nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo species which favor single&#8208;atom metal adsorption. This approach can be utilized for the preparation of stable single&#8208;atom catalysts with a high density of active sites.







Abstract
Atomically dispersed precious metals on oxide supports have recently become increasingly interesting catalytic materials. Nonetheless, their non&#8208;trivial preparation and limited thermal and environmental stability constitutes an issue for their potential applications. Here we demonstrate that an oxygen plasma pre&#8208;treatment of the ceria (CeO2) surface serves to anchor Pt single atoms, making them active and resistant towards sintering in the CO oxidation reaction. Through a combination of experimental results obtained on well&#8208;defined CeO2 films and theory, we show that the O2 plasma causes surface nanostructuring and the formation of surface peroxo (O22&#8722;) species, favoring the uniform and dense distribution of isolated strongly bonded Pt2+ atoms. The promotional effect of the plasma treatment was further demonstrated on powder Pt/CeO2 catalysts. We believe that plasma functionalization can be applied to other metal/oxide systems to achieve tunable and stable catalysts with a high density of active sites.

         <title>K3SbS4 as a Potassium Superionic Conductor with Low Activation Energy for K&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium superionic conductor with low activation energy: W&#8208;doped K3SbS4 possesses a two&#8208;dimensional K migration pathway and a low activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature and is then used in K&#8722;S batteries to block the polysulfide shuttle.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state K&#8208;ion conducting electrolytes are key elements to address the current problems in K secondary batteries. Here, we report a sulfide&#8208;based K&#8208;ion conductor K3SbS4 with a low&#8208;activation energy of 0.27&#8197;eV. W&#8208;doped K3&#8722;xSb1&#8722;xWxS4 (x=0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.12) compounds were also explored for increasing vacancy concentrations and improving ionic conductivity. Among them, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 exhibits the highest conductivity of 1.4&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 40&#8201;&#176;C, which is among the best reported potassium&#8208;ion conductors at ambient temperature. In addition, K2.92Sb0.92W0.08S4 is electrochemically stable with long&#8208;chained potassium polysulfide of K2Sx. A room&#8208;temperature solid potassium&#8211;sulfur (K&#8722;S) battery system has therefore been successfully demonstrated, which is the first K&#8722;S battery prototype using non&#8208;commercial inorganic&#8208;based electrolyte to block the polysulfide shuttle.

         <title>Distal Ruthenaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H Bromination with Aqueous HBr</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization has been accomplished, affording the positionally selective bromination product in an undivided cell by the catalysis of readily available RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr as the brominating agent.







Abstract
While electrochemical ortho&#8208;selective C&#8722;H activations are well established, distal C&#8722;H activations continue to be underdeveloped. In contrast, we herein describe the electrochemical meta&#8208;C&#8722;H functionalization. The remote C&#8722;H bromination was accomplished in an undivided cell by RuCl3&#8901;3&#8201;H2O with aqueous HBr. The electrohalogenation proceeded under exogenous ligand&#8208; and electrolyte&#8208;free conditions. Notably, pyrazolylarenes were meta&#8208;selectively brominated at the benzenoid moiety, rather than on the electron&#8208;rich pyrazole ring for the first time. Mechanistic studies were suggestive of an initial ruthenacycle formation, and a subsequent ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand hydrogen transfer (LLHT) process to liberate the brominated product.

         <title>Transforming Dyes into Fluorophores: Exciton&#8208;Induced Emission with Chain&#8208;like Oligo&#8208;BODIPY Superstructures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dark BODIPY dyes are able to fully recover their fluorescence properties when linked via a flexible ethylene tether. Various excited state deactivation channels are shown to become drastically mitigated by formation of stable excitons within conformationally unstable, discrete superstructures. This study might open doors to a novel assay for detection and visualization of spatial, molecular encounters.







Abstract
Herein we present a systematic study demonstrating to which extent exciton formation can amplify fluorescence based on a series of ethylene&#8208;bridged oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. A set of non&#8208; and weakly fluorescent BODIPY motifs was selected and transformed into discrete, chain&#8208;like oligomers by linkage via a flexible ethylene tether. The prepared superstructures constitute excitonically active entities with non&#8208;conjugated, Coulomb&#8208;coupled oscillators. The non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels of Internal Conversion (IC), also combined with an upstream reductive Photoelectron Transfer (rPET) and Intersystem Crossing (ISC) were addressed at the monomeric state and the evolution of fluorescence and (non&#8208;)radiative decay rates studied along the oligomeric series. We demonstrate that a &#8220;masked&#8221; fluorescence can be fully reactivated irrespective of the imposed conformational rigidity. This work challenges the paradigm that a collective fluorescence enhancement is limited to sterically induced motional restrictions.

         <title>Leveraging Electron&#8208;Deficient Iminium Intermediates in a General Synthesis of Valuable Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of aminals as precursors for iminium ion has been limited to methylene derivatives, thus hampering its broader use. By employing electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions an obvious hurdle of the methodology is overcome, whilst generating highly desirable motifs. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.







Abstract
The development of reactions converting alkenes and alkynes into valuable building blocks remains one of the main goals of synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present the leveraging of highly electron&#8208;deficient iminium ions, rare and fleeting intermediates, into a general amine synthesis. This enables the preparation of amines bearing e.g. valuable &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl moieties under mild conditions. This broad concept is highlighted by the late&#8208;stage amination of quinine into a biologically interesting new analogue.

         <title>Building a Beyond Concentrated Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly aggregated ether electrolyte is rationally constructed by introducing a 3A zeolite molecular sieve film. Benefitting from the highly aggregated electrolyte configuration, it enables a dramatically improved oxidative stability. Under the extremely harsh anode&#8208;free conditions, the high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free Na battery configuration has an ultrahigh energy density of 369&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0&#8197;V class cathodes.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and scalable sodium ion (Na&#8208;ion) batteries serve as an ideal alternative to the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To compensate for the shortage of energy density, the most accessible solution is developing a high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free configuration comprising a lightweight Al current collector on the anode and a high&#8208;voltage sodiumized cathode. However, it imposes stringent Na reversibility and high&#8208;voltage stability requirements on the electrolyte. A 3A zeolite molecular sieve film is rationally designed, and a highly aggregated solvation structure is constructed through the size effect. It suppresses the trace but continuous oxidative decomposition and extends the oxidative stability to 4.5&#8197;V without sacrificing the Na reversibility of the anode (99.91&#8201;%). Thus, we can make anode&#8208;free cells with high energy density of 369 and 372&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1 for 4.0 and 4.25&#8197;V class cells, respectively. Furthermore, this strategy enables a long lifespan (250&#8197;cycles) for 4.0&#8197;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free cells.

         <title>A Heterogeneous Palladium Catalyst for the Polymerization of Olefins Prepared by Halide Abstraction Using Surface R3Si+ Species</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silylium&#8208;like ion supported on silica ionizes a Pd&#8722;Cl complex by chloride abstraction to generate a very active catalyst for (co&#8208;)polymerization reactions.







Abstract
The silylium&#8208;like surface species [iPr3Si][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] activates (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl (N^N=Ar&#8722;N=CMeMeC=N&#8722;Ar, Ar=2,6&#8208;bis(diphenylmethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzene) by chloride ion abstraction to form [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3][(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)] (1). A combination of FTIR, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, and reactions with CO or vinyl chloride establish that 1 shows similar reactivity patterns as (N^N)Pd(CH3)Cl activated with Na[B(ArF)4]. Multinuclear 13C{27Al} RESPDOR and 1H{19F} S&#8208;REDOR experiments are consistent with a weakly coordinated ion&#8208;pair between (N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3+ and [(RFO)3Al&#8722;OSi&#8801;)]. 1 catalyzes the polymerization of ethylene with similar activities as [(N^N)Pd&#8722;CH3]+ in solution and incorporates up to 0.4&#8201;% methyl acrylate in copolymerization reactions. 1 produces polymers with significantly higher molecular weight than the solution catalyst, and generates the highest molecular weight polymers currently reported in copolymerization reactions of ethylene and methylacrylate.

         <title>Functionalization and Hydrogenation of Carbon Chains Derived from CO**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported.







Abstract
Selective reactions that combine H2, CO and organic electrophiles (aldehyde, ketones, isocyanide) to form hydrogenated C3 and C4 carbon chains are reported. These reactions proceed by CO homologation mediated by [W(CO)6] and an aluminum(I) reductant, followed by functionalization and hydrogenation of the chain ends. A combination of kinetics (rates, KIEs) and DFT calculations has been used to gain insight into a key step which involves hydrogenation of a metallocarbene intermediate. These findings expand the extremely small scope of systems that combine H2 and CO to make well&#8208;defined products with complete control over chain length and functionality.

         <title>Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8722;H Silylation of Heteroarenes for the Synthesis of Acyclic Si&#8208;Stereogenic Silanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes has been developed. This process proceeds via a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereocontrol.







Abstract
Intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation for the synthesis of acyclic silanes bearing a silicon&#8208;stereogenic center in one enantiomeric form remains unknown to date. Herein, we report the first enantioselective intermolecular C&#8722;H silylation of heteroarenes for the synthesis of acyclic silicon&#8208;stereogenic heteroarylsilanes. This process undergoes a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct intermolecular dehydrogenative Si&#8722;H/C&#8722;H cross&#8208;coupling, giving access to a variety of acyclic heteroarylated silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes, including bis&#8208;Si&#8208;stereogenic silanes, in decent yields with excellent chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereo&#8208;control, which significantly enlarge the chemical space of the optically active silicon&#8208;stereogenic monohydrosilanes.

         <dc:description>Axially chiral styrene&#8208;carboxylic esters were synthesized in high yields with excellent enantioselectivity by the cationic rhodium(I)/H  8  &#8208;BINAP complex&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;controlled [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of 1,6&#8208; and 1,7&#8208;diynes with 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;carboxylic esters. The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of&#160;  C  2  symmetric axially chiral&#160;  cis  &#160;and&#160;  trans  &#8208;stilbene&#8208;dicarboxylic esters was also achieved by the double [ 2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of two molecules of the 1,6&#8208;diyne with&#160; 2,3&#8208;dialkynylmaleate and 2,3&#8208;dialkynylfumarate, respectively.&#160; In these reactions, the 1,3&#8208;enyne&#8208;carboxylic esters coordinating to rhodium with a five&#8208;membered chelate were more reactive than those coordinating to rhodium with a six&#8208;membered chelate, although both chelation modes realized excellent enantioselectivity. The enantioselection mechanism of the cationic rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed chelation&#8208;controlled [ 2+2+2] cycloaddition &#160;was elucidated by the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

The diastereo- and enantioselective synthesis of&#160;  C  2  symmetric axially chiral&#160;  cis  &#160;and&#160;  trans  -stilbene-dicarboxylic esters was also achieved by the double [ 2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions of two molecules of the 1,6-diyne with&#160; 2,3-dialkynylmaleate and 2,3-dialkynylfumarate, respectively.&#160; In these reactions, the 1,3-enyne-carboxylic esters coordinating to rhodium with a five-membered chelate were more reactive than those coordinating to rhodium with a six-membered chelate, although both chelation modes realized excellent enantioselectivity. The enantioselection mechanism of the cationic rhodium(I)-catalyzed chelation-controlled [ 2+2+2] cycloaddition &#160;was elucidated by the DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Butyric Acid&#8208;Assisted In Situ Passivation Strategy for Superstable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbX3 Quantum Dots in Polar Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A crucial challenge is to develop an in situ passivation strategy for perovskite CsPbX  3  (CPX, X = Cl, Br, and I) quantum dots (QDs) to improve their stability in polar solvents and simultaneously maintaining their optical performance without using complicated organics. Here, we describe a facile method to significantly improve the stability of the CPX QDs via in situ crystallization with combined effects of 4&#8208;bromo&#8208;butyric acid (BBA) and oleylamine (OLA) in polar solvents and also propose a possible fundamental mechanism. Monodispersed CsPbBr  3  (CPB) QDs obtained in water show high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 86.4% and their PL features of CPB QDs have no significant change after being dispersed in water for 96 h&#65292;which implies that their structures are unchanged. The results provide a viable design strategy to synthesize all&#8208;inorganic perovskites CPX QDs with strong stability against the attack of polar solvents and shed more light on their surface chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrawide Bandgap and Outstanding Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response by a Fluorine Enrichment Strategy at a Transition&#8208;Metal Oxyfluoride Nonlinear Optical Material</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials has been hindered by competing microstructure requirements:&#160;the need to simultaneously engineer a large hyperpolarizability (a large second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)) and a wide HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (a wide bandgap). Herein, a non&#8208;centrosymmetric transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxyfluoride K5(NbOF4)(NbF7)2 (KNOF) with an extremely high F/O ratio is constructed in high yield. KNOF exhibits an extremely wide bandgap (5.88 eV) and a strong powder SHG response (4.0 &#215; KH2PO4) &#8211; both being the largest values for TM&#8208;centered oxyfluorides &#8211; as well as a birefringence sufficient for applications. The dominant roles of the partially fluorinated [NbO2F4] and totally fluorinated [NbF7] groups in achieving the enlarged bandgap in KNOF have been clarified by first&#8208;principles calculations. Our results suggest that maximizing the fluorine content of oxyfluorides may unlock the promise of short&#8208;wavelength&#8208;transparent materials with exceptional NLO performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Thioetherification via Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Photoactivation using Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of sulfides has been widely studied because this functional subunit is prevalent in biomolecules and pharmaceuticals, as well as being a useful synthetic platform for further elaboration. Thus, various methods to build C&#8211;S bonds have been developed, but typically they require the use of precious metals or harsh conditions. Electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex photoactivation strategies have emerged as versatile and sustainable ways to achieve C&#8211;S bond formation, avoiding challenges associated with previous methods. This work describes an open&#8208;to&#8208;air, photoinduced, site&#8208;selective C&#8211;H thioetherification from readily available reagents via EDA complex formation, tolerating a wide range of different functional groups. Moreover, C(sp  2  )&#8211;halogen bonds remain intact using this protocol, allowing late&#8208;stage installation of the sulfide motif in various bioactive scaffolds, while allowing yet further modification through more traditional C&#8208;X bond cleavage protocols. Additionally, various mechanistic investigations support the envisioned EDA complex scenario.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of cyclic allylborates was achieved by the reaction of 1,3&#8208;dienes and B  2  pin  2  using a copper catalyst. Several 1,3&#8208;dienes were converted to the corresponding cyclic allylborates in moderate to high yields. The cyclic allylborate obtained could be used in several organic transformations such as allylation of electrophiles and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Potential Cathodes with Nitrogen Active Centres for Quasi&#8208;Solid Proton&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although proton&#8208;ion batteries have received considerable attention owing to their reliability, safety, toxin&#8208;free nature, and low cost, their development remains in the early stages because of lacking proper electrolytes and cathodes for facilitating a high output voltage and stable cycle performance. We present a novel cathode based on active nitrogen centre, which provides a flat discharge plateau at 1 V with a capacity of 115 mAh g  &#8208;1  and excellent stability. Moreover, a quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte was developed to overcome the issue of corrosion, broaden the potential window of the electrolyte, and prevent the active material from dissolving. While using the unique as&#8208;developed electrolyte, the newly designed cathode retained 89.67% of its original capacity after 2000 cycles. Finally, we demonstrated the excellent cycle performance of the as&#8208;developed metal&#8208;free, flexible, soft&#8208;packed battery. Notably, even when a portion of the battery was cut off, it continued to function normally.</dc:description>

         <title>Counterion&#8208;paired Bright Heptamethine Fluorophores with NIR&#8208;II Excitation and Emission Enable Multiplexed Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photon excitation and emission at the NIR&#8208;II spectral window enable high&#8208;contrast deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging. However, multiplexed imaging with NIR&#8208;II excitation and emission has been hampered by the limited chemical strategy to develop bright fluorophores with tunable absorption in this spectral regime  . Herein, we developed a series of heptamethine cyanines (HCs) with varied absorption/emission maxima spanning from 1100 to 1600 nm through a physical organic approach. A bulky counterion paired to HCs was found to elicit substantial improvements in absorptivity (7&#8208;fold), brightness (14&#8208;fold), and spectral profiles in water, addressing a notorious quenching problem of NIR&#8208;II cyanines due to aggregation and polarization. We demonstrated the utilities of HC1222 and HC1342 for high&#8208;contrast dual&#8208;color imaging of circulatory system, lymphatic structures, tumor, and organ function in living mice under 1120 nm and 1319 excitation, enabling HCs as a promising platform for non&#8208;invasive bioimaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Bilayer Surface Passivation for High Efficiency Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TEASCN (2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate) was synthesized to construct a bilayer structure on a Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite surface, which can passivate perovskite and ensure effective carriers transfer, enabling the device to reach a certified efficiency of 21.1&#8201;%. The mechanism for the growth of the uniform bilayer structure is revealed by simulation based on density functional theory.







Abstract
The combination of comprehensive surface passivation and effective interface carriers transfer plays a critical role in high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. A 2D structure is an important approach for surface passivation of perovskite film, however, its large band gap could compromise carrier transfer. Herein, we synthesize a new molecule 2&#8208;thiopheneethylamine thiocyanate (TEASCN) for the construction of bilayer quasi&#8208;2D structure precisely on a tin&#8208;lead mixed perovskite surface. This bilayer structure can passivate the perovskite surface and ensure effective carriers transfer simultaneously. As a result, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of the device is increased without sacrificing short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), giving rise to a high certified efficiency from a credible third&#8208;party certification of narrow band gap perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, theoretical simulation indicates that the inclusion of TEASCN makes the bilayer structure thermodynamically more stable, which provides a strategy to tailor the number of layers of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structures.

         <title>A Nanopore Sensing Assay Resolves Cascade Reactions in a Multienzyme System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanopore sensing assay is developed to resolve cascade reactions of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. In a confined environment such as liposomes, substrate&#8208;channelling effects are observed between two sets of the three enzymes.







Abstract
Enzymatic cascade reactions are widely used to synthesize complex molecules from simple precursors. The major underlying mechanism of cascade reactions is substrate channelling, where intermediates of different enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. Here, we report a nanopore sensing assay that allows accurate quantification of all the reaction intermediates and the product of an artificial three&#8208;enzyme system. A DNA&#8211;peptide complex is used as the initial substrate which undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages in solution. All the temporal changes of the intermediates and product can be obtained through nanopore translocation recordings. Furthermore, we find that in a confined environment such as liposome, substrate channelling occurs between two sets of the three enzymes. Our results demonstrate a novel and powerful approach to determine and quantify substrate channelling effects, which is potentially useful for designing and evaluating multienzyme systems.

         <title>Regio&#8208;, Diastereo&#8208;, and Enantioselective Decarboxylative Hydro&#8208;aminoalkylation of Dienol Ethers Enabled by Dual Palladium/Pho&#8208;toredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel decarboxylative hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) reaction of N&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;amino acids with dienol ethers enabled by a photoredox/palladium dual catalytic system is presented. With the developed method, a broad variety of substrates was deployed to deliver vicinal amino tertiary ethers in good to excellent yields with excellent diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies suggest that this transformation proceeds through a reversible hydropalladation of 1,3&#8208;dienes.







Abstract
Intermolecular photocatalytic hydroaminoalkylation (HAA) of alkenes have emerged as a powerful method for the construction of alkyl amines. Although there are some studies aiming at stereoselective photocatalytic HAA reactions, the alkenes are limited to electrophilic alkenes. Herein, we report a highly regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselective HAA of electron&#8208;rich dienol ethers and &#945;&#8208;amino radicals derived from &#945;&#8208;amino acids using a unified photoredox and palladium catalytic system. This decarboxylative 1,2&#8208;Markovnikov addition enables the construction of vicinal amino tertiary ethers with high levels of regio&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 rr), diastereo&#8208; (up to &gt;19&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr), and enantioselectivity control (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies support a reversible hydropalladation as a key step.

         <title>Synthesis of Axially Chiral N&#8208;Arylindoles via Atroposelective Cyclization of Ynamides Catalyzed by Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method enables the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities.







Abstract
In recent years, asymmetric catalysis of ynamides has attracted much attention, but these reactions mostly constructed central chirality, except for a few examples on the synthesis of axially chiral compounds which exclusively relied on noble&#8208;metal catalysis. Herein, a facile access to axially chiral N&#8208;heterocycles enabled by chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed 5&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of ynamides is disclosed, which represents the first metal&#8208;free protocol for the construction of axially chiral compounds from ynamides. This method allows the practical and atom&#8208;economical synthesis of valuable N&#8208;arylindoles in excellent yields with generally excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, organocatalysts and ligands based on such axially chiral N&#8208;arylindole skeletons are demonstrated to be applicable to asymmetric catalysis.

         <dc:description>
A silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion was synthesized. This compound exhibits an extremely elongated bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a near&#8208;IR absorption (&#955;max=922&#8197;nm) in solution attributed to the HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. Furthermore, this silicon radical anion presents a new bonding motif which appears to be the first example of a &#8220;&#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221;.







Abstract
&#963;&#8208;Type 3&#8208;electron&#8208;2&#8208;center (3e&#8208;2c) bonds have been extensively studied as one of the key bonding motifs in radical chemistry and some biological systems. &#8220;&#960;&#8208;Type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species&#8221; that contain a 3e&#8208;2c &#960;&#8208;bond without an underlying &#963;&#8208;bond framework, however, have been unexplored so far both theoretically and experimentally. Herein, we report the synthesis of the first stable &#960;&#8208;type 3e&#8208;2c&#8208;bonded species, a silicon analogue of a bicyclo[1.1.0]butane radical anion. This compound exhibits an extremely long bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a strong near&#8208;IR absorption at 922&#8197;nm in solution which arises from a HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. DFT calculations revealed a &#960;&#8208;type bonding interaction between the two bridgehead silicon atoms with an unpaired electron mainly delocalized across the corresponding &#960;*&#8208;type orbital, which introduces a novel bonding motif for constructing &#960;&#8208;electron systems.

This compound exhibits an extremely long bridgehead Si&#8722;Si bond (3.0638(8)&#8197;&#197;) and a strong near-IR absorption at 922&#8197;nm in solution which arises from a HOMO&#8594;SOMO [&#960;(Si&#8722;Si)&#8594;&#960;*(Si&#8722;Si)] transition. DFT calculations revealed a &#960;-type bonding interaction between the two bridgehead silicon atoms with an unpaired electron mainly delocalized across the corresponding &#960;*-type orbital, which introduces a novel bonding motif for constructing &#960;-electron systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modification of Nitrate Ion Enables Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modification of NO3&#8722; is achieved by connecting NO3&#8722; to an ether&#8208;based moiety. The broken resonance structure of &#8722;NO3 improves its reducibility compared with NO3&#8722;. The decomposition of &#8722;NO3 forms a LiNxOy&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and induces uniform Li deposition.







Abstract
The lifespan of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is hindered by heterogeneous solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The rational design of electrolytes is strongly considered to obtain uniform SEI in working batteries. Herein, a modification of nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) is proposed and validated to improve the homogeneity of the SEI in practical LMBs. NO3&#8722; is connected to an ether&#8208;based moiety to form isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) to break the resonance structure of NO3&#8722; and improve the reducibility. The decomposition of non&#8208;resonant &#8722;NO3 in ISDN enriches SEI with abundant LiNxOy and induces uniform lithium deposition. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with ISDN additives deliver a capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% for 100 cycles compared with rapid decay with LiNO3 after 55 cycles. Moreover, lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with ISDN additives provide a specific energy of 319&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 and undergo 20 cycles. This work provides a realistic reference in designing additives to modify the SEI for stabilizing LMBs.

         <title>Gadolinium Changes the Local Electron Densities of Nickel 3d Orbitals for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Gd atoms into a Ni&#8208;based catalyst readily changes local electron densities of the Ni 3d orbitals and strengthens the electronic activity. The resulting Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst achieves high selectivity, large current density and outstanding stability in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Generally, in terms of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, single&#8208;atom catalysts show high selectivities yet low current densities whereas conventional nanoparticle catalysts exhibit relatively high current densities but low selectivities. This work combines the advantages of the two classes of catalysts by constructing a Ni&#8208;Gd&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon black electrocatalyst within which NiI active sites are exposed outside the carbon layers and Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated inside the carbon layers. The Gd atoms can not only influence the local electron densities of Ni 3d orbitals, thus strengthening the electronic activity, but also tailor the sizes of the Ni nanoparticles, thereby minimizing the activity toward hydrogen evolution. Accordingly, this electrocatalyst yields both a high CO faradaic efficiency (97&#8201;%) and a large current density (308&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), alongside an outstanding stability (100&#8197;h).

         <title>Photo&#8208;Reduction with NIR Light of Nucleus&#8208;Targeting PtIV Nanoparticles for Combined Tumor&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The example of PtIV nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The complex was functionalized with a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides which self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII, presenting a multimodal treatment by chemotherapy and photodynamic immunotherapy.







Abstract
The development of PtIV prodrugs which are selectively reduced within cancerous cells into their PtII therapeutically active species has received increasing attention within the last decade. Despite recent research progress, the majority of investigated compounds are excited using ultraviolet or blue light. As the light penetration depth is low at these wavelengths, the treatment of deep&#8208;seated or large tumors is limited. To overcome this limitation, herein, the example of PtIV&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808&#8197;nm is reported. The polymer backbone which can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles was functionalized with PtIV complexes for chemotherapy, photosensitizers for photodynamic immunotherapy, and nucleus/cancer&#8208;targeting peptides. Upon irradiation, the PtIV center is reduced to PtII and the axially coordinated ligands are released, presenting a multimodal treatment. While selectively accumulating in tumorous tissue, the nanoparticles demonstrated the ability to eradicate a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer tumor inside a mouse model.

         <title>Demonstrating and Unraveling a Controlled Nanometer&#8208;Scale Expansion of the Vacancy Defects in Graphene by CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 is demonstrated as a promising etchant for controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancy defects down to a rate of a few &#197; per minute while completely avoiding the nucleation of new vacancy defects. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion.







Abstract
A controlled manipulation of graphene edges and vacancies is desired for molecular separation, sensing and electronics applications. Unfortunately, available etching methods always lead to vacancy nucleation making it challenging to control etching. Herein, we report CO2&#8208;led controlled etching down to 2&#8211;3&#8197;&#197; per minute while completely avoiding vacancy nucleation. This makes CO2 a unique etchant for decoupling pore nucleation and expansion. We show that CO2 expands the steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;free edges with an activation energy of 2.71&#8197;eV, corresponding to the energy barrier for the dissociative chemisorption of CO2. We demonstrate the presence of an additional configurational energy barrier for nanometer&#8208;sized vacancies resulting in a significantly slower rate of expansion. Finally, CO2 etching is applied to map the location of the intrinsic vacancies in the polycrystalline graphene film where we show that the intrinsic vacancy defects manifest mainly as grain boundary defects where intragrain defects from oxidative etching constitute a minor population.

An iridium&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution of a variety of methyl azaarenes, including (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline, is described. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are afforded in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Herein, an Ir&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reaction of methyl azaarenes is described. Azaarenes such as (benzo)thiazole, oxazole, benzoimidazole, pyridine, and (iso)quinoline are all tolerated. The corresponding chiral azaarene derivatives are obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;% ee). The utilization of the Knochel reagent TMPZnBr&#8901;LiBr warrants the in situ formation of benzylic nucleophiles without additional activating reagents. 1H&#8197;NMR studies suggested a two&#8208;fold function of the Knochel reagent in this reaction. The synthetic utility of this method has been showcased by a concise enantioselective synthesis of an allosteric protein kinase modulator.

         <title>Structural Basis for the Prenylation Reaction of Carbazole&#8208;Containing Natural Products Catalyzed by Squalene Synthase&#8208;Like Enzymes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbazole prenyltransferase was found to combine the overall structure of squalene synthase and the elegant stacking interaction between prenyl diphosphate and aromatic compounds observed in the aromatic substrate prenyltransferase. Structural and mutational analyses revealed the binding and deprotonation mechanisms of the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor.







Abstract
Some enzymes annotated as squalene synthase catalyze the prenylation of carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone&#8208;containing substrates in bacterial secondary metabolism. Their reaction mechanisms remain unclear because of their low sequence similarity to well&#8208;characterized aromatic substrate prenyltransferases (PTs). We determined the crystal structures of the carbazole PTs, and these revealed that the overall structure is well superposed on those of squalene synthases. In contrast, the stacking interaction between the prenyl donor and acceptor substrates resembles those observed in aromatic substrate PTs. Structural and mutational analyses suggest that the Ile and Asp residues are essential for the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions with the carbazole&#8208;3,4&#8208;quinone moiety of the prenyl acceptor, respectively, and a deprotonation mechanism of an intermediary &#963;&#8208;complex involving a catalytic triad is proposed. Our results provide a structural basis for a new subclass of aromatic substrate PTs.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Highly Oxidizing Cobalt Molecular Catalyst Designed for Bioinspired Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt(IV) complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold is very active in the catalysis of water oxidation at an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV at pH=6.







Abstract
Herein, we present a stable water&#8208;soluble cobalt complex supported by a dianionic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine]&#8208;6,6&#8242;&#8208;diyl)bis(propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol) ligand scaffold, which is a rare example of a high&#8208;oxidation species, as demonstrated by structural, spectroscopic and theoretical data. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed that the CoIV center of the mononuclear complex in the solid state resides in the high spin state (sextet, S=5/2). The complex can effectively catalyze water oxidation via a single&#8208;site water nucleophilic attack pathway with an overpotential of only 360&#8197;mV in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6. The key intermediate toward water oxidation was speculated based on theoretical calculations and was identified by in situ spectroelectrochemical experiments. The results are important regarding the accessibility of high&#8208;oxidation state metal species in synthetic models for achieving robust and reactive oxidation catalysis.

         <title>Widefield SERS for High&#8208;Throughput Nanoparticle Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening is a multiplexed widefield screening approach for particle characterization. The method is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations and simultaneously measures SERS and particle size.







Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) imaging is a powerful technology with unprecedent potential for ultrasensitive chemical analysis. Point&#8208;by&#8208;point scanning and often excessively long spectral acquisition&#8208;times hamper the broad exploitation of the full analytical potential of SERS. Here, we introduce large&#8208;scale SERS particle screening (LSSPS), a multiplexed widefield screening approach to particle characterization, which is 500&#8211;1000&#8197;times faster than typical confocal Raman implementations. Beyond its higher throughput, LSSPS simultaneously quantifies both the sample's Raman and Rayleigh scattering to directly quantify the fraction of SERS&#8208;active particles which allows for an unprecedented correlation of SERS activity with particle size. .

         <title>Pincer Ligand Bearing bis&#8208;(Carbone) and its Coordinative Behavior Toward Multi&#8208;Metallic Configuration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbones are divalent carbon (0) species that contain two lone pairs of electrons. Herein, we have prepared the first known stable and isolable free  bis  &#8208;(carbone) pincer framework with a well&#8208;defined solid&#8208;state structure. This  bis  &#8208;(carbone) ligand is an effective scaffold for forming monometallic (Ni and Pd) and trinuclear heterometallic complexes with Au&#8211;Pd&#8211;Au, Au&#8211;Ni&#8211;Au, and Cu&#8211;Ni&#8211;Cu configurations. Sophisticated quantum&#8208;theoretical analyses found that the metal&#8208;metal interactions are too weak to play a significant role in upholding these multi&#8208;metallic configurations; rather, the four lone pairs of electrons within the  bis  &#8208;(carbone) framework are the main contributors to the stability of the complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoaffinity capture compounds to profile the Magic Spot Nucleotide interactomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magic Spot Nucleotides (MSN) regulate the stringent response, a highly conserved bacterial stress adaptation mechanism, enabling survival under adverse external challenges. In times of antibiotic crisis, a detailed understanding of stringent response is essential, as potentially new targets for pharmacological intervention could be identified. In this study, we delineate the MSN interactome in&#160;Escherichia coli&#160;and&#160;Salmonella typhimurium&#160;applying a family of trifunctional photoaffinity capture compounds. We introduce MSN probes covering diverse phosphorylation pattern, such as pppGpp, ppGpp, and pGpp. Our chemical proteomics approach provides datasets of putative MSN receptors both from cytosolic and membrane fractions that, unveil new MSN targets. We find, that the activity of the non&#8208;Nudix hydrolase ApaH is potently inhibited by pppGpp, which itself is converted to pGpp by ApaH. The capture compounds described herein will be useful to identify MSN interactomes across bacterial species</dc:description>

         <title>Steric Modulation of Spiro Structure for Highly Efficient Multiple Resonance Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecule with a fused, planar architecture tends to aggregate at high doping ratios, resulting in broad full width at half maximum (FWHM), redshifting electroluminescence peaks, and low device efficiency. Herein, we propose a mono&#8208;substituted design strategy by introducing spiro&#8208;9,9'&#8208;bifluorene (SBF) units with different substituted sites into the MR&#8208;TADF system for the first time. As a classic steric group, SBF can hinder interchromophore interactions, leading to high device efficiency (32.2&#8208;35.9%) and narrow&#8208;band emission (~27 nm). Particularly, the shield&#8208;like molecule, SF1BN, seldom exhibits a broadened FWHM as the doping ratio rises, which differs from the C3&#8208;substituted isomer and unhindered parent emitter. These results manifest an effective method for constructing highly efficient MR&#8208;TADF emitters through a spiro strategy and elucidate the feasibility for steric modulation of spiro structure in &#960;&#8208;framework.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrafast Electrothermal Flow&#8208;Enhanced Magneto Biosensor for Highly Sensitive Protein Detection in Whole Blood</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current diagnostic tests for sensitive protein detection rely on immunological techniques, such as ELISA, which require sample purification, multiple washing steps and lengthy incubation, hindering their use for rapid testing. Here, we report a simple electrothermal flow&#8208;enhanced biosensor for ultrafast, high sensitivity measurements of protein biomarkers in whole blood. Magnetic nanobeads dually&#8208;labeled with a detection antibody and enzyme reporter are used to form immunocomplexes with the target protein, which are readily transported to the sensor via magnetic concentration. The incorporation of electrothermal flows enhances immunocomplex formation, allowing for rapid and sensitive detection without requiring blood purification or lengthy incubation. Proof of concept was carried out using Plasmodium falciparum histidine&#8208;rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), a malaria parasite biomarker, which could be detected at concentrations as low as 5.7 pg/mL (95 fM) in whole blood in 7 min. The speed, sensitivity and simplicity of this device make it attractive for rapid diagnostic testing.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar&#8208;Chiral Macrocycles through Asymmetric Electrophilic Aromatic Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient approach for asymmetric synthesis of planar&#8208;chiral macrocycles (paracyclophanes) has been disclosed through enantioselective electrophilic aromatic aminations with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. A wide range of chiral macrocycles bearing varied ring sizes (16 to 23&#8208;membered) and functional group&#8208;containing ansa chains were readily afforded using this method, with excellent yields and high enantioselectivities (23 examples, up to 99.5:0.5 er). Experimental studies and DFT calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism and origin of stereoselectivities of these reactions. Preliminary utilization of the planar&#8208;chiral macrocycle as chiral organocatalyst showcased the potential applications of these novel chiral skeletons.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Enhanced Osmotic Energy Harvester Using Photoactive Porphyrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High ion selectivity and permeability, as two contradictory aspects for the membrane design, highly hamper the development of osmotic energy harvesting technologies. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra&#8208;small and high&#8208;density pores and functional surface groups show great promise in tackling these problems. Here, we propose a facile and mild cathodic deposition method to directly prepare crack&#8208;free porphyrin MOF membranes on a porous anodic aluminum oxide for osmotic energy harvesting. The abundant carboxyl groups of the functionalized porphyrin ligands together with the nanoporous structure endows the MOF membrane with high cation selectivity and ion permeability, thus a large output power density of 6.26 W/m2 is achieved. The photoactive porphyrin ligands further leads to an improvement of the power density to 7.74 W/m2 upon light irradiation. This work provides a promising strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance osmotic energy harvesting systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Hybrid Halide Perovskite Birefringent Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Birefringent crystals that can modulate the polarization of light play a significant role in modern optical devices including polarizing microscopes, optical isolators, and achromatic quarter&#8208;wave plates. To date, commercial birefringent crystals are exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds. Here we report a new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid halide, MLAPbBr  4  (MLA = melamine), which features a (110)&#8208;oriented layered perovskite structure. Although the 6s  2  lone&#8208;pair electrons of Pb  2+  cations are stereochemically inert, MLAPbBr  4  exhibits a birefringence of 0.322@550 nm, which exceeds those of all commercial birefringent crystals. The first principles calculations reveal that this birefringence should be ascribed to the highly dislocated &#960;&#8208;conjugation of MLA cations and high distortion of PbBr  6  octahedra. This work highlights the persistently neglected great potential of hybrid halide perovskites as birefringent crystals.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Birefringent crystals that can modulate the polarization of light play a significant role in modern optical devices including polarizing microscopes, optical isolators, and achromatic quarter-wave plates. To date, commercial birefringent crystals are exclusively limited to purely inorganic compounds. Here we report a new organic-inorganic hybrid halide, MLAPbBr  4  (MLA = melamine), which features a (110)-oriented layered perovskite structure. Although the 6s  2  lone-pair electrons of Pb  2+  cations are stereochemically inert, MLAPbBr  4  exhibits a birefringence of 0.322@550 nm, which exceeds those of all commercial birefringent crystals. The first principles calculations reveal that this birefringence should be ascribed to the highly dislocated &#960;-conjugation of MLA cations and high distortion of PbBr  6  octahedra. This work highlights the persistently neglected great potential of hybrid halide perovskites as birefringent crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Here we report the design of  N  2  &#8208;carboxy&#8208;4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;lysines (CATKs) and their site&#8208;specific incorporation into proteins via genetic code expansion. When introduced into the protein dimer interface, CATKs permitted spontaneous, proximity&#8208;driven, site&#8208;selective crosslinking to generate covalent protein dimers in living cells, with phenyl&#8208;bearing CATK&#8208;  1  exhibiting high reactivity toward the proximal Lys and Tyr. Furthermore, when introduced into the  N  &#8208;terminal  &#946;  &#8208;strand of either a single&#8208;chain VHH antibody or a supercharged monobody, CATK&#8208;  1  enabled site&#8208;specific, inter&#8208;strand, orthogonal crosslinking with a proximal Tyr located on the opposing  &#946;  &#8208;strand. Compared with a non&#8208;crosslinked monobody, the orthogonally crosslinked monobody displayed improved cellular uptake and enhanced proteolytic stability against an endosomal enzyme. The robust crosslinking reactivity of CATKs should facilitate the design of novel protein topologies with improved physicochemical properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A super aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole equipped with four oxazolo[4,5&#8208;b]pyrazinyl units at its upper rim is reported. Its Pt(II)/Pd(II)&#8208;metallobridged cavitand counterparts were obtained by treatment with 2 equiv. of cis&#8208;protected metal corners, [M(dppp)(OTf)2] (dppp = 1,3&#8208;(bis&#8208;diphenylphosphino)propane). The metal corners arranged their axial phenyl substituents near the aromatic walls of the cavitand leading to the formation of inclusion complexes as single conformers. We characterized the inclusion complexes in solution using NMR spectroscopy. Selected complexes were also characterized in the gas&#8208;phase and in the solid&#8208;state using mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The dimensions of the open portals of the dinuclear complexes were found to be dependent on the included guest. The results of DFT calculations served to explain the dissimilar complexation&#8208;induced shifts observed in the dinuclear inclusion complexes with mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;formamide guests.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Branched Heterostructures with Optical Interconnects for Photonic Barcodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical interconnects exhibit superior potential in the precise regulation of photon transmission for organic photonic circuits . However, the rational design of well&#8208;defined organic heterostructures toward active optoelectronics remains challenging. Herein, we designed organic branched heterostructures (OBHs) with accurate spatial organization for optical interconnection. Notably, the precise regulation of OBHs has been controllably achieved including the trunk morphologies and the branched microwire number. Significantly, these as&#8208;prepared OBHs inherently exhibit the multichannel coupling outputs and the excitation position&#8208;dependent waveguide characteristics, leading to various outcoupling signals with tunable intensity and emission colors. The optical interconnects are realized due to the occurrence of exciton conversion and photon propagation between branch and trunk at the heterojunction, benefiting the application possibilities of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) optical barcodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereo&#8208; and Enantioselective Silver&#8208;Catalyzed [3+3] Cycloaddition and Kinetic Resolution of Azomethine Imines with Activated Isocyanides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to the well&#8208;established [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, the catalytic enantioselective [3+n] (n&#8805;3) cycloaddition reaction of activated isocyanides for the preparation of six&#8208;membered or larger ring systems has remained underdeveloped. Herein, we report&#160;the first example of highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective [3+3] cycloaddition of activated isocyanides with azomethine imines. By employing silver catalysis, a wide range of biologically important bicyclic 1,2,4&#8208;triazines were obtained in high yields (up to 99%) with good to excellent stereoselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, 99% ee). In addition, the same catalytic system could be applied to both the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules and the kinetic resolution of racemic azomethine imines, further highlighting its versatility and synthetic utility.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed (4+1) Cycloaddition between Benzocyclobutenones and Styrene&#8208;Type Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe a unique one&#8208;carbon ring&#8208;expansion strategy to access multi&#8208;substituted 2&#8208;indanones from benzocyclobutenones and styrene&#8208;type olefins. The use of a cationic &#8220;ligandless&#8221; rhodium catalyst was the key for both high reactivity and selectivity towards the (4+1) product. Broad functional group tolerance, a good substrate scope, and scalability have been demonstrated. Computation studies reveal that the origin of the (4+1) selectivity is due to a facile &#946;&#8208;H elimination pathway that reduces the overall barrier of the turnover&#8208;limiting C&#8722;C reductive elimination step.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;addressable single&#8208;molecule junctions incorporating a persistent organic radical</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integrating radical (open&#8208;shell) species into non&#8208;cryogenic nanodevices is key to unlocking the potential of molecular electronics. While many efforts have been devoted to this issue, in the absence of a chemical/electrochemical potential the open&#8208;shell character is generally lost in contact with the metallic electrodes. Here, single&#8208;molecule devices incorporating a 6&#8208;oxo&#8208;verdazyl persistent radical have been fabricated using break&#8208;junction techniques. The open&#8208;shell character is retained at room temperature, and electrochemical gating permits  in&#8208;situ  reduction to a closed&#8208;shell anionic state in a single&#8208;molecule transistor configuration. Furthermore, electronically&#8208;driven rectification arises from bias&#8208;dependent alignment of the open&#8208;shell resonances. The integration of radical character, transistor&#8208;like switching, and rectification in a single molecular component paves the way to further studies of the electronic, magnetic, and thermoelectric properties of open&#8208;shell species.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptoid&#8208;Directed Formation of Five&#8208;Fold Twinned Au Nanostars through Particle Attachment and Facet Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of the easy manipulation of peptoid&#8211;peptoid and peptoid&#8211;particle interactions solely by the variation of side chain chemistry, peptoid&#8208;induced formation of five&#8208;fold twinned Au star&#8208;shaped particles exhibiting five regular points has been achieved through a process of repeated particle attachment followed by facet stabilization.







Abstract
While bio&#8208;inspired synthesis offers great potential for controlling nucleation and growth of inorganic particles, precisely tuning biomolecule&#8211;particle interactions is a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we used variations in peptoid sequence to manipulate peptoid&#8211;Au interactions, leading to the synthesis of concave five&#8208;fold twinned, five&#8208;pointed Au nanostars via a process of repeated particle attachment and facet stabilization. Ex situ and liquid&#8208;phase TEM observations show that a balance between particle attachment biased to occur near the star points, preferential growth along the [100] direction, and stabilization of (111) facets is critical to forming star&#8208;shaped particles. Molecular simulations predict that interaction strengths between peptoids and distinct Au facets differ significantly and thus can alter attachment kinetics and surface energies to form the stars. This work provides new insights into how sequence&#8208;defined ligands affect particle growth to regulate crystal morphology.

         <title>Non&#8208;Immunosuppressive Cyclophilin Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophilins, enzymes with a peptidyl prolyl  cis  /  trans  isomerase activity, are relevant to a large variety of biological processes. The most abundant member of this enzyme family, cyclophilin A, is the cellular receptor of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). Due to the pathophysiological role of cyclophilins, particularly in viral infections, there is a broad interest in cyclophilin inhibition, devoid of immunosuppressive activity. In this overview an introduction into the physiological and pathophysiological roles of cyclophilins will be given first. The presentation of non&#8208;immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors will commence with drugs based on chemical modifications of CsA. The macrocyclic naturally occurring sanglifehrins became another lead structure for cyclophilin&#8208;inhibiting drugs. Finally, de&#8208;novo designed compounds, whose structures are not derived from or inspired by natural products, will be presented. Relevant synthetic concepts will be discussed but a focus will equally be on biochemical studies, structure&#8208;activity relationship, and clinical studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polymer Brushes for Protein Capture and Release in Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfaces functionalized with polymers are known for providing excellent resistance towards biomolecular adsorption and for their ability to bind high amounts of protein while preserving their structure. However, making an interface that switches between these two states has proven challenging and concepts to date rely on changes in the physiochemical environment, which is static in biological systems. Here we present the first interface that can be electrically switched between a high&#8208;capacity (&gt;1 &#956;g/cm  2  ) multilayer protein binding state and a completely non&#8208;fouling state (no detectable adsorption). Switching is possible over multiple cycles without any regeneration. Importantly, switching works even when the interface is in direct contact with biological fluids and a buffered environment. The technology offers many applications such as zero fouling on demand, patterning or separation of proteins as well as controlled release of biologics in a physiological environment, showing high potential for future drug delivery  in vivo  .</dc:description>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Extended Cyclohepta[def]fluorene Derivatives with Very Low&#8208;Lying Triplet States</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Open&#8208;shell non&#8208;alternant polycyclic hydrocarbons (PHs) are attracting increasing attention due to their promising applications in organic spintronics and quantum computing. Herein we report the synthesis of three cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based diradicaloids (  1&#8208;3  ), by fusion of benzo rings on its periphery for the thermodynamic stabilization, as evidenced by multiple characterization techniques. Remarkably, all of them display a very narrow optical energy gap (  E  g  opt  = 0.52&#8208;0.69 eV) and persistent stability under ambient conditions (  t  1/2  = 11.7&#8208;33.3 h). More importantly, this new type of diradicaloids possess a low&#8208;lying triplet state with an extremely small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap, as low as 0.002 kcal/mol, with a clear dependence on the molecular size. This family of compounds thus offers a new route to create non&#8208;alternant open&#8208;shell PHs with high&#8208;spin ground states, and opens up novel possibilities and insights into understanding the structure&#8208;property relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature of the Active Sites of Copper Zinc Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical CO  2  reduction to multi&#8208;carbon chemical feedstocks over copper based catalysts is of considerable attraction but suffers with the ambiguous nature of active sites, which hinder the rational design of catalysts and large&#8208;scale industrialization. Herein, combining neural network based global optimization and density functional theory calculations, this paper describes a large&#8208;scale simulation to obtain realistic copper zinc nanoparticles models and investigates the atom&#8208;level structure of C  2+  products active sites on CuZn catalysts in CO  2  ER. After analyzing over 2000 surface sites through high throughput tests based on NN potential, two kinds of active sites are identified, balanced Cu&#8208;Zn sites and Zn&#8208;heavy Cu&#8208;Zn sites, both facilitating C&#8208;C coupling, which are verified by subsequent calculational and experimental results. This work provides a new research paradigm for the design of high&#8208;performance Cu&#8208;based catalysts and may offer a general strategy to identify accurately the atomic structures of active sites in complex catalytic systems.</dc:description>

Key stages of bottlebrush random copolymer (BRCP) assembly at fluid interfaces are shown in the picture: Diffusion of BRCP from oil solution to the interface, reconfiguration to a hydrophilic&#8208; and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformation and interfacial adsorption (lhs), and reorganization of the BRCPs assembled at the liquid interface by in&#8208;plane diffusion (rhs).







Abstract
Bottlebrush random copolymers (BRCPs), having randomly distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains, are shown to reconfigure into hydrophilic&#8208;rich and hydrophobic&#8208;rich conformations at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to reduce interfacial energy. Both the degree of polymerization (NBB) and extent of grafting in these BRCPs were found to impact surface coverage and assembly kinetics. The time&#8208;dependence of the interfacial tension is described as the sum of two exponential relaxation functions characterizing BRCP diffusion, interfacial adsorption, and reorganization. Interfacial tension (&#947;) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) results showed that higher molecular weight BRCPs require longer time to adsorb to the water&#8211;oil interface, but less time for interfacial reorganization. Overall, this work describes fundamental principles of BRCP assembly at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, with implications pertaining to polymer design with enhanced understanding of emulsification, adhesion, and related properties in fluids and at interfaces.

         <title>Spatially Resolved, Error&#8208;Robust Multiplexed MicroRNA Profiling in Single Living Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;encoded error&#8208;corrected label (FluoEL) for multiplexed microRNA imaging in living cells is developed. Proportionally encoded Cy3 and Cy5 overcome the limitation of spectral overlap. The core&#8211;shell mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) structure avoids FRET between the recognition component of the molecular beacon (MB) and the barcoding dye to provide high accuracy.







Abstract
Simultaneous imaging of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) in individual living cells is challenging due to the lack of spectrally distinct encoded fluorophores and non&#8208;cytotoxic methods. We describe a multiplexed error&#8208;robust combinatorial fluorescent label&#8208;encoding method, termed fluorophores encoded error&#8208;corrected labels (FluoELs), enabling multiplexed miRNA imaging in living cells with error&#8208;correcting capability. The FluoELs comprise proportional dual fluorophores for encoding and a constant quantitative single fluorophore for error&#8208;corrected quantification. Both are embedded in 260&#8197;nm core&#8211;shell silica nanoparticles modified with molecular beacon detection probes. The FluoELs are low cytotoxic and could accurately quantify and spatially resolve nine breast&#8208;cancer&#8208;related miRNAs and evaluate their coordination. The FluoELs enabled a single&#8208;cell analysis platform to evaluate miRNA expression profiles and the molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA&#8208;associated diseases.

         <title>Designing a Network of Crystalline Polymers for a Scalable, Nonfluorinated, Healable and Amphiphobic Solid Slippery Interface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A healable amphiphobic solid slippery coating is derived through the formation of a crystalline network of &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymers in a porous polymeric coating, where the 1,4&#8208;conjugate addition reaction provided a porous and substrate&#8208;independent polymeric coating to develop a non&#8208;fluorinated and optically transparent slippery interface for sliding beaded droplets of water, crude/refined oils and polar/non&#8208;polar solvents.







Abstract
The fluorinated&#8208;liquid infused amphiphobic slippery interfaces exhibiting superior sliding of the beaded oil/water droplets, often suffer from durability and contamination issues. Here, the ability of 1)&#8197;hexagonal packing of hydrocarbon sides in a selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer and 2)&#8197;its reversible phase transition at 51&#8201;&#176;C was rationally exploited to achieve temperature&#8208;assisted rapid (&lt;1&#8197;minute) and repetitive (50 times) self&#8208;healable amphiphobic solid&#8208;slippery coating on both planar and geometrically&#8208;complex substrates. The selected &#8220;comb&#8208;like&#8221; polymer was strategically infused in a porous, hydrophilic and thick (&#8776;4.8&#8197;&#956;m) polymeric coating. The resultant solid and smooth interface exhibited sliding of beaded droplets of various liquids, including droplets of water, polar (ethanol, 1&#8208;propanol, 1&#8208;hexanol, DMSO, DMF), and non&#8208;polar (decane, dodecane, diiodomethane) organic solvents, edible (vegetable oil), motor, engine (petrol, diesel, kerosene) and crude oils.

         <title>Prodrugs of Persulfide and Sulfide: Is There a Pharmacological Difference between the Two in the Context of Rapid Exchanges among Various Sulfur Species In Vivo?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delivery system which can release pure H2S, hydrogen persulfide, and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide was used to compare the pharmacological difference of sulfide and persulfide. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also exhibited reduced toxicity compared to H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.







Abstract
Sulfide and persulfide are chemically different and one might expect persulfide to be more effective in mediating sulfur signaling because persulfide can directly modify protein cysteine residue. However, rapid scrambling, and interconversions occur among sulfur species. Then there is the question of whether the chemical reactivity differences between sulfide and persulfide would translate into pharmacological differences. Utilizing a delivery system to generate pure hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen persulfide (H2S2), and N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine persulfide (N&#8208;CysSSH), we examined the activities of sulfide and persulfide in vitro and in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs exhibited increased activities compared to the H2S prodrug. In particular, the H2S2 prodrug offers much&#8208;elevated analgesic effects compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo. Persulfide prodrugs also possess a reduced level of toxicity compared to the H2S prodrug in vivo, indicating persulfide might represent a better therapeutic paradigm than H2S.

         <title>Reductant&#8208;Free Cross&#8208;Electrophile Synthesis of Di(hetero)arylmethanes by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Desulfinative C&#8722;C Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzylic halides and heteroaryl halides are directly coupled using Pd&#8208;catalysis and a simple sulfinate transfer reagent. The reactions proceed by formation of an intermediate benzylic sulfinate, formed in situ, and deliver di(hetero)arylmethane products. The reactions use only commercial components, and no stoichiometric metal reductant is needed.







Abstract
An efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling to access medicinally relevant di(hetero)arylmethanes is reported. The method is reductant&#8208;free, and involves a sulfinate transfer reagent and a Pd&#8208;catalyst mediating the union of two electrophilic coupling partners; a (hetero)aryl halide and a benzyl halide. We establish for the first time that benzyl sulfinates, generated in situ, undergo efficient Pd&#8208;catalyzed desulfinative cross&#8208;coupling with (hetero)aryl halides to generate di(hetero)arylmethanes. The reaction can be extended to benzylic pseudohalides derived from benzyl alcohols. The reactions are straightforward to perform and scalable, and all reaction components are commercially available.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H Borylation of Aminocyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of simple imide&#8208;directed intermolecular enantioselective C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization of aminocyclopropanes enabled by iridium catalysis has been developed. The reaction proceeds via six&#8208;membered metallacycles. The method could tolerate a broad spectrum of functional groups, affording a vast array of chiral aminocyclopropanes (36 examples) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;controllable C&#8722;H functionalization remains a formidable challenge in asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we disclose the first example of iridium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H borylation of aminocyclopropanes by using simple imides as weakly coordinating directing groups under mild reaction conditions. The reaction proceeded via a six&#8208;membered iridacycle, affording a vast range of chiral aminocyclopropyl boronates. The current method features a broad spectrum of functional groups (36 examples) and high enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;%). We also demonstrated the synthetic utility by a preparative scale C&#8722;H borylation, C&#8722;B bond transformations, and conversion of the directing group.

         <title>Activation of CO Using a 1,2&#8208;Disilylene: Facile Synthesis of an Abnormal N&#8208;Heterocyclic Silylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of a 1,2&#8208;disilylene with CO under ambient conditions leads to a bis(silylene), the five&#8208;membered heterocycle of which represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (see picture). Reactions of the bis(silylene) with transition metal carbonyls lead to different outcomes, including a chelate complex of the Mo(CO)4 fragment.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylene, [{ArC(NDip)2}Si]2 1 (Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But), with CO proceeds via insertion of CO into one Si&#8722;N bond, and Si&#8722;Si bond cleavage, to cleanly give the bis(silylene), {ArC(NDip)2}Si(:)O
 Ar 2, under ambient conditions. The reaction can be partially reversed when solutions of 2 are subjected to UV irradiation. The five&#8208;membered heterocyclic fragment of 2 represents the first silicon analogue of an &#8220;abnormal&#8221; N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC), a view which is substantiated by a computational analysis of the compound. Reaction of 2 with [Mo(CO)6] under UV light affords the chelate complex, [Mo(CO)4(&#954;2&#8208;Si,Si&#8208;2)] 3, while reaction with [Fe(CO)5] gives the unusual silyleneyl bridged complex, [{Fe2(CO)6}{&#956;&#8208;Si[(NDip)2CAr]}2] 4. The same coordination complexes can be accessed by reaction of 1 with [Mo(CO)6] or [Fe(CO)5] under UV light. As is the case for aNHCs, d&#8208;block metal complexes of bis(silylene) 2 could prove useful as bespoke catalysts for organic transformations.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Based Complex Fluids as Aqueous Exciton Transport Networks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions are fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. Complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid in which energy transfer is highly efficient.







Abstract
The ability to assemble artificial systems that mimic aspects of natural light&#8208;harvesting functions is fascinating and attractive for materials design. Given the complexity of such a system, a simple design pathway is desirable. Here, we argue that associative phase separation of oppositely charged conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) can provide such a path in an environmentally benign medium: water. We find that complexation between an exciton&#8211;donor and acceptor CPE leads to formation of a complex fluid. We interrogate exciton transfer from the donor to the acceptor CPE within the complex fluid and find that transfer is highly efficient. We also find that excess molecular ions can tune the modulus of the inter&#8208;CPE complex fluid. Even at high ion concentrations, CPEs remain complexed with significantly delocalized electronic wavefunctions. Our work lays the rational foundation for complex, tunable aqueous light&#8208;harvesting systems via the intrinsic thermodynamics of associative phase separation.

         <title>A Symmetry&#8208;Based Kinematic Theory for Nanocrystal Morphology Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate shape evolution is proposed. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories of NPs. The theory accommodates the conventional theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking.







Abstract
The growth of crystalline nanoparticles (NPs) generally involves three processes: nucleation, growth, and shape evolution. Among them, the shape evolution is less understood, despite the importance of morphology for NP properties. Here, we propose a symmetry&#8208;based kinematic theory (SBKT) based on classical growth theories to illustrate the process. Based on the crystal lattice, nucleus (or seed) symmetry, and the preferential growth directions under the experimental conditions, the SBKT can illustrate the growth trajectories. The theory accommodates the conventional criteria of the major existing theories for crystal growth and provides tools to better understand the symmetry&#8208;breaking process during the growth of anisotropic structures. Furthermore, complex dendritic growth is theoretically and experimentally demonstrated. Thus, it provides a framework to explain the shape evolution, and extends the morphogenesis prediction to cases, which cannot be treated by other theories.

         <title>Overcoming Spectral Dependence: A General Strategy for Developing Far&#8208;Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Ultra&#8208;Fluorogenic Tetrazine Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general tetrazine probe design strategy overcomes the spectral dependence of the energy transfer mechanism, endowing excellent fluorogenicity in the NIR window. The high specificity, signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and photostability of the synthesized probes make them highly suited for live&#8208;cell bioimaging and theranostics.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal fluorogenic dyes are indispensable tools in wash&#8208;free bioimaging of specific biological targets. However, the fluorogenicity of existing tetrazine&#8208;based bioorthogonal probes deteriorates as the emission wavelength shifts towards the NIR window, greatly limiting their applications in live cells and tissues. Herein, we report a generalizable molecular design strategy to construct ultra&#8208;fluorogenic dyes via a simple substitution at the meso&#8208;positions of various far&#8208;red and NIR fluorophores. Our probes demonstrate significant fluorescence turn&#8208;on ratios (102&#8211;103&#8208;fold) in the range 586&#8211;806&#8197;nm. These results will greatly expand the applications of bioorthogonal chemistry in NIR bioimaging and biosensing.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer and Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel donor&#8208;pillar[5]arene&#8208;acceptor structure with aggregation&#8208;induced emission property shows a twisted conformation and intramolecular through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT). Balancing of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission via viscosity and polar guest generates the single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission.







Abstract
The fabrication of single&#8208;molecule white&#8208;light emission (SMWLE) materials has become a highly studied topic in recent years and through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is emerging as an important concept in this field. However, the preparation of ideal TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials is still a big challenge. Herein, we report a bifunctional pillar[5]arene (TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA) with a linear donor&#8208;spacer&#8208;acceptor structure and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property. The bulky pillar[5]arene between the donor and acceptor induces a twisted conformation and a non&#8208;conjugated structure, resulting in intramolecular TSCT. In addition, the AIE feature and pillar[5]arene cavity endow TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA with responsiveness to viscosity and polar guests, by which the TSCT emission is triggered. The combination of blue locally&#8208;excited state emission and yellow TSCT emission of TPCN&#8208;P5&#8208;TPA generates SMWLE. Therefore, we provide a new and versatile strategy for the construction of TSCT&#8208;based SMWLE materials.

         <title>Rhodaelectro&#8208;Catalyzed peri&#8208;Selective Direct Alkenylations with Weak O&#8208;Coordination Enabled by the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium&#8208;catalyzed electrooxidative alkenylation of oxidation&#8208;sensitive 1&#8208;naphthols as well as 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;hydroxyquinolines has been developed. It employs readily available starting materials, and the C&#8722;C bond formation proceeds with high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity, with molecular H2 as the only stoichiometric waste product.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H functionalizations by electrocatalysis is dominated by strongly coordinating N(sp2)&#8208;directing groups. In sharp contrast, direct electrocatalytic transformations of weakly&#8208;coordinating phenols remain underdeveloped. Herein, electrooxidative peri C&#8722;H alkenylations of challenging 1&#8208;naphthols were achieved by versatile rhodium(III) catalysis via user&#8208;friendly constant current electrolysis. The rhodaelectrocatalysis employed readily&#8208;available alkenes and a protic reaction medium and features ample scope, good functional group tolerance and high site&#8208; and stereoselectivity. The strategy was successfully applied to high&#8208;value, nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, thereby providing direct access to uncommon heterocyclic motifs based on the dihydropyranoquinoline skeleton.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating Colloidal Co&#8208;Assemblies That Accelerate Their Own Destruction via Chemo&#8208;Structural Feedback</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemo&#8208;structural feedback mechanism is introduced in co&#8208;assembling microgels (MGs), whereby the co&#8208;assemblies promote their own destruction. The key concept uses co&#8208;assembly&#8208;triggered proximity effects of enzymes immobilized on individual MGs so that the co&#8208;assembly enhances an enzymatic cascade for deactivator production.







Abstract
Biological self&#8208;assemblies self&#8208; and cross&#8208;regulate each other via chemical reaction networks (CRNs) and feedback. Although artificial transient self&#8208;assemblies have been realized via activation/deactivation CRNs, the transient structures themselves do mostly not engage in the CRN. We introduce a rational design approach for chemo&#8208;structural feedback, and present a transient colloidal co&#8208;assembly system, where the formed co&#8208;assemblies accelerate their destruction autonomously. We achieve this by immobilizing enzymes of a deactivating acid&#8208;producing enzymatic cascade on pH&#8208;switchable microgels that can form co&#8208;assemblies at high pH. Since the enzyme partners are immobilized on individual microgels, the co&#8208;assembled state brings them close enough for enhanced acid generation. The amplified deactivator production (acid) leads to an almost two&#8208;fold reduction in the lifetime of the transiently formed pH&#8208;state. Our study thus introduces versatile mechanisms for chemo&#8208;structural feedback.

         <title>Bioinspired Total Synthesis of Erectones A and B, and the Revised Structure of Hyperelodione D</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical speculation on the biosynthesis of hyperelodione D leads to its structural reassignment via a concise total synthesis. The key step is a bioinspired, Diels&#8211;Alder cascade reaction between E,E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;farnesene and a naturally occurring quinone that generates three rings and six stereocentres.







Abstract
The field of biomimetic synthesis seeks to apply biosynthetic hypotheses to the efficient construction of complex natural products. This approach can also guide the revision of incorrectly assigned structures. Herein, we describe the evolution of a concise total synthesis and structural reassignment of hyperelodione D, a tetracyclic meroterpenoid derived from a Hypericum plant, alongside some biogenetically related natural products, erectones A and B. The key step in the synthesis of hyperelodione D forms six stereocentres and three rings in a bioinspired cascade reaction that features an intermolecular Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, an intramolecular Prins reaction and a terminating cycloetherification.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Zirconocene&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s and Its Extension to Synthesis of a Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Nanobarrel</title>

         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valent zirconocene&#8208;mediated cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent treatment with acid affords porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with exocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiene motifs. These porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s can react with dienophiles to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. The Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of porphyrin(2.1.2.1)s with benzdiyne gives a nanobarrel which can hold two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction.







Abstract
Rosenthal's&#8208;reagent&#8208;mediated intramolecular cyclometallation of &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dialkynyldipyrrin nickel(II) complex and subsequent acid treatment afforded a 1,3&#8208;butadiene&#8208;embedded porphyrin(2.1.2.1), 6, which served as a reactive diene towards dienophiles such as dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) and benzyne to give corresponding Diels&#8211;Alder adducts. Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 6 and benzdiyne gave adducts 14, 15&#8201;a, and 15&#8201;b along with a trace amount of porphyrin(2.1.2.1) barrel 13. Stepwise routes using 14 or 15&#8201;a/15&#8201;b as a substrate allowed for the synthesis of 13 as a single stereoisomer. The nanobarrel structure for 13 was revealed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, where its cavity held two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. DFT calculations revealed that the electrostatic attraction was dominant with binding energy of 32.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; and benzdiyne gave adducts &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;15&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;15&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; along with a trace amount of porphyrin(2.1.2.1) barrel &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;. Stepwise routes using &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;15&#8201;a/15&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; as a substrate allowed for the synthesis of &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; as a single stereoisomer. The nanobarrel structure for &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; was revealed by X-ray diffraction, where its cavity held two chloroform molecules via C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction. DFT calculations revealed that the electrostatic attraction was dominant with binding energy of 32.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox Activation of Inert Alkyl Chlorides for the Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling with Aromatic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoredox activation of inert chloroalkanes for the cross&#8208;coupling reaction with olefins, with a broad functional group tolerance under mild conditions is presented. By combining UV/Vis spectroscopy, EPR, radical clock and deuterium&#8208;labelling experiments, [Ni(Py2Tstacn)]+ is proposed to be catalytically competent to activate the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond, forming a free radical, which reacts with the alkene.







Abstract
The inertness of chloroalkanes has precluded them as coupling partners for cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Herein we disclose a general strategy for the activation of inert alkyl chlorides through photoredox catalysis and their use as coupling partners with alkenes. The catalytic system is formed by [Ni(OTf)(Py2Tstacn)](OTf) (1Ni), which is responsible for the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond activation, and [Ir(NMe2bpy)(ppy)2]PF6, (PCIrNMe2), which is the photoredox catalyst. Combined experimental and theoretical studies show an in&#8197;situ photogenerated NiI intermediate ([Ni(Py2Tstacn)]+) which is catalytically competent for the Csp3&#8722;Cl bond cleavage via a SN2 mechanism for primary alkyl chlorides, forming carbon&#8208;centered free radicals, which react with the olefin leading to the formation of the Csp3&#8722;Csp3 bond. These results suggest inert alkyl chlorides can be electrophiles for developing new intermolecular strategies in which low&#8208;valent aminopyridine nickel complexes act as key catalytic species.

         <title>Endo&#8208;M Mediated Chemoenzymatic Approach Enables Reversible Glycopeptide Labeling for O&#8208;GlcNAcylation Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To selectively enrich O&#8208;linked &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosamine (O&#8208;GlcNAc) peptides in their original form from complex samples, we report the first reversible chemoenzymatic labeling approach for proteomic analysis. In this strategy, the O&#8208;GlcNAc moieties are ligated with long N&#8208;glycans using an Endo&#8208;M mutant, which enables the enrichment of the labeled glycopeptides by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The attached glycans on the enriched glycopeptides are removed by wild&#8208;type Endo&#8208;M/S to restore the O&#8208;GlcNAc moiety. Compared with the classic chemoenzymatic labeling, this approach enables the tag&#8208;free identification, and eliminates the interference of bulky tags in glycopeptide detection. This approach presents a unique avenue for the proteome&#8208;wide analysis of protein O&#8208;GlcNAcylation to promote its mechanism research.</dc:description>

         <title>White&#8208;light Emission and Circularly Polarized Luminescence from a Chiral Copper(I) Coordination Polymer through Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Crystallization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving white&#8208;light emission, especially white circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) from a single&#8208;phase material is challenging. Herein, a pair of chiral Cu(I) coordination polymers (  1&#8208;M  and  1&#8208;P  ) have been prepared by the asymmetrical assembly of achiral ligands and Cu  2  I  2  clusters. The compounds display dual emission bands and can be used as single&#8208;phase white&#8208;light phosphors, achieving a &#8220;warm&#8221;&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode with an ultra&#8208;high color rendering index (CRI) of 93.4 and an appropriate correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3632 K. Meanwhile, corresponding CPL signals with maximum dissymmetry factor |  g  lum  | = 8&#215;10  &#8208;3  have been observed. Hence, intrinsic white&#8208;light emission and CPL have been realized simultaneously in coordination polymers for the first time. This work gains insight into the nature of chiral assembly from achiral units and offers a prospect for the development of single&#8208;phase white&#8208;CPL materials.</dc:description>

         <title>X&#8208;ray Electron Density Study of the Chemical Bonding Origin of Glass Formation in Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glass&#8208;forming metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have novel applications, but the origin of their peculiar melting behavior is unclear. Here, we report synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction electron densities of two zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), the glass&#8208;forming Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni and the isostructural thermally decomposing Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni. Electron density analysis shows that the Zn&#8210;N bonds are more ionic than Co&#8210;N bond, which have distinct covalent features. Variable temperature Raman spectra reveal onset of significant imidazolate bond weakening in Co&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni above 673 K. Melting can be controlled by tuning the metal&#8211;ligand and imidazole bonding strength as shown from thermal analysis of nine solid solution Co  x  Zn  1&#8208;x  &#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni (x = 0.3 to 0.003) MOFs, and a mere 4% Co&#8208;doping into Zn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;zni results in thermal decomposition instead of melting. The present findings demonstrate the key role of the metal&#8210;ligand bonds and imidazolate bonds in controlling the delicate balance between melting and decomposition processes in this class of ZIF compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tacticity Control of Cyclic Poly(3&#8208;Thiobutyrate) Prepared by Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Racemic &#946;&#8208;Thiobutyrolactone</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report here on the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of racemic &#946;&#8208;thiobutyrolactone (rac&#8208;TBL), as the first chemical synthesis of poly(3&#8208;thiobutyrolactone) (P3TB), the thioester analogue of the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB). The ROP reactions proceed very fast (TOF &gt; 12,000 h&#8210;1 at r.t.) in the presence of various metal&#8208;based catalysts. Remarkably, catalyst systems based on non&#8208;chiral yttrium complexes stabilized by tetradentate amino alkoxy&#8208; or diamino&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligands {ONXOR1,R2}2&#8210; (X = O, N) provide access to cyclic P3TB with either high isoselectivity (Pm up to 0.90) or high syndiotactic bias (Pr up to 0.70). The stereoselectivity can be controlled by manipulation of the substituents on the ligand platform and adequate choice of the reaction solvent and temperature as well. The cyclic polymer topology is evidenced by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS, NMR and TGA. Highly isotactic cyclic P3TB is a semi&#8208;crystalline material as revealed by DSC.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Desymmetric Dicarbofunctionalization of Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of multi&#8208;stereocenters of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction is a stubborn challenge. In the meanwhile, catalytic desymmetric functionalization of unactivated alkene remains largely unexplored. Herein, we disclose an unprecedented desymmetric dicarbofunctionalization of 1,6&#8208;dienes  via  nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction. The leverage of underdeveloped chiral 8&#8208;Quinox enables Ni&#8208;catalyzed desymmetric carbamoylalkylation of both unactivated mono&#8208; and disubstituted alkenes to forge the pyrrolidinone bearing two uncontinuous stereogenic centers in high enantio&#8208; and stereoselectivitives with broad functional group tolerance. The synthetic application of pyrrolidinones allows the rapid access to the complex chiral fused&#8208;heterocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Activated Ester&#8208;Amine Reaction for Enantioselective Multi&#8208;Channel Visual Detection of Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral recognition is of pivotal importance not only in living systems but also in estimating the optical purity of enantiomeric drugs and fabricating advanced materials. Herein we report a novel self&#8208;reporting activated ester&#8208;amine reaction that can provide multi&#8208;channel visual detection of organic amines. It relies on the reaction extent dependent  cis&#8208;transoid  to  cis&#8208;cisoid  helical transition of polyphenylacetylene backbone and thus triggered fluorescence. Owing to the high selectivity, this visual process can recognize structurally diverse achiral amines and quantitatively checkout the impurity content. Moreover, it also exhibits an outstanding enantioselectivity towards various chiral amines and can be applied to determine enantiomeric composition. The multiple responses in absorption, circular dichromism, photoluminescence, and circularly polarized luminescence make the helical transition of polymer backbone potential as a novel detection mode for high throughput screening of chiral chemicals.</dc:description>

         <title>Estimating Phosphorescent Emission Energies in IrIII Complexes Using Large&#8208;Scale Quantum Computing Simulations**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) quantum method was used to calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in phosphorescent IrIII complexes. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 logical qubits. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals studied, setting an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.







Abstract
Here we calculate T1&#8594;S0 transition energies in nine phosphorescent iridium complexes using the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method to determine if quantum simulations have any advantages over classical methods. These simulations would require a gate&#8208;based quantum computer with at least 72 fully&#8208;connected logical qubits. Since such devices do not yet exist, we demonstrate the iQCC method using a purpose&#8208;built quantum simulator on classical hardware. The results are compared to a selection of common DFT functionals, ab initio methods, and empirical data. iQCC is found to match the accuracy of the best DFT functionals, but with a better correlation coefficient, demonstrating that it is better at predicting the structure&#8211;property relationship. Results indicate that the iQCC method has the required accuracy to design organometallic complexes when deployed on emerging quantum hardware and sets an industrially relevant target for demonstrating quantum advantage.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Promoted ZnMe/ZnPh Exchange in Eight&#8208;Coordinate [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2]</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reaction of the 8&#8208;coordinate RuZn4 heterobimetallic complex [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2] with ZnPh2 leads to complete ZnMe/ZnPh exchange to form [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2]. Both species exhibit equilibria in solution with their alternative 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers and DFT calculations define facile isomerisation and hydride&#8208;assisted ZnMe/ZnPh exchange pathways.







Abstract
The syntheses, reactivity and electronic structure analyses of [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnMe)4H2], 1&#8201;a, and [Ru(PPh3)2(ZnPh)4H2], 2&#8201;b, are reported. 1&#8201;a exhibits an 8&#8208;coordinate Ru centre with axial phosphines and a symmetrical (2&#8201;:&#8201;2) arrangement of ZnMe ligands in the equatorial plane. The ZnMe ligands in 1&#8201;a undergo facile, sequential exchange with ZnPh2 to give 2&#8201;b, which shows a 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 arrangement of ZnPh ligands. Both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b exist in equilibrium with their respective 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 isomers. Mechanisms for ZnMe/ZnPh exchange and isomerisation are proposed using DFT calculations. The relationships of these {Ru(ZnR)4H2} species to isoelectronic Group 8 transition metal polyhydrides and related Schlenk equilibria in the Negishi reaction are discussed.

         <title>Direct Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Alkyl (Hetero)Aryl Ketones by an&#160;Engineered Amine Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Interfacial Chemistry Triggers Ultrafast Radiative Recombination in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial chemistry strategy is developed to dramatically increase radiative recombination of perovskites. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite has a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state, exhibiting an unprecedented 5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.







Abstract
Efficient radiative recombination is essential for perovskite luminescence, but the intrinsic radiative recombination rate as a basic material property is challenging to tailor. Here we report an interfacial chemistry strategy to dramatically increase the radiative recombination rate of perovskites. By coating aluminum oxide on the lead halide perovskite, lead&#8211;oxygen bonds are formed at the perovskite&#8208;oxide interface, producing the perovskite surface states with a large exciton binding energy and a high localized density of electronic state. The oxide&#8208;bonded perovskite exhibits a &#8776;500 fold enhanced photoluminescence with a &#8776;10 fold reduced lifetime, indicating an unprecedented &#8776;5000 fold increase in the radiative recombination rate. The enormously enhanced radiative recombination promises to significantly promote the perovskite optoelectronic performance.

Click On! &#951;6&#8208;Coordination of cationic cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) moieties is demonstrated to be a convenient, quantitative method for the click&#8208;like activation of aryl iodides as halogen bond donors. Photochemical demetalation using violet LEDs in MeCN returns the metal to its starting material form and supresses halogen bonding functionality. The cycle provides a reversible &#8220;ON/OFF&#8221; switch for controlling the halogen bond donor strength of aryl iodides.







Abstract
&#951;6&#8208;Metalated aryl halides are recognized as a class of halogen bond (XB) donors. Click&#8208;like &#951;6&#8208;metalation/demetalation of aryl iodides by cyclopentadienylruthenium(II) ([CpRuII]+) is shown to turn ON/OFF (amplify/suppress) XB donor functionality. [CpRu(MeCN)3][PF6] is shown to react quantitatively with iodobenzenes (ArIn, n=1,2) to yield [CpRu(&#951;6&#8208;ArIn)][PF6] compounds. Photochemical demetalation (405&#8197;nm) quantitatively reverts these compounds to ArIn and [CpRu(MeCN)3][PF6]. Crystal structures of [CpRu(ArXn)]+ salts show that the [CpRu(ArIn)]+ cations are strong, charge&#8208;assisted XB donors analogous to iodopyridinium cations. XB&#8208;induced association of [CpRu(C6H5I)]+ with diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) is established by NMR spectroscopy. [CpRu(C6H5I)][BPh4] and [CpRu(1,4&#8208;C6H4I2)][BPh4] co&#8208;crystallize with DABCO and the structure of [CpRu(1,4&#8208;C6H4I2)][BPh4]&#8901;DABCO&#8901;Et2O is reported. DFT calculations support amplification of the XBing capabilities of aryl iodides upon [CpRu]+&#8208;metalation.

         <title>Mapping Ambiphile Reactivity Trends in the Anti&#8208;(Hetero)annulation of Non&#8208;Conjugated Alkenes via PdII/PdIV Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to access 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles from non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides and ambiphilic organohalides is described. Under PdII/PdIV catalysis, this [n+2] annulation proceeds in an anti&#8208;selective fashion and tolerates a wide array of ambiphiles, which are systematically benchmarked with respect to nucleophile identity, electrophile identity, and product ring&#8208;size. Otherwise unreactive ambiphilic ortho&#8208;haloacetophenones can be activated using an amine co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
In this study, we systematically evaluate different ambiphilic organohalides for their ability to participate in anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208; or heteroannulation with non&#8208;conjugated alkenyl amides under PdII/PdIV catalysis. Detailed optimization of the reaction conditions has led to protocols for synthesizing tetrahydropyridines, tetralins, pyrrolidines, and other carbo/heterocyclic cores via [n+2] (n=3&#8211;5) (hetero)annulation. Expansion of scope to otherwise unreactive ambiphilic haloketones through PdII/amine co&#8208;catalysis is also demonstrated. Compared to other annulation processes, this method proceeds via a distinct PdII/PdIV mechanism involving Wacker&#8208;type directed nucleopalladation. This difference results in unique reactivity and selectivity patterns, as revealed through assessment of reaction scope and competition experiments.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Organic Reactions by Resonant Acoustic Mixing**

Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM) enables mechanochemical organic synthesis that avoids milling or crushing media, as well as bulk solvents. The RAM methodology enables significant simplification and improvement of mechanochemical olefin metathesis, the first mechanochemical strategy for ene&#8208;yne metathesis, and permits the direct, 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the mechanochemical synthesis of pharmaceutically active sulfonylureas, without any significant changes to reaction conditions or conversion.







Abstract
We demonstrate catalytic organic synthesis by Resonant Acoustic Mixing (RAM): a mechanochemical methodology that does not require bulk solvent or milling media. Using as model reactions ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing metathesis and copper&#8208;catalyzed sulfonamide&#8208;isocyanate coupling, RAM mechanosynthesis is shown to be faster, operationally simpler than conventional ball&#8208;milling, while also providing the first example of a mechanochemical strategy for ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed ene&#8208;yne metathesis. Reactions by RAM are readily and directly scaled&#8208;up without any significant changes in reaction conditions, as shown by the straightforward 200&#8208;fold scaling&#8208;up of the synthesis of the antidiabetic drug Tolbutamide, from hundreds of milligrams directly to 30&#8197;grams.

Reactions by RAM are readily and directly scaled-up without any significant changes in reaction conditions, as shown by the straightforward 200-fold scaling-up of the synthesis of the antidiabetic drug Tolbutamide, from hundreds of milligrams directly to 30&#8197;grams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Influenced Fragmentations in Free&#8208;Standing Three&#8208;Dimensional Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Hydrophobicity Switching</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel pre&#8208;synthetically controlled framework growth strategy to tune the hydrophobicity of the 3D&#8208;COF membranes without changing the building blocks or post&#8208;synthetic modifications is demonstrated. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane was utilized for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture.







Abstract
The ordered open organic frameworks membranes are attractive candidates for flow&#8208;assisted molecular separations. The physicochemical properties of such membranes mostly depend on their selectively chosen functional building blocks. In this work, we have introduced a novel concept of functional switchability of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes through a simple solvent&#8208;influenced fragmentation method. This room&#8208;temperature interfacial synthesis provides free&#8208;standing 3D&#8208;COF membranes with distinct physicochemical properties from the same building monomers. Notably, the change of solvent from chloroform to ethyl acetate switches the membrane property from hydrophilic (water contact angle 60&#176;) to hydrophobic (water contact angle 142&#176;) nature. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane selectively passes oil molecules from an oil&#8211;water emulsion with a gravitational flux of 1536&#8197;L&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Two&#8208;Component Excitonic Switch Utilizing High&#8208;Performance Diarylethenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doubly methylated diarylethenes derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine are reported with high thermal stability, fatigue resistance, and fluorogenicity. With these, an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides has been designed: one containing the fluorogenic diarylethene as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form an efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer pair.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) are an emerging class of photochromes but have rarely been used in materials science. Here, we have developed doubly methylated DAEs derived from 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine with high thermal stability and fatigue resistance. These new photoswitches not only outperform their predecessors but also rival classical non&#8208;nucleosidic DAEs. To demonstrate the utility of these new DAEs, we have designed an all&#8208;optical excitonic switch consisting of two oligonucleotides: one strand containing a fluorogenic double&#8208;methylated 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine as a fluorescence donor and the other a tricyclic cytidine (tC) as acceptor, which together form a highly efficient conditional F&#246;rster&#8208;Resonance&#8208;Energy&#8208;Transfer (FRET) pair. The system was operated in liquid and solid phases and showed both strong distance&#8208; and orientation&#8208;dependent photochromic FRET. The superior ON/OFF contrast was maintained over up to 100 switching cycles, with no detectable fatigue.

         <title>Coordinating the Mechanisms of Action of Ferroptosis and the Photothermal Effect for Cancer Theranostics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cancer theranostic nanomedicine (denoted as Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA) was designed by attentively considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect to promote maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects in combination therapy. The pH/GSH&#8208;responsive therapeutic and imaging characteristics of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles in the tumor enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.







Abstract
Combination therapy based on different mechanisms of cell death has shown promise in tumor therapy. However, when different modalities are integrated, the maximum synergy of the therapeutic effects is often lacking in the design. Herein, we report a cancer theranostic nanomedicine formula developed by considering the mechanisms of action of ferroptosis and the photothermal effect in combination therapy. The croconaine molecule was encapsulated as both a photothermal converter and an iron&#8208;chelating agent with BSA, thus leading to biocompatible and stable Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA nanoparticles (NPs). The Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs in the tumor milieu showed an activated photothermal effect leading to enhanced radical formation owing to the temperature&#8208;dependent Fenton reaction kinetics, while radical formation during ferroptosis in turn prevented the heat&#8208;induced formation of heat shock proteins and thus the self&#8208;protection mechanism of cancer cells in response to heat. The activatable photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging performance of the Cro&#8208;Fe@BSA NPs also enabled safe and reliable cancer theranostics.

         <title>Real&#8208;time Observation of Structural Dynamics Triggering Excimer Formation in a Perylene Bisimide Folda&#8208;dimer by Ultrafast Time&#8208;Domain Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The term &#8220;excimer&#8221;, a contraction of an excited dimer, is the most classical photoproduct in organic materials. In this work, vibrational snapshots showing ultrafast structural dynamics triggering the excimer formation and its relaxation are presented based on ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that interchromophore vibrational modes are related to perturbing the excited&#8208;state potential surface of a dimer stack.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic photovoltaic materials, an excimer state has been generally regarded as a trap state which hinders efficient excitation energy transport. But despite wide investigations of the excimer for overcoming the undesirable energy loss, the understanding of the relationship between the structure of the excimer in stacked organic compounds and its properties remains elusive. Here, we present the landscape of structural dynamics from the excimer formation to its relaxation in a co&#8208;facially stacked archetypical perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. We directly captured vibrational snapshots illustrating the ultrafast structural evolution triggering the excimer formation along the interchromophore coordinate on the complex excited&#8208;state potential surfaces and following evolution into a relaxed excimer state. Not only does this work showcase the ultrafast structural dynamics necessary for the excimer formation and control of excimer characteristics but also provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

         <title>Highly Enhanced Aromatics Selectivity by Coupling of Chloromethane and Carbon Monoxide over H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into aromatics by coupling of CH3Cl with CO over H&#8208;zeolites is presented, which achieved 82.2&#8201;% aromatic selectivity with ca. 60&#8201;% BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity over HZSM&#8208;5. 2,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one is detected as an intermediate generated from acetyl group and olefins resulting in a new aromatization.







Abstract
The transformation of methane into high value&#8208;added chemicals such as aromatics provides a more desired approach towards sustainable chemistry but remains a critical challenge due to the low selectivity of aromatics and poor stability. Herein, we first report a coupling reaction of CH3Cl and CO (CCTA) based on methane conversion, which achieves extremely high aromatics selectivity (82.2&#8201;%) with the selectivity of BTX up to ca. 60&#8201;% over HZSM&#8208;5. The promoting effects have been demonstrated on other zeolites especially 10&#8208;membered rings (10 MR) zeolites. Multiple characterizations show that 2,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;cyclopentene&#8208;1&#8208;one (DMCPO) is generated from acetyl groups and olefins. Furthermore, isotopic labeling analysis confirms that CO is inserted into the DMCPO and aromatics rings. A new aromatization mechanism is proposed, including the formation of the above intermediates, which conspicuously weakens the hydrogen transfer reaction, leading to a considerable increase of aromatics selectivity and a dramatic drop in alkanes.

     alt="Highly Enhanced Aromatics Selectivity by Coupling of Chloromethane and Carbon Monoxide over H-ZSM-5"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into aromatics by coupling of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl with CO over H-zeolites is presented, which achieved 82.2&#8201;% aromatic selectivity with ca. 60&#8201;% BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity over HZSM-5. 2,3-Dimethyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one is detected as an intermediate generated from acetyl group and olefins resulting in a new aromatization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transformation of methane into high value-added chemicals such as aromatics provides a more desired approach towards sustainable chemistry but remains a critical challenge due to the low selectivity of aromatics and poor stability. Herein, we first report a coupling reaction of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and CO (CCTA) based on methane conversion, which achieves extremely high aromatics selectivity (82.2&#8201;%) with the selectivity of BTX up to ca. 60&#8201;% over HZSM-5. The promoting effects have been demonstrated on other zeolites especially 10-membered rings (10 MR) zeolites. Multiple characterizations show that 2,3-dimethyl-2-cyclopentene-1-one (DMCPO) is generated from acetyl groups and olefins. Furthermore, isotopic labeling analysis confirms that CO is inserted into the DMCPO and aromatics rings.

         <title>Finite Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional DNA Hierarchical Nanoarchitectures through Orthogonal and Directional Bonding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Establishing robust orthogonal and directional bonding lays the foundation for the construction of finite DNA origami superstructures with complex shapes. By employing a twelve&#8208;valence hexagonal prism DNA origami as the building block, versatile superstructures were obtained from different combinations of building blocks with appropriate valences. All of these superstructures are fully addressable and could guide the assembly of guest molecules to produce functional devices.







Abstract
Reliable orthogonal bonding with precise and flexible orientation control would be ideal for building finite complex nanostructures via self&#8208;assembly. Employing a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) DNA origami, hexagonal prism DNA origami (HDO), as building block, we demonstrate it is practical to construct finite hierarchical nanoarchitectures with complicated conformations through orthogonal and directional bonding. The as&#8208;designed HDO building block has twelve prescribed directional valences in 3D space and each of them supports two opposite orientations, yielding the capability to generate abundant directional bonding. Meanwhile, we minimize the thorny non&#8208;specific interactions among HDOs and enable the orthogonal bonding between any two valences based on self&#8208;similar designing. Consequently, various hierarchical nanostructures are prepared at will simply by the combination of HDOs with appropriate valences. We believe this route towards hierarchically assembly is inspiring and hope it will facilitate the fabrication of functional superstructures.

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Stannate(II): A Tetraamido Tin(II) Dianion and Strong Metal&#8208;Centered &#963;&#8208;Donor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The macrocyclic calix[4]pyrrole enables the synthesis of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion. The compound is a very strong metal&#8208;centered &#963;&#8208;donor with a Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) value exceeding that of carbenes and electron&#8208;rich phosphines. The coordinative and nucleophilic features are demonstrated with transition metals and organic substrates.







Abstract
Anionic, metal&#8208;centered nucleophiles are emerging compounds with unique reactivities. Here, we describe the isolation and full characterization of the first tetraamido tin(II) dianion, its behavior as ligand towards transition metals, and its reactivity as a tin&#8208;centered nucleophile. Experimental values such as the Tolman electronic parameter (TEP) and computations attest tin&#8208;located &#963;&#8208;donor ability exceeding that of carbenes or electron&#8208;rich phosphines. Against transition metals, the stannate(II) can act as &#951;1&#8208; or &#951;5&#8208;type ligand. With aldehydes, it reacts by hydride substitution to give valuable acyl stannates. The reductive dehalogenation of iodobenzene indicates facile redox pathways mediated by halogen bond interaction. Calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) represents the first example of this macrocyclic ligand in low&#8208;valent p&#8208;block element chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Uptake of an Iridium Complex inside Engineered apo&#8208;Ferritin Nanocages: Study of Structure and Catalysis**
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable hybrid bio&#8208;nanocage with selective immobilization of an iridium complex inside the self&#8208;assembly protein, ferritin has been developed. These hybrid bio&#8208;catalysts reduce substituted acetophenones into the corresponding chiral alcohols with high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
The effect of the mutation at the core of the ferritin nanocage (apo&#8208;rHLFr) on the uptake of IrCp* has been investigated by structural and spectroscopic methods. Site&#8208;specific mutations of two polar residues viz., Asp38 and Arg52 were investigated. The uptake of IrCp* was increased by about 1.5&#8208;fold on mutation of Arg52 by His compared to the wild&#8208;type variant, while mutation of Asp38 by His had no effect on the uptake. All the variants of the Ir&#8208;embedded ferritin cages remained as stable as the wild&#8208;type analogue. These hybrid bio&#8208;nanocages of ferritin were found to efficiently catalyze transfer hydrogenation of various substituted acetophenones forming the corresponding chiral alcohols with up to 88&#8201;% conversion and 70&#8201;% enantioselectivity. An electron&#8208;withdrawing substituent on the reactant enhanced the Turnover frequency of the reaction. Molecular docking analyses suggested that the substrate binds in different orientations at the active site in different mutants of the nanocage.

         <title>Mechanism of the Bifunctional Multiple Product Sesterterpene Synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sesterterpene synthase from Aspergillus calidoustus was characterised that produces calidoustene, a compound with a new skeleton, besides five known compounds. A deep mechanistic investigation through isotopic labelling experiments, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis and DFT calculations is presented. The substrate analog 8&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;FPP was converted into several oxygenated terpenoids.







Abstract
The multiproduct chimeric sesterterpene synthase AcAS from Aspergillus calidoustus yielded spirocyclic calidoustene, which exhibits a novel skeleton, besides five known sesterterpenes. The complex cyclisation mechanism to all six compounds was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments in combination with DFT calculations. Chemically synthesised 8&#8208;hydroxyfarnesyl diphosphate was converted with isopentenyl diphosphate and AcAS into four oxygenated sesterterpenoids that structurally resemble cytochrome&#8197;P450 oxidation products of the sesterterpene hydrocarbons. Protein engineering of AcAS broadened the substrate scope and gave significantly improved enzyme yields.

         <title>The Role of Copper Salts and O2 in the Mechanism of C&#8801;N Bond Activation for Facilitating Nitrogen Transfer Reactions**

         <dc:description>
A detailed theoretical study on the intricate mechanism and electron transfer landscape of oxygen&#8208;assisted copper&#8208;promoted formation of aryl nitrile species starting from aryl aldehyde. In this reaction the major driving force is the redox cycle of the copper center (CuII/CuI), which acts as the electron source and sink whenever necessary along the course of reaction.







Abstract
C&#8801;N bond scission can be a potential avenue for the functionalization of chemical bonds. We have conducted a computational study, using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio multireference CASSCF methods, to unravel the intricate mechanistic pathways traversed in the copper&#8208;promoted, dioxygen&#8208;assisted reaction for the formation of aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehyde. This aryl isocyanate species acts as an active species for C&#8801;N bond cleavage of coordinated cyanide anion enabling nitrogen transfer to various aldehydes. Electronic structure analysis revealed that under all the reaction conditions radical&#8208;based pathways are operative, which is in agreement with the experimental findings. The major driving force is a CuII/I redox cycle initiated by single&#8208;electron transfer from the carbon center of the nitrile moiety. Our study reveals that the copper salts act as the &#8220;electron pool&#8221; in this unique nitrogen transfer reaction forming an aryl isocyanate species from aryl aldehydes.

&lt;p&gt;A detailed theoretical study on the intricate mechanism and electron transfer landscape of oxygen-assisted copper-promoted formation of aryl nitrile species starting from aryl aldehyde. In this reaction the major driving force is the redox cycle of the copper center (Cu&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;), which acts as the electron source and sink whenever necessary along the course of reaction.

         <title>Dehydrated UiO&#8208;66(SH)2: The Zr&#8722;O Cluster and Its Photocatalytic Role Mimicking the Biological Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66(SH)2, was found to show efficient conversion of N2 into NH3 under visible light. The revealed synergetic action of the photoelectron supported by the proton was analogous to that in molybdenum nitrogenase, however, with characteristic &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions inside the [Zr6O6] cluster, which sheds new light on understanding the mechanism of nitrogenase.







Abstract
This work reports the dehydrated Zr&#8208;based MOF UiO&#8208;66(SH)2 as a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalyst to mimic the biological N2 fixation process. The 15N2 and other control experiments demonstrated that the new photocatalyst is highly efficient in converting N2 to ammonia. In&#8208;situ TGA, XPS, and EXAFS as well as first&#8208;principles simulations were used to demonstrate the role of the thermal treatment and the changes of the local structures around Zr due to the dehydration. It was shown that the dehydration opened a gate for the entry of N2 molecules into the [Zr6O6] cluster where the strong N&#8801;N bond was broken stepwise by &#956;&#8208;N&#8722;Zr type interactions driven by the photoelectrons aided by the protonation. This mechanism was discussed in comparison with the Lowe&#8211;Thorneley mechanism proposed for the MoFe nitrogenase, and with emphasis on the [Zr6O6] cluster effect and the leading role of photoelectrons over the protonation. The results shed new light on understanding the catalytic mechanism of biological N2 fixation and open a new way to fix N2 under mild conditions.

         <title>Mapping Dual&#8208;Base&#8208;Enabled Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Aryl Amidations: Application in the Synthesis of 4&#8208;Quinolones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides with 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones enabled the synthesis of sought&#8208;after 4&#8208;quinolones. The use of a new pre&#8208;catalyst supported by PAd2&#8208;DalPhos in combination with a DBU/NaTFA dual&#8208;base system, along with a thorough mechanistic investigation led to a successful demonstration of room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
The C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halides with NH substrates employing nickel catalysts and organic amine bases represents an emergent strategy for the sustainable synthesis of (hetero)anilines. However, unlike protocols that rely on photoredox/electrochemical/reductant methods within NiI/III cycles, the reaction steps that comprise a putative Ni0/II C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling cycle for a thermally promoted catalyst system using organic amine base have not been elucidated. Here we disclose an efficient new nickel&#8208;catalyzed protocol for the C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling of amides and 2&#8242;&#8208;(pseudo)halide&#8208;substituted acetophenones, for the first time where the (pseudo)halide is chloride or sulfonate, which makes use of the commercial bisphosphine ligand PAd2&#8208;DalPhos (L4) in combination with an organic amine base/halide scavenger, leading to 4&#8208;quinolones. Room&#8208;temperature stoichiometric experiments involving isolated Ni0, I, and II species support a Ni0/II pathway, where the combined action of DBU/NaTFA allows for room&#8208;temperature amide cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Copper(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Synthesis of P&#8208;Chiral Aminophosphinites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric synthesis of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites with esters of hydroxylamines is achieved by means of the dynamic kinetic transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines. A two&#8208;electron redox process is proposed for this reaction based on mechanistic studies.







Abstract
Herein, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed reaction of diarylphosphines and O&#8208;benzoyl hydroxylamines is developed. In the cases of symmetrical diarylphosphines, a series of aminophosphinites is prepared in high yields. In the cases of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines, an array of P&#8208;chiral aminophosphinites is synthesized in high yields with high enantioselectivity by using a copper(I)&#8208;(R,RP)&#8208;Ph&#8208;FOXAP complex as a chiral catalyst. Based on several control experiments and 31P&#8197;NMR studies, a two&#8208;electron redox mechanism involving the dynamic kinetic asymmetric transformation of unsymmetrical diarylphosphines is proposed for the copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction. Finally, one representative P&#8208;chiral phosphoric amide generated through the oxidation with H2O2 is transformed to a chiral diarylphosphinate in high yield with retained enantioselectivity, which allows further transformations towards various P&#8208;chiral tertiary phosphines.

H&#8208;bonding network: Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) can act as a hydrogen&#8208;bond donor to enhance the catalytic efficiency of simple Br&#248;nsted acid catalysts in carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by stabilization of all transition states and intermediates along the reaction pathway.







Abstract
Synthetic chemists have learned to mimic nature in using hydrogen bonds and other weak interactions to dictate the spatial arrangement of reaction substrates and to stabilize transition states to enable highly efficient and selective reactions. The activation of a catalyst molecule itself by hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, in order to enhance its catalytic activity to achieve a desired reaction outcome, is less explored in organic synthesis, despite being a commonly found phenomenon in nature. Herein, we show our investigation into this underexplored area by studying the promotion of carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reactions by hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted Br&#248;nsted acid catalysis, using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) solvent in combination with para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA). Our experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal not only an interesting role of HFIP solvent in assisting pTSA Br&#248;nsted acid catalyst, but also insightful knowledge about the current limitations of the carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction.

         <title>Electrochemical Deposition of a Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanorod Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Film with Efficient Charge and Exciton Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical film deposition of a single&#8208;crystalline polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon on electrodes, with synthetically controlled crystal structure, film thickness, and crystal orientations is reported. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both charges and excitons, with a free carrier mobility over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, a low exciton binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV, and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Electrochemical deposition has emerged as an efficient technique for preparing conjugated polymer films on electrodes. However, this method encounters difficulties in synthesizing crystalline products and controlling their orientation on electrodes. Here we report electrochemical film deposition of a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The film is composed of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods, in which the molecules adopt a cofacial stacking arrangement along the &#960;&#8211;&#960; direction. Film thickness and crystal size can be controlled by electrochemical conditions such as scan rate and electrolyte species, while the choice of anode material determines crystal orientation. The film supports exceptionally efficient migration of both free carriers and excitons: the free carrier mobility reaches over 30&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, whereas the excitons are delocalized with a low binding energy of 118.5&#8197;meV and a remarkable exciton diffusion length of 45&#8197;nm.

         <title>Engineering Enzyme&#8208;Cleavable Oligonucleotides by Automated Solid&#8208;Phase Incorporation of Cathepsin B Sensitive Dipeptide Linkers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide phosphoramidites were developed for automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. The enzymatic cleavage of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 by cathepsin B is efficient in the context of single&#8208;stranded DNA, but is sterically hindered by double&#8208;stranded DNA and short hairpin loops. The design of Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone allows the construction of oligonucleotide&#8211;drug conjugates which release their small&#8208;molecule payload after enzymatic cleavage.







Abstract
Oligonucleotides containing cleavable linkers have emerged as versatile tools to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive and site&#8208;specific cleavage of DNA. However, the limitations of previously reported cleavable linkers including photolabile and disulfide linkers have restricted their applications in vivo. Inspired by the cathepsin B&#8208;sensitive dipeptide linkers in antibody&#8211;drug conjugates (ADCs) such as Adcetris, we have developed Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone phosphoramidites for the automated synthesis of enzyme&#8208;cleavable oligonucleotides. Cathepsin B digests Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;02 and Val&#8208;Ala&#8208;Chalcone linkers efficiently, enabling cleavage of oligonucleotides into two components or release of small&#8208;molecule payloads. Based on the prior success of dipeptide linkers in ADCs, we believe that these dipeptide linker phosphoramidites will promote new clinical applications of therapeutic oligonucleotides.

         <title>A Cholesterol Dimer Stabilizes the Inactivated State of an Inward&#8208;Rectifier Potassium Channel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of a cholesterol dimer&#8208;inward rectifier (Kir) channel complex using solid&#8208;state NMR and simulated annealing calculations is solved. The identified cholesterol binding pocket is directly linked to the mechanism of cholesterol&#8208;mediated inactivation of Kir channels. This work is one of the most detailed structural&#8208;functional studies of cholesterol dimer&#8208;protein interactions within a biological membrane.







Abstract
Cholesterol oligomers reside in multiple membrane protein X&#8208;ray crystal structures. Yet, there is no direct link between these oligomers and a biological function. Here we present the structural and functional details of a cholesterol dimer that stabilizes the inactivated state of an inward&#8208;rectifier potassium channel KirBac1.1. K+ efflux assays confirm that high cholesterol concentration reduces K+ conductance. We then determine the structure of the cholesterol&#8208;KirBac1.1 complex using Xplor&#8208;NIH simulated annealing calculations driven by solid&#8208;state NMR distance measurements. These calculations identified an &#945;&#8211;&#945; cholesterol dimer docked to a cleft formed by adjacent subunits of the homotetrameric protein. We compare these results to coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations. This is one of the first examples of a cholesterol oligomer performing a distinct biological function and structural characterization of a conserved promiscuous lipid binding region.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Furfural in Aqueous Acetic Acid Media with Enhanced 2&#8208;Methylfuran Selectivity Using CuPd Bimetallic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of Pd enhanced the selectivity of Cu catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran in an aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acidic acid solution. The origin of the superior performance was revealed by in&#8197;situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic measurements and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report a series of CuPd catalysts for electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of furfural to 2&#8208;methylfuran (MF or FurCH3 where Fur=furyl) in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M acetic acid (pH&#8197;2.9). The highest faradaic efficiency (FE) for MF reached 75&#8201;% at &#8722;0.58&#8197;V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode with an average partial current density of 4.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In&#8197;situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopic and kinetic isotopic experiments suggested that electrogenerated adsorbed hydrogen (Hads) was involved in the reaction and incorporation of Pd enhanced the surface coverage of Hads and optimized the adsorption pattern of furfural, leading to a higher FE for MF. Density functional theory calculations revealed that Pd incorporation reduced the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of FurCH2* to FurCH3*. Our study demonstrates that catalyst surface structure/composition plays a crucial role in determining the selectivity in ECH and provides a new strategy for designing advanced catalysts for ECH of bio&#8208;derived oxygenates.

         <title>Halogen Bonding: A New Platform for Achieving Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Persistent Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) was introduced into the host&#8211;guest room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system, achieving fluorescence&#8211;phosphorescence dual&#8208;emission. The weak intermolecular interactions of the halogen bond are sensitive to external stimuli (heat, mechanical force and X&#8208;rays), realizing the colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli response behaviors.

Monotonous luminescence has always been a major factor limiting the application of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials. Enhancing and regulating the intermolecular interactions between the host and guest is an effective strategy to achieve excellent phosphorescence performance. In this study, intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) was introduced into the host&#8211;guest RTP system. The interaction promoted intersystem crossing and stabilized the triplet excitons, thus helping to achieve strong phosphorescence emission. In addition, the weak intermolecular interaction of halogen bonding is sensitive to external stimuli such as heat, mechanical force, and X&#8208;rays. Therefore, the triplet excitons were easily quenched and colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli responsive behaviors were realized, which greatly enriched the luminescence functionality of the RTP materials. This method provides a new platform for the future design of responsive RTP materials based on weak intermolecular interactions between the host and guest molecules.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Containing Nucleic Acid&#8208;Based Energy&#8208;Storage Nanoagent for Continuously Photo&#8208;Induced Oxidative Stress Amplification</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The siRNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;ferrocene modified persistent luminescence nanoparticle (siRNA&#8208;ApFe&#8208;PLNP) was designed as an energy&#8208;storage nanoagent to achieve continuous amplification of oxidative stress after photo&#8208;activation, eliminating the need for constant light irradiation and further avoiding the photo&#8208;induced tissue damage.







Abstract
Regulation of cellular oxidative stress plays a critical role in revealing the molecular mechanisms of cellular activities and thus is a potential strategy for tumor treatment. Optical methods have been employed for intelligent regulation of oxidative stress in tumor regions. However, long&#8208;time continuous irradiation inevitably causes damage to normal tissues. Herein, a ferrocene&#8208;containing nucleic acid&#8208;based energy&#8208;storage nanoagent was designed to achieve the continuous photo&#8208;regulation of cellular oxidative stress in the dark. Specifically, the photoenergy stored in the agent could convert effectively and accelerate Fenton&#8208;like reaction continuously, augmenting cellular oxidative stress. This nanoagent could also silence oxidative damage repair genes to further amplify oxidative stress. This strategy not only provides oxidative stress regulation for studying the molecular mechanisms of biological activities, but also offers a promising step toward tumor microenvironment modulation.

         <title>Rewritable Macromolecular Data Storage with Automated Read&#8208;out</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rewriting of information stored on synthetic macromolecules is achieved via the introduction of an editable position tag. The automated read&#8208;out is facilitated by making use of an algorithm that is able to decode large portions of macromolecular information without interference from the operator.







Abstract
Rewriting data stored on synthetic macromolecules is an interesting feature, even though it is considered as being quite challenging within the area of digital macromolecules. In this context, we initially studied a strategy for modifying the position tag of sequence&#8208;encoded macromolecules in a reversible manner. The efficiency of this method, which relies on the orthogonal cleavage of a thioester moiety via aminolysis, was demonstrated by modifying parts of an exemplary sentence. Simultaneously, a novel algorithm was developed to ease the read&#8208;out of macromolecular information by means of MS/MS techniques. This program, Oligoreader, can identify potential information&#8208;containing macromolecules from a series of MS1 spectra, analyze the corresponding MS2 spectra, and finally decode the data. Consequently, the algorithm simplifies the entire read&#8208;out process by avoiding any interference from the operator, which increases the potential for blind sequencing of uniform macromolecules.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery with a Wide Operation&#8208;Temperature Range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide&#8208;temperature range sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB), which involves a Bi anode, a NFPP@C cathode and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte is successfully fabricated. Owing to the solvent co&#8208;intercalation mechanism of the Bi anode, the high Na+ diffusion coefficient of the NFPP@C cathode at low temperature and the electrolyte with a high boiling point and low freezing point, the prepared SIB can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), as one of the potential candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage systems, are required to tackle extreme weather conditions. However, the all&#8208;weather SIBs with a wide operation&#8208;temperature range are rarely reported. Herein, we propose a wide&#8208;temperature range SIB, which involves a carbon&#8208;coated Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 (NFPP@C) cathode, a bismuth (Bi) anode, and a diglyme&#8208;based electrolyte. We demonstrate that solvated Na+ can be directly stored by the Bi anode via an alloying reaction without the de&#8208;solvent process. Furthermore, the NFPP@C cathode exhibits a high Na+ diffusion coefficient at low temperature. As a result, the Bi//NFPP@C battery exhibits perfect low&#8208;temperature behavior. Even at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C, this battery still delivers 70.19&#8201;% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity. Furthermore, benefitting from the high boiling point of the electrolyte, this battery also works well at a high temperature of up to 100&#8201;&#176;C. These results are encouraging for the further exploration of wide&#8208;temperature range SIBs.

         <title>A Multiplexed Cell&#8208;Free Assay to Screen for Antimicrobial Peptides in Double Emulsion Droplets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel microfluidic system for the cell&#8208;free production and screening of antimicrobial peptides for their membrane specificity is introduced. On the device, the peptides are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The droplets can be analyzed via fluorescence microscopy of flow cytometry.







Abstract
The global surge in bacterial resistance against traditional antibiotics triggered intensive research for novel compounds, with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) identified as a promising candidate. Automated methods to systematically generate and screen AMPs according to their membrane preference, however, are still lacking. We introduce a novel microfluidic system for the simultaneous cell&#8208;free production and screening of AMPs for their membrane specificity. On our device, AMPs are cell&#8208;free produced within water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water double emulsion droplets, generated at high frequency. Within each droplet, the peptides can interact with different classes of co&#8208;encapsulated liposomes, generating a membrane&#8208;specific fluorescent signal. The double emulsions can be incubated and observed in a hydrodynamic trapping array or analyzed via flow cytometry. Our approach provides a valuable tool for the discovery and development of membrane&#8208;active antimicrobials.

         <title>Quantification of the Dynamic Interface Evolution in High&#8208;Efficiency Working Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental interplay among Li dynamic loss behavior, electrolyte composition, and the structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer was quantitatively elucidated. The actual dominant form in inactive Li loss is determined by the relative growth rates of dead Li0 and SEI Li+ as the anode interface undergoes processive evolution during cycling. The mechanistic studies shed fresh light on the interfacial dynamics of the Li&#8208;metal anode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has been considered a promising anode for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, the low reversibility and intricate Li loss hinder the widespread implementation of Li metal batteries. Herein, we quantitatively differentiate the dynamic evolution of inactive Li, and decipher the fundamental interplay among dynamic Li loss, electrolyte chemistry, and the structure of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The actual dominant form in inactive Li loss is practically determined by the relative growth rates of dead Li0 and SEI Li+ because of the persistent evolution of the Li metal interface during cycling. Distinct inactive Li evolution scenarios are disclosed by ingeniously tuning the inorganic anion&#8208;derived SEI chemistry with a low amount of film&#8208;forming additive. An optimal polymeric film enabler of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is demonstrated to derive a highly uniform multilayer SEI and decreased SEI Li+/dead Li0 growth rates, thus achieving enhanced Li cycling reversibility.

         <title>Interfacial Atom&#8208;Substitution Engineered Transition&#8208;Metal Hydroxide Nanofibers with High&#8208;Valence Fe for Efficient Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>

An electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber was synthesized by an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to boost the activity of the NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts.







Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for efficient and robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key for scalable water electrolysis, for instance, NiFe&#8208;based materials. Decorating NiFe catalysts with other transition metals offers a new path to boost their catalytic activities but often suffers from the low controllability of the electronic structures of the NiFe catalytic centers. Here, we report an interfacial atom&#8208;substitution strategy to synthesize an electrocatalytic oxygen&#8208;evolving NiFeV nanofiber to boost the activity of NiFe centers. The electronic structure analyses suggest that the NiFeV nanofiber exhibits abundant high&#8208;valence Fe via a charge transfer from Fe to V. The NiFeV nanofiber supported on a carbon cloth shows a low overpotential of 181&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, along with long&#8208;term stability (&gt;20&#8197;h) at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The reported substitutional growth strategy offers an effective and new pathway for the design of efficient and durable non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based OER catalysts.

         <title>Reversible Self&#8208;Assembly of an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible self&#8208;assembly of an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene mediated by conformational switching can be tuned via controllable experimental conditions, leaving behind different largely ordered structures. Such method provides a new alternative and convenient method to influence the self&#8208;assembled structure of NHC&#8208;metal monolayers, a still missing but essential tool towards catalytic applications.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of cyclohexyl cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (cyCAAC) can be realized and reversibly switched from a close&#8208;packed trimer phase to a chainlike dimer phase, enabled by the ring&#8208;flip of the cyclohexyl wingtip. Multiple methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a distinct isomer (axial or equatorial chair conformer) in each phase, and consequently support the conclusion regarding the determination of molecular surface geometry on the self&#8208;assembly of cyCAAC. Moreover, various substrates such as Ag (111) and Cu (111) are tested to elucidate the importance of cyCAAC&#8208;surface interactions on cyCAAC based nanopatterns. These investigations of patterned surfaces prompted a deep understanding of cyCAAC binding mode, surface geometry and reversible self&#8208;assembly, which are of paramount significance in the areas of catalysis, biosensor design and surface functionalization.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excimer (a contraction of the excited&#8208;state dimer) is the most classical photoproduct which has been generally regarded as a trap site. In their Research Article (202114474), Hyungjun Kim, Frank W&#252;rthner, Dongho Kim and co&#8208;workers have captured the vibrational snapshots triggering the excimer formation and relaxation processes of the perylene bisimide folda&#8208;dimer using the ultrafast time&#8208;domain Raman spectroscopy. Understanding the mechanism of the excimer provides important criteria for designing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic molecules.

Can we tune the physicochemical properties of free&#8208;standing organic membranes without changing the building blocks or post&#8208;synthetic modifications? The Research Article (e202200905) by Dinesh Shetty et&#8197;al. demonstrates a novel pre&#8208;synthetically controlled framework growth strategy to tune the hydrophobicity of 3D&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework (3D&#8208;COF) membranes. The hydrophobic 3D&#8208;COF membrane shows potential use for the demulsification of an oil&#8211;water mixture, a significant environmental and water reuse issue.

The coupling of CH3Cl with CO over H&#8208;zeolites is an efficient reaction strategy for the transformation of methane into aromatics, which ensures the sustainable development of natural gas in an environmental pathway. In their Research Article (e202114953), Hongchao Liu, Wenliang Zhu, Zhongmin Liu, and co&#8208;workers report that high aromatics and BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) selectivity can be achieved with complete conversion of CH3Cl over HZSM&#8208;5, following a new aromatization mechanism.

Halogen bonding is an effective tool in solid&#8208;state supramolecular chemistry to stabilize crystal structures. In their Research Article (e202200236), Zhengxu Cai and co&#8208;workers introduced intermolecular halogen bonding (CN&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Br) into a host&#8212;guest room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) system, achieving fluorescence&#8212;phosphorescence dual emission. The weak intermolecular interactions of the halogen bond are sensitive to external stimuli (heat, mechanical force and X&#8208;rays), realizing colorimetric multi&#8208;stimuli response behavior.

         <title>Layered Biomimetic Composites from MXenes with Sequential Bridging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered nanocomposites fabricated by techniques other than layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly (e.g. vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration and blade coating) contain voids in their structure, which reduces their performance. Cheng and co&#8208;workers have now found that the problem of voids in Ti3C2Tx MXene composites can be solved by sequential bridging of MXEne platelets with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose combined with covalent bridging by borate ions.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly is a widely used technique for the self&#8208;assembly of layered nanocomposites from clay sheets, carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, nanoparticles, and other materials. Other approaches for fabricating layered nanocomposites include vacuum&#8208;assisted filtration and blade coating. They are simpler than LbL assembly, but they all introduce voids into the layered structure, thereby reducing the performance of the resulting nanocomposites. A team from Beihang University evaluated the void structure in Ti3C2Tx MXene composites and found that the fundamental problem with voids can be solved by the sequential nanoscale bonding of MXEne platelets with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose combined with covalent bridging with borate ions, thereby opening a new path to self&#8208;assemble two&#8208;dimensional platelets into continuous high&#8208;performance layered nanocomposites.

         <title>Planar Chirality: A Mine for Catalysis and Structure Discovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the benefits of molecules exhibiting planar chirality have recently been recognized in different areas of chemistry, the shortage of available catalytic methods for generating planar chirality has precluded their use. This Minireview aims to highlight the infancy of the area and serve as a source of inspiration for the design of unconventional methods for the generation of three&#8208;dimensional complexity from accessible simple/linear molecules.







Abstract
Planar chirality is one of the most fascinating expressions of chirality, which is exploited by nature to lock three&#8208;dimensional chiral conformations and, more recently, by chemists to create new chiral reagents, catalysts, and functional organic materials. Nevertheless, the shortage of procedures able to induce and secure asymmetry during the generation of these unique chiral entities has dissuaded chemists from exploiting their structural properties. This Minireview intends to illustrate the limited but remarkable catalytic methods that have been reported for the production of planar chirality in strained molecules and serve as a source of inspiration for the development of new unconventional procedures, which are expected to appear in the near future.

         <title>Advances in the Sensing and Treatment of Wound Biofilms</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wound biofilms are a challenging problem for modern medicine. Advances in the areas of sensors and reporters that can accurately detect early biofilm formation in the wound, and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offer promise for better detection and treatment. This review focuses on novel approaches to biofilm eradication and detection and compares them to conventional methods.







Abstract
Wound biofilms represent a particularly challenging problem in modern medicine. They are increasingly antibiotic resistant and can prevent the healing of chronic wounds. However, current treatment and diagnostic options are hampered by the complexity of the biofilm environment. In this review, we present new chemical avenues in biofilm sensors and new materials to treat wound biofilms, offering promise for better detection, chemical specificity, and biocompatibility. We briefly discuss existing methods for biofilm detection and focus on novel, sensor&#8208;based approaches that show promise for early, accurate detection of biofilm formation on wound sites and that can be translated to point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings. We then discuss technologies inspired by new materials for efficient biofilm eradication. We focus on ultrasound&#8208;induced microbubbles and nanomaterials that can both penetrate the biofilm and simultaneously carry active antimicrobials and discuss the benefits of those approaches in comparison to conventional methods.

         <title>Significance of Receptor Mobility in Multivalent Binding on Lipid Membranes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivalent membrane processes result in numerous receptors being coupled on a diffusive surface. As such, these binding mechanisms depend heavily on the intrinsic mobility on the cell membrane. The Minireview discusses the importance of mobility in multivalent binding, demonstrating that it is crucial for the deeper understanding of receptor interactions, and to guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.







Abstract
Numerous key biological processes rely on the concept of multivalency, where ligands achieve stable binding only upon engaging multiple receptors. These processes, like viral entry or immune synapse formation, occur on the diffusive cellular membrane. One crucial, yet underexplored aspect of multivalent binding is the mobility of coupled receptors. Here, we discuss the consequences of mobility in multivalent processes from four perspectives: (I)&#8197;The facilitation of receptor recruitment by the multivalent ligand due to their diffusivity prior to binding. (II)&#8197;The effects of receptor preassembly, which allows their local accumulation. (III)&#8197;The consequences of changes in mobility upon the formation of receptor/ligand complex. (IV)&#8197;The changes in the diffusivity of lipid environment surrounding engaged receptors. We demonstrate how understanding mobility is essential for fully unravelling the principles of multivalent membrane processes, leading to further development in studies on receptor interactions, and guide the design of new generations of multivalent ligands.

         <title>Phosphonate/Phosphine Oxide Dyad Additive for Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one dyad additive combining phosphonate and phosphine oxide groups for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is demonstrated. Owing to its dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs with maximum external quantum efficiency of 25.1&#8201;% is obtained.







Abstract
Additives play a critical role for efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Here, we report a novel phosphonate/phosphine oxide dyad molecular additive (PE&#8208;TPPO), with unique dual roles of passivating defects and enhancing carrier radiative recombination, to boost the device efficiency of metal&#8211;halide perovskites. In addition to the defect passivation effect of the phosphine oxide group to enhance the photoluminescence intensity and homogeneity of perovskite film, the phosphonate group with strong electron affinity can capture the injected electrons to increase local carrier concentration and accelerate the carrier radiative recombination in the electroluminescence process. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional green PeLEDs modified by this dyad additive exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency, current efficiency, and power efficiency of 25.1&#8201;%, 100.5&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, and 98.7&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies.

         <title>Binary Solvent Regulated Architecture of Ultra&#8208;Microporous Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Tunable Polarization for Highly&#8208;Selective Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with controlled open coplanar carboxyl oxygen atoms within the pores have been constructed through an adaptable binary solvent synthetic strategy. Activated HOFs with enhanced surface polarization show highly selective adsorption of CO2 over N2 based on differences of molecule polarizability.







Abstract
A binary solvent synthetic strategy is proposed for the construction of C2&#8208;symmetric molecule&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with permanent ultra&#8208;micropores and surface polarization derived from tunable coplanar open oxygen atoms. The activated HOFs BTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a and PTBA&#8208;1&#8201;a show highly selective separation of CO2/N2 with a record high ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) selectivity &gt;2000 under ambient temperature and pressure.

Crown ether&#8208;functionalized 3D COFs can efficiently gate ion transport with an excellent gating ratio up to 23.6 are reported, which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far.







Abstract
The development of bioinspired nano/subnano&#8208;sized (&lt;2&#8197;nm) ion channels is still considered a great challenge due to the difficulty in precisely controlling pore's internal structure and chemistry. Herein, for the first time, we report that three&#8208;dimensional functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can act as an effective nanofluidic platform for intelligent modulation of the ion transport. By strategic attachment of 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4 groups to the monomers as ion&#8208;driver door locks, we demonstrate that gating effects of functionalized COFs can be activated by lithium ions. The obtained materials exhibit an outstanding selective ion transmission performance with a high gating ratio (up to 23.6 for JUC&#8208;590), which is among the highest values in metal ion&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state nanochannels reported so far. Furthermore, JUC&#8208;590 offers high tunability, selectivity, and recyclability of ion transport proved by the experimental and simulated studies.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Triptycene&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks with hea Net for Hydrogen Adsorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>

3D COFs with a non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, are designed and successfully synthesized for the first time. Remarkably, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic polymers reported so far.







Abstract
Owing to the finite building blocks and difficulty in structural identification, it remains a tremendous challenge to elaborately design and synthesize three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) with predetermined topologies. Herein, we report the first two cases of 3D COFs with the non&#8208;interpenetrated hea net, termed JUC&#8208;596 and JUC&#8208;597, by using the combination of tetrahedral and triangular prism building units. Due to the presence of triptycene functional groups and fluorine atoms, JUC&#8208;596 exhibits an exceptional performance in the H2 adsorption up to 305&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 (or 2.72&#8197;wt%) at 77&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar, which is higher than previous benchmarks from porous organic materials reported so far. Furthermore, the strong interaction between H2 and COF materials is verified through the DFT theoretical calculations. This work represents a captivating example of rational design of functional COFs based on a reticular chemistry guide and demonstrates its promising application in clean energy storage.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Tamsulosin Utilizing Sequential Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a multistep continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, three C&#8722;N bond formation/cleavage reactions with hydrogen gas over heterogeneous catalysts enabled the efficient construction of the key skeleton. Two different polysilane&#8208;modified Pd catalysts were developed for these transformations, which were followed by a deprotection step under homogeneous catalysis to provide tamsulosin in 60&#8201;% overall yield in a flow stream.







Abstract
We describe the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of (R)&#8208;tamsulosin, a blockbuster therapeutic drug employed for dysuria associated with urinary stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia, by utilizing sequential heterogeneous catalysis. Two heterogeneous catalysts have been developed for the synthesis, and the key step involves reductive amination of nitriles using dimethylpolysilane&#8208;modified Pd on activated carbon/calcium phosphate. Overall, (R)&#8208;tamsulosin was obtained in 60&#8201;% yield and 64&#8201;% ee (99&#8201;% ee after recrystallization) in a flow stream through four catalytic transformations without the need for the isolation or purification of any intermediates or byproduct.

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control over Multicolor Molecular Emission by Temporal Chemical Locking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor molecular emission is controlled in a dynamic timing manner by introducing a temporal chemical lock. The temporal life&#8208;time of the systems can be encoded by molecularly engineering the structural information.







Abstract
Dynamic control over molecular emission, especially in a time&#8208;dependent manner, holds great promise for the development of smart luminescent materials. Here we report a series of dynamic multicolor fluorescent systems based on the time&#8208;encoded locking and unlocking of individual vibrational emissive units. The intramolecular cyclization reaction driven by adding chemical fuel acts as a chemical lock to decrease the conformational freedom of the emissive units, thus varying the fluorescence wavelength, while the resulting chemically locked state can be automatically unlocked by the hydrolysis reaction with water molecules. The dynamic molecular system can be driven by adding chemical fuels for multiple times. The emission wavelength and lifetime of the locking states can be readily controlled by elaborating the molecular structures, indicating this strategy as a robust and versatile way to modulate multi&#8208;color molecular emission in a time&#8208;encoded manner.

         <title>Genetic Encoding of Cyanopyridylalanine for In&#8208;Cell Protein Macrocyclization by the Nitrile&#8211;Aminothiol Click Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetic encoded cyanopyridylalanines are presented as convenient and highly selective reactive groups for in vivo functionalization, cyclization and stapling of polypeptides. The non&#8208;toxic compounds can be genetically incorporated into proteins with high yields and their biocompatible reaction with amino&#8208;thiol moieties proceeds under physiological conditions to near completion without requiring a catalyst.







Abstract
Cyanopyridylalanines are non&#8208;canonical amino acids that react with aminothiol compounds under physiological conditions in a biocompatible manner without requiring added catalyst. Here we present newly developed aminoacyl&#8208;tRNA synthetases for genetic encoding of meta&#8208; and para&#8208;cyanopyridylalanine to enable the site&#8208;specific attachment of a wide range of different functionalities. The outstanding utility of the cyanopyridine moiety is demonstrated by examples of i) post&#8208;translational functionalization of proteins, ii)&#8197;in&#8208;cell macrocyclization of peptides and proteins, and iii)&#8197;protein stapling. The biocompatible nature of the protein ligation chemistry enabled by the cyanopyridylalanine amino acid opens a new path to specific in vivo protein modifications in complex biological environments.

A palladium&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes was developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. A stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement was achieved to afford diverse indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.







Abstract
Dearomatized indole derivatives bearing a C3&#8208; or C2&#8208;stereocenter exist ubiquitously in natural products and biologically active molecules. Despite remarkable advances in their synthesis, stereoselective and regio&#8208;divergent methods are still in a high demand. Herein, a Pd&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular asymmetric spiroannulation of 2,3&#8208;disubstituted indoles with internal alkynes has been developed for the efficient construction of indoline structures with a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter. Stereospecific aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement of these indoline derivatives under acidic conditions afforded indolenine products bearing a C3&#8208;quaternary stereocenter, where the migrating group could be controlled by the reaction sequence. The asymmetric spiroannulation together with the subsequent aza&#8208;semipinacol rearrangement enabled a divergent access to dearomatized indole derivatives with either a C3&#8208; or a C2&#8208;quaternary stereocenter.

         <title>A Facile and Unprecedented Route to a Library of Thermostable Formaldehyde&#8208;Derived Polyesters: Highly Active and Selective Copolymerization of Cyclic Acetals and Anhydrides</title>

This work discloses the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 cyclic anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters that can flow at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The development of new strategies for producing polyesters can expand the category of biodegradable materials. Here, we disclose the alternating copolymerization of cyclic acetals (made from formaldehyde and diols) and anhydrides for the first time, using 5 cyclic acetals and 9 anhydrides to afford 45 unprecedented polyesters. At a wide range of reaction temperatures (25 to 140&#8201;&#176;C), diverse metal&#8208;free Lewis/Br&#248;nsted acids are highly active catalysts for these copolymerizations via the cationic mechanism. Of interest, kinetic studies indicate that the copolymerization of cyclic acetals and anhydrides shifts the chemical equilibrium of &#8220;cyclic acetals &#8652; polyacetals&#8221; to the left, thus yielding polyesters with up to &gt;99&#8201;% alternating degree. The obtained polyesters possess high oxygen content ([O]&#8201;:&#8201;[C] up to 6&#8201;:&#8201;7), molecular weights of 2.0&#8211;33.3&#8197;kDa, narrow polydispersities of 1.2&#8211;1.5, low glass transition temperatures (&#8722;64 to &#8722;27&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high decomposition temperatures (275 to 324&#8201;&#176;C).

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Pore&#8208;Space Partition and Charge Distribution in Multi&#8208;Modular Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge shifting via pore partition: A nine&#8208;nitrogen ligand simultaneously enables pore&#8208;space partition (via three N's) and charge reallocation (via six N's), thereby paving the way for multi&#8208;modular assembly of a huge family of tunable anionic porous materials with much enhanced chemical stability and selective gas and vapor sorption.







Abstract
We report here a strategy for making anionic pacs type porous materials by combining pore space partition with charge reallocation. The method uses the first negatively charged pore partition ligand (2,5,8&#8208;tri&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4,6,7,9&#8208;hexaazaphenalene, H&#8208;tph) that simultaneously enables pore partition and charge reallocation. Over two dozen anionic pacs materials have been made to demonstrate their excellent chemical stability and a high degree of tunability. Notably, Ni3&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph (bdt=1,4&#8208;benzeneditetrazolate) exhibits month&#8208;long water stability, while CoV&#8208;bdt&#8208;tph sets a new benchmark for C2H2 storage capacity under ambient conditions for ionic MOFs. In addition to tunable in&#8208;framework modules, we show feasibility to tune the type and concentration of extra&#8208;framework counter cations and their influence on both stability and capability to separate industrial C3H8/C3H6 and C6H6/C6H12 mixtures.

         <title>Preparation of Primary and Secondary Dialkylmagnesiums by a Radical I/Mg&#8208;Exchange Reaction Using sBu2Mg in Toluene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary and secondary dialkylmagnesium reagents were prepared in toluene by the reaction of sBu2Mg with alkyl iodides (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8211;4&#8197;h). Stereoconvergent I/Mg&#8208;exchanges were observed for secondary cyclohexyl iodides leading after quenching reactions to products with high enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity, including homo&#8208;aldol products. Mechanistic studies confirmed radical pathways for these exchanges.







Abstract
The treatment of primary or secondary alkyl iodides with sBu2Mg in toluene (25&#8211;40&#8201;&#176;C, 2&#8211;4&#8197;h) provided dialkylmagnesiums that underwent various reactions with aldehydes, ketones, acid chlorides or allylic bromides. 3&#8208;Substituted secondary cyclohexyl iodides led to all&#8208;cis&#8208;3&#8208;cyclohexylmagnesium reagents under these exchange conditions in a highly stereoconvergent manner. Enantiomerically enriched 3&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;substituted secondary alkyl iodides gave after an exchange reaction with sBu2Mg stereodefined dialkylmagnesiums that after quenching with various electrophiles furnished various 1,3&#8208;stereodefined products including homo&#8208;aldol products (99&#8201;% dr and 98&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies confirmed a radical pathway for these new iodine/magnesium&#8208;exchange reactions.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Tail&#8208;to&#8208;Tail Reductive Dimerization of Terminal Alkynes to 2,3&#8208;Dibranched Butadienes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a combination of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid proved successful in favoring the selective highly chemo&#8208; and regioselective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes over the competitive head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimerization pathway. The target reaction, proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate, presents a facile and straightforward approach for accessing 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes.







Abstract
The palladium&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization of terminal alkynes is described for the first time. Aromatic terminal alkynes bearing diverse and sensitive functional groups as well as aliphatic terminal alkynes are efficiently transformed to 2,3&#8208;dibranched butadienes. The key to achieve a selective tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is to control appropriately the acidity of the reaction solution, which is accomplished by a combined use of pivalic acid and para&#8208;toluenesulfonic acid. The tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail reductive dimerization reaction is proposed to proceed via a cationic alkenyl palladium intermediate under acidic conditions.

         <title>Enantioselective Cascade Annulation of &#945;&#8208;Amino&#8208;ynones and Enals Enabled by Gold and Oxidative NHC Relay Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented system of gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis was developed, which enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals to afford pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent level of enantioselectivity. The lactone products could be readily converted to diverse densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields and diastereoselectivity.







Abstract
We report herein an unprecedented gold and oxidative NHC relay catalysis that enables highly enantioselective cascade annulation between readily available &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;ynones with enals. This method utilizes the in situ&#8208;generated pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones as a novel and versatile synthon, which engage with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated acylazolium intermediates generated from enals by oxidative NHC catalysis to produce pyrrole&#8208;fused lactones in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity. Synthetic utility of the lactone products is also demonstrated by facile conversion to densely functionalized pyrroles and pyrrolin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in high yields with excellent stereopurity.

         <title>Polyzwitterionic Hydrogels for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polyzwitterionic hydrogel with efficient atmospheric water harvesting is developed based on anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel could achieve 0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 water vapor sorption within 120&#8197;minutes at 30&#8201;% relative humidity and produce 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. This tactful designed polyzwitterionic hydrogel provides new insight on how to fabricate efficient atmospheric water harvesting materials.







Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is regarded as one of the promising strategies for freshwater production desirable to provide sustainable water for landlocked and arid regions. Hygroscopic materials have attracted widespread attention because of their water harvesting performance. However, the introduction of many inorganic salts often leads to aggregation and leakage issues in practical use. Here, polyzwitterionic hydrogels are developed as an effective AWH material platform. Via anti&#8208;polyelectrolyte effects, the hygroscopic salt coordinated with polymer chains could capture moisture and enhance the swelling property, leading to a strong moisture sorption capacity. The hydrogel shows superior AWH performance (0.62&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 120&#8197;minutes for equilibrium at 30&#8201;% relative humidity) and produces 5.87&#8197;L&#8201;kg&#8722;1 freshwater per day. It is anticipated that the polyzwitterionic hydrogels with unique salt&#8208;responsive properties could provide new insights into the design and synthesis of next&#8208;generation AWH materials.

         <title>A Facile Potential Hold Method for Fostering an Inorganic Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile potential hold process fosters the growth of a more inorganic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) for anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Owing to the various decomposition potentials of the Li&#8208;solvation structures, salt anion&#8208;derived SEI was preferentially established on the current collector while reducing the components from organic solvents.







Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium batteries are regarded as an ultimate form of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, irreversible lithium loss during cycling plays a major role in degrading the overall cell performance in the anode&#8208;free configuration. To alleviate the deterioration, building a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interface on an anode current collector is an indispensable requirement. Here, we present a facile in&#8208;situ electrochemical method of a potential hold during the first charge to guide more salt&#8208;derived (less solvent&#8208;derived) decomposition on the anode interface. We show the distinctive decomposition potential of lithium salts and ether/carbonate solvents, where the Li&#8208;solvation structures with salt contact&#8208;ion&#8208;pairs preferentially decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich and less organic components, leading to enhanced lithium Coulombic efficiency in Li||Cu cells as well as mitigating the capacity fade of Cu||LiFePO4 and Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cells.

         <title>Anchoring Ionic Liquid in Copper Electrocatalyst for Improving CO2 Conversion to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic liquid 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium nitrate (BmimNO3) was anchored into Cu, through which the atomic coordination and electronic properties of Cu can be optimized to facilitate C&#8722;C coupling. This electrocatalyst can reduce CO2 to C2H4 with high selectivity. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H4 reaches 77.3&#8201;% at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE) in KHCO3 aqueous solution using a H&#8208;type cell, much higher than that over pure Cu catalyst (31.2&#8201;%).







Abstract
Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels is appealing for CO2 fixation and energy storage. The Cu&#8208;based catalysts feature unique superiorities, but achieving high ethylene selectivity is still restricted. In this study, we propose the anchoring of an ionic liquid (IL) on a Cu electrocatalyst for improving the electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene. In a water&#8208;based electrolyte and a commonly used H&#8208;type cell, a high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 77.3&#8201;% was achieved at &#8722;1.49&#8197;V (vs. RHE). Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that an IL can modify the electronic structure of a Cu catalyst through its interaction with Cu, making it more conducive to *CO dimerization for ethylene formation.

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of Uranyl&#8208;Imprinted Nanocage for Selective Uranium Recovery from Seawater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 61, Issue 13, March 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adsorbent was fabricated by the in&#8197;situ construction of a uranyl&#8208;imprinted nanostructure in a MOF material. Impressively, the adsorbent shows highly selective uranium extraction ability in natural seawater, which was attributed to the fitting coordination structure for uranyl.







Abstract
An adaptive coordination structure is vital for selective uranium extraction from seawater. By strategy of molecular imprinting, uranyl is introduced into a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) during the synthesis process to guide the in situ construction of proper nanocage structure for targeting uranyl binding. Except for the coordination between uranium with four oxygen from the materials, the axial oxygen of uranyl also forms hydrogen bonds with hydrogen from the phenolic hydroxyl group, which enhances the binding affinity of the material to uranyl. Attributing to the high binding affinity, the adsorbent shows high uranium binding selectivity to uranyl against not only the interfering metal ions, but also the carbonate group that coordinates with uranyl to form [UO2(CO)3]4&#8722; in seawater. In natural seawater, the adsorbent realizes a high uranium adsorption capacity of 7.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1, together with an 18.38 times higher selectivity to vanadium.

&lt;p&gt;An adsorbent was fabricated by the in&#8197;situ construction of a uranyl-imprinted nanostructure in a MOF material. Impressively, the adsorbent shows highly selective uranium extraction ability in natural seawater, which was attributed to the fitting coordination structure for uranyl.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An adaptive coordination structure is vital for selective uranium extraction from seawater. By strategy of molecular imprinting, uranyl is introduced into a multivariate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) during the synthesis process to guide the in situ construction of proper nanocage structure for targeting uranyl binding. Except for the coordination between uranium with four oxygen from the materials, the axial oxygen of uranyl also forms hydrogen bonds with hydrogen from the phenolic hydroxyl group, which enhances the binding affinity of the material to uranyl. Attributing to the high binding affinity, the adsorbent shows high uranium binding selectivity to uranyl against not only the interfering metal ions, but also the carbonate group that coordinates with uranyl to form [UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in seawater. In natural seawater, the adsorbent realizes a high uranium adsorption capacity of 7.35&#8197;mg&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, together with an 18.38 times higher selectivity to vanadium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalised Cofactor Mimics for Interactome Discovery and Beyond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cofactors are required for almost half of all enzyme reactions, but their functions and binding partners are not fully understood even after decades of research. Functionalised cofactor mimics which bind in place of the unmodified cofactor can provide answers, as well as expand the scope of cofactor activity. Through chemical proteomics approaches such as activity&#8208;based protein profiling, the interactome and localisation of the native cofactor in its physiological environment can be unravelled and previously uncharacterised proteins annotated. Furthermore, cofactors which supply functional groups to substrate biomolecules can be hijacked by mimics to site&#8208;specifically label targets and unravel the complex biology of post&#8208;translational protein modification. The diverse activity of cofactors has inspired the design of mimics for use as inhibitors, antibiotic therapeutics and chemo&#8208; and biosensors, and cofactor conjugates have enabled the generation of novel enzymes and artificial DNAzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mesoionic Imines (MIIs): Strong Donors and Versatile Ligands for Transition Metals and Main Group Substrates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and the reactivity of 1,2,3&#8208;triazolin&#8208;5&#8208;imine type mesoionic imines (MIIs). The MIIs are accessible by a base&#8208;mediated cycloaddition between a substituted acetonitrile and an aromatic azide, methylation by established routes and subsequent deprotonation. C=O&#8208;stretching frequencies in MII&#8208;CO2 and Rh(CO)2Cl complexes were used to determine the overall donor strength. The MIIs are stronger donors than the N&#8208;heterocyclic imines (NHIs). MIIs are excellent ligands for main group elements and transition metals in which they display substituent&#8208;induced fluorine&#8208;specific interactions and undergo C&#8208;H activation. DFT calculations gave insights into the frontier orbitals of the MIIs. The calculations predict a relatively small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap compared to other related ligands. MIIs are potentially able to act as both &#960;&#8208;donor and &#960;&#8208;acceptor ligands. This report highlights the potential of MIIs to display exciting properties with a huge potential for future development.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Stable Borepin Radicals and Anions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borepin, a 7&#8208;membered boron&#8208;containing heterocycle, has become an emerging molecular platform for the development of new materials and optoelectronics. While neutral borepins are wellestablished, reduced borepin species have remained elusive. Herein we report the first isolable, crystalline borepin radicals (  2a  ,  2b  ) and anions (  3a  ,  3b  ), which have been synthesized by potassium graphite (KC  8  ) reduction of dibenzo[b,d]borepin in the presence of free cyclic(alkyl)(amino) carbene. Borepin radicals and anions have been characterized by EPR or NMR, elemental analysis, X&#8208;ray crystallography and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the bonding features have been investigated computationally using density functional theory.</dc:description>

         <title>Steering Self&#8208;Assembly of Three&#8208;Dimensional Iptycenes on Au(111) by Tuning Molecule&#8208;Surface Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly of three&#8208;dimensional molecules is scarcely studied on surfaces. Their modes of adsorption can exhibit far greater variability compared to (nearly) planar molecules that adsorb mostly flat on surfaces. This additional degree of freedom can have decisive consequences for the expression of intermolecular binding motifs, hence the formation of supramolecular structures. The determining molecule&#8208;surface interactions can be widely tuned, thereby providing a new powerful lever for crystal engineering in two dimensions. Here, we study the self&#8208;assembly of triptycene derivatives with anthracene blades on Au(111) by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, Near Edge X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure and Density Functional Theory. The impact of molecule&#8208;surface interactions was experimentally tested by comparing pristine with iodine&#8208;passivated Au(111) surfaces. Thereby, we observed a fundamental change of the adsorption mode that triggered self&#8208;assembly of an entirely different structure.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clean air is an indispensable prerequisite for human health. The capture of small toxic molecules requires the development of advanced materials for air filtration. Two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials offer highly accessible surface areas but for real&#8208;world applications their assembly into well&#8208;defined hierarchical mesostructures is essential.

         <title>Synthesis of Fe(III) and Fe(IV) Cyanide Complexes Using Hypervalent Iodine&#160;Reagents as Cyano&#8208;Transfer One&#8208;Electron Oxidants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a new reactivity mode for electrophilic cyano  &#160;  &#160;  l  3  &#8208;iodanes as group transfer one&#8208;electron oxidants to synthesize Fe  III  and Fe  IV  cyanide complexes. The inherent thermal instability of high&#8208;valent Fe  IV  compounds without  pi  &#8208;donor ligands (such as oxido (O  2&#8208;  ), imido (RN  2&#8208;  ) or nitrido (N  3&#8208;  )) makes their isolation and structural characterization a very challenging task. We report the synthesis of an Fe  IV  cyanide complex [(N  3  N&#8217;)FeCN] (  4  ) by two consecutive single electron transfer (SET) processes from Fe  II  precursor [(N  3  N&#8217;)FeLi(THF)] (  1  ) with cyanobenziodoxolone (CBX). The Fe  IV  complex can also be prepared by reaction of [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  ] (  3  ) with CBX. In contrast, the oxidation of Fe  II  with 1&#8208;cyano&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(1H)&#8208;1,2benziodoxole (CDBX) enables the preparation of Fe  III  cyanide complex [(N  3  N&#8217;)Fe  III  (CN)(Li)(THF)  3  ] (  2&#8208;Li  THF  ). Complexes  4  and  2Li  THF  have been structurally characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and their electronic structure has been examined by M&#246;ssbauer, EPR spectroscopy, and computational analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualizing Proteins in Mammalian Cells by 19F NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In&#8208;cell NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to investigate protein behavior in physiologically relevant environments. Although proven valuable for disordered proteins, we show that in commonly used&#160;  1  H&#8208;  15  N HSQC spectra of globular proteins,&#160; interactions with cellular components often broaden resonances beyond detection. This contrasts&#160;  19  F spectra in mammalian cells, in which signals are readily observed. Using several proteins, we demonstrate that surface charges and interaction with cellular binding partners modulate linewidths and resonance frequencies. Importantly, we establish that&#160;  19  Fparamagnetic relaxation enhancements using stable, rigid Ln(III) chelate pendants, attached via non&#8208;reducible thioether bonds, provide an effective means to obtain accurate distances for assessing protein conformations in the cellular milieu.</dc:description>

         <title>Micromechanically&#8208;Powered Rolling Locomotion of Twisted&#8208;Crystal Optical&#8208;Waveguide&#8208;Cavity as a Mobile Light Polarization Rotor</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Micromechanically&#8208;powered optical polarization rotors have immense potential in robotic sensors, optoelectronics and photonics. Here, we demonstrate precise mechanical rolling locomotion of twisted microcrystal optical waveguide on the substrate displaying a linear&#8208;polarization rotation of the output signal. Self&#8208;assembly of (  E  )&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;6&#8208;(((4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)imino)methyl)&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenol produces several naturally twisted microcrystals. The twisted crystals exhibit varying pitch lengths because of strain between several intergrowing, orientationally mismatched nanocrystalline fibres along the [100] direction. The mechanical rolling motion of crystals is due to their twisted morphologies. The crystals are also flexible perpendicular to twisted (001) and (010) planes due to &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Br, N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O and C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. The twisted crystals in their straight and bent geometries self&#8208;guide fluorescence along their long&#8208;twisted body axes with low loss. Depending upon the degree of mechanical rolling locomotion, the crystal waveguide cavity correspondingly rotates the polarization of output optical modes. The presented, first of its kind, mechanically rollable twisted&#8208;crystal with a combination of locomotive and photonic attributes unfolds the new dimension in the field of mechanophotonics.</dc:description>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Redox Looping of a Rhodium/ CexWO3 Photocatalyst for Highly Active and Robust Dry Reforming of Methane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dry reforming of methane (DRM) has provided an effective avenue to convert two greenhouse gases, CH  4  and CO  2  , into syngas. Here, we design a DRM photocatalyst Rh/Ce  x  WO  3  that invokes both photothermal and photoelectric processes, which overcomes the thermodynamic limitation of DRM under conventional conditions. In contrast to plasmonic or UV&#8208;response photocatalysts, our photocatalyst produces a superior light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency (LTCEE) of 4.65% with a moderate light intensity. We propose that a light&#8208;induced Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Metal charge transfer plays a crucial role in the DRM reaction, which induces a redox looping between Ce to W species to lower the activation energy. Quantum mechanical studies reveal that a high oxygen mobility of Ce  x  WO  3  , accompanied with the formation of oxo&#8208;bridge species, results in a substantial elimination of deposited C species during the reaction. Our catalyst design strategy could offer a promising energy&#8208;efficient industrial process for DRM.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Symmetry Breaking of Monoacylated Anhydroerythritols and meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;Diols through Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols and acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols with a cis configuration revealed that four compounds crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. All compounds racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals of 99&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
We developed a chiral symmetry breaking method for monoacylated meso diols. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis of monoacylated 1,4&#8208;anhydroerythritols, meso cyclic diols with a cis configuration, revealed that the O&#8208;(p&#8208;anisoyl) derivative crystallized as a racemic conglomerate of the P212121 crystal system. It was confirmed that the substrate racemized by intramolecular transfer of the acyl group in the presence of a catalytic amount of base. Evaporating the solvent gradually from the solution or Viedma ripening to promote crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization efficiently led to enantiomer crystals. These results provide the first successful example of asymmetric expression and amplification by deracemization of sugar derivatives without an external chemical chiral source. Furthermore, we applied this methodology to acyclic meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols. Three O&#8208;monoacylated substrates were successfully deracemized to 99&#8201;% ee by Viedma ripening. We also developed asymmetric desymmetrization of meso&#8208;1,2&#8208;diols by combining acylation and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>NIRII&#8208;HDs: A Versatile Platform for Developing Activatable NIR&#8208;II Fluorogenic Probes for Reliable In Vivo Analyte Sensing</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of O&#8208;HD&#8208;like dyes (NIRII&#8208;HDs) with bright and stable NIR&#8208;II emission together with proper pKa is reported. By decorating the tunable hydroxyl group, the novel NIR&#8208;II dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 can serve as an effective platform to design various activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for reliable in vivo bioimaging with high contrast.







Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) activatable fluorescent probes can potentially provide a high target&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and deep tissue penetration. However, most of the reported NIR&#8208;II activatable small&#8208;molecule probes exhibit poor versatility owing to the lack of a general and stable optically tunable group. In this study, we designed NIRII&#8208;HDs, a novel dye scaffold optimized for NIR&#8208;II probe development. In particular, dye NIRII&#8208;HD5 showed the best optical properties such as proper pKa value, excellent stability, and high NIR&#8208;II brightness, which can be beneficial for in vivo imaging with high contrast. To demonstrate the applicability of the NIRII&#8208;HD5 dye, we designed three target&#8208;activatable NIR&#8208;II probes for ROS, thiols, and enzymes. Using these novel probes, we not only realized reliable NIR&#8208;II imaging of different diseases in mouse models but also evaluated the redox potential of liver tissue during a liver injury in vivo with high fidelity.

         <title>Environmentally Benign Biosynthesis of Hierarchical MOF/Bacterial Cellulose Composite Sponge for Nerve Agent Protection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosynthesized MOF&#8208;based sponge composite materials feature hierarchical pores and tunable MOF loading. They can be used for efficient nerve agent simulant catalytic hydrolysis and toxic nerve agent capture.







Abstract
The fabrication of MOF polymer composite materials enables the practical applications of MOF&#8208;based technology, in particular for protective suits and masks. However, traditional production methods typically require organic solvent for processing which leads to environmental pollution, low&#8208;loading efficiency, poor accessibility, and loss of functionality due to poor solvent resistance properties. For the first time, we have developed a microbial synthesis strategy to prepare a MOF/bacterial cellulose nanofiber composite sponge. The prepared sponge exhibited a hierarchically porous structure, high MOF loading (up to &#8776;90&#8201;%), good solvent resistance, and high catalytic activity for the liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state hydrolysis of nerve agent simulants. Moreover, the MOF/ bacterial cellulose composite sponge reported here showed a nearly 8&#8208;fold enhancement in the protection against an ultra&#8208;toxic nerve agent (GD) in permeability studies as compared to a commercialized adsorptive carbon cloth. The results shown here present an essential step toward the practical application of MOF&#8208;based protective gear against nerve agents.

         <title>Cystine Knot Peptides with Tuneable Activity and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separate approaches for tuning the activity of cystine knot peptides are reported. Protease inhibitors were designed that had light&#8208;controlled activity and could be switched ON against new targets, or had an affinity tag that allowed inhibitors to be switched OFF. These peptides enabled modulation of target activity with exquisite temporal control.







Abstract
Knottins are topologically complex peptides that are stabilised by a cystine knot and have exceptionally diverse functions, including protease inhibition. However, approaches for tuning their activity in situ are limited. Here, we demonstrate separate approaches for tuning the activity of knottin protease inhibitors using light or streptavidin. We show that the inhibitory activity and selectivity of an engineered knottin can be controlled with light by activating a second mode of action that switches the inhibitor ON against new targets. Guided by a knottin library screen, we also identify a position in the inhibitor's binding loop that permits insertion of a biotin tag without impairing activity. Using streptavidin, biotinylated knottins with nanomolar affinity can be switched OFF in activity assays, and the anticoagulant activity of a factor XIIa inhibitor can be rapidly switched OFF in human plasma. Our findings expand the scope of engineered knottins for precisely controlling protein function.

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides Catalyzed by a Single H&#8208;Bond Donor Organocatalyst</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple prolinamide bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor urea function catalyzes the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction between tryptamines and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantiomeric excesses.







Abstract
The asymmetric Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction (PSR) with aldehydes is well known. However, PSR involving ketones as electrophilic partners is far&#8208;less developed. We report herein the first examples of catalytic enantioselective PSR of tryptamines with &#945;&#8208;ketoamides. A new class of easily accessible prolyl&#8208;urea organocatalysts bearing a single H&#8208;bond donor function catalyzes the title reaction to afford 1,1&#8208;disubstituted tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The kinetic isotope effect using C2&#8208;deuterium&#8208;labelled tryptamine indicates that the rearomatization of the pentahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolinium ion intermediate might be the rate&#8208; and the enantioselectivity&#8208;determining step.

         <title>A Rational Biphasic Tailoring Strategy Enabling High&#8208;Performance Layered Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational biphasic tailoring strategy to prepare layered composite cathodes with the desired phase ratio is proposed. Benefiting from the reversible phase transition within transition metal slabs and the decreased structure strain at the phase boundary of the intergrowth structure during Na extraction and insertion, the Com&#8208;NaNMFT composite material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Layered oxide cathodes usually exhibit high compositional diversity, thus providing controllable electrochemical performance for Na&#8208;ion batteries. These abundant components lead to complicated structural chemistry, closely affecting the stacking preference, phase transition and Na+ kinetics. With this perspective, we explore the thermodynamically stable phase diagram of various P2/O3 composites based on a rational biphasic tailoring strategy. Then a specific P2/O3 composite is investigated and compared with its monophasic counterparts. A highly reversible structural evolution of P2/O3&#8211;P2/O3/P3&#8211;P2/P3&#8211;P2/Z/O3&#8242;&#8211;Z/O3&#8242; based on the Ni2+/Ni3.5+, Fe3+/Fe4+ and Mn3.8+/Mn4+ redox couples upon sequential Na extraction/insertion is revealed. The reduced structural strain at the phase boundary alleviates the phase transition and decreases the lattice mismatch during cycling, endowing the biphasic electrode a large reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 with the energy density approaching 514&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Structurally Disordered RuO2 Nanosheets with Rich Oxygen Vacancies for Enhanced Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structural disorder enhanced catalytic performance is demonstrated for carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets. The improved activity is ascribed to the disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies, which can modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus resulting in a low endothermic potential&#8208;determining step (PDS) and a high efficiency.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate pollutants to ammonia has emerged as an attractive alternative for ammonia synthesis. Currently, many strategies have been developed for enhancing nitrate reduction to ammonia (NRA) efficiency, but the influence of the degree of structural disorder is still unexplored. Here, carbon&#8208;supported RuO2 nanosheets with adjustable crystallinity are synthesized by a facile molten salt method. The as&#8208;synthesized amorphous RuO2 displays high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (97.46&#8201;%) and selectivity (96.42&#8201;%), greatly outperforming the crystalline counterparts. The disordered structure with abundant oxygen vacancies is revealed to modulate the d&#8208;band center and hydrogen affinity, thus lowering the energy of the potential&#8208;determining step (NH2*&#8594;NH3*).

         <title>Insights into Dynamic Surface Bromide Sites in Bi4O5Br2 for Sustainable N2 Photofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic N2 reduction on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 nanosheets reveals a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of the catalyst surface. Creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle.







Abstract
Simulating photosynthesis has long been one of the ideas for realizing the conversion of solar energy into industrial chemicals. Heterogeneous N2 photofixation in water is a promising way for sustainable production of ammonia. However, a mechanistic understanding of the complex aqueous photocatalytic N2 reduction is still lacking. In this study, a light&#8208;dependent surface hydrogenation mechanism and light&#8208;independent protection of catalyst surface for N2 reduction are revealed on ultrathin Bi4O5Br2 (BOB) nanosheets, in which the creation and annihilation of surface bromine vacancies can be controlled via a surface bromine cycle. Our rapid scan in situ FT&#8208;IR spectra verify that photocatalytic N2 reduction proceeds through an associative alternating mechanism on BOB surface with bromine vacancies (BrV&#8208;BOB). This work provides a new strategy to combine light&#8208;dependent facilitated reaction with light&#8208;independent regeneration of catalyst for advancing sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Organoplatinum Compounds as Anion&#8208;Tuneable Uphill Hydroxide Transporters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active and directional hydroxide transport is realized by using PtII organometallic compounds as carriers based on their hydrolysis reaction combined with the different permeability of the neutral form and the charged form PtII aqua species. These compounds can transport hydroxide selectively &#8220;uphill&#8221;, a gradient in a liposomal system producing a transmembrane pH gradient, and tuneable activity is achieved by adding anions through a ligand&#8208;exchange reaction.







Abstract
Active transport of ions uphill, creating a concentration gradient across a cell membrane, is essential for life. It remains a significant challenge to develop synthetic systems that allow active uphill transport. Here, a transport process fuelled by organometallic compounds is reported that creates a pH gradient. The hydrolysis reaction of PtII complexes results in the formation of aqua complexes that established rapid transmembrane movement (&#8220;flip&#8208;flop&#8221;) of neutral Pt&#8722;OH species, leading to protonation of the OH group in the inner leaflet, generating OH&#8722; ions, and so increasing the pH in the intravesicular solution. The organoplatinum complex effectively transports bound hydroxide ions across the membrane in a neutral complex. The initial net flow of the PtII complex into the vesicles generates a positive electric potential that can further drive uphill transport because the electric potential is opposed to the chemical potential of OH&#8722;. The OH&#8722; ions equilibrate with this transmembrane electric potential but cannot remove it due to the relatively low permeability of the charged species. As a result, effective hydroxide transport against its concentration gradient can be achieved, and multiple additions can continuously drive the generation of OH&#8722; against its concentration gradient up to &#916;pH&gt;2. Moreover, the external addition of different anions can control the generation of OH&#8722; depending on their anion binding affinity. When anions displayed very high binding affinities towards PtII compounds, such as halides, the external anions could dissipate the pH gradient. In contrast, a further pH increase was observed for weak binding anions, such as sulfate, due to the increase of positive electric potential.

         <title>Superhydrophilic 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks as Broadband Absorbers for Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>

A 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthr&#8208;acene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) with both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions is developed for solar steam generation (SSG) and delivers an excellent water evaporation up to 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 with a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation.







Abstract
The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene&#8208;9,10&#8208;dione (TPAD)&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) (TPAD&#8208;COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD&#8208;COF serving as a highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under 1 sun irradiation. Further extension of the light absorption range of the TPAD&#8208;based COF is realized through post&#8208;synthetic modification by chelating BF2 moieties.

&lt;p&gt;A 1,4,5,8-tetrakis(phenylamino)anthr-acene-9,10-dione (TPAD)-based covalent organic framework (COF) with both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions is developed for solar steam generation (SSG) and delivers an excellent water evaporation up to 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under one sun irradiation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic hydrophobicity and limited light absorption especially in the near-infrared (NIR) region of porous organic polymers are two bottlenecks impeding their applications in solar steam generation (SSG). Herein, we develop a 1,4,5,8-tetrakis(phenylamino)anthracene-9,10-dione (TPAD)-based covalent organic framework (COF) (TPAD-COF) featuring both superhydrophilicity and broad light absorption covering from the entire UV/Vis to NIR regions for SSG. TPAD-COF serving as a highly efficient photothermal conversion material without any additives displays an excellent water evaporation of 1.42&#8197;kg&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and achieves a high energy conversion efficiency of 94&#8201;% under 1 sun irradiation. Further extension of the light absorption range of the TPAD-based COF is realized through post-synthetic modification by chelating BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moieties. Systematic control experiments and analysis confirm that the hydrophilicity of photothermal conversion materials plays a more dominant role in the current TPAD-based COFs for SSG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Intramolecular Hydroalkoxylation of 2&#8208;Vinylbenzyl Alcohols&#160;with Chiral Boro&#8208;Phosphates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric intramolecular hydroalkoxylation of alkenes represents a very important approach to access optically active cyclic ethers. It was found that B(C  6  F  5  )  3  could catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;vinylbenzyl alcohols with only 0.05 mol % catalyst loading, affording the desired product in high yields. To accomplish the asymmetric reaction, a novel type of chiral boro&#8208;phosphates was developed by treating chiral phosphoric acid with Piers&#8217; borane, in which the oxygen atom of P=O and the boron atom act as Lewis base and acid centers, respectively.

         <title>Generation and release of OH radicals from the reaction of H2O with O2 over soot</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>OH radicals in the air maintain the oxidizing power of the troposphere. A conventional view is that particulate matter (PM) in the atmosphere is a major sink of OH radicals, thereby lowering the oxidizing power of atmosphere in the event of high&#8208;level PM. By contrary, our joint experimental/theoretical study reveals a new mechanism for the generation of gaseous OH radicals by carbonaceous soot particles. We show that water and O  2  react on carbonaceous surfaces and give rise to gaseous OH radicals under irradiation. With ample delocalized &#960; electrons, carbonaceous surfaces enable the easy desorption of hydroxyl groups to produce gaseous OH radicals, evidenced by direct observation of the steady generation of OH radicals on a carbonaceous surface. Our results reveal a new chemical mechanism for the production of OH radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Serviced&#8208;Track 3D DNA Walker for Ultrasensitive Detection of Tumor Exosomes by Glycoprotein Profiling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting target exosomes (Exos) as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track: A self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free and highly sensitive detection of tumor Exos is constructed using split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous walking powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly. This STDW allows the direct detection of tumor Exos in serum and clinical samples.







Abstract
Sensitive and accurate analysis of low&#8208;concentration of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (Exos) in biofluids is essential for noninvasive cancer diagnosis but is still challenging due to the lack of high&#8208;sensitive methods with low&#8208;cost and easy&#8208;operation. Herein, exploiting target Exos as a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) track for the first time, we developed a self&#8208;serviced&#8208;track DNA walker (STDW) for wash&#8208;free detection of tumor Exos using exosomal glycoprotein, which was enabled by split aptamer&#8208;recognition&#8208;initiated autonomous running powered by a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). Benefiting from high selectivity and sensitivity of the STDW assay, direct detection of tumor Exos in cell culture medium and serum could also be realized. Furthermore, this method exhibited high accuracy in clinical sample analysis, offering the potential for early cancer diagnosis and postoperative response prediction.

         <title>Mediating Oxidation of Thioethers with Iodine &#8208; A Mild and Versatile Pathway to Trigger the Formation of Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of redox&#8208;triggerable peptide hydrogels poses fundamental challenges, since the highly specific peptide architectures required inevitably limit the versatility of such materials. A powerful, yet rarely applied approach to bypass those barriers is the application of a mediating redox reaction to gradually decrease the pH during hydrogel formation. We report a versatile strategy to trigger the formation of peptide hydrogels from readily accessible acid&#8208;triggerable gelators by generating protons by oxidation of thioethers with triiodide. Adding thiodiglycol as a readily available thioether auxiliary to the basic precursor solution of a peptide gelator efficiently yielded hydrogels after mixing with triiodide, as studied in detail for Nap&#8208;FF and demonstrated for other peptides. Furthermore, incorporation of the thioether moiety in the gelator backbone via the amino acid methionine as shown for the tailormade Nap&#8208;FMDM peptide provides a useful modulation option reducing the number of additives.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Elasticity of Nanogels Improves their Circulation Time by Evading Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is used to treat solid tumors by locally delivering radiation. However, due to nephro&#8208; and hepato&#8208;toxicity, it is limited by its dosage. To amplify radiation damage to tumor cells, radiolabeled nanogels can be used. We show that by tuning the mechanical properties of nanogels significant enhancement in circulation half&#8208;life of the gel could be achieved. We demonstrate why and how small changes in the mechanical properties of the nanogels influence its cellular fate. Nanogels with a storage modulus of 37 kPa were minimally phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages compared to nanogels with 93 kPa modulus. Using PET/CT a significant difference in the blood circulation time of the nanogels was shown. Computer simulations affirmed the results and predicted the mechanism of cellular uptake of the nanogels. Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano&#8208; or microgels.</dc:description>

Altogether, this work emphasizes the important role of elasticity even for particles that are inherently soft such as nano- or microgels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrazone and Oxime Olefination via Ruthenium Alkylidenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the development of an efficient method for the olefination of hydrazones and oximes. The key design approach that enables this transformation is tuning of the energy/polarity of C=N &#960;&#8208;bonds by employing electron withdrawing groups (NR  2  , OR). The resulting hydrazones or oximes facilitate olefination with ruthenium alkylidenes. Through this approach, we show that air&#8208;stable, commercially available ruthenium alkylidenes provide access to functionalized alkenes (20 examples) in ring&#8208;closing reactions with yields up to 88%.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the design and synthesis of a p&#8209;conjugated telluro[3,2&#8208;  b  ][1]&#8208;tellurophene&#8208;based synthon that, embodying pyridyl and haloaryl chalcogen&#8208;bonding acceptors, self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons through chalcogen bonds. The ribbons &#960;&#8208;stack in a multi&#8208;layered architecture both in single crystals and thin films. Theoretical studies of the electronic states of chalcogen&#8208;bonded material showed the presence of a local charge density between Te and N atoms. OTFT&#8208;based charge transport measurements showed hole&#8208;transport properties for this material. Its integration as a  p  &#8208;type semiconductor in multi&#8208;layered Cu(I)&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) led to a 10&#8208;fold increase in stability (38 h vs 3 h) compared to single&#8209;layered devices. Finally, using reference tellurotellurophene congener bearing a C&#8208;H group instead of the pyridyl N atom, a herringbone solid&#8208;state assembly is formed without charge transport features, resulting in LECs with poor stabilities (&lt; 1 h).</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective&#160;and Diastereoselective Intramolecular (3+2) Cycloadditions of Epoxy and Aziridinyl Enolsilanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy and aziridinyl enolsilanes react as oxyallylic cation equivalents in highly chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective intramolecular (3+2) cycloadditions with a range of dienes and olefins. With acyclic dienes, the (3+2) cycloaddition outcompetes the (4+3) pathway traditionally observed in this kind of system almost exclusively. With both conjugated dienes and isolated olefins, excellent diastereoselectivities are observed, and cycloadducts can be obtained in optically&#8208;enriched forms. Computational studies indicate that the stepwise (3+2) cycloaddition involves an activated epoxy/aziridinyl intermediate and the conformational flexibility of the intermediate determines the preference for (3+2) cycloadduct formation. Further transformations of the (3+2) cycloadducts produce densely functionalized  trans  &#8208;hydrindane scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;Trifluoromethylpyridines Enabled by Umpolung C&#8208;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;fluorine bond activation of the trifluoromethyl group represents an important approach to fluorine&#8208;containing molecules. While selective defluorinative functionalization reactions of CF  3  &#8208;containing substrates have been achieved by invoking difluorocarbocation, difluorocarboradical, or difluoroorganometallic species as the key intermediates, the transformations via fluorocarbanion mechanism only achieved limited success. Furthermore, the enantioselective defluorinative transformation of the CF  3  group remained a formidable challenge. Here we report a defluorinative functionalization reaction of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines involving difluoro(pyrid&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl anion as the key intermediate, which was developed based upon our previous studies on the  N  &#8208;boryl pyridyl anion chemistry. In particular, asymmetric defluoroallylation of 4&#8208;trifluoromethylpyridines and &#8208;pyrimidines could be achieved by using Ir&#8208;catalysis to forge a difluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted chiral center.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Enzyme Activity by the Modulation of Covalent Interactions in the Confined Channels of Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controllable regulations on the enzyme conformation to optimize catalytic performance are highly desired for the immobilized biocatalysts yet remain challenging. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess confined channels with finely tunable pore environment, offering a promising platform for enzyme encapsulation. Herein, we covalently immobilized the cytochrome  c  (Cyt  c  ) in the size&#8208;matched channels of COFs with different contents of anchoring site, and significant enhancement of the stability and activity (~600% relative activity compared with free enzyme) can be realized by optimizing the covalent interactions. Structural analyses on the immobilized Cyt  c  suggest that covalent bonding could induce conformational perturbation resulting in more accessible active sites. The effectiveness of the covalent interaction modulation together with the tailorable confined channels of COFs offers promise to develop high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>More than a Leaving Group: N&#8208;Phenyltrifluoroacetimidate as a Remote Directing Group for Highly &#945;&#8208;Selective 1,2&#8208;cis Glycosylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anomeric configuration can greatly affect the biological functions and activities of carbohydrates. Herein, we report that N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidoyl (PTFAI), a well&#8208;known leaving group for catalytic glycosylation, can act as a stereodirecting group for the challenging 1,2&#8208;cis &#945;&#8208;glycosylation. Utilizing rapidly accessible 1,6&#8208;di&#8208;OPTFAI glycosyl donors, TMSOTf&#8208;catalyzed glycosylation occurred with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity and broad substrate scope, and the remaining 6&#8208;OPTFAI group can be cleaved chemoselectively. The remote participation of 6&#8208;OPTFAI is supported by the first characterization of the crucial 1,6&#8208;bridged bicyclic oxazepinium ion intermediates by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy. These cations were found to be relatively stable and mainly responsible for the present stereoselectivities. Further application is highlighted in glycosylation reactions toward trisaccharide heparins as well as the convergent synthesis of chacotriose derivatives using a bulky 2,4&#8208;di&#8208;O&#8208;glycosylated donor.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional WC&#8208;Supported RuO2 Nanoparticles for Robust Water Splitting in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the strong catalyst&#8208;support interaction in WC&#8208;supported RuO2 nanoparticles (RuO2&#8208;WC NPs) anchored on carbon nanosheets with low loading of Ru (4.11 wt.%), which significantly promotes the oxygen evolution reaction activity with &#951;10 of 347 mV and mass activity of 1430 A gRu&#8208;1, eight&#8208;fold higher than that of commercial RuO2 (176 A gRu&#8208;1). Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst&#8208;support interaction between RuO2 and WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic OWS electrolyzer with good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO2&#8208;WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm&#8208;2. The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combined WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS application.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural insight of MOFs under combined mechanical and adsorption stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>External control over the pore size of flexible metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently emerged as an intriguing concept, with possible applications to gas storage and separation. In this work we present a new pressure cell capable for the first time of monitoring through  in&#8208;situ  X&#8208;ray powder diffraction an adsorbent powder under combined uniaxial applied mechanical stress (up to 1 GPa) and gas pressure (up to 20 bar). The combined stress&#8208;pressure clamp (CSPC) cell was successfully exploited to follow the evolution of the CO  2  breathing behaviour of the prototypical complex breathing MIL&#8208;53(Al) system under mechanical compression obtaining structural evidence that this MOF can be maintained in its closed pore state upon compression, precluding its re&#8208;opening at high gas pressure (&gt;7 bar). This novel setup shows potential for the  in&#8208;operando  exploration of flexible systems, in equilibrium and flow configurations.</dc:description>

         <title>Exovinylene Cyclic Carbonates: Multifaceted CO2&#8208;Based Building Blocks for Modern Chemistry and Polymer Science</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dioxide is a renewable, inexhaustible and cheap alternative to fossil resources for the production of fine chemicals and plastics. This waste can notably be converted into exovinylene cyclic carbonates, unique synthons gaining momentum for preparing an impressive range of important organic molecules and functional polymers following 100% atom economy reactions under mild operating conditions in most cases. This review is summarizing the recent advances made in their synthesis with a particular attention to describe the catalysts needed for their preparation, and discuss the unique reactivity of these CO  2  &#8208;based heterocycles for constructing diverse organic building blocks and (functional) polymers. We also discuss the challenges and the future perspectives in the field.</dc:description>
