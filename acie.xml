      <title>Observing single&#8208;atom catalytic sites during reactions with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry</title>
      <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have become a prominent theme in heterogeneous catalysis, not least because of the potential fundamental insight into active sites. The desired level of understanding, however, is prohibited due to the inhomogeneity of most supported SACs and the lack of suitable tools for structure&#8208;activity correlation studies with atomic resolution. Herein, we describe the potency of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) to study molecularly defined SACs supported on polyoxometalates in catalytic reactions. We were able to identify the exact composition of active sites and their evolution in the catalytic cycle during CO and alcohol oxidation reactions performed in the liquid phase. Critical information on metal&#8208;dependent reaction mechanisms, the key intermediates, the dynamics of active sites and even the stepwise activation barriers were obtained, which would be challenging to gather via prevailingly adopted techniques in SAC research. DFT calculations revealed intricate details of the reaction mechanisms, and strong synergies between ESI&#8208;MS defined SAC sites and electronic structure theory calculations become apparent.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling the Activity Origin of Iron Nitride Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogenation of CO2 to C2+ Hydrocarbons</title>
      <dc:description>Developing efficient catalytic materials and unveiling the active species is significant for selective hydrogenation of CO  2  to C  2+  hydrocarbons. Fe  2  N@C nanoparticles were reported to exhibit outstanding performance toward selective CO  2  hydrogenation to C  2+  hydrocarbons (C  2+  selectivity: 53.96%; C  2  &#8208;C  4  =  selectivity, 31.03%), outperforming corresponding Fe@C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, ex situ  M&#246;ssbauer  and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra revealed that iron nitrides were in situ converted to highly active iron carbides, which acted as the real active species. Moreover, the combined results of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and control experiments suggested an in situ formed carbonyl iron&#8208;mediated conversion mechanism from iron nitrides to iron carbides.</dc:description>

      <title>&#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Encapsulation of Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane Derivatives: A Storable Feedstock for Preparation of [1.1.1]Propellane</title>
      <dc:description>The bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP) scaffold is useful in medicinal chemistry, and many protocols are available for synthesizing BCP derivatives from [1.1.1]propellane. However, little progress has been made in the preparation of [1.1.1]propellane since the first practical synthesis in 1985. Here, we report the &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) encapsulation of BCP derivatives, affording a stable, readily storable material from which BCPs can be easily and quantitatively recovered. We have also developed new and simple protocols for deiodination reaction of 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP to afford [1.1.1]propellane in protic/aprotic/polar/non&#8208;polar solvents. The combination of these methodologies enables simple, on&#8208;demand preparation of [1.1.1]propellane in various solvents under mild conditions from &#945;&#8208;CD capsules containing 1,3&#8208;diiodo BCP.</dc:description>

      <title>Environmental Control of Single&#8208;Molecule Junction Evolution and Conductance. Case Study of Expanded Pyridinium Wiring.</title>
      <dc:description>Environmental control of single molecule junction evolution and conductance was demonstrated for expanded pyridinium molecules by scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction method and interpreted by quantum transport calculations including solvent molecules explicitly. Fully extended and highly conducting molecular junctions prevail in water environment as opposed to short and less conducting junctions formed in non&#8208;solvating mesitylene. Theoretical approach correctly models single molecule conductance values considering the experimental junction length. Most pronounced difference in the molecular junction formation and conductance was identified for a molecule with the highest stabilization energy on the gold substrate confirming the importance of molecule&#8208;electrode interactions. Presented concept of tuning conductance through molecule&#8208;electrode interactions in the solvent&#8208;driven junctions can be used in the development of new molecular electronic devices.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Environmental control of single molecule junction evolution and conductance was demonstrated for expanded pyridinium molecules by scanning tunnelling microscopy break junction method and interpreted by quantum transport calculations including solvent molecules explicitly. Fully extended and highly conducting molecular junctions prevail in water environment as opposed to short and less conducting junctions formed in non&#8208;solvating mesitylene. Theoretical approach correctly models single molecule conductance values considering the experimental junction length. Most pronounced difference in the molecular junction formation and conductance was identified for a molecule with the highest stabilization energy on the gold substrate confirming the importance of molecule&#8208;electrode interactions. Presented concept of tuning conductance through molecule&#8208;electrode interactions in the solvent&#8208;driven junctions can be used in the development of new molecular electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Dimer organization of membrane&#8208;associated NS5A of hepatitis C virus as determined by highly sensitive&#160;1H&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR</title>
      <dc:description>The Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) is a membrane&#8208;associated protein involved in multiple steps of the viral life cycle. Direct&#8208;acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting NS5A are a cornerstone of antiviral therapy, but the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of these drugs is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of information on the membrane&#8208;bound NS5A structure. Here we present the structural model of an NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 protein reconstituted as proteoliposomes. We use highly sensitive proton&#8208;detected solid&#8208;state NMR methods suitable to study samples generated&#160;via&#160;synthetic biology approaches. Spectra analyses disclose that both the AH membrane anchor and the linker are highly flexible. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PRE) reveal that the dimer organization in lipids requires a new type of NS5A self&#8208;interaction not reflected in previous crystal structures. In conclusion, we provide the&#160;first characterization&#160;of NS5A AH&#8208;linker&#8208;D1 in a lipidic environment shedding light onto the mode&#8208;of&#8208;action of clinically used NS5A inhibitors.</dc:description>

      <title>C&#8211;H Activation by an Iron&#8208;Nitrido Bis&#8208;Pocket Porphyrin Species</title>
      <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron&#8208;nitrido species are nitrogen analogues of iron&#8208;oxo species which are versatile reagents for C&#8211;H oxidation. Nonetheless, C&#8211;H activation by iron&#8208;nitrido species has been scarcely explored, as this is often hampered by their instability and short lifetime in solutions. Herein, the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactivity of an Fe porphyrin nitrido species (  2c  ) toward C&#8211;H substrates was studied in solutions at room temperature, which was achieved by nanosecond laser flash photolysis (LFP) of its Fe(III)&#8208;azido precursor (  1c  ) supported by a bulky bis&#8208;pocket porphyrin ligand. C&#8211;H bonds with bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of up to ~84 kcal mol  &#8208;1  could be activated, and the second&#8208;order rate constants (  k  2  ) are on the order of 10  2  &#8211;10  4  s  &#8208;1  M  &#8208;1  . The Fe&#8208;amido product formed after HAT could further release ammonia upon protonation.</dc:description>

      <title>Direct C(sp3)&#8211;H Trifluoromethylation of Unactivated Alkanes Enabled by Multifunctional Trifluoromethyl Copper&#160;Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Despite the extensive development in trifluoromethylation, introduction of a trifluoromethyl group into an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond is significantly challenging. Herein, we report the development of a mild and operationally simple C(sp3)&#8211;H trifluoromethylation method for unactivated alkanes utilizing a bench&#8208;stable Cu(III) complex, bpyCu(CF3)3, as a visible&#8208;light photo&#8208;induced reaction initiator, a trifluoromethyl radical source as a hydrogen atom transfer reagent, and a trifluoromethyl anion source for functionalization. The reaction was initiated by reactive electrophilic carbon&#8208;centered CF3 radical generation from photo&#8208;induced homolytic cleavage of bpyCu(CF3)3, which performs hydrogen abstraction from an unactivated C(sp3)&#8211;H bond. Comprehensive mechanistic investigations based on a combination of experimental and computational methods suggested that C&#8211;CF3 bond formation was enabled by radical&#8208;polar crossover and ionic coupling between the resulting carbocation intermediate and the anionic CF3 source. The newly developed reaction can be applied to various methylene selective trifluoromethylation reactions including direct, late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of natural products and bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

      <title>Improved Asparaginyl Ligase&#8208;catalyzed Transpeptidation via Selective Nucleophile Quenching</title>
      <dc:description>The use of enzymes for the site&#8208;specific modification of proteins/peptides has become a highly accessible, widespread approach to study protein/peptide functions or to generate therapeutic conjugates. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) that preferentially catalyze transpeptidation reactions (AEP ligases) have emerged as enticing alternatives to established approaches, such as bacterial sortases, due to their catalytic efficiency and short tripeptide recognition motifs. However, under standard conditions, a substantial excess of the nucleophile to be conjugated is needed to reach desirable yields. Herein we report a versatile approach to shift the AEP&#8208;catalyzed transpeptidation equilibrium toward product formation via selectively quenching the nucleophilicity of the competing leaving group peptide. Our metal complexation&#8208;based strategy enables efficient peptide/protein labeling at the N&#8208; or C&#8208;terminus with near&#8208;equimolar concentrations of nucleophile label. Furthermore, we show that this approach can enhance protein&#8208;protein ligation and facilitate the formation of transpeptidation products that are otherwise unattainable.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Selective N&#8208;Formylation of Amines with CO2 and H2 Catalyzed by Porous Organometallic Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>The valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to fine chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for CO2  capture and utilization. Herein we demonstrated a series of porous organometallic polymers could be employed as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for this purpose. Synergetic effects of specific surface area, iridium content, and CO2  adsorption capability are crucial to achieve excellent selectivity and yields towards N&#8208;formylation of diverse amines with CO2  and H2  under mild reaction conditions even at 20 ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory calculations revealed not only a redox&#8208;neutral catalytic pathway but also a new plausible mechanism with the incorporation of the key intermediate formic acid via a proton&#8208;relay process. Remarkably, a record turnover number (TON = 1.58 &#215; 106  ) was achieved in the synthesis of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), and the solid catalysts can be reused up to 12 runs, highlighting their practical potential in industry.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2  ) to fine chemicals is one of the most promising approaches for CO2  capture and utilization. Herein we demonstrated a series of porous organometallic polymers could be employed as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for this purpose. Synergetic effects of specific surface area, iridium content, and CO2  adsorption capability are crucial to achieve excellent selectivity and yields towards N&#8208;formylation of diverse amines with CO2  and H2  under mild reaction conditions even at 20 ppm catalyst loading. Density functional theory calculations revealed not only a redox&#8208;neutral catalytic pathway but also a new plausible mechanism with the incorporation of the key intermediate formic acid via a proton&#8208;relay process. Remarkably, a record turnover number (TON = 1.58 &#215; 106  ) was achieved in the synthesis of N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF), and the solid catalysts can be reused up to 12 runs, highlighting their practical potential in industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Natural product (NP) structure is a rich source of inspiration for the discovery of new biologically relevant chemical matter. In natural product inspired pseudo&#8208;NPs, NP&#8208;derived fragments are combined de novo to unprecedented arrangements.

      <title>The Challenge of Peptide Proteolytic Stability Studies: Scarce Data, Difficult Readability, and the Need for Harmonization</title>
      <dc:description>
The assessment of peptide stability is a fundamental component of peptide characterization. Researchers can find numerous methods in the literature to assess stability. However, in general, the results are not comparable, since a given technique possesses certain specificities. Another major fault is the stability report. The lack of harmonization hampers a proper comparison of data, which makes their interpretation more demanding.







Abstract
Proteolytic stability assessment is increasingly viewed as a fundamental component of peptide characterization, arguably of comparable importance as efficacy and toxicity data. A literature survey over the last decade reveals steady growth in the stability information available. However, it also uncovers two significant problems that hinder proper data comparison: 1)&#8197;the use of different stability assays, and 2)&#8197;the differences in how stability information is reported. In this Viewpoint, we present results from a database meta&#8208;analysis as well as concerns about the stability assessments published so far. We also suggest guidelines for a proper discussion between experts in the field on how to improve data readability so that peptide stability, an often&#8208;missing parameter in older literature, is adequately reported to take maximum advantage of it.

      <title>Observation of the Reaction Intermediates of Methanol Dehydrogenation by Cationic Vanadium Clusters</title>
      <dc:description>Detection and characterization of fleeting reaction intermediates and active sites are crucial for molecular&#8208;level knowledge of catalysis; insight that is required to understand the catalytic mechanisms, and to design novel high performance catalysts. We report a mass spectrometric study of the reactions of 3d early transition metal (vanadium, [Ar]3d  3  4s  2  ) cationic clusters with methanol in a low&#8208;pressure collision cell. For comparison, the reaction of methanol with 3d late transition metal (cobalt, [Ar]3d  7  4s  2  ) cationic clusters were studied as well. In the vanadium case, the main reaction products are fully dehydrogenated species, and partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species are observed as minors, for which the relative intensities increase with cluster size and also at low cluster source temperature cooled by liquid nitrogen; while no dehydrogenation products have been observed for cobalt clusters. That demonstrates the strikingly different reactivity of vanadium and cobalt cationic clusters towards methanol. Quantum chemical calculations explored the reaction pathways and revealed that the fully dehydrogenation products of the reaction between V  n  +  and methanol are V  n  (C)(O)  +  , in which C and O are separated due to the high oxophilicity of vanadium. The partial dehydrogenation and non&#8208;dehydrogenation species observed in the experiment are verified to be reaction intermediates along the reaction pathway, and their most probable structures have been proposed.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>There has been a controversy surrounding the roles of the metal core (metal&#8208;metal interaction) and the shell (metal&#8208;ligand interaction) in photoluminescence of ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters.

The inclusion of silver ion has boosted photoluminescent quantum yield by 18 times. The results of photophysical measurements indicated that the rate of nonradiative decay was slower for silver doped platinum sub&#8208;nanocluster. Density functional theory calculations showed that the LUMO, which had the main contribution from Ag  s  &#8208;orbital and Pt  d  &#8208;orbitals, played a critical role in suppressing the structural distortion at the excited state.

      <title>Effective enantioselective recognition by chiral amino&#8208;phosphonium salts</title>
      <dc:description>The research on chiral recognition and selection is not only fundamental in deciding the mystery of homochirality, but also informative in terms of substrate recognition in biological processes and asymmetric catalysis. We report an enantiomeric pair of phosphonium salts having chiral (R and S) amino substituents that are utilized&#160;towards the enantioselective recognition of a variety of chiral compounds having functional groups such as carboxylic acid, amine, and alcohol.

      <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Red Phosphors and Their Core&#8208;Shell Structure for Improved Water&#8208;Resistance for Laser Diodes Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Single crystal luminescence materials usually show higher luminous efficiency and better stability than a powdery one. Poor water resistance of Mn  4+  doped powdery fluoride red phosphors limits their further application for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) with high color rendering index. In this report, we have presented a solvent&#8208;vapor transport route for centimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal red phosphor development. As a side benefit, the epitaxial growth route to yield its core&#8208;shell structure at ambient temperature was adopted. These single&#8208;crystal red phosphors could be applied in all&#8208;inorganic WLED devices without any organic resin. Cs  2  TiF  6  :Mn  4+  (CTFM) single crystal provides a significant enhancement of quantum efficiency, moisture resistance, and thermal stability as compared to its polycrystalline powders. Particularly, the internal quantum efficiency can reach as high as 98.7%. To further improve waterproof stability, the Cs  2  TiF  6  (CTF) shell with tunable thickness has been epitaxially grown on the CTFM single crystal surface and a unique three&#8208;step photoluminescence intensity evolution mechanism has been proposed. By combining as&#8208;prepared CTFM@CTF core&#8208;shell structured single crystal, YAG:Ce single crystal and blue&#8208;chip, warm WLEDs with excellent color rendition (R  a  = 90, R  9  = 94), low correlated color temperature (CCT = 3155 K), and high luminous efficacy have been fabricated without any organic resins. Furthermore, CTFM@CTF and YAG:Ce single crystals based high&#8208;power laser&#8208;driven white&#8208;lighting devices (LDs) with high brightness and excellent directionality have also been successfully obtained.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single crystal luminescence materials usually show higher luminous efficiency and better stability than a powdery one. Poor water resistance of Mn  4+  doped powdery fluoride red phosphors limits their further application for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) with high color rendering index. In this report, we have presented a solvent&#8208;vapor transport route for centimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal red phosphor development. As a side benefit, the epitaxial growth route to yield its core&#8208;shell structure at ambient temperature was adopted. These single&#8208;crystal red phosphors could be applied in all&#8208;inorganic WLED devices without any organic resin. Cs  2  TiF  6  :Mn  4+  (CTFM) single crystal provides a significant enhancement of quantum efficiency, moisture resistance, and thermal stability as compared to its polycrystalline powders. Particularly, the internal quantum efficiency can reach as high as 98.7%. To further improve waterproof stability, the Cs  2  TiF  6  (CTF) shell with tunable thickness has been epitaxially grown on the CTFM single crystal surface and a unique three&#8208;step photoluminescence intensity evolution mechanism has been proposed. By combining as&#8208;prepared CTFM@CTF core&#8208;shell structured single crystal, YAG:Ce single crystal and blue&#8208;chip, warm WLEDs with excellent color rendition (R  a  = 90, R  9  = 94), low correlated color temperature (CCT = 3155 K), and high luminous efficacy have been fabricated without any organic resins. Furthermore, CTFM@CTF and YAG:Ce single crystals based high&#8208;power laser&#8208;driven white&#8208;lighting devices (LDs) with high brightness and excellent directionality have also been successfully obtained.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Kinetic Barriers and Microscopic Mechanisms of Noble Gas Adsorption by Nanoporous &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2 Obtained by means of Sub&#8208;Second X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>Gas adsorption by porous frameworks sometimes result in structure &#8220;breathing&#8221;, &#8220;pores opening/closing&#8221;, &#8220;negative gas adsorption&#8221;, and other fascinating phenomena   which can be revealed and explained with the use of  in situ  diffraction methods. The time&#8208;dependent diffraction is able to address both kinetics of the guest uptake and structural response of the host framework, since the time evolution of the crystal structure bears the information on the mechanisms and kinetic barriers of guest adsorption.  Using such advanced sub&#8208;second  in situ  powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, three various intracrystalline diffusion scenarios have been evaluated from the isothermal kinetics of Ar, Kr, and Xe adsorption by nanoporous &#947;&#8209;Mg(BH4)2. These scenarios are dictated by  two possible simultaneous transport mechanisms: diffusion through the intra&#8208; (i) and interchannel apertures (ii) of  &#947;&#8208;Mg(BH4)2  crystal structure. The contribution of i and ii changes depending on the kinetic diameter of the noble gas molecule and temperature regime.  The lowest single activation barrier for the smallest Ar suggests equal diffusion of the atoms trough both pathways. Contrary, for the medium sized Kr we resolve the contributions of two parallel transport mechanisms, which tentatively can be attributed to the smaller  barrier of the migration paths  via  the channel like pores and the higher barrier for the diffusion  via  &#160; narrow aperture between these channels. Remarkably, the largest Xe atoms diffuse only along 1D channels and show the highest single activation barrier. This work demonstrates a potential of sub&#8208;second diffraction to access site&#8208;specific kinetics of guest uptake in multi&#8208;adsorption site frameworks.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic Activation of Adsorped Intermediates via Axial Traction for the Promoted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (e.g., M&#8208;N4) to accelerate overall reaction dynamics of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of M&#8208;N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C). The Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100% at &#8208;0.9 V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90% in a wide range of potential window from &#8208;0.5 to &#8208;1.1 V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O active moiety composed of a Ni&#8208;N4 site with an additional oxygen ligand that induces an axial traction effect. The unique structure was evidenced by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the introduction of axial oxygen atom could optimize surface states of Ni&#8208;N4 moieties and enhance the charge polarization effect, therefore decreasing the potential barrier of intermediate COOH* formation, a key factor to accelerate the reaction kinetics and boost the CO2RR performance.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regulating the local environment and structure of metal center coordinated by nitrogen ligands (e.g., M&#8208;N4) to accelerate overall reaction dynamics of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted extensive attention. Herein, we develop an axial traction strategy to optimize the electronic structure of M&#8208;N4 moiety and construct atomically dispersed nickel sites coordinated with four nitrogen atoms and one axial oxygen atom, which are embedded within the carbon matrix (Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C). The Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O/C electrocatalyst exhibited excellent CO2RR performance with a maximum CO Faradic efficiency (FE) close to 100% at &#8208;0.9 V. The CO FE could be maintained above 90% in a wide range of potential window from &#8208;0.5 to &#8208;1.1 V. The superior CO2RR activity is due to the Ni&#8208;N4&#8208;O active moiety composed of a Ni&#8208;N4 site with an additional oxygen ligand that induces an axial traction effect. The unique structure was evidenced by aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the introduction of axial oxygen atom could optimize surface states of Ni&#8208;N4 moieties and enhance the charge polarization effect, therefore decreasing the potential barrier of intermediate COOH* formation, a key factor to accelerate the reaction kinetics and boost the CO2RR performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Selective three&#8208;component 1,2&#8208;diamination of 1,3&#8208;dienes with concurrent introduction of two orthogonally protected amino groups remains unknown in spite of its significant synthetic potential.

Mechanistic studies indicate that the facile isomerization of allyl thiocyanates to allyl isothiocyanates under photocatalytic conditions is responsible for the selective formation of the observed products.

However, a comprehensive understanding on the intrinsic driving force of electron&#8208;donating effect is lacking, let alone the precise manipulation of electron donation processes.

The energy was also transferred to O2 and elevated the potential energy surface (PES) of MOA, which was reflected by the enhanced formation of superoxide oxygen anions. As predicted, the Ea of MOA decreased by 45.3% and exhibited a substantial light dependence, demonstrating that MOA became energy&#8208;efficient due to improved exploitation and conversion of photon energies.</dc:description>

      <title>Radical Fluorosulfonylation: Accessing Alkenyl Sulfonyl Fluorides from Alkenes</title>
      <dc:description>Sulfonyl fluorides have widespread applications in many fields. In particular, their unique biological activity has drawn considerable research interest in the context of chemical biology and drug discovery in the past years. Therefore, new and efficient methods for the synthesis of sulfonyl fluorides is highly in demand. In contrast to extensive studies on FSO2+ type reagents, a radical fluorosulfonylation reaction with fluorosulfonyl radical (FSO2  &#8226;) remains elusive so far, probably due to its instability and difficulty in generation. Here, we report the development of the first radical fluorosulfonylation of alkenes based on FSO2  radicals generated under photoredox conditions. This radical approach provides a new and general access to alkenyl sulfonyl fluorides, including structures that would otherwise be challenging to synthesize with previously established cross coupling methods. Moreover, further extention to the late&#8208;stage fluorosulfonylation of natural products is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2: Towards Stable Cycling at 4.6 V</title>
      <dc:description>LiCoO2, the first choice cathode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in 3C products due to its high volumetric energy density, typically only delivers a capacity of ~175&#8201;mAh/g although its theoretical specific capacity is as high as 274&#8201;mAh/g. The challenge is that cationic/anodic&#8208;redox&#8208;induced unstable phase transition, oxygen escape, and side reactions with electrolytes always occur when charging LiCoO2  to voltages higher than 4.35&#8201;V for delivering a higher capacity, which result in severe capacity fade. Herein, we demonstrate a Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  that can be cycled steadily at 4.6 V. Dopant Mg ions, serving as &#8220;pillar&#8221;in the Li&#8208;slab of LiCoO2, prevent slab sliding at highly delithiated state, thereby suppressing unfavorable phase transitions. Moreover, the resulted Li&#8208;Mg mixing phase at the surface of Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  is beneficial for eliminating the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase overgrown and phase transformation in the close&#8208;to&#8208;surface region. Consequently, Mg&#8208;pillared LiCoO2  exhibits a high capacity of 204 mAh/g at 0.2 C and a remarkably enhanced capacity retention of 84% at 1.0 C over 100 cycles within the voltage window of 3.0&#8208;4.6 V. In sharp contrast, pristine LiCoO2&#160; gives a much lower capacity retention of 14% within the same voltage window.</dc:description>

Title: A Supramolecular Bait to Trigger Non&#8208;equilibrium Co&#8208;assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
      <dc:description>In the living systems, the non&#8208;equilibrium states that control the assembly&#8208;disassembly of cellular components underlie the gradual complexification of life, whereas in the nonliving systems, most molecules follow the laws of thermodynamic equilibrium to sustain dynamic consistency. However, very little is known about the roles of non&#8208;equilibrium states of interactions between supramolecules in living systems. Here, we identified a non&#8208;equilibrium state of interaction between supramolecular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and A&#946;42, an aggregate&#8208;prone protein that causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structurally, the polymerized propagation of A&#946;42 presents a specific groove that is recognized by the amphiphilicity of LPS bait in a non&#8208;equilibrium manner. Functionally, the transient complex elicits a cellular response to clear extracellular A&#946;42 deposits via an endolysosomal mechanism in neuronal cells. Since the impaired clearance of toxic A&#946;42 deposits correlates with AD pathology, the non&#8208;equilibrium interaction between LPS and A&#946;42 could represent a useful target for the development of AD therapeutics.</dc:description>

      <title>Bio&#8208;Coreactant&#8208;Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence Microscopy of Intracellular Structure and Transport</title>
      <dc:description>A bio&#8208;coreactant&#8208;enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) microscopy realizes the ECL imaging of intracellular structure and dynamic transport.

      <title>Reshaping the Cathodic Catalyst Layer for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: from Heterogeneous Catalysis to Homogeneous Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>In anion exchange membrane fuel cells, catalytic reactions occur at a well&#8208;defined three&#8208;phase interface, wherein conventional heterogeneous catalyst layer structures exacerbate problems such as low catalyst utilization and limited mass transfer. We developed a structural engineering strategy to immobilize a molecular catalyst tetrakis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)porphyrin cobalt(II) (TMPPCo) on the side chains of an ionomer (polyfluorene, PF) to obtain a composite material (PF&#8208;TMPPCo), thereby achieving a homogeneous catalysis environment inside ion flow channels, with greatly improved mass transfer and turnover frequency due to 100% utilization of the catalyst molecules. The unique brand&#8208;new structure of the homogeneous catalysis system comprising interconnected nanoreactors exhibits advantages of low overpotential and high fuel cell power density. This strategy of reshaping of the catalyst layer structure may serve as a new platform for applications of many molecular catalysts in fuel cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Selection and Characterization of an RNA&#8208;cleaving DNAzyme Specifically Activated by Legionella pneumophila</title>
      <dc:description>Legionella pneumophila  is a deadly bacterial pathogen that has caused numerous Legionnaires&#8217; disease outbreaks, where cooling towers were the most common source of exposure. Bacterial culturing is used for  L. pneumophila  detection, but this method takes approximately 10 days to complete. In this work, we isolated an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme, named LP1. Extensive characterization revealed that LP1 is reactive with multiple infectious isolates of  L. pneumophila  but inactive with 25 other common bacterial species. It is likely activated by a protein target, is capable of generating a detectable signal in the presence of as few as 10 colony forming units of  L. pneumophila  , and is able to maintain its activity in cooling tower water from diverse sources. Given that similar DNAzymes have been incorporated into many sensitive assays for bacterial detection, LP1 holds the potential for the development of biosensors for monitoring the contamination of  L. pneumophila  in exposure sources.</dc:description>

Above this value their intensity is pH dependent and can be used to report on the occurring pH changes.

      <title>Induction of chirality in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) built from achiral precursors</title>
      <dc:description>Induction of chirality from achiral assembly system remains a huge challenge related to the origin of life and rational design of chiral materials. Here, both origin and control of chirality in a MOF built from achiral precursors have been realized. Assembling achiral H  3  BTB ligands and Zn(II)/Cd(II) clusters leads to a 2D coordination polymer (  FJI&#8208;H16  ), while introduction of achiral pyridine into such assembly system leads to a 3D chiral MOF (  FJI&#8208;H27  (  M  ) or (  P  )). The driven force for chiral origin of  FJI&#8208;H27  has been proved to be a pyridine participated kinetic&#8208;control assembly process, which can be controlled by changing the amount of pyridine and temperature, from no induction to partial induction to complete induction. The chiral generation and amplification process has been identified in detail through a pyridine&#8208;involved key intermediate (  FJI&#8208;H28  ). The targeted modification of pyridine can selectively lead to  FJI&#8208;H27  (  M  ) or  FJI&#8208;H27  (  P  ), making the chiral orientation and distribution of bulk  FJI&#8208;H27  samples can be controlled. Our work not only represents a new and highly controllable chiral induction process that may relate to the chiral origin in nature, but also firstly reveals how achiral external stimuli generate chirality from achiral precursors, and offers a guide for rational preparation of chiral MOFs.</dc:description>

      <title>Connecting hydrophobic surfaces in cyclic peptides increases membrane permeability</title>
      <dc:description>N&#8208;methylation or C&#8208;methylation in natural and synthetic cyclic peptides can increase membrane permeability, but it remains unclear why this happens in some cases but not others. Here we compare three&#8208;dimensional structures for cyclic peptides from six families, including isomers differing only in the location of a single N&#8208; or Ca&#8208;methyl substituent. We show that a single methyl group only increases membrane permeability when it connects or expands hydrophobic surface patches. Positional isomers, with the same molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, rotatable bonds, calculated LogP, topological polar surface area and total hydrophobic surface area, can still have different membrane permeabilities that correlate with the size of the largest continuous hydrophobic surface patch.

      <title>Controllable Distribution of Oxygen Vacancies in Grain Boundaries of p&#8208;Si/TiO2 Heterojunction Photocathodes for Solar Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Silicon is a promising photocathode in photoelectrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production, but it is primarily limited by photocorrosion in aqueous electrolytes. As an extensively used protective material, crystalline TiO2 could protect Si photoelectrode against corrosion. However, a large number of grain boundaries (GBs) in polycrystalline TiO2 would induce excessive recombination centers, impeding the carrier transport. This paper describes the introduction of oxygen vacancies (Ovac) with controllable spatial distribution for GBs to promote carrier transport. Two kinds of Ovac distribution, Ovac along GBs and Ovac inside grains,&#160; are compared, where the latter one is demonstrated to facilitate carrier transport owing to the formation of tunneling paths across GBs. Consequently, a simple p&#8208;Si/TiO2/Pt heterojunction photocathode with controllable Ovac distribution in TiO2 shows a +400 mV onset potential shift and yields an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 5.9%, which is the best efficiency reported among silicon photocathodes except for silicon homojunction.</dc:description>

Consequently, a simple p&#8208;Si/TiO2/Pt heterojunction photocathode with controllable Ovac distribution in TiO2 shows a +400 mV onset potential shift and yields an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 5.9%, which is the best efficiency reported among silicon photocathodes except for silicon homojunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Supramolecular Non&#8208;helical One&#8208;dimensional Channels and Microtubes Assembled from Enantiomers of Difluorenol</title>
      <dc:description>The design and assembly of photoelectro&#8208;active molecular channel structures is of great importance because of their special advantages in charge mobility, photo&#8208;induced electron transfer, proton conduction and exciton transport. Besides macrocycle stacking and knot + linker connection, this work rarely provides a fresh strategy for the exquisite design of 1D channel based on a pair of mirror isomers. Racemic 9,9'&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;[2,2'&#8208;bifluorene]&#8208;9,9'&#8208;diol (DPFOH) enantiomers were proved to be utilized as newfashioned building modules for the non&#8208;helical 1D channel structures. Although the individual molecule doesn&#8217;t present any molecular symmetry, two pairs of racemic DPFOH enantiomers can form a C2&#8208;symmetric closed loop via the stereoscopic herringbone assembly. Thanks to the special symmetry derived from the enantiomer pairs, the multiple supramolecular interactions and the padding from solvent molecules, this conventionally unstable topological structure is achieved. The self&#8208;similar relationship of tubular structures spanning from molecular level to microscale level was explained. Finally, the lithium&#8208;ion transport performance was demonstrated, showing a significant ion conductivity of 1.77&#215;10&#8208;4 S/cm, indicating the potential research value of this novel 1D channel structure.</dc:description>

Catalyzed by a Ni(II) complex in the absence of any external photosensitizer, readily available nitroarenes undergo coupling with a variety of aryl halides, providing a step&#8208;economic extension to the widely used Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig C&#8208;N coupling reaction.

      <title>Randomly Distributed Sulfur Atoms in the Main Chains of CO2&#8208;based Polycarbonates: Enhanced Optical Properties</title>
      <dc:description>Polymeric materials possessing both high refractive indices and high Abbe numbers are much in demand for the development of advanced optical devices. However, the synthesis of such functional materials is a challenge because of the trade&#8208;off between these two properties. Herein, a synthetic strategy is presented for enhancing the optical properties of CO  2  &#8208;based polycarbonates by modifying the polymer&#8217;s topological structure. Terpolymers with thiocarbonate and carbonate units randomly distributed in the polymers&#8217; main chain were synthesized  via  the terpolymerization of cyclohexene oxide with a mixture of CO  2  and COS in the presence of metal catalysts, most notably a dinuclear aluminum complex. DFT calculations were employed to explain why different structural sequence were obtained with distinct bimetallic catalysts. Varying the CO  2  pressure made it possible to obtain terpolymers with tunable carbonate linkages in the polymer chain. More importantly, optical property studies revealed that terpolymers with comparable thiocarbonate and carbonate units exhibited a refractive index of 1.501 with an enhanced Abbe number as high as 48.6, much higher than the corresponding polycarbonates or polythiocarbonates. Additionally, all terpolymers containing varying thiocarbonate content displayed good thermal properties with  T  g  &gt; 109 &#176;C and  T  d  &gt; 260 &#176;C, suggesting little loss in the thermal stability compared to the polycarbonate. Hence, modification of the topological structure of the polycarbonate is an efficient method of obtaining polymeric materials with enhanced optical properties without compromising thermal performance.</dc:description>

The methodology lays in the distal functionalization of acyl heterocycles enabling a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and the use of tailored made ketimines as reliable electrophilic partners.

The reaction proceeded selectively at the  ortho  position of the carbazolyl group, where the highest occupied molecular orbital is mainly localized due to the difference in the electron donating abilities of the diarylamino and carbazolyl groups.

      <title>Photoresponsive Prion&#8208;Mimic Foldamer to Induce Controlled Protein Aggregation</title>
      <dc:description>Proteins reconfigure their 3D&#8208;structure, and consequently their function, under the control of specific molecular interactions that sense, process and transmit information from the surrounding environment. When this fundamental process is hampered, many pathologies occur as in the case of protein misfolding diseases. In this work, we follow the early steps of &#945;&#8208;syncluclein (aS) aggregation, a process associated with Parkinson&#8217;s disease etiopathogenesis, that is promptly promoted by a light&#8208;mediated binding between the protein and a photoactive foldamer. The latter can switch between two conformations, one of which generates supramolecular fibrillar seeds that act as molecular templates able to induce a fast b&#8208;sheet transition for aS monomers that successively undergo fibrillar polymerization. The proposed method represents a powerful tool to study protein aggregation relevant to misfolding diseases in a controlled and inducible system.</dc:description>

      <title>One&#8208;step versatile room temperature synthesis of metal(IV) carboxylate MOFs</title>
      <dc:description>The development of room temperature green syntheses of robust MOFs is of great interest to meet the demand of the sustainable chemistry and is a pre&#8208;requisite for the incorporation of functional but fragile compounds in water stable MOFs. However, only few ambient conditions routes to produce metal(IV) based MOFs have been reported and most of them suffer from a very low yield and/or multiple steps that preclude their use for most applications. We report here a new versatile one&#8208;step synthesis of a series of highly porous M  6  oxoclusters based MOFs (M= Zr, Hf, Ce) at room temperature, including 8 or 12&#8208;connected micro/mesoporous solids with different functionalized organic ligands. The resulting compounds show varying degrees of defectivity, particularly for 12&#8208;connected phases, while maintaining the chemical stability of the parent MOFs. We propose first insights for the efficient MOF preparation based on  In&#8208;situ  kinetics observations. Remarkably, the synthetic versatility not only allows an efficient room temperature synthesis with a high space&#8208;time yield, but also gives possibility to tune the particle size, which therefore paves the way for their practical use.</dc:description>

      <title>Mn&#8722;O Covalency Governs the Intrinsic Activity of Co&#8208;Mn Spinel Oxides for Boosted Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
Bimetallic spinel oxides are efficient catalysts for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation but the catalytic mechanism is unclear. The critical role of Mn&#8722;O covalency in determining the intrinsic activity of Co3&#8722;xMnxO4 and a new mechanism of Co&#8211;Mn synergy are revealed by Wen&#8208;Wei Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010828). Co strengthens Mn&#8722;O covalency in the octahedral configuration of Co3&#8722;xMnxO4, which lowers the charge transfer energy of the MnOh&#8211;PMS interaction and drastically accelerates MnVI/MnIII redox cycling.

      <title>The Conformational Equilibrium of the Neuropeptide Y2 Receptor in Bilayer Membranes</title>

NMR spectroscopy sheds light on receptor activation: Molecular switches are conserved motifs of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors that undergo structural changes during activation. Tryptophan residues are often part of these molecular switches and thus provide insights in the activation mechanism of the molecule. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202006075) Daniel Huster et&#8197;al. use NMR spectroscopy to monitor structural alterations of the neuropeptide Y1 receptor with atomic resolution observable by changes in the chemical shifts of six native tryptophan residues.

      <dc:description>
Achieving rechargeable lithium oxygen batteries with reversible LiOH formation/decomposition is challenging. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202010745), Jun Lu, Khalil Amine, and co&#8208;workers report that a cation additive can tune the solvation environment of Li ions, resulting in the change of cell chemistry to form LiOH. LiOH is proved to be reversibly charged at a low voltage, without the presence of redox mediators or catalysts.

     alt="Cation Additive Enabled Rechargeable LiOH&#8208;Based Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving rechargeable lithium oxygen batteries with reversible LiOH formation/decomposition is challenging. In their Communication (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202010745"&gt;10.1002/anie.202010745&lt;/a&gt;), Jun Lu, Khalil Amine, and co&#8208;workers report that a cation additive can tune the solvation environment of Li ions, resulting in the change of cell chemistry to form LiOH. LiOH is proved to be reversibly charged at a low voltage, without the presence of redox mediators or catalysts.

&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diels&#8211;Alder Polymer Networks with Temperature&#8208;Reversible Cross&#8208;Linking&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
      <dc:description>
A Diels&#8211;Alder polymer network that exhibits strong emission due to the rotation restrictions of TPE molecules caused by the cross&#8208;linking structure is reported by Yu Jiang and Nikos Hadjichristidis in their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202013183). The cross&#8208;linking&#8208;induced emission behavior can be regulated by the temperature&#8208;responsible, reversible DA/retro&#8208;DA reaction.

      <title>1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition between Dehydroalanines and C,N&#8208;Cyclic Azomethine Imines: Application to Late&#8208;stage Peptide Modification</title>

Above all, the reactions can be carried out between peptides with Dha residues at the position of interest and C,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines, both in homogeneous phase and on resins in SPPS. It provides a new toolkit for late&#8208;stage peptide modification, labelling and peptide&#8208;drug conjugation. In addition, to shed light on the high regioselectivity of the reaction, DFT calculations were carried out, and showed qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations.</dc:description>
