         <title>Machine Learning Reveals In&#8208;Cavity vs Surface Activity for Selective C&#8211;H Borylation by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) provide an expansive and tunable platform for heterogeneous catalysis, yet distinguishing between catalytic reactions occurring within their pores and those on their external surfaces remains a challenge. This study employs interpretable machine learning to elucidate structure&#8208;activity relationships in MOF&#8208;supported nickel (Ni) catalysts for selective sp3 and sp2 C&#8211;H borylation. By analyzing over 470,000 MOF structures, we developed a set of 45 concise and chemically meaningful descriptors that capture key structural variations across MOFs. These descriptors enabled us to identify the critical factors governing sp3 vs. sp2 selectivity, revealing distinct activation mechanisms: sp3 C&#8211;H borylation preferentially occurs within MOF cavities via a radical&#8208;mediated hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, whereas sp2 C&#8211;H borylation is associated with surface or defect sites, favoring a concerted metalation&#8208;deprotonation (CMD) pathway. Guided by these insights, we designed Ni catalysts that achieve up to 97.8% sp3 selectivity and 88.7% sp2 selectivity. This work provides a systematic framework for rational catalyst design and establishes generalizable principles for controlling activity preference in MOF&#8208;supported catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric coordination in cobalt single&#8208;atom catalysts enables fast charge dynamics and hierarchical active sites for two&#8208;stage kinetics in photodegradation&#160;of organic pollutants</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted growing interest in solar&#8208;driven catalysis, though challenges persist due to symmetrical metal coordination, which results in limited driving force and sluggish charge dynamics. Additionally, uneven energy and mass distribution complicate reaction pathways, ultimately restricting solar energy utilization and catalytic efficiency. Herein, we synthesized cobalt single atom decorated carbon nitride catalysts (CoSA&#8208;CN) featuring a highly asymmetric Co&#8208;C2N3 coordination, tailored for photocatalytic pollutants removal. Advanced experimental studies and simulation results collectively revealed that the unique microenvironment surrounding Co single atoms improved charge dynamics and created reactive hot spots, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species during the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. These enhanced charge dynamics, combined with hierarchical active sites, resulted in two&#8208;stage reaction kinetics and excellent stability for the degradation of bisphenol A in wastewater, distinctly outperforming the first&#8208;stage kinetics observed for polymeric carbon nitride. This work advances the understanding of structure&#8208;performance relationships in SAC&#8208;based photocatalytic degradation and offers valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation SACs in environmental catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Interface Engineering and Additive&#8208;Induced Crystallinity Tuning for High&#8208;Performance Thermally Conductive Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To boost up the properties of thermally conductive polymer composites, it is essential to conduct comprehensive research focused on interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers. Hexagonal boron nitride (BN) or expanded graphite (EG) are commonly utilized as nanofillers to improve the thermal conductivity of polymer composites. However, the interfacial interactions between the polymer matrix and nanofillers are generally weak, making effective thermal conductivity challenging. To address this issue, we have designed and synthesized an electron&#8208;rich and aromatic tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;based reactive mesogen (TRM), which not only possesses high thermal conductivity but also exhibits excellent interfacial affinity with BN and EG at the molecular level. Systematic experiments including photophysical, thermodynamic, structural, and computational analyses reveal that the thermal conductivity of TRM&#8208;based polymer composites is substantially enhanced due to effective interfacial interactions between TRM and fillers. The TRM composites experimentally show excellent thermal conductivity based on enhanced interfacial phonon transfer, and these results are supported by theoretical interpretations. These findings underscore the critical importance of interface engineering between the polymer matrix and fillers at the molecular level in maximizing the material properties of polymer composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Cytochrome P450 Mediated Cyclohexane Ring Formation in Forazoline Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Forazoline A, produced by the marine actinomycete Actinomadura sp. WMMB&#8208;499, is a unique PK/NRP hybrid macrolactone with promising antifungal in vivo efficacy through a previously unreported mechanism.&#160;While a PKS/NRPS gene cluster was identified as a candidate for forazoline production, the precise biosynthetic pathway and the&#160;functions of the tailoring enzymes remain unclear. In this work, the functions of three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (FrazP1P2P3) were characterized. Notably, FrazP2 was found to mediate cyclohexane ring formation from an 1,3,6&#8208;triene precursor during forazoline A biosynthesis, as confirmed by genetic and biochemical analysis. To gain structural and mechanistic insight into the activity of FrazP2, the crystal structure of a FrazP2&#8208;substrate complex has been solved at 2.3 &#197; resolution. The molecular dynamics simulations and DFT calculations revealed an unprecedented enzyme&#8208;catalyzed oxidative cyclization reaction by FrazP2. These findings expand our understanding of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome P450s, contributing to the diversification of natural products and enabling the creation of unnatural derivatives with increased antifungal potency.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Lactonase Enzymes as Biocatalysts for the Deracemization of Chiral &#947;&#8208;Thiolactones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactonases, a class of metalloenzymes that exhibit catalytic promiscuity, have been extensively studied from a biological perspective, yet their application as biocatalysts remains underexplored. In this study, we disclose the biocatalytic activity of lactonase enzymes in the hydrolysis and deracemization of chiral C3&#8208;substituted&#8208;&#947;&#8208;thiolactones and the asymmetric synthesis of &#947;&#8208;thio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;substituted&#8208;carboxylic acids. The thiolactonase activity of lactonases from different protein superfamilies was investigated. The biocatalyst GcL, from the metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase&#8208;like lactonase family, catalysed the enzymatic kinetic resolution (EKR) of homocysteine (Hcy) thiolactones with excellent enantioselectivity (E&#8208;value up to 136), yielding enantioenriched Hcy thiolactones and &#947;&#8208;thio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;carboxylic acids with high ees. Additionally, the biocatalyst N9 Y71G, a rationally engineered variant of the reconstructed ancestral paraoxonase enzyme N9, catalysed the dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) of C3&#8208;thio&#8208;&#947;&#8208;thiolactones, yielding &#947;&#8208;thio&#8208;&#945;&#8208;thio&#8208;carboxylic acids in enantioselective manner with high ees (up to &gt;99%) and yields (up to &gt;99%). Insights on the mechanism and the stereoselectivity of the lactonase biocatalysts were gained through computational and site&#8208;directed mutagenesis studies.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Cu6Sn5 alloy electrocatalysts for formaldehyde oxidative dehydrogenation and bipolar hydrogen production</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aldehyde assisted water electrolysis offers an attractive pathway for energy&#8208;saving bipolar hydrogen production with combined faradaic efficiency of 200 % while converting formaldehyde into value&#8208;added formate. Herein we report the design and synthesis of noble metal free Cu6Sn5&#160;alloy as a highly effective electrocatalyst for formaldehyde electro oxidative dehydrogenation, demonstrating a geometric current density of 915&#177;46 mA/cm2&#160;at 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming many noble metal electrocatalysts reported previously. The formaldehyde assisted water electrolyser delivers 100 mA/cm2&#160;at a low cell voltage of 0.124 V, and a current density of 486&#177;20 mA/cm2&#160;at a cell voltage of 0.6 V without any iR compensation, and exhibit nearly 200 % faradaic efficiency for bipolar hydrogen production at 100 mA/cm2&#160;in 88&#8208;hour long&#8208;term operation. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the notably lowered barriers for dehydrogenation and Tafel steps on the Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; surface compared to Cu, underscoring its potential as a highly active catalyst.</dc:description>

The formaldehyde assisted water electrolyser delivers 100 mA/cm2&#160;at a low cell voltage of 0.124 V, and a current density of 486&#177;20 mA/cm2&#160;at a cell voltage of 0.6 V without any iR compensation, and exhibit nearly 200 % faradaic efficiency for bipolar hydrogen production at 100 mA/cm2&#160;in 88-hour long-term operation. Density functional theory calculations further confirm the notably lowered barriers for dehydrogenation and Tafel steps on the Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; surface compared to Cu, underscoring its potential as a highly active catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Security and High&#8208;Efficiency Information Encryption/Decryption Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskites via Delicate Organic&#8208;Cation Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical encryption based on stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (SRL) materials has received enormous interest in the field of information security. Metal&#8211;halide perovskites, as a newly emerging SRL material, have shown great potential for confidential information encryption/decryption (InfoED) applications. However, it is rather challenging to ensure high security and achieve high readout efficiency in perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED. Herein, we present a unique InfoED strategy using two&#8208;dimensional hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites via delicate organic&#8208;cation engineering, benefiting from the high contrast and quick response of their photoluminescence behaviors. Indistinguishably encrypted information can be efficiently decrypted through triple&#8208;key implementation (i.e., ultraviolet&#8208;light irradiation, temperature control, and narrow&#8208;bandpass filtering) that operates in multiple switching modes, enabling us to demonstrate extremely high security by adopting dot&#8208;matrix patterning scenarios that are virtually uncrackable. As a proof of principle, a simple 2 &#215; 2 patterning can yield a code dictionary with random variants as high as ~10^{47}, which will take as long as ~10^{22}&#160;years to crack using the hitherto fastest supercomputer El Capitan. Our perovskite SRL&#8208;based InfoED strategy provides a promising solution for information security based on optical encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Equalized dual emissions from copper complexes via multichannel balanced intersystem crossing: towards 100% quantum efficiencies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent materials have important applications in biology, medicine, catalysis, energy, information technology, and so on. However, to suppress quenching and improve efficiencies, how to balance singlet and triplet radiations for efficient dual emission composed of equalized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence remains a formidable challenge. Here we report that based on a rigid skeleton of triphosphine CuI complex, modification with carbazole donors results in high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered charge transfer states, which provide additional channels for accurately optimizing the singlet&#8208;triplet ratios. We achieve equalized dual emissions containing 53% TADF and 47% phosphorescence, ~100% photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;luminescence quantum efficiencies and record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies of ~30% for pure&#8208;yellow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Photophysical and exciton kinetics analyses indicate the incorporation of high&#8208;lying ligand&#8208;centered triplet states into dual&#8208;emissive electroluminescence is based on energy&#8208;level matching with the first triplet states of host matrixes.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes has been extensively developed as it offers an effective way to obtain chiral cyclic compounds. Herein, we report a divergent palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of&#160;N&#8208;allyl substituted propiolamides, which allows for the efficient synthesis of chiral &#947;&#8208;lactams bearing a quaternary stereogenic center. Three distinctive cyclization strategies, namely, hydrocyanative cyclization, cyclization/Heck reaction, and cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation, were successfully developed. The product can be selected by using different initial substrates under the same catalytic conditions or by fine&#8208;tuning the reaction conditions for the same initial substrate. This catalytic system boasts broad substrate scope and wide functional&#8208;group compatibility, where a diverse range of substituents on the aryl group and amide nitrogen atom were tolerated. The combination of experimental studies and theoretical calculations revealed the fundamental role of the ligand in regioselectivity and the role of H2O in the sequential cyclization/Heck/hydrocyanation reactions. H2O can significantly lower the energy barrier of the reductive elimination step, thus promoting the reaction towards target product formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Divergent Hydroboration/Multiboration of Terminal Alkynes via Markovnikov Pathway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroboration/multiboration of alkynes has been considered a straightforward route for the construction of high&#8208;value alkenylboronates and multiborylalkanes, especially reflected by the productions of &#946;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes based on the anti&#8208;Markovnikov&#8208;type transformations of terminal alkyne. However, the syntheses of branched &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates and related multiborylalkanes remain elusive due to the thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable Markovnikov hydroboration process. Herein, we present a conceptually novel metal&#8208;free approach for Markovnikov hydroboration of terminal alkynes to achieve the &#945;&#8208;alkenylboronates. Derived from it, we have successfully realized unprecedented tailor&#8208;made multiborations (2,2&#8208;dihydroboration, 1,2,2&#8208;triboration, and 1,2&#8208;dihydroboration) of alkynes by simply changing the proton sources and solvents. The broad substrate scope and outstanding chemo&#8208; and regioselectivities of the developed approaches unlock opportunities to exploit these formerly unattainable organoboronates, thereby expanding uncharted chemical space. The preliminary mechanistic studies highlight the synergistic roles of amide solvents, suitable proton sources, and B2cat2 in facilitating these tunable transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Lithium&#8208;Mediated Green Ammonia Synthesis with Water Electrolysis Boosted by Membrane Electrolyzer with Polyoxometalate Proton Shuttles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers a sustainable approach to ammonia synthesis by integrating lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction (Li&#8208;NRR) with water electrolysis (WE). Polyoxometalates (POMs) serve as electron&#8208;coupled proton buffers (ECPBs), enhancing proton transfer while suppressing hydrogen evolution. A three&#8208;compartment flow reactor achieves continuous ammonia production, setting a benchmark for eco&#8208;friendly nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
Integrating water electrolysis (WE) with lithium&#8208;mediated nitrogen reduction (Li&#8208;NRR) offers a sustainable route for green ammonia production by directly utilizing protons from water oxidation, eliminating reliance on grey or blue hydrogen. Here, polyoxometalates (POMs) function as electron&#8208;coupled proton buffers (ECPBs) to seamlessly link WE with Li&#8208;NRR in a three&#8208;compartment flow reactor comprising an aqueous anode, an organic cathode, and a gas feed chamber. POMs serve as proton shuttles while suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), facilitating efficient ammonia synthesis. The addition of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) enhances catholyte hydrophobicity, mitigating water contamination. By optimizing ECPB concentration, a dynamic balance is achieved between lithium nitride intermediates (LiNxHy) formation and consumption, yielding ammonia at 573.7&#160;&#177;&#160;5.2&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 54.2%. This design advances flow reactor technology by uniquely utilizing water oxidation as a direct proton source, bypassing conventional hydrogen oxidation methods. The use of POMs as proton shuttles establishes a new benchmark for green ammonia production, reinforcing its potential in sustainable chemistry.

         <title>Oscillatory Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction in Pd/TiO2 Under Redox Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oscillatory strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) behavior of Pd/TiO2 nanocatalysts under redox conditions was revealed through environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM). The oscillatory TiOx overlayers act as a temporary reservoir for Ti species, facilitating the tip growth of the support protrusion.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis, with its encapsulation configuration being highly dependent on the chemical environments. However, the dynamic behavior of SMSI under redox conditions remains insufficiently understood. Here, environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) revealed that SMSI overlayers form stably on the surface of Pd/TiO2 nanocatalysts under pure O2 and pure H2 conditions, and exhibit oscillatory behavior under a redox condition with a 5:1 O2/H2 ratio at 0.05&#160;Pa. Specifically, the outer layer of the SMSI overlayer, characterized primarily by typical oxidative SMSI, undergoes oscillations between formation and retraction near the Pd&#8208;TiO2 interface. The SMSI oscillations locally modify the morphology of the TiO2 support, with the SMSI overlayer serving as a temporary reservoir for Ti species to drive the tip growth of the support protrusion. Our work expands the understanding of the dynamic behavior of SMSI under reaction conditions and provides new insights into the solid&#8208;state growth mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;An oscillatory strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) behavior of Pd/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocatalysts under redox conditions was revealed through environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM). The oscillatory TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers act as a temporary reservoir for Ti species, facilitating the tip growth of the support protrusion.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis, with its encapsulation configuration being highly dependent on the chemical environments. However, the dynamic behavior of SMSI under redox conditions remains insufficiently understood. Here, environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) revealed that SMSI overlayers form stably on the surface of Pd/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocatalysts under pure O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and pure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conditions, and exhibit oscillatory behavior under a redox condition with a 5:1 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio at 0.05&#160;Pa. Specifically, the outer layer of the SMSI overlayer, characterized primarily by typical oxidative SMSI, undergoes oscillations between formation and retraction near the Pd-TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface. The SMSI oscillations locally modify the morphology of the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; support, with the SMSI overlayer serving as a temporary reservoir for Ti species to drive the tip growth of the support protrusion. Our work expands the understanding of the dynamic behavior of SMSI under reaction conditions and provides new insights into the solid-state growth mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Is Phenylnitrene a Missing Link in the Formation of Polycyclic Aromatic Nitrogen Heterocycles?</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heteroatoms into the framework of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in particular of nitrogen to yield polycyclic aromatic nitrogen heterocycles (PANHs), has been proposed for both astronomical and combustion environments, but no suitable precursors and pathways have been found. Analogous pathways to PAH formation are kinetically or energetically inhibited in the presence of a nitrogen heteroatom. We report on the reaction of phenylnitrene (3PhN, c&#8208;C6H5N) with resonance&#8208;stabilized propargyl radicals (C3H3) and find that the association reaction bifurcates depending on the orientation of the attacking propargyl radical and yields multiple isomeric products. Among them, we identify the condensed&#8208;ring quinoline and conclude that nitrenes are viable candidates to drive the formation of PANHs.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets for the Assembly of Efficient Membrane Bioreactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly method to trap enzymes between covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets instead for the construction of membrane bioreactors. This design boosts mass transfer, shields enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products, and enables rapid substrate conversion (complete in 7.95 s)&#8212;achieving 1018&#215; higher activity than free enzymes. The reactor maintains stability under continuous use and works with diverse enzymes/COFs, offering a versatile platform for high&#8208;performance biocatalysts.








Abstract
Immobilizing fragile enzymes in porous materials holds significant potential for biocatalysis but encounters challenges such as mismatched enzyme size and pore structure of host materials, along with harsh assembly conditions that can denature enzymes. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for constructing membrane bioreactors through water&#8208;mediated, vacuum&#8208;assisted layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of covalent organic framework (COF) nanosheets with enzymes. This method effectively addresses pore size limitations, preserves enzyme activity, and promotes convective transport of reactants to active sites, while shielding enzymes from harmful by&#8208;products through rapid transport in continuous membrane catalysis. The optimized bioreactor achieves a 1018&#8208;fold increase in relative activity compared to free enzymes in batch reactions, completing substrate conversion in just 7.95 s, and demonstrating enhanced stability.

         <title>Anchoring Highly Unsaturated Nickel(II) Sites into a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Simultaneous High C2H2 Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have realized a new strategy of anchoring highly unsaturated Ni2+ sites into large&#8208;pore MOF (Ni2+@NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2) for simultaneously promoting C2H2 adsorption and selectivity, resulting in the most balance reported so far between C2H2 uptake (201.4 cm3 g&#8722;1) and C2H2/CO2 (25.7) selectivity at 298&#160;K and 1 bar.








Abstract
Separation of acetylene (C2H2) from carbon dioxide (CO2) remains a challenge to achieve both high C2H2 uptake and selectivity for a single material. Porous materials with open metal sites (OMSs) have been widely employed to separate various gas mixtures; however, routine OMSs often show the limitation in C2H2/CO2 separation due to the comparable binding affinity with the two gases. Herein, we report a new strategy of anchoring highly unsaturated nickel(II) sites into a large&#8208;pore MOF (Ni2+@NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2) for simultaneously improving C2H2 adsorption and selectivity. The coordination geometry of the anchored Ni2+ ion was accurately determined by SCXRD studies, featuring a two&#8208;coordination model with highly unsaturated OMSs after the activation. This highly unsaturated Ni2+ ion can provide additional binding sites to improve C2H2 adsorption and also enable highly selective binding of C2H2 over CO2 through the specific and strong &#960;&#8208; complexation interactions, as revealed by gas&#8208;loaded SCXRD studies and theoretical simulations. This metalated MOF thus exhibits both significantly enhanced C2H2 uptake (201.4 cm3 g&#8722;1) and C2H2/CO2 selectivity (25.7) than the pristine NOTT&#8208;101&#8208;(COOH)2 (148.0 cm3 g&#8722;1 and 3.8) at 298&#160;K and 1&#160;bar, making an unprecedented balance between C2H2 adsorption and selectivity to overcome the trade&#8208;off challenge. Breakthrough experiments on equimolar C2H2/CO2 mixtures afford both the top&#8208;tier dynamic selectivity (14.4) and C2H2 productivity of 114.5&#160;L kg&#8722;1 (&gt;99.5% purity) at ambient conditions.

         <title>N&#8208;Insertion of Diazonium Salts Into Ketone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diazonium salts insert into ketones and their silyl enol ethers through a sequence of &#945;&#8208;azenylation and ring expansion via an N&#8208;iminoaziridinium species. Coupled with an efficient N&#8208;N bond cleavage, this protocol offers a mild alternative to Beckmann rearrangements and a powerful tool for skeletal editing of ketones.








Abstract
We report a new oxidative nitrogen insertion into cyclic ketones using readily available diazonium salts. In the case of indanones, the reaction is promoted by auto&#8208;catalytically generated Br&#248;nsted acid and proceeds via sequential &#945;&#8208;diazenylation and ring expansion through an N&#8208;iminoaziridinium intermediate. For less &#945;&#8208;acidic ketones, a complementary strategy employing silyl enol ethers was developed: catalyzed by HNTf2, efficient nitrogen insertion occurred into silyl enol ethers derived from a broad range of four&#8208; to seven&#8208;membered cyclic ketones. The resulting N&#8208;aminoamides exhibit broad synthetic utility in various downstream transformations. Notably, a ring expansion, followed by N&#9472;N bond cleavage offers a powerful tool for skeletal editing, converting indanones into isoquinolinones, as demonstrated by the scaffold modification of donepezil.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Doped Cobalt Molybdate Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence Imaging for Dynamic Multilevel Information Encryption System Construction and Biomarker Sensing Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exhibiting different efficiencies in converting tripropylamine into free radicals, iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate and cobalt molybdate generate a signal gradient in the ECL image that enhances information multidimensionality. Leveraging this feature, these materials serve as chemical inks for encrypted printing, thereby establishing a multilevel information encryption strategy for information security.








Abstract
Integrating electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging with a multilevel information encryption strategy overcomes the limitations of conventional encryption methods, which rely solely on abstract electrical signals, by providing intuitive visual outputs. Herein, a dynamic multilevel information encryption system based on ECL imaging was successfully constructed, which realizes robust protection and precisely controlled decryption of information through the multidimensional security mechanism of &#8220;biometrics (biospecific recognition of the primary key) &#8211; electrochemical activation (precise voltage&#8208;triggered activation of the secondary key) &#8211; operational sequence dependence (strict matching of the operational timing)&#8211;signal gradient (decryptor judgment)&#8221;. Specifically, we develop a functional chemical ink comprised of iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate and biomolecules, which is applied onto nitrocellulose membranes via micro&#8208;patterned printing to construct biocompatible, environmentally responsive encryption interfaces. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate that iron&#8208;doped cobalt molybdate accelerates the conversion of tripropylamine (TPrA) into TPrA radicals, forming a signal gradient with the cobalt molybdate catalytic region and thereby further enhancing the dimensionality of information encryption. Furthermore, a chemical ink&#8208;based ECL sensor was developed for ultra&#8208;sensitive detection of the cancer biomarker CA15&#8208;3, demonstrating the dual potential application in biomedical information security and disease diagnosis.

         <title>Beyond Second Coordination Shell: Long&#8208;Range &#960;&#8208;Electrons Delocalization Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) depend on hierarchical coordination environments, yet higher&#8208;order shells (&gt;2nd) critically influence electronic structures via long&#8208;range charge delocalization. This study pioneers long&#8208;range interaction engineering in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for CO2 electroreduction. By tailoring pyrolysis of NiTPP to preserve Ni&#8208;N4 coordination shell (first and second) while eliminating peripheral &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the catalyst achieves a 29&#8208;fold CO efficiency boost (85.9% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V) and 98.3% selectivity at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although long&#8208;range charge delocalization beyond the second coordination shell critically influence the geometric and electronic properties of single&#8208;atom active sites, their systematic modulation to enhance multielectron catalytic processes remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a site&#8208;specific strategy to engineer the nickel tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) precursors by selectively cleaving carbon&#8211;carbon single bonds at the &#946;&#8208;carbon sites. This approach preserves the Ni&#8208;centered first and second coordination shells while systematically removing peripheral &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization in extended coordination environments. The resultant Ni&#8208;N4 catalyst exhibits a 29&#8208;fold enhancement in CO faradaic efficiency at &#8722;1.4&#160;V versus RHE compared to original counterparts. Notably, it maintains 98.3% CO selectivity at industrial&#8208;grade current densities up to 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Combined experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the electron&#8208;enriched Ni sites, arising from precisely regulated charge delocalization in higher coordination shells, facilitate stabilization of the critical *COOH intermediate. Our findings establish a paradigm for advanced catalyst design through deliberate engineering of higher coordination shells.

         <title>Triple Synergy Engineering via Metal&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Atom Incorporation for Self&#8208;Sustaining Acidic Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a metal&#8208;free heteronuclear catalyst, Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC, engineering atomic&#8208;level triple synergy: 1) Electron&#8208;deficient Ni&#948;&#8314; and oxygen vacancies boost nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion activity while suppressing H2 evolution. 2) Iodine&#8208;mediated proton reservoirs dynamically regulate H* coverage. 3) Covalent Si&#9472;O&#9472;Ni bonding stabilizes the interface. The catalyst achieves a 96.8% FE and groundbreaking 420&#8208;h durability in acid. The innovative heteronuclear diatomic synergistic strategy establishes a new design principle for durable, acid&#8208;compatible electrocatalysts of nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) for ammonia synthesis under acidic conditions offers significant advantages, like direct fertilizer production and prevention of ammonia volatilization. However, three critical challenges persist: instability of metal&#8208;based catalysts, competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and proton depletion leading to species imbalance. Here, we developed a novel metal&#8208;free heteronuclear diatomic&#8208;based catalyst that simultaneously addresses these challenges through atomic&#8208;level triple synergy engineering. Silicon&#8211;iodine dual&#8208;atoms are precisely anchored on nickel oxide ultrathin nanosheets supported on carbon cloth (Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC) via a gradient&#8208;heating co&#8208;loading method. Si/I&#8208;NiO@CC establishes a self&#8208;sustaining catalytic system, achieving a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 96.8% at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE and record&#8208;breaking operational stability of 420&#160;h in acidic electrolyte, surpassing the performance of all reported acid NO3RR electrocatalysts to date. Advanced in situ spectroscopic characterization combined with electrochemical evaluation reveals the triple synergy mechanism: electron&#8208;deficient Ni&#948;&#8314; and oxygen vacancies generate abundant active sites while mitigating HER competition, iodine&#8208;mediated proton reservoirs dynamically regulate H* coverage to maintain species balance, and covalent Si&#9472;O&#9472;Ni interfacial bonding inhibits metal leaching and stabilizes the catalytic system. This work establishes a constructive guideline for the rational engineering of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for selective acidic NO3RR.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron and Oxygen Coordination on Ruthenium Clusters for Industrial Water Splitting in Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;density boron&#8211;oxygen bi&#8208;coordinated ruthenium clusters have been successfully synthesized. The resultant RuC&#8211;B&#8211;O/rGO composites exhibit promising potential for application in industrial water electrolysis.








Abstract
The alteration in the coordination environment of metal atoms can manipulate their electronic structure and regulate the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. In this work, synchrotron radiation tests prove that the boron (B) and oxygen (O) elements co&#8208;coordinate with ruthenium clusters (RuC) on the surface of B&#8211;O modified reduced graphene oxide. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that this unique structure electrocatalyst presents an overpotential of 12&#160;mV in 1&#160;M KOH condition and for over 120&#160;h at the current of &#8722;1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating potential practical applications. The quasi in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy confirmed that the B&#8211;O diatomic coordination can modulate the synergy between the substrate and the RuC catalytic site, enhancing the intrinsic catalytic activity and ion migration efficiency. The first principles calculation further proves that B&#8211;O diatomic coordination will reduce the desorption barrier of H* and construct a complete hydrogen migration path. This study discloses the significance of the synergistic effect of two anions to enhance the catalytic activity of the catalyst by altering the coordination environment of ruthenium clusters.

         <title>Visible Light Excited Time&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Tuning in Carbon Dots via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the discovery of confining carbon dots (CDs) into boric acid matrix realizing the precise regulation of color from red to white with delay time increase under white light (WL) excitation. And composites can emit persistent afterglow at high temperatures up to 393&#160;K under WL excitation. Its time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) and high stability lay a solid foundation for higher&#8208;order cryptographic and anticounterfeiting.








Abstract
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency time&#8208;dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials that can be activated under visible light with strong stability remains challenging. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) were confined in the boric acid matrix to activate surface crosslinking emissive clusters and modulate charge transfer (CT) interaction, facilitating green and red dual emissive centers to coexist in composites. The presence of halogen atoms strengthened the interactions between CDs and boric acid. Notably, the CT interaction can offer excitons at low energy levels and allow for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, making the red emissive center more dominant under visible light excitation. The interplay of dual centers featuring sufficient color differentiation and different decay rates activated characteristic TDPC evolution resulting in dynamic afterglow evolution from red to white under visible light excitation. Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra&#8208;strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperatures of up to 393&#160;K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.

&lt;p&gt;Achieving high-efficiency time-dependent phosphorescence color (TDPC) materials that can be activated under visible light with strong stability remains challenging. In this study, carbon dots (CDs) were confined in the boric acid matrix to activate surface crosslinking emissive clusters and modulate charge transfer (CT) interaction, facilitating green and red dual emissive centers to coexist in composites. The presence of halogen atoms strengthened the interactions between CDs and boric acid. Notably, the CT interaction can offer excitons at low energy levels and allow for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, making the red emissive center more dominant under visible light excitation. The interplay of dual centers featuring sufficient color differentiation and different decay rates activated characteristic TDPC evolution resulting in dynamic afterglow evolution from red to white under visible light excitation. Moreover, the formation of rigid boric acid crystalloid network resulted in an ultra-strong confinement at high temperature, enabling the composites to emit long persistent afterglow at high temperatures of up to 393&#160;K under visible light excitation. The study provides new light on the design of TDPC materials and represents a significant advancement toward expanding the application in information security.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Influence of Ligand Design and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions on the Isoselective Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;Butyrolactone Using Salan and Salalen Rare&#8208;Earth Metal Catalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
Polyhydroxybutyrates are key sustainable polyesters, but controlling the stereoregularity is crucial for exhibiting the most promising thermal and mechanical properties. Highly active rare&#8208;earth metal salan/salalen complexes yield isotactic (Pm up to 0.96 at 0 &#176;C) or syndioenriched (Pr up to 0.91) PHB, depending on the steric demand of the ligand and non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) in the catalytic system. 








Abstract
We herein report the influence of the ligand framework on the isoselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;&#946;&#8208;butyrolactone using highly active in situ generated salan [ONNO]H2 and salalen [ONNO]H rare&#8208;earth metal complexes. The stereochemistry was found to be highly dependent on the ortho&#8208;substituents, enabling the synthesis of either isotactic poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) (up to Pm&#160;=&#160;0.92) or syndiotactic PHB (up to Pr&#160;=&#160;0.91). To obtain further information on the mechanism of the isoselective ROP, which exhibits an enantiomorphic site control (ESC), a new hybrid Y[ONNO]H(N(SiHMe2)2)(THF) complex was isolated and characterized via NMR, DFT, and mass&#8208;spectrometry experiments. The impact of non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCIs) was demonstrated by the addition of NCI inhibitors. Kinetic studies revealed a secondary kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) of 1.14, indicating that the pre&#8208;coordination of the monomer plays a significant role in the mechanism. These findings provide a foundation for the future design of catalysts for isoselective ROP.

         <title>Intrinsically Disordered Peptide Nanofibers from a Structured Motif Within Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sequence (PQYQP), derived from the SRC protein, was combined with the self&#8208;assembly motif (Nap&#8208;FF) to produce intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies that form cell&#8208;compatible hydrogels via enzyme&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly (EISA).








Abstract
Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous in proteins, orchestrating complex cellular signaling through higher&#8208;order protein assemblies. However, the properties and functions of intrinsically disordered peptide (IDP) assemblies are largely underexplored. This work unveiled a facile strategy for engineering IDP assemblies. We demonstrate that conjugating a structured motif derived from a protein's phosphorylation site to a self&#8208;assembling tripeptide unexpectedly yields self&#8208;assembled nanofibers with intrinsic disorder. Specifically, by using a glycine linker to attach a pentapeptide derived from a phosphorylation site within a random coil region of SRC kinase to the C&#8208;terminus of a widely used self&#8208;assembling enabler, we generated a phosphorylated octapeptide. The octapeptide exhibits cell compatibility and forms a hydrogel upon dephosphorylation of the phosphooctapeptide. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) structural analysis of the nanofibers reveals that the peptides adopt two types of helical arrangements but exhibit intrinsic disorder at the periphery of the nanofibers. The hydrogels exhibit decreased protein adsorption with increasing peptide concentration. This study represents the first instance of a structured random coil within a protein transitioning into an intrinsically disordered state within self&#8208;assembled peptide nanofibers, expanding the pool of peptide sequences for IDPs and providing valuable insights for the engineering of peptide nanofibers with intrinsic disorder for the development of cell&#8208;compatible biomaterials.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ammonia in combination with hypochlorites as simple oxidants under phase&#8208;transfer conditions allows for the direct oxidative &#945;&#8208;amination of reactive enolate precursors such as cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, oxindoles, as well as malonitriles and malonates with good to excellent yields.








Abstract
We, herein, introduce a method for the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of different carbonyl compounds by employing aqueous ammonia as the N&#8208;source. Upon using NH3 in combination with hypochlorites as simple oxidants under phase&#8208;transfer catalytic conditions it is possible to carry out the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of reactive enolate&#8208;precursors such as cyclic &#946;&#8208;ketoesters, oxindoles, as well as malonitriles and malonates with good to excellent yields, while simple ketone precursors being out of the scope thus far. Furthermore, a first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for an asymmetric variant by employing a chiral quaternary ammonium salt is reported.

         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface synthesis enables nanographene fabrication but with limited reactions. Here, bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene undergoes domino cyclization via cycloisomerization, cyclodehydrogenation, and formyl cyclization, yielding dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene. STM, STS, and DFT analyses reveal their structures and properties, advancing carbon nanostructure synthesis.








Abstract
On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful method to synthesize nanographenes that are difficult to obtain through the solution chemistry, but the number of available reactions is still highly limited. In this study, we demonstrate an unprecedented on&#8208;surface domino cyclization of bis{2&#8208;(7&#8208;formylnaphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenyl}diacetylene, leading to dibenzo[hi,st]ovalene and peryleno[2,1,12,11&#8208;fghij]pentaphene through a sequence of 1) cycloisomerization of diaryldiacetylene moieties, 2) oxidative cyclodehydrogenation, and 3) reductive cyclization of formyl groups. The structures of these nanographenes and other cyclized products were unambiguously elucidated by using scanning tunneling microscopy directly on Au(111). Moreover, their electronic properties were investigated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations. Our findings offer new insights into the on&#8208;surface cyclization reactions, providing an effective strategy for synthesizing a wider variety of carbon nanostructures.

         <title>Unveiling an In Situ H2O2 Production: Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;H2O2 Battery Powering 26 LEDs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We proposed an aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;H2O2 battery, which targets two birds&#8208;one stone approach via generating H2O2 while discharging and O2 while charging. In situ electrochemical Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopic measurements exhibited the formation of real&#8208;time analysis of products. Local pH insights were examined via micro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Moreover, Zn&#8208;H2O2 batteries powered 26 LEDs for more than 7 days.








Abstract
Looking toward ever&#8208;growing energy demand, the advancement in energy storage devices and carrying out electrocatalytic reactions in an efficient way is the need of the hour. Herein, we have employed the two birds&#8208;one stone approach, viz. fusing energy conversion and storing system enabling 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to value&#8208;added hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) product and its utilization in the energy storage devices using MnWO4 catalyst, without any external H2O2 source. The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H2O2 production of 98% @ 0.37 V versus RHE.

&lt;p&gt;We proposed an aqueous rechargeable Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery, which targets two birds-one stone approach via generating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while discharging and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; while charging. In situ electrochemical Raman and in situ infrared spectroscopic measurements exhibited the formation of real-time analysis of products. Local pH insights were examined via micro-electrochemical studies. Moreover, Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries powered 26 LEDs for more than 7 days.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking toward ever-growing energy demand, the advancement in energy storage devices and carrying out electrocatalytic reactions in an efficient way is the need of the hour. Herein, we have employed the two birds-one stone approach, viz. fusing energy conversion and storing system enabling 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to value-added hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) product and its utilization in the energy storage devices using MnWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst, without any external H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source. The designed catalyst exhibited a remarkable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production of 98% @ 0.37 V versus RHE. The real-time H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production was monitored by in-situ electrochemical Raman and in-situ infrared spectroscopic measurements. The pivotal influence of electrolyte composition, viz. local pH and the formation of carbonate species on H&#8322;O&#8322; production was meticulously examined through micro-electrochemical studies using gold (Au) microelectrodes. Further, we have explored an aqueous rechargeable Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery utilizing MnWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as bifunctional electrocatalyst for sustainable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production simultaneously producing the electricity. The Zn-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery exhibited a remarkable cycle life of 136&#160;h and an practical energy efficiency of 43%.

         <title>The Mechanism of Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed C&#9472;H Arylation of Arenes: The Key Role of Bis&#8208;Cyclometalated Intermediates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#9472;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes is addressed through experimental stoichiometric, catalytic kinetic, and DFT studies. These reveal a key role for bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species and show bromoarene activation proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition. Bromoarene activation at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species is ruled out.








Abstract
The mechanism of Ru&#8208;catalyzed N&#8208;directed C&#8208;H ortho&#8208;arylation with haloarenes has been under intense scrutiny over the last decade, with conflicting proposals concerning the relevance of various catalytic intermediates and the nature of the key steps. This work presents experimental and computational studies that address these long&#8208;standing questions. Stoichiometric, catalytic, and mechanistic kinetic studies, supported by DFT calculations, reveal that bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium species are key intermediates in these reactions. These studies also show that oxidative addition with bromoarenes proceeds via a concerted oxidative addition pathway, as demonstrated by DFT and experimental kinetic orders. Bromoarene activation does not proceed at mono&#8208;cyclometalated species. In the catalytic process, zero order kinetics are observed on both reaction substrates, an observation that is rationalized by DFT calculations which predict a rate&#8208;limiting step within the product&#8208;release stage. These results showcase how detailed experimental and DFT studies can combine to probe mechanistic questions, as well as resolving opposing views around the mechanism of these Ru&#8208;catalyzed arylations that form the basis of promising mild C&#9472;H functionalizations.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Enable Improved Performance and Stability of Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonds and ionic liquids were used for the first time to regulate the phase distribution and release residual lattice strain of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) perovskites. The PFI&#8208;based halogen bond molecules achieve the regulation of the uniform and continuous phase distribution of DJ perovskite and adjust the lattice strain from the tensile strain to a smaller value of the compression strain. Eventually, the reverse bias stability of (PDMA)(MA)2Pb3I10&#8208;based DJ perovskite solar cells improved over 100 times.








Abstract
The undesired phase distribution and intrinsic residual lattice strain remain the bottleneck for high&#8208;performance and stable 2D or Q&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for the Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) type Q&#8208;2D PSCs. Here, we showcase employing halogen bonds to stabilize the halide anions and fine&#8208;tuning the residual lattice strain by introducing perfluorodecyl iodide (PFI). It reduces the density of iodide species defects and releases the residual tensile strain, leading to more homogenous phase distribution, suppressed carrier recombination, promoted charge transport, enhanced efficiency, and stability. Therefore, DJ PSCs maintain over 81% of initial efficiency after thermal&#8208;light aging (i.e., under 85&#8201;&#176;C and 1 sun illumination) for 952&#160;h, and remain over 91% of initial efficiency after under reverse bias (&#8722;2.5&#160;V, under ISOS&#8208;V aging tests) for over 21&#160;h, representing one of the most bias&#8208;stable Q&#8208;2D PSCs reported so far.

         <title>Inverted Chiroptical Properties of Hybrid Metal Halides Through Reversible Chiral Induction Driven by External and Internal Chirality Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible chiral induction strategy has achieved chiroptical property inversion of chiral hybrid metal halides driven by external and internal chirality transfer from a single chiral reagent. Both externally and internally induced chiral crystals exhibit significant chiroptical response, photoluminescence, and second harmonic generation. The multi&#8208;path chirality transfer provides new insights for construction of functional chiral materials.








Abstract
Chiral organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (OIHMHs) are commonly constructed by introducing pairs of enantiomorphic chiral precursors through a single chirality transfer pathway, which may limit the regulation of chiral structural diversity and chiroptoelectronic properties. Herein, we propose a new strategy for achieving reversible chiral induction of OIHMHs with inverted chiroptical properties through external and internal chirality transfer pathways, by utilizing a single chiral reagent R&#8208;/S&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylamine (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA). Specifically, R&#8208;MBA can externally induce chiral enrichment of M&#8208;DMA4(Bi0.486In0.511Sb0.003)Cl7 (M&#8208;DMA4(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl7, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylammonium cation) without integrating into structure. Conversely, R&#8208;MBA can insert into structure, internally inducing the formation of DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi0.634In0.362Sb0.004)Cl6 (DMA(R&#8208;MBA)2(Bi&#8208;In&#8208;Sb)Cl6), which reverses&#160;the structural arrangements and inverts both linear and nonlinear chiroptical properties. Both externally and internally induced chiral OIHMHs exhibit significant chiroptical responses with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and second harmonic generation (SHG). Moreover, the externally induced centimeter&#8208;sized rhombic single crystal enables morphology&#8208; and angle&#8208;dependent inverted circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor of &#8764;0.02, through single crystal anisotropy. The internal induction enhances SHG intensity by nine&#8208;fold and increases PLQY to 98.9%. This multi&#8208;path chirality transfer, based on a single chiral reagent, can significantly broaden the structural scope of functional chiral OIHMH materials and facilitate the regulation of chiroptoelectronic properties.

Combined in situ XAS and electrochemical characterizations reveal the structural rearrangement of carbon&#8208;supported Fe/Co/Ni single&#8208;atom catalysts during water oxidation. Our findings highlight the formation of dual metal active sites bridged by oxygen atoms during the reaction, providing key mechanistic insights into the identification of true active sites, which are crucial for advancing future research on this class of catalysts.








Abstract
Extensive research has been conducted on carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrochemical applications, owing to their outstanding conductivity and high metal atom utilization. The atomic dispersion of active sites provides an ideal platform to investigate the structure&#8211;performance correlations. Despite this, the development of straightforward and scalable synthesis methods, along with the tracking of the dynamic active sites under catalytic conditions, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we introduce a biomass&#8208;inspired coordination confinement strategy to construct a series of carbon&#8208;supported SACs, incorporating various metal elements, such as Fe, Co, and Ni. We have systematically characterized their electronic and geometric structure using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), atomic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses, it is demonstrated that the single atoms undergo structural rearrangement to form amorphous (oxy)hydroxide clusters during oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where the newly formed oxygen&#8208;bridged dual metal M&#9472;O&#9472;M or M&#9472;O&#9472;M&#8217; (M/M&#8217; = Fe, Co, Ni) moieties within these clusters play key role in the OER performance. This work provides essential insights into tracking the actual active sites of SACs during electrochemical OER.

         <title>Manipulation of Hydrogen Transfer Behaviors by RhCu Alloying Enables an All&#8208;in&#8208;one Sustainable &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; System</title>

         <dc:description>Nitrogen&#8208;oxysalts and biomass&#8208;derived&#8208;aldehydes are typical wastes mainly from industrialization and agriculturalization progresses, and their clean conversions are still very challenging for a green and sustainable future. Nevertheless, scant attention has been devoted to the core issues: the rational integration of two wastes recycling and the targeted manipulation of hydrogen (H*) transfer behaviors to address their sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we report an all&#8208;in&#8208;one electrochemical energy system that is thermodynamically designed by coupling nitrate reduction (NO3RR) and furfural oxidation reactions (FOR) together. Particularly, the poor kinetics for both electrode reactions are efficaciously optimized by the as&#8208;fabricated bifunctional electrocatalyst of RhCu alloy nanowires on copper foam (RhCu NW/CF) with highly improved dual&#8208;directional H*&#8208;modulation performances, thus initializing NO3RR for NH3 synthesis at +0.31 V vs. RHE and driving FOR for H2 harvest at an onset potential lower than 0 V. Eventually, such integrated &#8220;Furfural&#8208;Nitrate&#8221; system can simultaneously effectuate the electricity energy supply (10.76 mW cm&#8722;2), wastewater purification, cathodic hydrogen storage (NH3), anodic H2 production, and biomass upgrading, thereby generating economic benefits with multiple non&#8208;mixed valuable products. Hence, it provides a promising perspective of &#8220;turning waste into treasure&#8221; in a rational manner, justifying its all&#8208;in&#8208;one property in addressing the global challenge of sustainable energy.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Initial Coulombic Efficiency in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;based Cathodes by Tuning Orbital Hybridization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Li&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMO) are promising cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their high&#8208;capacity and low&#8208;cost merits. However, the low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and irreversible oxygen release of LRMO severely hinder their commercialization processes. Here, we employ glyoxal treatment to modulate the hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen (O) 2p orbitals in LRMO. This approach is found to reduce the Co/Mn t2g&#8208;O 2p hybridization in LRMO while simultaneously activating the Co2+/Co3+ redox below the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate that tuning TM 3d&#8208;O 2p orbital hybridization can be a viable approach to improve the ICE of LMRO. Specifically, the ICE of LRMO can be elevated from 85.3 % to 102.5 %, and a high specific capacity of 291.2 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 0.1 C. Moreover, the treated LRMO cathodes exhibit significantly enhanced capacity retention.</dc:description>

         <title>Valence Tautomerism and Alkaline Properties of Global Aromatic Imine&#8208; and Methine&#8208;Bridged All&#8208;Benzenoid Macrocyclic Superpyrazine and Supertriazine</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The comprehensive understanding of the ground&#8208;state electronic structures of all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles and their charged species, particularly those exhibiting global anti/aromaticity, remains poorly resolved. Here, we present two imine&#8208; and methine&#8208;bridged all&#8208;benzenoid [6]cyclo&#8208;para&#8208;phenylenes SPAZ (superpyrazine) and STAZ (supertriazine)&#8208;designed as &#960;&#8208;extended analogues of 1,4&#8208;pyrazine and 1,3,5&#8208;triazine, respectively. For first time, we elucidate their unprecedented valence tautomerism between a &#8220;super&#8208;kekul&#233;&#8221; alternating benzenoid/quinoidal structures and a &#8220;super&#8208;sextet&#8221; transient structure, mediated by a 30&#960; azaannulene conjugated pathway. The aromatic stabilization energy (ASE) for the formation of global aromatic delocalization would partially counterbalance the energy penalty for disrupting three benzenoid sextets. Further protonation studies demonstrate their alkaline characteristics (pKa = 0.97 for SPAZ; 3.27 for STAZ), with di&#8208;protonated SPAZ&#8208;DH and mono&#8208;protonated STAZ&#8208;MH adopting planarized geometries that amplify global aromaticity through charge&#8208;induced structural constraints and enhanced &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization. Remarkably, two&#8208;electron reduction generates a dianion SPAZ&#8208;DA exhibiting 32&#960; electron global antiaromaticity with amine N atom embedded aza[30]annulene pathway. These findings establish a framework for decoding electronic structure property relationships in all&#8208;benzenoid macrocycles, offering insights into aromaticity modulated regulations through tautomerism, protonation, and redox switching.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Migration&#8208;Pulling Polymer Electrolyte Design Strategy for Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries exhibit significant promise as safe, high&#8208;energy electrochemical storage technology, yet their performance remains constrained by polysulfide accumulation and exacerbated shuttle effects due to sluggish redox kinetics and inefficient charge transport. Here a dynamic migration&#8208;pulling strategy is proposed to accelerate polysulfide redox kinetics by dynamically restructuring the solvated structure of Li+, which is validated on a GPE incorporating boronic ester dynamic covalent bonds and polar side chains (BE&#8208;GPE). Theoretical calculations and experiments revealed that the desolvation barrier for Li+ is significantly reduced while the ligand groups were pulled out from the solvated shell assisted by the migration of dynamic covalent bonds. Rapid charge transfer kinetics are attainable via designed electrolyte. Consequently, BE&#8208;GPE based lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries delivered high reversible capacity of 1446 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C and long&#8208;term cycling stability with an average capacity decay of 0.04% during 1000 cycles at 0.5 C. The initial capacity at 0.5 C is up to 920 mAh g&#8208;1 and remains stable for 200 cycles at 0&#176;C. Successfully realized the energy storage of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries under low&#8208;temperature conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Defect&#8208;Triggered Orbital Hybridization in FeMn Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts Toward Sabatier&#8208;Optimized Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSAs), leveraging synergistic dual&#8208;site interactions, represent a promising frontier in electrocatalysis. However, the precise synthesis of dual&#8208;atom pairs and fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic structures remain significant challenges. Herein, we construct a defect&#8208;engineered heteronuclear FeMn&#8208;DSA anchored&#160;on a porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (FeMnDSA/dNC) through a customized trinuclear&#8208;defect trapping strategy. This defect modulation strategy effectively stabilizes dual atomic pairs while optimizing electronic structures to approach Sabatier's optimality, significantly boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance.&#160;The FeMnDSA/dNC achieves a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.921 V in alkaline media, with assembled zinc&#8208;air batteries demonstrating 291 mW cm&#8208;2 peak power density and stable charge/discharge cycling for over 500 h. Theoretical calculations reveal that defect&#8208;mediated coordination adjacent to Fe&#8208;Mn diatomic centers triggers charge redistribution, suppressing antibonding orbital populations while strengthening Fe 3dz2 with O 2p orbital hybridization. This modulation weakens O&#8208;O bonding through optimized *OOH adsorption configurations, thereby enhancing ORR kinetics. The present work provides valuable insights into the precise modulation and the underlying mechanisms of DSAs, advancing the design of electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Urea Electrosynthesis via Asymmetric Oxygen Vacancies in Zn&#8208;doped Fe2O3 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urea electrosynthesis from CO2 and nitrate (NO3&#8208;) provides an attractive pathway for storing renewable electricity and substitute traditional energy&#8208;intensive urea synthesis technology. However, the kinetics mismatching between CO2 reduction and NO3&#8208; reduction, as well as the difficulty of C&#8208;N coupling, are major challenges in urea electrosynthesis. Herein, we first calculated the free energy of *CO, *OCNO and *NOH formation over defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts with different metal dopants, which showed that Zn dopant was a promising candidate. Based on the theoretical study, we developed Zn&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich Fe2O3 catalysts (Zn&#8208;Fe2O3/OV) containing asymmetric Zn&#8208;OV&#8208;Fe sites. It exhibited an outstanding urea Faradaic efficiency of 62.4% and the remarkable recycling stability. The production rate of urea was as high as 7.48 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1, which is higher than most of the reported works up to date. Detailed control experiments and in situ spectroscopy analyses identified *OCNO as a crucial intermediate for C&#8208;N coupling. The Zn&#8208;Fe2O3/OV catalyst with asymmetric Zn&#8208;OV&#8208;Fe sites showed enhanced *CO coverage and promoted *OCNO formation, leading to high efficiency toward urea production.</dc:description>

         <title>Periodic Patterning of Matter in Non&#8208;Equilibrium Liesegang&#8208;Type Structures</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the self&#8208;organization of materials into Liesegang patterns. It examines their formation mechanisms, physicochemical properties, and occurrence across materials science, geology, and biology. It highlights their potential applications in electronics and environmental monitoring, as well as their role in providing insights into the origin of life.








Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;organization of unordered molecules into ordered, spatiotemporal patterns of complex structures through non&#8208;equilibrium reaction&#8211;diffusion (RD) processes is ubiquitous in nature across all scales. Unlike many RD processes that typically lead to transient patterns, periodic precipitation reactions governed by the Liesegang phenomenon are distinguished by the formation of stable, permanent structures. This unique characteristic makes them valuable tools in the development of hierarchical multifunctional materials, an area that has seen significant progress in recent decades. This review summarizes the fundamental aspects of the Liesegang phenomenon, focusing on the key characteristics, compositional features, inherent properties, and formation mechanisms of Liesegang patterns in chemical systems, while also highlighting their occurrence in biological and geological settings. We discuss recent advancements in applying periodic precipitation to address global challenges in microelectronics and environmental monitoring, concluding with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on the promising future applications of the Liesegang periodic precipitation in materials science, nanotechnology, medicine, and environmental engineering.

         <title>Bromide as Noninnocent Ligand to Iron Tames Fenton Chemistry for Chemoselective Nondegrading Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report for the first time that the bromide ion, acting as a non&#8208;N&#8208;ligand in iron complexes with the tridentate N&#8208;ligand bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BMPA), which is traditionally used in Fenton chemistry to degrade organic compounds, tames Fenton chemistry and enables chemo&#8208;selective, nondegrading oxidation reactions. This discovery of the bromide effect bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation, potentially inspiring further investigation into the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligands of iron complexes for new reactivity and applications. The overlooked inorganic anion may be exploited in other catalytic systems.








Abstract
It has long been the chemistry dogma that the nitrogen&#8208;based ligand of iron complexes determines the redox reactivity; tetra&#8208; and/or pentadentate nitrogen&#8208;based ligand (N&#8208;ligand: PDP, porphyrin, N4Py) enables chemo&#8208;selective oxidation through high&#8208;valent iron species (FeIV/V&#9552;O), while bi&#8208; and/or tridentate N&#8208;ligand leads to the generation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) (i.e., hydroxyl radical) via a Fenton chemistry pathway. The effect of inorganic anionic ligands (i.e., halides, pseudohalides, triflate, nitrate, sulfate, etc) of these iron complexes has rarely been examined and overlooked as an &#8220;innocent&#8221; anion. Herein, we report our discovery that bromide (Br&#8722;) is not an innocent ligand to the iron&#8208;BPMA complexes [BMPA: bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine] but a decisive factor for taming the Fenton chemistry (ROS) into a mild [HOBr] oxidant, which allows for chemo&#8208; and regioselective oxidation of furans, indoles, and sulfides without noticeable degradation. In contrast to the conventional Fenton chemistry pathway by many tridentate N&#8208;ligand iron complexes, our [Fe(BMPA)Br3] mimics haloperoxidases to generate HOBr by oxidation of bromide ion with hydrogen peroxide. The discovery of the bromide effect on iron complexes bridges the gap between Fenton chemistry and haloperoxidase&#8208;catalyzed halogenation and might stimulate interest in reinvestigating the &#8220;innocent&#8221; ligand of iron complexes for discovery of new reactivity and new applications. Additionally, the new catalytic system represents a mild and green oxidation method that might be useful in academia and industry.

         <title>Interfacial Atom Rearrangement Drives Potential&#8208;Adaptive Electrocatalytic Olefin Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY, establishing a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, generating high&#8208;density active sites, and realizing excellent olefin hydrogenation performances in aqueous media.








Abstract
Dynamic rearrangement of metal atoms at heterointerfaces by chemical bond conversion drives high efficiency electrocatalytic processes, which is a new concept in the field of electrocatalysis and a new discovery to directly improve catalytic activity. It is of great significance to explore transformative catalytic systems that directly control the interfacial structure and function of atomic composition. As an emerging 2D carbon allotrope featuring unique sp&#8208;sp2 co&#8208;hybridization, graphdiyne (GDY) offers unprecedented advantages for heterointerface engineering. In particular, the uneven surface charge distribution of GDY, high distribution of active sites and customizable electronic structures provide unprecedented opportunities for the development of a new generation of catalytic systems. Here, we report a new idea to directly control the cooperative growth and drive metal atomic rearrangement on the interface of GDY/NiPd/GDY. The results of atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy characterization revealed two unique interfacial phenomena: i) GDY&#8208;induced massive dislocation formation within NiPd nanoalloys and ii) rearrangement of surface metal atoms from (111) to (200) facets. Detailed spectroscopic analysis further demonstrated the composition&#8208;dependent evolution of elemental valence states and stoichiometric ratios. This atomic&#8208;level restructuring establishes a charge&#8208;redistribution network featuring non&#8208;integer charge transfer, which improves the overall conductivity and intrinsic activity. What is even more encouraging is that this electrocatalytic olefin hydrogenation is carried out in an aqueous solution. The GDY/NiPd/GDY heterostructure achieves exceptional activity (turnover frequency: 6.8&#160;s&#8722;1), stability (&gt;5 cycles), and chemo&#8208;selectivity (&#8722;100%), which is superior to traditional catalysts.

         <title>Structures of Polyhydroxyalkanoate Synthase PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, Producing Biodegradable Plastics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PHA synthase (PhaC) is the key enzyme in the polymerization of a biodegradable plastic&#8212;polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA). Structures of full&#8208;length PhaC reveal three key regions essential for substrate specificity and polymerization. Additionally, this study also highlights the critical role of N&#8208;domain&#8208;dependent dimerization in PhaC activity. These findings provide a foundation for enzyme engineering to enhance bioplastic production.








Abstract
Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a biodegradable polyester that can serve as a promising alternative to petrochemical plastics, which present a serious source of pollution. PHA synthase (PhaC) is a key enzyme responsible for producing a wide variety of PHAs in microorganisms. Here, we present crystal structures of full&#8208;length PhaC from Aeromonas caviae, a high&#8208;performance PhaC employed for industrial use. The structure reveals an N&#8208;terminal helical domain that mediates head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimerization and stabilizes the C&#8208;terminal &#945;/&#946; catalytic domain to form a tunnel that connects the catalytic center embedded inside the protein to the protein surface. We showed that this tunnel is a putative egress tunnel for the product PHA chain. Our results establish a fundamental understanding of the PhaC machinery that should lead to improvement of this enzyme in industrial applications.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Isodaphlongamine H by Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive [3+2] Cycloaddition of N&#8208;Hydroxylactam</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total synthesis of isodaphlongamine H based on a lactam strategy, which enables quick access to complex cyclic amines, is described. The strategy begins with alkylation of a chiral lactam and subsequent N&#8208;oxidation via an imino ether to afford the N&#8208;hydroxylactam. For the key transformation to functionalize the amide carbonyl, an iridium&#8208;catalyzed reductive [3+2] cycloaddition of the N&#8208;hydroxylactam provides a tricyclic isoxazolidine in a one&#8208;pot process. After the coupling reaction with an allylic silane fragment, the total synthesis is accomplished through intramolecular Hosomi&#8208;Sakurai allylation to construct a pentacyclic core. The deoxygenated pentacyclic intermediate shows higher cytotoxicity against HeLa and U937 cell lines than isodaphlongamine H, and might become a lead compound for further biological study.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Decarboxylative Acylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Acids with Carboxylic Acids via Photoredox/Nickel Dual Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;driven decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling has emerged as a pivotal platform for constructing C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) bonds in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry. However, using two structurally dissimilar carboxylic acids as a feedstock to form chiral &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones remains a considerable challenge due to side reactions such as decarboxylative reduction and homo&#8208;coupling. Herein, we report for the first time a photoredox/nickel dual&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative acylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid derivatives and aliphatic carboxylic acids, enabling efficient access to enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;oxygenated ketones. This method exhibits a broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, high chemoselectivity, and excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% e.e.). The advantage of this reaction is that it eliminates the need for metal reductants and the use of precious metal photocatalysts and utilizes renewable feedstocks. The use of a coiled&#8208;tube continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor can shorten the illumination time by half and obtain results comparable to those of a batch reaction. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic experiments support a pathway in which photocatalytic decarboxylation generates &#945;&#8208;oxy alkyl radical species, and the Ni(I)&#8208;alkyl intermediate activates the in situ&#8208;formed mixed anhydride followed by reductive elimination to give the product in enantiomerically pure form.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilic Germylation of Stable &#960; Bonds via Ge&#8211;Ge Bond Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organogermanes have recently attracted a great deal of attention as building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive products, drugs, and functional materials. Metallo&#8208;germyls were classically synthesized and employed for nucleophilic germylation to form C&#8211;Ge bonds. However, their syntheses require highly reactive organometal reagents, and the scope of germylations involving metallo&#8208;germyls is limited due to competition with kinetically favoured side reactions. Here, we present a regio/stereo&#8208;convergent nucleophilic germylation of stable &#960; bonds by germyl anion generated in situ via heterolytic cleavage of the Ge&#8211;Ge bond of digermane (Ge&#8211;Ge) in the presence of KOtBu. This methodology affords unprecedented reactivity, enabling multiple germylation of alkynes and internally selective germylation of alkenes. These reactions are operationally simple, have broad functional group tolerance, and afford densely functionalized aliphatic organogermanes, such as 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;1&#8208;germylalkanes, 1,1&#8208;digermylalkanes, and 1,1,1&#8208;trigermylalkanes, without any catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Evoking Simultaneous Ferroptosis and Apoptosis by a Dual&#8208;Locked Platinum (IV) Prodrug for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutics have revolutionized cancer treatment, their clinical potential is limited by off&#8208;target toxicity and restricted anti&#8208;tumor mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a dual&#8208;locked Pt(IV) prodrug designed for tumor&#8208;specific activation, combining platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy with TLR7/8&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. The prodrug features a &#947;&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;caged TLR7/8 agonist as an axial ligand, enabling sequential activation by elevated glutathione (GSH) and &#947;&#8208;glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) in the tumor microenvironment. Reduction of the Pt(IV) core releases cisplatin and depletes intracellular reductants, amplifying reactive oxygen species to trigger synergistic ferroptosis and apoptosis. Concurrently, GGT&#8208;cleaved axial ligand activates tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells, repolarizing immunosuppressive M2&#8208;like macrophages to pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;like phenotypes while recruiting effector and memory T cells. In murine models, the Pt(IV) prodrug demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy by confining immune activation to malignant tissues, eradicating primary tumors, and establishing durable protective immunity against recurrence. This spatiotemporally controlled dual&#8208;release strategy minimizes systemic toxicity while synergizing chemotherapy and immunotherapy, offering a transformative approach for targeted cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanosensitive Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Visualizing Temporal Changes in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane&#8208;intercalating conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;spanning molecules that serve as fluorescent dyes for bioimaging. However, COE emission has thus far only been capable of visualizing dye location and their preferential accumulation in different membrane&#8208;bound intracellular compartments. Herein, we report the first example of environmentally&#8208;sensitive COEs for visualizing temporal changes in live cells, providing information on the physical properties of intracellular lipid bilayer membranes. The new COE&#8208;BY series is designed around a BODIPY central unit with a membrane&#8208;spanning topology and six cationic pendant groups ensuring solubility in aqueous media. These reporters feature high two&#8208;photon absorption cross section, NIR&#8208;II excitation capabilities under multiphoton excitation, and high dye brightness; all highly desirable photophysical features for bioimaging. The emission lifetime of the probes was sensitive to changes to both the lipid composition of model vesicle systems and membrane tension within cells, induced by either mechanical or osmotic stress. Using two&#8208;photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it is possible to use the most efficient emitter, namely COE&#8208;BYPhOC4, to image changes in the mechanical properties of intracellular membranes. We show that these COEs remain stably vesicle&#8208;bound within the endolysosomal pathway over extended periods, allowing for long&#8208;term monitoring of the associated biophysical changes of these vesicles over time.</dc:description>

         <title>Tri&#8208;coordinated Boron Species in Confined Boron Oxide Catalysts for Enhanced Low&#8208;temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron&#8208;based catalysts exhibit great potential for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to produce olefins. The straightforward systhesis of confined boron&#8208;based catalyst commonly using H3BO3 is intractable because of its abundant hydroxyl groups easily interacting with the supports in a spatially nonselective manner. Herein, we managed to construct a confined BOx@SiO2 catalyst showing an impressive low&#8208;temperature (400 &#176;C) activity. This catalyst was prepared via the encapsulation of BN nanosheets by SiO2 shell, and subsequent oxidization steps. The in situ generated boron&#8208;oxygen species were anchored to silica shells via B&#8722;O&#8722;Si and hydrogen bonds. BOx@SiO2 exhibited a unique catalytic behavior of propane conversion uprush, increasing from 5.3% at 410 &#176;C to 28.4% at 424.6 &#176;C for ODHP reaction. That was attributed to the efficient activation of propane triggered by the newly formed tri&#8208;coordinated B&#8722;OH (B[3]a and B[3]b) active sites from the dispersion of molten BOx species in confined SiO2. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed that in the confined structure, the bond angle of O&#8722;B&#8722;O and B&#8722;O&#8722;B and system disorder of BOx species increased significantly on molten state, favoring the dispersion of BOx species and formation of B&#8722;OH groups, which drove the uprush of propane conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Dihydrophenazine Derived Pd6L12 Cage: Self&#8208;Assembly, Polyradical Cations, and Lithium Battery Cathode Application</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we present the self&#8208;assembly of a dihydrophenazine&#8208;based Pd6L12&#8208;type coordination cage 1 showing excellent redox activity and demonstrate the use as the cathode for lithium batteries. The structure of cage 1 was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The excellent reversible redox performance of 1 and its electrochromic properties induced by radical species were systematically characterized using in&#8208;situ UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and EPR spectroelectrochemistry. Notably, a highly stable radical cationic species 112&#8226;+, containing 12 radical cations, was successfully obtained through the chemical oxidation of 1, and its single&#8208;crystal structure was resolved. The excellent redox properties of 1 enable its application as a cathode material for lithium batteries. The 1|Li cell exhibited good cycling stability, nearly 100% coulombic efficiency, and an initial discharge capacity of 84 mAh g&#8722;1 within a voltage range of 2.5&#8211;4.0 V. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ two&#8208;dimensional EPR experiments on lithium batteries visually revealed the excellent cycling stability of the 1&#8208;based cathode material and its reversible two&#8208;step electron transfer process. This study provides important insights into the design, synthesis, and properties of functionalized redox&#8208;active coordination cages, offering a reference for their application in energy storage and functional materials research.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The atomic position of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides has been a long&#8208;standing structural question in inorganic chemistry given that hydride delivery is integral to diverse chemical reactions. Microcrystal electron diffraction (microED), with it&#8217;s increased sensitivity towards hydrogen atoms relative to X&#8208;ray diffraction, offers a potential path to addressing this challenge. Herein, the first microED study of Stryker&#8217;s reagent is reported, resulting in the structure of a new benzene solvate.&#160;&#160;Improved accuracy for hydrogen atom positions was obtained via a quantum crystallography (QCr) approach, Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR). Structural and topological analysis supports edge bridging hydrides in the microED structure of a THF solvate form, consistent with previous diffraction studies. Interestingly, analysis of a new benzene solvate, discovered in this study, is consistent with mixed edge&#8208; and face&#8208;bridging hydrides.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Aldehyde&#8208;Copper&#8208;Iridium Catalysis Enables Stereodivergent Allylation via &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H Functionalization of Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Chiral primary amines are recognized as one of the most valuable and versatile synthetic intermediates, widely utilized in the construction of diverse amine&#8208;containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. The direct asymmetric &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of unprotected primary amines is the most straightforward method for creating these motifs. However, this transformation remains underdeveloped, particularly in stereodivergent synthesis of primary amines with multiple stereocenters. Herein, we report an aldehyde/copper/iridium ternary catalytic system, which was successfully employed for the direct enantio&#8208; and diastereodivergent &#945;&#8208;allylation of primary &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;chromanone without requiring additional protection or activation of the NH2 group. A wide range of &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines bearing vicinal stereocenters were prepared in high yields with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &gt;20:1 dr and &gt;99% ee). Notably, all four stereoisomers of the &#945;&#8208;tertiary amines can be readily prepared by simply switching the configuration combinations of the two chiral metal catalysts. Furthermore, the asymmetric induction model for the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization of primary amines was meticulously elucidated through comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Visualization Analysis of Covalent and Noncovalent Interactions in Real Space</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the types and locations of interactions between atoms or molecules within a chemical system is a fundamental concern in chemistry. In the field of theoretical and computational chemistry, wavefunction analysis offers various methods based on functions defined in three&#8208;dimensional real space, enabling the visual representation of both covalent and noncovalent interactions. These methods provide researchers with an intuitive understanding of molecular interactions and are gaining increasing attention. This review systematically introduces various widely adopted and distinctive visualization methods, such as the noncovalent interaction (NCI) method, the independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition of molecular density (IGMH), the interaction region indicator (IRI), the electrostatic potential (ESP), the electron localization function (ELF), and deformation density. Additionally, numerous application examples are provided to help readers recognize the significant practical value of these methods. Also the computer program Multiwfn, which effectively implemented all the introduced methods, is briefly mentioned.</dc:description>

         <title>Dopant And Exfoliation Induced Simultaneous Modification Of Charge Density And C&#8208;C Coupling Sites For Efficient CO2 Photoreduction To Ethylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemical conversion of CO2 into C2+ products has emerged as an attractive method for synthesizing valuable chemicals and fuels using abundant solar energy. However, the challenge lies in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation. In this study, we employed a heteroatom doping strategy to optimize the photocatalytic parameters and achieve excellent efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ product formation. Our experimental analysis revealed that the local electronic structure of the catalyst, modified by In&#8208;doping, enables enhanced efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of Cu facilitates the coupling of C1 intermediates, resulting in excellent selectivity towards C2+ products. The CO2 reduction performance is further enhanced through exfoliation, which increases the exposure of active sites and extends the charge carrier lifetime by reducing the charge diffusion length. We report that the rate of formation of C2H4 reached 54.3 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8208;1&#183;g&#8208;1 with an outstanding selectivity of 91% over the exfoliated CuIn&#8208;doped ABPS catalyst. By elucidating the role of heteroatom doping and exfoliation in enhancing both the efficiency and selectivity of C2+ product formation, our study contributes to advancing the development of sustainable and efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion technologies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Despite its widely appreciated significance, most research on mental health is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. This contribution intends to enhance discussion between those disciplines and the STEM field by pointing toward relevant studies, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.








Abstract
In recent years, an increasing number of articles have outlined the mental health crisis in academia. Despite its widely appreciated significance, most of the related research is published in journals focusing on education, social science, psychology, or psychiatry. Despite stakeholders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) being disproportionately affected, they are often left in the dark about important findings unless they seek out relevant information themselves. This contribution attempts to spark interdisciplinary discussion between psychology, psychiatry, and STEM by highlighting relevant research, advocating for increased knowledge on mental health, and elaborating on what benefits improved mental health literacy could have for both the individual and the academic system in its entirety.

A spiro&#8208;conformation&#8208;driven neutral ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)2], is reported by Zi&#8208;Yi Du, Weizhao Cai, Rui&#8208;Kang Huang, and co&#8208;workers in their Communication (e202500027). This material features dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive phase transitions: a thermally activated ferroelectric transition via spiro&#8208;conformational flipping and a pressure&#8208;induced transition arising from helical chain deformation. This study showcases a rare example of a multi&#8208;responsive neutral ferroelectric system, advancing the design of molecular ferroelectrics via unconventional stimulus&#8211;response mechanisms.

         <title>Merging Hydrogen&#8208;Atom&#8208;Transfer and the Truce&#8208;Smiles Rearrangement for Synthesis of &#946;&#8208;Arylethylamines from Unactivated Allylsulfonamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, photoinduced radical hydroarylation of unactivated N&#8208;allylamine derivatives is reported for the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that ipso attack is more favourable than ortho attack when one of the ortho positions at the aromatic group attached to sulfur was blocked.








Abstract
Arylethylamines are crucial elements in pharmaceutical molecules, making methods for their synthesis highly significant. The Truce&#8211;Smiles rearrangement is a well&#8208;developed strategy to synthesize arylethylamine motifs via aryl migration. However, most examples require amide substrates to activate the alkene to attack by a radical precursor. This strategy both limits the product scope to amide&#8208;containing compounds as well as necessitating the incorporation of specific functional groups arising from the initial radical addition. In this work, we overcome these limitations, delivering a hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer from a cobalt catalyst to unactivated alkenes to yield &#946;&#8208;arylethylamines with simple alkyl chains. DFT studies reveal that increasing the steric hindrance in at least one of the ortho positions on the migrating aromatic group promotes ipso over ortho addition, a selectivity that contrasts with previous methods.

An iron&#8208;based catalytic system can act as an efficient and selective tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s, followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide, providing direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. The study emphasizes the potential for chemical recycling, making these materials environmentally friendly and suitable for various applications.








Abstract
A shift from petrochemical feedstocks to renewable resources has the potential to address some of the environmental concerns associated with petrochemical extraction, thereby making the production of plastics a sustainable process. Consequently, there is a growing interest in the development of selective techniques for the conversion of abundant renewable feedstocks into environmentally friendly polymers. We present a one&#8208;pot iron&#8208;based catalytic system, which is active, efficient, and selective under mild conditions for producing of renewable copolymers. We demonstrate that this system can function as a tandem catalyst for the production of poly(silylether)s (PSEs), followed by the ring&#8208;opening polymerization of lactide. This effective approach provides direct access to novel thermally stable copolymers. Furthermore, we detail the quantitative chemical recycling of such copolymers, underscoring their potential as new environmentally friendly materials.

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Ethylene&#8211;Acrylate Copolymers Synthesized with Highly Active Neutral Nickel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers are directly synthesized with outstanding catalytic activities using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component nickel catalyst, which maintain the essential bulk properties of UHMWPE, reach an impressive tensile strength of 44&#160;MPa, and possess improved surface and dyeing properties.








Abstract
Molecular weight is a crucial parameter in catalytic olefin polymerization to determine the thermomechanical properties of polymers. Elevating the molecular weight of ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymer, a typical polar polyolefin has been a persistent challenge. This study presents the direct synthesis of ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW) ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers using a highly active, neutral, single&#8208;component phosphine&#8208;phenolate nickel catalyst under mild conditions. The coordination&#8208;insertion copolymerization of ethylene and various acrylates, such as methyl acrylate, n&#8208;butyl acrylate, and t&#8208;butyl acrylate, can yield ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers with UHMWs (Mn) ranging from 1000 to 2700&#160;kDa, with exceptional activities of up to 4.03&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. A relatively large&#8208;scale synthesis (30&#8211;50&#160;g) of UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers was notably achieved. The properties of these UHMW ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers were comprehensively evaluated, demonstrating that these copolymers retained the bulk properties of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) while exhibiting improved surface and dyeing properties. In particular, the tensile strength of the ethylene&#8211;acrylate copolymers significantly increased with higher molecular weights, reaching 44&#160;MPa (147&#160;MPa after a predrawing ratio of 3.1), which is comparable to that of UHMWPE.

         <title>Singlet&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Driven Cooperative Photocatalytic Coupling of Biomass Valorization and Hydrogen Peroxide Production Using Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel singlet oxygen&#8208;promote photocatalysis on COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 couples biomass valorization with H2O2 production, diverging from traditional H2O2 photocatalysis, which relies on photoexcited electrons and holes. Herein, singlet oxygen consumes most electron&#8211;hole pairs, facilitating an Achmatowicz rearrangement with furfuryl alcohol. This yields high&#8208;value pyranones and H2O2, surpassing traditional products by 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude in market value.








Abstract
Traditional H2O2 photocatalysis primarily depends on photoexcited electrons and holes to drive oxygen reduction and water oxidation, respectively. However, singlet oxygen (1O2), often underappreciated, plays a pivotal role in H2O2 production. Meanwhile, photocatalytic biomass conversion has attracted attention, yet studies combining H2O2 synthesis with biomass valorization remain rare and typically yield low&#8208;value products. Herein, a strategy of photocatalytic valorization of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) coupled with the efficient co&#8208;production of H2O2 is reported, enabled by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) induced, 1O2&#8208;participated Achmatowicz rearrangement. This study introduces polyimide&#8208;based COF&#8208;N0&#8208;3 with tailored nitrogen content, representing an unprecedently efficient platform for 1O2 production. Remarkably, reducing the nitrogen content of the COF enhances 1O2 production, significantly boosting the H2O2 generation rate. In FFA, the primary pathway for H2O2 production is Achmatowicz rearrangement, achieving a rate ten times higher than that reliant on oxygen reduction reaction in pure water, reaching 4549 &#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185;. Mechanism studies revealed 1O2 selectively engaged FFA, bypassing hole oxidation to trigger the Achmatowicz rearrangement, producing valuable 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;(2H)&#8208;pyranone with 99% conversion and 92% selectivity. This work establishes a coupling strategy for simultaneous synthesis of H2O2 and biochemicals, offering a transformative approach to sustainable photocatalysis.

         <title>Targeted Degradation of ZBP1 with Covalent PROTACs for Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Treatment of Infections</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a covalent PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) was developed to achieve precise and efficient degradation of ZBP1 by leveraging DNA aptamer targeting and NASA&#8208;mediated covalent binding. This approach suppresses necroptosis and mitigates inflammation, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for infection&#8208;induced inflammation and diseases. The findings highlight the potential of targeted protein degradation in modulating inflammatory responses and advancing treatment options.








Abstract
Z&#8208;DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) has emerged as a critical pathogen&#8208;sensing protein that upon activation, triggers necroptotic signaling cascades, leading to a potent inflammatory response and potentially causing significant tissue damage. However, available drugs specifically developed for the effective inhibition or degradation of ZBP1 is still lacking so far. In this study, we developed a potent covalent recognition&#8208;based PROTAC (C&#8208;PROTAC) molecule for the degradation of ZBP1. It consists of a DNA aptamer as the recognition moiety and an E3 enzyme&#8208;recruiting unit, connected by a linker containing N&#8208;acyl&#8208;N&#8208;alkyl sulfonamides (NASA) groups. The DNA aptamer specifically binds to ZBP1, while the NASA&#8208;containing linker facilitates the formation of a covalent bond between the PROTAC and the target protein. The E3 ligase&#8208;recruiting unit then directs the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system to degrade the ZBP1&#8208;PROTAC complex. This approach combines the high specificity of DNA aptamers with the efficiency of covalent binding and the degradation&#8208;inducing capabilities of PROTACs, providing a powerful tool for targeted protein degradation. The successful application of this technology to ZBP1 highlights its potential for the selective elimination of disease&#8208;associated proteins and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Elucidating Relay Catalysis on Copper Clusters With Satellite Single Atoms for Enhanced Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

In the relay catalysis for urea electrosynthesis on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC, &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites convert NO3&#8722; to *NOx, and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites promote water dissociation, yielding *H for *NOx hydrogenation. The resultant *NH2 then couples with *CO2 activated by &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites, facilitating an efficient cascade catalysis for urea production. This process highlights the synergy between &#8220;CuAC&#8221; and &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites in enhancing catalytic performance.








Abstract
Relay catalysis represents significant efficacy in alleviating competition among different reactants during coupling reactions. However, a comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism underlying relay catalysis for the urea electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, we have developed a catalyst (CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC) comprising Cu atomic clusters (CuAC) with satellite Cu&#9472;N4 single atoms (CuSA) sites on the nitrogen&#8208;doped porous interconnected carbon skeleton (NC), enabling elucidation of a relay catalysis process for co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;. The designed CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC catalyst exhibits an approximately threefold higher urea yield rate compared to that of CuSA@NC at&#160;&#8722;1.3&#160;V versus RHE. Ex&#8208;situ experimental results and in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy analysis reveal a formation sequence between the *NH2 and *NH2CO species on CuAC&#8208;CuSA@NC with increasing reduction potential. The combination of theoretical calculations further elucidates that the relay catalysis pathway involves &#8220;CuAC&#8221; sites facilitating the conversion of *NO3 to *NOx, followed by a hydrogenation process to form *NH2 with *H from water dissociation promoted by &#8220;CuSA&#8221; sites, which subsequently couples with *CO2 to produce urea. This work provides novel insights into the investigation of coupling reactions, but not limit to, urea synthesis.

         <title>Mechanochemically Enabled Formal Reductive Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Between Aryl Ethers and Aryl Fluorides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents are essential in modern synthetic chemistry. This study investigates a novel nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling between aryl ethers and aryl fluorides. The method is characterized by mild conditions, short reaction times, and the production of a range of aryl coupling compounds with high yields. Mechanistic studies show that nickel is involved in the activation of both C&#9472;O and C&#9472;F bonds.








Abstract
Reductive cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving two electrophilic reagents have become increasingly important in modern synthetic chemistry. Previous studies have investigated electrophilic reagents featuring zero or one inactive bond; however, reactions involving electrophilic reagents with two inactive bonds remain unexplored. This study presents the first nickel&#8208;catalyzed reductive cross&#8208;coupling reaction under mechanical conditions, involving aryl ethers and aryl fluorides, both of which contain inactive bonds. The reaction successfully synthesized a series of multifunctional biphenyl compounds, specifically including several sparingly soluble substrates that are challenging to prepare in a solvent system. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that nickel and magnesium play a crucial role in the activation of C&#9472;F bonds. This novel coupling reaction offers a beneficial approach for polymer degradation and the development of luminescent materials.

         <title>Photo&#8208;RAFT Polymerization Under Microwatt Irradiation via Unimolecular Photoinduced Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization significantly enhances the reactivity of acidic CTAs with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts, enabling polymerization under low light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). This approach outperforms traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently. Mechanistic studies suggest base addition shifts activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.








Abstract
Photoinduced radical addition fragmentation chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization typically requires high light intensity (&gt;5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), limiting energy efficiency, and scalability. We demonstrate that adding a base to PET&#8208;RAFT systems drastically enhances the reactivity of acidic chain transfer agents (CTAs) with Zn&#8208;based photocatalysts (Zn porphyrin and Zn phthalocyanine). This approach enables complete polymerization under microwatt light intensity (0.25&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), a significant improvement over traditional PET&#8208;RAFT, which showed no conversion under the same conditions. Both acrylates and methacrylates polymerized efficiently with excellent chain&#8208;end fidelity. Reactivity was triggered chemically (via base addition) or electrochemically (via electrolytic reduction). Mechanistic studies reveal that base addition promotes a CTA&#8208;Zn photocatalyst complex, shifting the activation from bimolecular to more efficient unimolecular PET&#8208;RAFT.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Degradation of Polycaprolactone into Adipic Acids over Pt/TiO2 in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot strategy is presented to achieve upcycling of polycaprolactone (PCL) to adipic acid (AA) using Pt/TiO2 as a catalyst in water with [BMIm][NTf2] via hydrolysis of PCL and subsequent oxidation, achieving complete conversion of PCL with an AA yield of 85.60%.








Abstract
Upgrading polyester waste into high value&#8208;added chemicals can achieve carbon recycling, which is of great significance for sustainable development. Herein, we report a one&#8208;pot protocol to oxidatively degrade polycaprolactone (PCL) with air into adipic acid (AA) mediated by ionic liquid (IL, e.g., 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [BMIm][NTf2]) in water. In this protocol, IL catalyzes the hydrolysis of PCL into 6&#8208;hydroxyhexanoic acid (6&#8208;HHA) and further mediates the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA into AA over TiO2&#8208;supported Pt nanocatalysts, reaching the highest AA yield of 85.6% under relatively mild conditions (140&#160;&#176;C, 1.5&#160;MPa). Mechanism investigation indicates that both O2&#8226;&#8211; and &#8226;OH derived from oxygen and water are involved in the oxidation of 6&#8208;HHA to form 6&#8208;oxohexanoic acid via two pathways, which further convert into AA. The IL inhibits the overoxidation of AA, thus leading to a high selectivity toward AA. This protocol provides a green and feasible way to degrade PCL and also to access AA.

Nontypical sugars represent a prominent, yet hardly, accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. Here, we disclose a technology toward non&#8208;typical sugars that allows facile, and site&#8208;selective functionalization of native sugars. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant carbohydrates.








Abstract
Non&#8208;typical C&#8208;functionalized sugars represent a prominent yet hardly accessible class of biologically&#8208;active compounds. The available synthetic methodologies toward such sugar derivatives suffer either from an extensive use of protecting groups, requiring long and laborious synthetic manipulations, or from limited predictability and noncontrollable site&#8208;selectivity of the employed C&#8208;functionalization reactions. In this work, we disclose an alternative synthetic methodology toward nontypical sugars that allows facile, site&#8208;selective, and stereocontrolled C&#8208;functionalization of sugars through a traceless tethering approach. The described silyl&#8208;based redox&#8208;active tethering group appends directly to the unprotected sugar substrate and mediates the C&#8208;functionalization reaction through a photochemically&#8208;promoted 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism, while transforming into a readily&#8208;removable silyl protecting group. The protocol is compatible with a variety of unprotected carbohydrate substrates featuring sensitive aglycons and a diverse set of coupling partners, providing a straightforward and scalable route to pharmaceutically relevant C&#8208;functionalized carbohydrate conjugates.

         <title>Identifying Key Properties That Drive Redox Mediator Activity in Lactiplantibacillus Plantarum</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of structurally diverse quinones led to defining key physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions that drive type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2)&#8208;dependent extracellular electron transfer activity in Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. Analysis of lead quinones in bioelectrochemical systems revealed that the amine&#8208;containing compounds can produce stable current profiles for up to 5 days.








Abstract
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is known to utilize exogenous small molecule quinone mediators to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), allowing it to produce a detectable current in a bioelectrochemical system (BES). Utilization of quinone mediators by L. plantarum requires a type&#8208;II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2); however, structural variations in the core of 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone EET mediators have shown to yield significantly different current outputs. Herein, we assembled a library of 40 quinone&#8208;based EET mediators to probe the important physicochemical properties and biochemical interactions responsible for Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET in L. plantarum. The library was designed with inspiration from naturally occurring metabolites, and assembly was focused on structural modifications that diversified polarity, reduction potential, and predicted free energy of binding to Ndh2 (&#916;Gcomp), as these properties are hypothesized to drive EET activity. In general, Ndh2&#8208;dependent EET activity in an iron(III) nanoparticle reduction assay significantly correlates to the mediator's polarity and &#916;Gcomp. Five mediators were analyzed in BESs with L. plantarum, and each generated Ndh2&#8208;dependent current over background signal. Importantly, an amine&#8208;containing mediator yielded incredibly stable current output over the course of the experiment (up to 5 days). These findings improve our understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships for quinone&#8208;mediated EET and provide stable mediators for bioelectronic sensing applications.

         <title>Homologation of Alkenes Using Acetylene as a C2 Feedstock</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general method for the homologation of alkenes that employs acetylene as a C&#8322; feedstock and proceeds via an alkyl borane intermediate has been developed. Commercially available but expensive and unavailable alkenes can be synthesized by this methodology from their C&#8322; shorter homologues, which can be much less expensive. A variety of functional groups and a series of alkene substitution patterns were tolerated, and a chain length increase of up to twelve carbon atoms was achieved by iterative homologation.








Abstract
The preparation of diverse homologs from lead compounds has been a common and important practice in medicinal, mechano, polymeric, and many other branches of chemistry. The homologation of alkenes, though important, remains challenging due to the difficulty of (CH2)n insertion into the main carbon chain of alkenes compared to chains containing other polar functional groups. Here, we report the homologation of both terminal and internal alkenes by using acetylene as a cheap and abundant C2 feedstock. The process involves an in&#8208;situ transformation of alkenes into boranes and then into elongated alkenes, during which direct (CH2)n insertion is avoided. The reaction can be carried out iteratively to achieve up to a 12&#8208;carbon elongation.

         <title>Isoselenourea&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Pyrazolo&#8208;Heterocycle Synthesis Enabled by Self&#8208;Correcting Amide and Ester Acylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly enantioselective isoselenourea catalyzed route to fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridone and &#8208;pyranone heterocycles has been developed. Mechanistic and computational studies highlight the significance of an intermediate amide or ester product derived from 1,2&#8208;addition that can be diverted to the desired pathway through isoselenourea acylation.








Abstract
Pyrazole heterocycles are prevalent in a wide range of medicinal and agrochemical compounds, and as such, the development of methods for their enantioselective incorporation into molecular scaffolds is highly desirable. This manuscript describes the effective formation of fused pyrazolo&#8208;pyridones and &#8208;pyranones in high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er) via an isoselenourea (HyperSe) catalyzed enantioselective [3&#160;+&#160;3]&#8208;Michael addition&#8208;cyclization process using readily available pyrazolylsulfonamides or pyrazolones as pronucleophiles and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated anhydrides as starting materials. Mechanistic analysis indicates an unusual self&#8208;correcting reaction pathway involving preferential [1,2]&#8208;addition of the pronucleophile to initially generate an intermediate amide or ester that can be intercepted by isoselenourea acylation, leading to productive formation of the fused heterocyclic products with high enantiocontrol. The scope and limitations of this process are developed across a range of examples, with insight into the factors leading to the observed enantioselectivity provided by density functional theory (DFT) analysis.

         <title>Cleavable Strand&#8208;Fusing Cross&#8208;Linkers as Additives for Chemically Deconstructable Thermosets with Preserved Thermomechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report cleavable &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs) as additives for polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets. During polymerization, SFCs fuse two network strands at four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;links and thereby achieve network dissolution at very low loadings without compromising thermomechanical properties. SFCs perform similarly under oven curing and frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions.








Abstract
Permanently cross&#8208;linked polymer networks&#8212;thermosets&#8212;are often difficult to chemically deconstruct. The installation of cleavable bonds into the strands of thermosets using cleavable comonomers as additives can facilitate thermoset deconstruction without replacement of permanent cross&#8208;links, but such monomers can lead to reduced thermomechanical properties and require high loadings to function effectively, motivating the design of new and optimal cleavable additives. Here, we introduce &#8220;strand&#8208;fusing cross&#8208;linkers&#8221; (SFCs), which fuse two network strands via a four&#8208;way cleavable cross&#8208;link. SFCs enable deconstruction of model polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) thermosets with as little as one&#8208;fifth of the molar loading needed to achieve deconstruction using traditional cleavable comonomers. SFCs function under traditional oven curing as well as low&#8208;energy frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) conditions and lead to improved thermomechanical properties, for example, glass transition temperatures, compared to prior cleavable comonomer designs. This work motivates the development of increasingly improved cleavable additives to enable thermoset deconstruction without compromising material performance.

This work motivates the development of increasingly improved cleavable additives to enable thermoset deconstruction without compromising material performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ High Selectivity Contact&#8208;Electroreduction of CO2 to Methanol Using an Imine&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8208;Free Vitrimer Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vitrimer catalyst with C&#9552;N bond enables efficient CO2 reduction via contact&#8208;electrocatalysis, driven by water droplet&#8208;induced charges. Imine groups stabilize CO2 adsorption, enrich electrons, and mediate electron transfer, achieving &gt;90% methanol selectivity. The system demonstrates exceptional stability, recyclability, and sustained catalysis, offering a sustainable pathway for CO2 conversion to methanol.








Abstract
Metal catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) face challenges such as high cost, limited durability, and environmental impact. Although various structurally diverse and functional metal&#8208;free catalysts have been developed, they often suffer from slow kinetics, low selectivity, and nonrecyclability, significantly limiting their practical applications. In this study, we introduce a recyclable nonmetallic polymer material (vitrimer) as a catalyst for a new platform in contact&#8208;electrocatalysis. This approach harnesses the contact charges generated between water droplets and vitrimer to drive CO2RR, achieving methanol selectivity exceeding 90%. The imine groups within the vitrimer play a dual role, facilitating CO2 adsorption and enriching friction&#8208;generated electrons, thereby mediating efficient electron transfer between the imine groups and CO2 to promote CO2RR. After 84&#160;h of CO2RR, the system achieved a methanol production rate of 13 nmol&#183;h&#8722;1, demonstrating the excellent stability of the method. Moreover, the vitrimer retains its high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic activity even after recycling. Mechanistic studies reveal that, compared to traditional metal catalysts, the N&#9472;O bond in the imine, which adsorbs the key intermediate *OCH3, breaks more readily to produce methanol, resulting in enhanced product selectivity and yield. This efficient and environmentally friendly contact&#8208;electroreduction strategy for CO2 offers a promising pathway toward a circular carbon economy by leveraging natural water droplet&#8208;based contact&#8208;electrochemistry.

         <title>LIBX&#8208;A401: A Novel Selective Inhibitor of Acyl&#8208;CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) and Its Binding Mode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent and selective ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone is reported. HDX&#8208;MS reveals that LIBX&#8208;A401 stabilizes the ACSL4 C&#8208;terminus and alters the fatty acid (FA) gate domain. Consistently, photoaffinity labeling, molecular dynamics, and mutagenesis identify key binding residues within the FA pocket. LIBX&#8208;A401 also exhibits ACSL4&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supporting its therapeutic potential.








Abstract
Acyl&#8208;coenzyme A synthetase long&#8208;chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism, has emerged as a therapeutic target for ferroptosis&#8208;related conditions and cancer. However, its reference inhibitor, rosiglitazone, has off&#8208;target activity on peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptor gamma (PPAR&#947;), a key regulator of lipid homeostasis. Here, the discovery of LIBX&#8208;A401, a potent ACSL4 inhibitor derived from rosiglitazone devoid of PPAR&#947; activity, is reported. Its binding to ACSL4 is ATP&#8208;dependent, stabilizing the C&#8208;terminal domain and altering the fatty acid gate region, as shown by Hydrogen&#8208;Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry. Photoaffinity labeling identified A329 within the fatty acid binding site, while molecular dynamics and mutagenesis highlighted Q302 as critical for LIBX&#8208;A401 binding. LIBX&#8208;A401 exhibits anti&#8208;ferroptotic properties in cells, supported by target engagement. These findings establish LIBX&#8208;A401 as a valuable tool to study ACSL4 in ferroptosis and cancer, while its elucidated binding mode paves the way for the rational design of improved inhibitors.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthesis of Formamide via an Oxidant&#8208;Free Photoinduced Radical Coupling Route over Pt&#8208;CdS</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia was successfully achieved through an oxidant&#8208;free radical coupling route on Pt&#8208;loaded CdS, with considerable value&#8208;added hydrogen production. A series of in situ characterizations revealed that the efficient C&#9472;N coupling between &#183;CH2OH and &#183;NH2 driven by photoinduced holes achieved the synthesis of formamide and hydrogen without formaldehyde, which makes the artificial photocatalytic route more competitive.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale manufacturing of formamide is always involved with the use of carbon monoxide, hence developing a series of eco&#8208;friendly synthesis routes is of great significance. Alternative feedstock of low&#8208;cost methanol is expected to fulfill this breakthrough due to its green and renewable nature; however, the overoxidation of methanol severely inhibits the efficacious formamide synthesis from methanol and ammonia through the conventional catalytic route. Herein, we report the successful development of a direct radical coupling route for converting methanol and ammonia into high&#8208;selectivity formamide and hydrogen without extra oxidants under ambient conditions. The optimized Pt&#8208;CdS photocatalysts offered an impressive formamide production rate of 1.45&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, as well as an exceptional hole selectivity reaching up to 63.5%. The oxidant&#8208;free radical mechanism of high&#8208;efficiency formamide generation as revealed by in situ characterizations (e.g., in situ electron paramagnetic resonance and in situ transient absorption spectroscopy), stems from the photogenerated holes oxidizing the methanol to hydroxymethyl radical for subsequently direct C&#9472;N coupling with amino radical. This work demonstrates an efficient oxidant&#8208;free photoinduced radical coupling strategy with the promise of an acceptable alternative to current technologies for artificial photosynthesis formamide using clean and abundant solar energy.

         <title>Isomeric 1,4&#8208;Dihydropentalene&#8208;Containing Building Blocks for High Mobility Ladder&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of two novel isomeric derivatives of 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indeneo (DHI), incorporating a thieno group to reduce torsional disorder. The anti&#8208;C16DHIT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT isomers differ in conjugation characteristics, with the anti&#8208;isomer showing fully delocalized conjugation, whereas syn isomer exhibiting cross&#8208;conjugation. The polymer based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT exhibits high hole mobility of 2.38 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, surpassing that of pIDTBT in same device structure.








Abstract
Nearly amorphous conjugated polymers, though lacking long&#8208;range order, can exhibit high charge carrier mobility and enhanced flexibility, making them ideal for flexible or stretchable OFET applications. However, research on novel structural blocks for this class of materials remains limited. We report the synthesis of two derivatives of the 5,10&#8208;dihydroindeno[2,1&#8208;a]indene (DHI) core, where two thieno groups are appended to each end to reduce torsional disorder with adjacent comonomers. The two 1,4&#8208;dihydropentalene containing isomers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;Br, feature distinct thieno group orientations, leading to differences in their electronic properties. The anti&#8208;isomer shows a fully delocalized conjugation pathway, whereas the syn isomer exhibits cross&#8208;conjugation, limiting delocalization along the polymer backbone. These monomers were copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) to form two conjugated polymers, anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT and syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT, both with highly planar backbones, good solubility, and solution processability. Morphological studies reveal that anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT exhibits more ordered stacking and higher crystallinity than syn&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT. Devices based on anti&#8208;C16DHIT&#8208;BT show significantly better performance, with a hole mobility of 2.38&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, slightly higher than the widely studied pIDTBT under identical conditions.

However, research on novel structural blocks for this class of materials remains limited. We report the synthesis of two derivatives of the 5,10-dihydroindeno[2,1-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;]indene (DHI) core, where two thieno groups are appended to each end to reduce torsional disorder with adjacent comonomers. The two 1,4-dihydropentalene containing isomers, anti-C16DHIT-Br and syn-C16DHIT-Br, feature distinct thieno group orientations, leading to differences in their electronic properties. The anti-isomer shows a fully delocalized conjugation pathway, whereas the syn isomer exhibits cross-conjugation, limiting delocalization along the polymer backbone. These monomers were copolymerized with benzothiadiazole (BT) to form two conjugated polymers, anti-C16DHIT-BT and syn-C16DHIT-BT, both with highly planar backbones, good solubility, and solution processability. Morphological studies reveal that anti-C16DHIT-BT exhibits more ordered stacking and higher crystallinity than syn-C16DHIT-BT. Devices based on anti-C16DHIT-BT show significantly better performance, with a hole mobility of 2.38&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, slightly higher than the widely studied pIDTBT under identical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selectively Accelerating the Generation of &#946;&#8208;Linked Residue Isoaspartate in Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoaspartate (isoAsp), a &#946;&#8208;linked residue, widely exists in proteins. A method that allows the site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins has been developed. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative that undergoes a facile intramolecular reaction to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to the major product isoAsp.








Abstract
Isoaspartate (isoAsp) is a &#946;&#8208;linked residue in proteins spontaneously generated through Asn deamidation or Asp dehydration and significantly affects protein properties. However, the sluggish and site&#8208;nonselective generation of isoAsp residues in proteins severely impedes in&#8208;depth biological investigations as well as the exploitation of its unique &#946;&#8208;linkage features. Herein, we introduce a method that allows site&#8208;selective and rapid generation of isoAsp residues in proteins. This method leverages the genetic incorporation of a side&#8208;chain&#8208;esterified Asp derivative (BnD), which undergoes facile intramolecular arrangement to form the key intermediate, aspartyl succinimide (Suc); subsequent hydrolysis of Suc gives rise to isoAsp as the major product. On native sites of proteins, including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and calmodulin, we demonstrate that BnD&#8208;mediated isoAsp formation is faster than Asn deamidation generally by three orders of magnitude.

         <title>Polychromatic Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single Heteroligand Metal&#8211;Organic Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We design a series of heteroligand MOFs composting of porphyrin and pyrene ligands as crystalline emitters for polychromatic ECL imaging. Due to rational conjugated spacing of MOF, it exhibits excellent energy transfer efficiency and unique polychromatic ECL imaging characteristics, providing the first instance of single MOF crystals in ECL imaging.








Abstract
Conventional polychromatic electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging is realized with the several separated luminophores at the different potentials. In this study, an emerging polychromatic ECL imaging system was constructed based on single heteroligand metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) crystals as nanoemitters through an intrareticular energy transfer process. The heteroligand MOF crystals, named h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241, were coassembled of meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) with 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(p&#8208;benzoic acid)pyrene (TBAPy) ligand using benzoic acid catalyst with coordination ability, leading to the conjugated spacing of 0.624&#160;nm between two ligands. Remarkably, an energy transfer efficiency of 92.2% was achieved when the coordination weight ratio of TCPP acceptor and TBAPy donor was only 1.87&#8240;. Different from monoligand MOFs, the heteroligand h&#8208;NJU&#8208;241 exhibits dual ECL emissions in both blue and red regions at one step applied potential, which is first example of polychromatic ECL imaging for single MOF crystals. Furthermore, by adjusting the reaction conditions, the morphology distribution of porphyrin within the crystal can be dynamically controlled, providing a tailored crystal platform for decoding fundamentals in polychromatic ECL imaging.

         <title>Uniform Ion Flow Effect of Dynamic Electrostatic Shielding Layer for Facilitating Homogeneous Nucleation and Deposition on Aluminum Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study optimizes the Al anode/electrolyte interface by incorporating anionic surfactants (sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) to achieve stable Al anode. The alkyl chains preferentially adsorb on Al surface, forming dense adsorption layer that mitigates corrosion from the electrolyte. Additionally, &#9472;SO3 and phenyl rings provide electrostatic shielding layer with moderately electronegative that regulates ion migration. The uniform ion flow effect facilitates the uniform nucleation and deposition of Al, suppressing dendritic growth and tip effects, thereby enhancing the cycling stability and lifespan of the rechargeable aluminum battery.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) present considerable potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, particularly within power stations. Nonetheless, their operational lifespan and commercialization are hindered by issues like Al anode dendrite formation and electrolyte corrosion. To address the aforementioned issues, a stabilizer has been proposed to enhance the electrolyte/anode interface. Experimental and computational simulation results indicate that the surface tension of the SDBS alkyl chain facilitates its preferential adsorption onto the electrode surface, thereby establishing a protective layer that mitigates the corrosion of the chloroaluminate ionic liquid (ILs). Additionally, the suitable electronegativity of the phenyl&#8208;SO3 group generates an electrostatic shielding effect that not only dynamically regulates ion flow but also equilibrates the nucleation and deposition velocity, ultimately promoting the stable planar Al deposition. Consequently, the SDBS&#8208;modified Al//Al symmetric battery demonstrates stable cycling for 500 and 1000&#160;h under high current density (5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and large area capacity (5&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2), respectively. The Al//flake graphite full battery achieves reversible capacity of 90.01&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, significantly improving capacity retention. This study also further explores the effect of additive functional groups and ions on Al anodes, offering insights for the rational design of RABs electrolytes.

         <title>Spontaneous Anionic Double Capture/Displacement to Trigger Single&#8208;Ion Conducting Interpenetrating Polymer Networks with Desired Ionic Conductivity for Durable Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpenetrating polymer network interface is constructed to enable a quasi&#8208;single ion conductor for the protection of the Zn anodes through an anionic double capture/displacement mechanism, and thereby inhibiting the corrosion of the Zn anode, preventing the side reaction, elevating the Zn ion transference number and stabilized the plating/striping of zinc ions.








Abstract
The engineering of single&#8208;ion conductors (SICs) is a promising strategy to stabilize the anode/electrolyte interface in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. However, the commonly employed single&#8208;ion conductive solid or quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes often lead to a significant reduction in overall ionic conductivity, thereby impeding ion diffusion kinetics. Here, we propose a compromise strategy that effectively balances ionic conductivity and ion transference number. Specifically, a single&#8208;ion conductive interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with phase&#8208;functional decoupling is developed solely on the anode side, while a liquid electrolyte is retained on the cathode side. This design facilitates a high ion transference number (0.84) while maintaining the ionic conductivity at an optimal level (12.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1). The single&#8208;ion&#8208;conductive mechanism is unveiled as a spontaneous anionic dual capture/displacement process, which synergizes zincophilic&#8211;hydrophobic functionality to ensure efficient reversible Zn2+ stripping and plating. The modified electrode demonstrates outstanding cycling stability of 1300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The assembled NH4V4O10//IPNs@Zn full cell exhibits an exceptional lifespan, enduring 9000 cycles with a remarkable retention of 80.8% at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work introduces an effective approach for balancing ionic conductivity and ion transference numbers in SICs, offering a promising pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance SICs.

         <title>Electrochemical Amino&#8208;Oxygenation Cyclization via Alkene Radical Cation/Bisnucleophile Engagement to Saturated N/O&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkene radical cations with bisnucleophiles enabled the formation of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles. In situ EC&#8208;MS data offered valuable insights into the radical cation&#8208;initiated difunctionalization, allowing precise control over regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.








Abstract
Regioselective functionalization of alkenes to create nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing heterocycles remains a significant challenge in organic synthesis. Because of their unique electronic and biological properties, these heterocycles are crucial in pharmaceuticals and materials. Herein, we present an electrochemical amino&#8208;oxygenation of alkenes using alkene radical cations and bisnucleophiles, enabling the synthesis of saturated N/O&#8208;heterocycles in an undivided cell. This method employs readily available amides and alkenes, eliminating the need for additional oxidants or redox catalysts. The in situ generation of alkene radical cations results in high yields with excellent regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity. Our approach offers a direct route to six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered N/O&#8208;heterocycles from simple starting materials, broadening access to complex molecules essential for medicinal chemistry and materials science.

         <title>Rapid, Precise, and Robust Supramolecular Polymerization from Functional Oligomeric&#8208;Charged Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular design of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) amphiphiles enables their crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly with unprecedented rapid growth kinetics and precise size control. This robust supramolecular polymerization allows access to hierarchical hairy structures with dense, uniform micellar brushes via a &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; approach initiated from the surface of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets.








Abstract
Nature inspires the design of artificial systems with remarkable rapidity, precision, and functionality, yet achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a challenge. Living crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) methods have enabled the formation of low&#8208;dispersity block copolymer nanofibers with crystalline cores, but these processes typically involve moderate or slow growth kinetics to ensure well&#8208;controlled and ordered epitaxial crystallization. Here, we report studies on the living CDSA of oligomeric&#8208;charged poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) amphiphiles, demonstrating an unprecedented combination of rapidity and precision. We show that self&#8208;seeding can produce nanofibers with controllable lengths up to &#8764;700&#160;nm within &#8764;15&#160;min (including 5&#160;min of disassembly and 10&#160;min of re&#8208;growth), while seeded growth can generate nanofibers up to &gt; 2000&#160;nm in length within &#8764;20&#8211;40&#160;min, depending on the unimer&#8208;to&#8208;seed mass ratios. Notably, this robust supramolecular polymerization can be initiated from the surfaces of two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets, resulting in hierarchical hairy structures grafted with dense, uniform micellar brushes.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Activated Platform for Controlled Hydrogen Sulfide Release with Tracking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tunable H2S releasing motif was developed, enabling the encapsulation of payloads featuring diverse functional sites. The delivery of H2S was achieved through a COS mediate pathway characterized by an adjustable releasing profile. Additionally, drugs possessing function sites could be readily integrated into this platform, thereby facilitating the construction of prodrugs.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is increasingly recognized for its critical role in various physiological and pathological processes. The development of synthetic donors with controllable release profiles is essential for elucidating H2S's complex involvement in cellular signaling, which remains a challenge. Herein, we report a diverse collection of photocaged N&#8208;methylation thiocarbamates and thiocarbonates, designed to explore how electronic properties and the leaving efficiency of payloads affect H2S release behaviors. These compounds are engineered to release carbonyl sulfide (COS) following the removal of photoprotective group (PPG). The COS could be rapidly converted into H2S by carbonic anhydrase, and the entire reaction progression was monitored by changes in fluorescence signals. Furthermore, this H2S&#8208;releasing platform is suitable for conjugation with active pharmaceutical ingredients, facilitating the creation of H2S&#8208;releasing hybrid prodrugs. Collectively, this novel class of H2S donor not only provides valuable tool for H2S&#8208;related research but also holds significant potential as therapeutic agent.

         <title>Valence Engineering via Polyoxometalate&#8208;Induced on Vanadium Centers for Efficient Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study synthesized a series of novel nanostructures with polyoxometalates (POMs) inserted into vanadate&#8208;based compounds via a solvothermal method to achieve uniform dispersion of POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds. The electronic synergistic effect between the POMs and vanadate&#8208;based compounds effectively reduced the Zn2&#8314; migration barrier and accelerated Zn2&#8314; migration on the cathode, resulting in a high specific capacity. This work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.








Abstract
Layered vanadium&#8208;based compounds have attracted attention as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their low cost, high theoretical specific capacity, and abundant vanadium valence states. However, the slow migration of Zn2+ ions and their poor cycling stability hinder their practical application in AZIBs. Herein, using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method, the polyoxometalates (POMs) were inserted into the aluminum vanadate interlayer spacing, and a series of novel 3D nanoflower cathode materials (HAVO&#8208;MMo6&#8208;X) were successfully fabricated. The unique electron&#8208;rich structure of the POMs accelerated the migration of Zn2+ on the cathode to obtain a high specific capacity. Owing to the synergistic pillar effect of POMs and HAVO, the interlayer spacing of HAVO&#8208;FeMo6&#8208;50 increased to approximately 14.33&#160;&#197;. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to analyze the coordination environments of the cathode materials. A combination of in situ and ex situ characterization techniques demonstrated the storage mechanism of Zn2+ during the charge/discharge process. Furthermore, the experimental results and DFT calculations indicated that the introduction of POMs had the dual function of improving conductivity and reducing the Zn2+ migration barrier. Thus, this work provides a new perspective on the synergistic interaction between POMs and metal compounds and offers insights into the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

An ionic liquid&#8208;driven compacting strategy was proposed to form FSI&#8722;&#8208;rich solvation structures with high&#8208;ionic conductivity and low&#8208;desolvation energy at a low concentration of 0.8 M, which enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics by promoting the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and accelerated K+ transport kinetics, enabling the PB||CSE||graphite full cell to operate for 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 88%.








Abstract
The development of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) faces significant challenges due to the lack of suitable electrolytes to achieve satisfactory energy density and long&#8208;term stability. This work reports an innovative compact&#8208;solvation electrolyte (CSE) strategy leveraging ionic liquid&#8208;induced manipulation of solvation structures under low concentration for high&#8208;performance PIBs. The CSE, formulated with a low&#8208;salt concentration of 0.8&#160;M, simultaneously exhibits compact solvation structures with abundant F&#8208;rich anions, high&#8208;ionic conductivity, and low&#8208;desolvation energy. These features lead to enhanced K&#8208;storage thermodynamics and kinetics through the formation of a robust KF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) as well as accelerated K+ transport kinetics. Consequently, the graphite electrode in CSE delivers a high&#8208;reversible capacity of 252&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% after 300 cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g. Furthermore, the designed CSE enables the Prussian blue||graphite full cell to operate for over 1450 cycles at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, maintaining an impressive capacity retention of 88%. This work represents a significant advance in the development of safe and compatible electrolytes for advanced PIBs.

         <title>Unravelling the Oxygen Evolution Mechanism of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antifluorite Prelithiation Agent Based on Anionic Oxidation</title>

         <dc:description>
The illustration of the intricate oxygen evolution mechanism of antifluorite Li5FeO4 (LFO) prelithiation agent, which is originally explained in a variety of novel and unconventional perspectives: lattice mismatch induced by the coexistence of Fe&#8208;O tetrahedral (tet.) and octahedral (oct.) activate the lattice oxygen, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O&#8722; configurations dimerize to superoxide and O2, the nucleophilic reaction between superoxide and electrolyte contributes to cathode electrolyte interface (CEI), the oxidized O species shuttle to the anode side participating in the construction of solid electrolyte interface (SEI).








Abstract
Developing sacrificial cathode prelithiation technology to compensate for irreversible lithium loss is crucial for enhancing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Antifluorite Li&#8208;rich Li5FeO4 (LFO) is a promising prelithiation agent due to its high theoretical capacity (867 mAh g&#8722;1) and superior decomposition dynamic (&lt;4.0&#160;V vs. Li/Li+). However, the oxygen evolution mechanism in LFO remains unclear, limiting its application as an ideal prelithiation agent. Herein, we systematically track the full lifecycle oxygen footprint in LFO lattice, electrolyte and solid electrolyte interface (SEI). We demonstrate the lattice mismatch induced by the quasi&#8208;disorder rocksalt intermediate phase can activate the lattice oxygen oxidation promoting the dimerization to O2. Specifically, in contrast to the O&#9472;O dimers formed within typical anionic&#8208;redox active cathodes, the oxidation of lattice oxygen in LFO generates O&#8722; stabilized in Li6&#8208;O configuration. Significantly, a pair of edge&#8208;sharing Li6&#8208;O configurations transforms into a superoxo dimer, which further evolves into O2 via a ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer process. Moreover, we demonstrate that nucleophilic intermediates threaten the stability of electrolytes and SEI. Leveraging the insights above, we offer comprehensive perspectives for the modification of ideal prelithiation agents.

         <title>Electronegative Strategic Positions in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Unlocking High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Recovery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs with an electronegative skeleton designed for selective gold recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers generate electron&#8208;rich sites at strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the structural integrity of the framework. These features enable efficient gold capture, providing high&#8208;adsorption capacity and fast kinetics through electrostatic interactions, making the COFs highly effective for selective gold recovery.








Abstract
Gold (Au) concentrations accumulated from electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) and industrial leachates far surpass those found in natural ores, a highly valuable resource if efficient recovery methods can be developed. Despite advancements in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), achieving adsorbents with high selectivity, large capacity, and rapid adsorption kinetics remain challenging because of limitations in partial pore wall sites. Here, we present hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;based COFs (HATP&#8208;COFs) with an electronegative skeleton, specifically designed for selective Au recovery. The hexaazatriphenylene centers, imine linkages, and pyridine linkers within the COFs introduce electron&#8208;rich sites that extend across strategic positions&#8212;vertex, linkages, and linkers&#8212;thereby enhancing the overall structural integrity. These features facilitate efficient Au capture through electrostatic interactions, achieving an exceptional adsorption capacity exceeding 2366&#160;mg g&#8722;1 with rapid kinetics, making HATP&#8208;COFs one of the most efficient pure COFs reported to date. Moreover, these HATP&#8208;COFs demonstrate remarkable selectivity, stability, and scalability. Theoretical calculations reveal that the electronegative skeleton introduces critical binding sites, promoting strong electrostatic interactions with Au3+ ions and improving adsorption kinetics. This work highlights the potential of charge&#8208;interface engineering in COFs as a transformative strategy for developing next&#8208;generation materials.

         <title>A Promising Deep Ultraviolet Nonlinear Optical Crystal Activated by the Ordered Structure Design</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#160;nonlinear optical crystal, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 with ordered design of the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups, has been successfully synthesized through utilizing the similar topological group substitution strategy. It exhibits excellent performance, i.e., the strongest second&#8208;harmonic generation response among the KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like deep&#8208;ultraviolet borates, the best crystal growth habit along the c axis, short absorption edge, and sufficient birefringence.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;ultraviolet nonlinear optical (DUV NLO) crystals play a vitally important role in many scientific and technological fields, yet their rational design remains an ongoing challenge. Here, through utilizing the ordered structure design, a new KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV transparent NLO crystal Cs2KY(B3O6)2 has been successfully designed and synthesized, in which we first use the largest &#960;&#8208;conjugated B3O6 functional groups to substitute the BO3 to maximize the second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response and utilize the K/YO6 connecting groups to replace two BeO3F groups to optimize the layer connections. Eventually, Cs2KY(B3O6)2 exhibits not only the largest SHG responses in KBe2BO3F2&#8208;like DUV borates but also the best growth rate along c axis (the strong layer&#8208;habit along c axis has been being the greatest obstacle to prohibit the practical application of KBe2BO3F2 and its derivative). Clearly, the substitution from BO3 triangles to similar topological B3O6 groups and from (BeO3F)2 groups to similar topological K/YO6 octahedra can better modulate the functional properties of materials in the larger scale. That results in the superior comprehensive properties of Cs2KY(B3O6)2 and makes it a promising DUV NLO crystal. Therefore, the ordered structure design provides some new insights for assembling the functional and connecting groups to rationally design materials with high&#8208;performance.

         <title>Sustainability&#8208;Inspired Upcycling of Organophosphorus Pollutants into Phosphatic Fertilizer in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>

First report of organophosphorus pollutants selective degradation, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate and sodium percarbonate, into phosphates that are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on a continuous&#8208;flow reactor.








Abstract
With the increasing requirement for phosphorus resources and their shortage in nature, cyclic utilization of organophosphorus pollutants into phosphatic fertilizer might offer a sustainable approach to achieve the recycling of phosphorus. Herein, we first report the selective degradation of organophosphorus pollutants, via the synergistic effect of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and sodium percarbonate (SPC), into phosphates (o&#8208;PO43&#8722;), which are continually converted into phosphatic fertilizer by struvite precipitation on the continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, electrochemical analysis, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggest that the transfer of electrons from SPC to PMS results in the synthesis of catalytically active species (i.e., &#183;OH, &#183;O2&#8722;, 1O2, and CO3&#183;&#8722;) for hydroxyethylidene&#8208;1,1&#8208;diphosphonicacid (HEDP) degradation. For the real glyphosate wastewater, the PMS/SPC system exhibits excellent catalytic activity with 69.20% decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 37.80% decrease in the total organic carbon (TOC) after 90&#160;min. Indeed, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms that glyphosate is completely degraded in 90&#160;min with the formation of 271.93&#160;&#181;mol/L of o&#8208;PO43&#8722;, which is further converted into phosphatic fertilizer by the precipitation of struvite with 87.20% yield on continuous&#8208;flow reactor. Finally, biotoxicity of glyphosate to zebrafish and wheat seeds are significantly deceased after treatment of PMS/SPC system by zebrafish toxicology assays and germination tests of wheat seeds.

         <title>Repurposing Post&#8208;Consumer Polyethylene to Access Cross&#8208;Linked Polyethylene with Reprocessability, Recyclability, and Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successfully repurposing mixed post&#8208;consumer PE into crosslinked PE (XLPE) with reprocessability, chemical recyclability, tunable properties, and potential degradability is achieved. The approach involves catalytically converting PE into telechelic oligomers with hydroxyl chain&#8208;end groups. Subsequent cross&#8208;linking the oligomers or their mixture with commercial macrodiols using hybrid cross&#8208;linkers provides XLPE with the modular properties.








Abstract
Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely produced plastic but accumulation and resistance to degradation has significantly contributed to the plastic waste crisis. Upcycling has presented promising solutions to transform PE waste into value&#8208;added products. In this study, mixed post&#8208;consumer PE was successfully repurposed into reprocessable and chemically recyclable cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE). This process involved converting PE into telechelic oligomers, followed by repolymerization using a hybrid cross&#8208;linking system consisting of a dynamic cross&#8208;linker 2,4,6&#8208;triethoxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TETA) and non&#8208;dynamic cross&#8208;linker tris(6&#8208;isocyanatohexyl)isocyanurate (Tri&#8208;HDI). In the resulting XLPE, TETA facilitated iterative reprocessing with minimal property degradation across cycles, whereas Tri&#8208;HDI helped preserve functional performance throughout service life. Compared to PE, XLPE exhibited enhanced mechanical properties, reduced creep deformation under application&#8208;relevant temperatures, and high temperature structural stability. Notably, copolymerizing PE oligomers with commercial macrodiols was employed to create composite XLPEs, enabling tuning material properties. After use, XLPE can be efficiently and selectively depolymerized under mild conditions, even when mixed with commercial insulator cables. This depolymerization allows for the recovery of the constituent building blocks, enabling purification and subsequent repolymerization for reuse. This approach demonstrates the potential of repurposing plastic waste into sustainable materials and fostering the development of a circular economy.

         <title>Unusual 1,1&#8208;Dicarboxylation Selectivity in the Domino Hydrocarboxylation of Alkynes with Formate and Application in Polyimide Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoinduced 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes using cesium formate and water was disclosed for the first time. The dicarboxylation reaction undergoes via &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to an acrylic acid intermediate. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids, succinic acids, and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. It may provide a new working mode for positive&#8208;type photoresists for photolithographic processing.








Abstract
We report for the first time a photoinduced domino 1,1&#8208;dicarboxylation of alkynes for the synthesis of malonic acid derivatives using a cesium formate solution (80% w/w in water), which is different from previous 1,2&#8208;dicarboxylation methods that usually produce succinic acids. Cesium malonate precipitated directly from the diluted reaction mixture and was collected by filtration without further purification. Interestingly, solid cesium formate with additional water led to a mono&#8208;carboxylation product. The solubility of cesium formate and alkaline environment are two key factors contributing to the outcome. A series of malonic acids, propionic acids and drug intermediates were synthesized by the methods in good yields. Mechanism experiments and DFT calculations indicate that the malonic acid is formed through the &#945;&#8208;selective addition of CO2&#8226;&#8722; to a cinnamate intermediate. This method enables direct preparation of water&#8208;soluble carboxylate&#8208;functionalized molecules and polymers from hydrophobic alkyne&#8208;containing precursors, showing potential usability in photolithography for semiconductor manufacturing.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Mechanistic Control of Nonadiabatic Tunnelling in Triplet Carbenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instanton theory is applied to study the reactivity of triplet carbenes at low temperature. We find a competition between a sequential mechanism of intersystem crossing (ISC) followed by hydrogen tunnelling and a new concerted nonadiabatic tunnelling pathway. This explains the differences in the observed reactivity of three chemically similar carbenes.








Abstract
Experiments on three chemically similar triplet carbenes observed the reaction of one at 10 K, another only when heated to 65 K, whereas the third remained stable despite heating. As the products are singlets, it is clear that the reactions involve intersystem crossing in addition to intramolecular hydrogen transfer. Here, instanton theory is used to study various possible reaction mechanisms, including sequential and concerted pathways. The latter describes a new reaction mechanism which involves changing spin state (a nonadiabatic process) while heavy atoms tunnel underneath a barrier (an adiabatic process). In each case, we find that the concerted pathway dominates the rate at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures it switches to a sequential mechanism. The existence of a crossover temperature is the key to explaining the experimental observations and demonstrates that temperature can control the reactivity of triplet carbenes via nonadiabatic&#160;tunnelling.

A magnetic field&#8208;assisted lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8208;O2) battery was established by the spin&#8208;polarization strategy. The spin&#8208;polarized catalysts are capable of promoting electron transfer and improv ing the carrier separation efficiency, contributing to the accelerated kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions for Li&#8211;O2 battery. With the magnetic field, the Li&#8211;O2 battery exhibited a low overpotential of 0.40 V, an ultralow overpotential of 0.12 V and a high energy efficiency of 96.3% under illumination. 








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries have attracted significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, but are obstructed by the sluggish reaction kinetics at the cathode and high overpotential. Our previous researches have proved that energy fields such as light, force, and heat are effective strategies to improve the reaction kinetics of Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, we proposed a novel magnetic field&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries via a spin polarization strategy. By doping magnetic Mn2+ ions with spin polarization characteristics into CsPbBr3 (Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3) perovskite, a magnetic field&#8208;responsive cathode was designed and prepared. The incorporation of Mn2+ ions drives the charge redistribution and spin polarization of CsPbBr3, which remarkably improve the carrier separation efficiency and the oxygen species adsorption energy. The&#160;Increased spin&#8208;polarization of the magnetic elements by Zeeman effect in an external magnetic field results in the enhanced oxygen reduction and evolution reaction. In the magnetic field, a low overpotential of 0.40&#160;V was obtained for Li&#8211;O2 batteries with Mn&#8211;CsPbBr3 cathodes, demonstrating an ultralow overpotential of 0.12&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96.3% with the further illumination. The introduction of magnetic fields into the Li&#8211;O2 battery system provides a new avenue for improving the reaction kinetics of rechargeable Li&#8211;O2 battery.

         <title>Short&#8208;Path Hydrogen Spillover on CeO2&#8208;Supported PtPd Nanoclusters for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtPd alloy clusters anchored on CeO2 enable efficient hydrogen spillover via short&#8208;path interfacial transfer, achieving near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy (0.023 eV) for hydrogen adsorption. This design minimizes the HER energy barrier, yielding an ultralow overpotential of 5.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and robust stability in acidic media, offering a novel strategy for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover in supported metal electrocatalysts has garnered significant research attention for its potential to enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) efficiency. However, challenges remain in facilitating hydrogen spillover and reducing the associated energy barriers. Herein, PtPd alloy clusters are anchored to the CeO2 surface, enabling short&#8208;path hydrogen spillover and lowering the reaction energy barrier in acidic environments. During HER, hydrogen is initially adsorbed on the noble metal surface and subsequently migrates to the interface, rather than precipitating directly on the CeO2 surface. This interface exhibits a near&#8208;zero Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (0.023&#160;eV). Consequently, the catalyst demonstrates an exceptionally low overpotential of only 5.7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic media, along with remarkable long&#8208;term stability. These findings provide valuable insights into designing highly efficient HER electrocatalysts for acidic environments based on hydrogen spillover mechanisms.

         <title>Chemical Process Development in the Pharmaceutical Industry in Europe&#8212;Insights and Perspectives from Industry Scientists</title>

What are the tasks of chemical process development in the pharmaceutical industry? What are trends and challenges? This Scientific Perspective written by members of the European pharmaceutical industry introduces key concepts of drug development and key drivers for the future of chemical process development.








Abstract
Chemical process development is a critical component in the development process for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). With interfaces to drug discovery and API manufacturing, chemical process development activities must deliver scalable, safe, cost&#8208;efficient, sustainable, and reliable processes for novel as well as marketed APIs. Despite its importance for the pharmaceutical industry and society, the domain of chemical process development, together with its advances and challenges, is often not well known to nonpractitioners. As industry scientists, we provide a scientific perspective on the state of affairs in chemical process development, which we believe will be of value to a broader audience, including academic researchers, students, and professionals from related fields.

         <title>Photoexcited Structural Diversification of Carboxylic Acids with Phosphorus Promoter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article showcases recent breakthroughs by Scheidt and co&#8208;workers in the photoexcited structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids. By leveraging hydrogen&#8208;atom transfer and cyclization sequences, the generated diradicals facilitate the synthesis of valuable &#945;&#8208;hydroxyl and amino phosphonates in a highly efficient and sustainable manner.








Abstract
Photoexcitation of carboxylic acids is challenging due to high energy requirements and low quantum efficiency. Recently, Scheidt and co&#8208;workers reported a single&#8208;flask transformation of carboxylic acids into acyl phosphonates, which facilitates the generation of diradicals under visible light irradiation. Building on this work, an efficient strategy for the structural reconstruction of carboxylic acids has been developed.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights Into H2O Dissociation in Overall Photo&#8208;/Electro&#8208;Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The slow dissociation of H&#8322;O, which serves as the rate&#8208;determining step, governs the overall performance of CO&#8322; reduction. Three key regulatory mechanisms are identified as: 1) The proton&#8208;feeding effect; 2) the positive charge depletion effect; and 3) the significant reverse reaction effect. These principles universally influence catalytic systems that involve H&#8322;O activation, providing a framework for atomic&#8208;scale design strategies for energy conversion interfaces in photo/electrocatalytic systems.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction with H2O to produce fuels and chemicals offers a dual solution to address both environmental and energy challenges. For a long time, catalyst design in this reaction system has primarily focused on optimizing reduction sites to improve the efficiency or guide the reaction pathway of the CO2 reduction half&#8208;reaction. However, less attention has been paid to designing activation sites for H2O to modulate the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction. Impressively, the rate&#8208;determining step in overall CO2 reduction is the latter, and it influences the evolution direction and formation energy of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates through the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process. Herein, we summarize the mechanism of the H2O dissociation half&#8208;reaction in modulating CO2 reduction performance based on cutting&#8208;edge research. These analyses aim to uncover the potential regulatory mechanisms by which H2O activation influences CO2 reduction pathways and conversion efficiency, and to establish a mechanism&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationship that can guide the design and development of high&#8208;efficiency catalytic materials. A summary of advanced characterization techniques for investigating the dissociation mechanism of H2O is presented. We also discuss the challenges and offer perspectives on the future design of activation sites to improve the performance of photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;catalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Isotope Techniques in Chemical Wastewater Treatment: Opportunities and Uncertainties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we would first introduce basic knowledge about isotopic compounds and then scrutinize the physical and chemical influence induced by isotope changes. Special attention will be paid to the uncertainties in explaining the isotope results. Next, the implications in kinetic isotope effects (KIE, including solvent and nonsolvent KIE) and element tracing will be individually discussed. Notably, the combination of isotope techniques with EPR, infrared, Raman, and DFT calculation will be summarized. Finally, the limitations and outlooks will be proposed.








Abstract
A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis of reaction mechanisms is essential for advancing chemical water treatment technologies. However, due to the limitations of conventional experimental and analytical methods, the types of reactive species and their generation pathways are commonly debatable in many aqueous systems. As highly sensitive diagnostic tools, isotope techniques offer deeper insights with minimal interference from reaction conditions. Nevertheless, precise interpretations of isotope results remain a significant challenge. Herein, we first scrutinized the fundamentals of isotope chemistry and highlighted key changes induced by the isotope substitution. Next, we discussed the application of isotope techniques in kinetic isotope effects, presenting a roadmap for interpreting KIE in sophisticated systems. Furthermore, we summarized the applications of isotope techniques in elemental tracing to pinpoint reaction sites and identify dominant reactive species. Lastly, we propose future research directions, highlighting critical considerations for the rational design and interpretation of isotope experiments in environmental chemistry and related fields.

         <title>Unlocking the ConPeT Mechanism: Correspondence on &#8220;Catalytic Asymmetric Redox&#8208;Neutral [3&#160;+&#160;2] Photocycloadditions of Cyclopropyl Ketones with Vinylazaarenes Enabled by Consecutive Photoinduced Electron Transfer&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>
Ultrafast absorption spectroscopy highlights that the excited state of the radical anion of 4DPAPN, a TADF chromophore employed as a photocatalyst, is not directly involved in a ConPeT mechanism. Instead, its high reducing ability stems from the generation of solvated electrons through a two&#8208;photon process in acetonitrile solution.








Abstract
Recently, in a communication to this journal, Qiao, Jang, and coworkers described an asymmetric photoredox reaction promoted by TADF cyanoarene photocatalysts (specifically 4DPAPN (3,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(diphenylamino)phthalonitrile)). The authors claimed that the high reduction potential required for the reaction in acetonitrile was achieved by the radical anion of the photocatalyst in its excited state, which initiated the reaction. This mechanism is usually named consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPeT), in which two photons are involved: the first one to excite the photocatalyst and generate the radical anion 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; and the second photon to promote 4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; to its excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211;. Employing ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, here we report that, although two photons are indeed involved in this transformation, the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; is short&#8208;lived, not emissive, and not quenched by the organic substrate employed in the reaction, opposite to what was claimed by the authors. The photocatalyst in the excited state *4DPAPN&#8226;&#8211; can generate a solvated electron that is able to reduce the substrate involved in this chemistry. It is worth noting that a different photochemical mechanism is likely to be operative in CH2Cl2, where solvated electrons are much less stabilized and reduction of the solvent might occur.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Force Spectroscopy Uncovers Root Zone&#8208; and Bacteria&#8208;Specific Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate at the single&#8208;cell level the reversible primary attachment between plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant roots. Bacterial affinities are both species&#8208; and region&#8208;specific along the root, with flagella playing a key role in mediating these interactions. The physicochemical properties of the root surface and the bacterial envelope significantly influence how these PGPR attach.








Abstract
Understanding root&#8211;bacteria interactions with plant growth&#8208;promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is key to developing effective biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture. We performed single&#8208;cell force spectroscopy using the atomic force microscope (AFM) to study the primary attachment of two PGPR, Bacillus velezensis and Pseudomonas defensor, to different regions of Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Force measurements with individual cells uncovered distinct attachment strategies by each strain, involving binding via micrometer&#8208;long polymers from both bacteria and root surfaces. Flagella differentially affected the binding interactions of each PGPR; their removal altered binding characteristics differently for each strain, highlighting the importance of flagella in early root colonization. Using silica beads to mimic the negatively charged bacteria, we demonstrated the influence of electrostatic forces on root&#8211;bacteria interactions. We also examined interactions with abiotic surfaces of varying surface energies, revealing the roles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces in initial binding. Our measurements show that differences in the physicochemical properties of bacteria and roots are responsible for variations in primary attachment strategies between PGPR strains and root regions. Parallel fluorescence measurements corroborated our AFM single&#8208;cell analysis.

     alt="Single-Cell Force Spectroscopy Uncovers Root Zone- and Bacteria-Specific Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate at the single-cell level the reversible primary attachment between plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant roots. Bacterial affinities are both species- and region-specific along the root, with flagella playing a key role in mediating these interactions. The physicochemical properties of the root surface and the bacterial envelope significantly influence how these PGPR attach.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding root&#8211;bacteria interactions with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is key to developing effective biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture. We performed single-cell force spectroscopy using the atomic force microscope (AFM) to study the primary attachment of two PGPR, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus velezensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas defensor&lt;/i&gt;, to different regions of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt; roots. Force measurements with individual cells uncovered distinct attachment strategies by each strain, involving binding via micrometer-long polymers from both bacteria and root surfaces. Flagella differentially affected the binding interactions of each PGPR; their removal altered binding characteristics differently for each strain, highlighting the importance of flagella in early root colonization. Using silica beads to mimic the negatively charged bacteria, we demonstrated the influence of electrostatic forces on root&#8211;bacteria interactions. We also examined interactions with abiotic surfaces of varying surface energies, revealing the roles of hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces in initial binding. Our measurements show that differences in the physicochemical properties of bacteria and roots are responsible for variations in primary attachment strategies between PGPR strains and root regions. Parallel fluorescence measurements corroborated our AFM single-cell analysis. Overall, our results provide a nanoscale view of bacterial attachment to roots, offering key insights into how beneficial bacteria colonize roots, crucial for enhancing biofertilizer effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Screening of Siloxane Molecules as Electrolyte Additives for High&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol is proposed for screening potential electrolyte additives from a number of siloxane molecules for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, greatly improves the high&#8208;temperature performance due to its preferential binding with anions, high reactivity with H2O/HF, and good interface stabilization.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries hold great promise for large&#8208;scale energy storage but face significant challenges at extreme temperatures. Especially at high temperatures, side reactions and electrode dissolution are exacerbated by repeated cycling. It is, therefore, essential to optimize the electrolyte formulation. Here, a series of siloxane molecules are screened to boost the high&#8208;temperature performance of the anode materials in SIBs. Octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), as a result of this screening, prefers to interact with anions due to the unique electron&#8208;donating of Si&#8594;CH3. This association then weakens the P&#9472;F bond and facilitates the formation of a NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase. Additionally, MDM inhibits the hydrolysis of PF6&#8722;, reducing the deleterious species in the electrolyte. Therefore, commercial Sn microparticles show a reversible capacity of 752 mAh g&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C after 750 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1, much better than the case without MDM. This result exceeds the reported data at high temperatures. MDM as an electrolyte additive also improves the high&#8208;temperature performance of Bi and hard carbon. The results provide useful guidance for the rational selection of electrolyte additives for high&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enantioselective Acylation of Benzylic C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Enabled by a Cooperative Photoredox and N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via cooperative photoredox and NHC catalysis was disclosed, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in high efficiency, with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). Mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations support the radical pathway and rationalize the radical coupling via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step.








Abstract
Organocatalyzed direct and asymmetric functionalization of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond is attractive yet challenging. Herein, we report the enantioselective acylation of benzylic C(sp3)&#9472;H bond via a cooperative photoredox and N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis, affording the corresponding chiral &#945;&#8208;aryl ketones in moderate to good yields with good to excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 er). The rational design of novel NHCs guided by the initial evaluation of available catalysts and their application promotes the asymmetric transformation. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the formation of benzyl radical and ketyl radical intermediates and rationalize the coupling of these radical species via open&#8208;shell singlet transition states to be the enantiodetermining step. This redox neutral protocol features mild conditions and is free of transition&#8208;metals (TMs) and pre&#8208;functionalized radical precursors.

         <title>Full Recovery of Epoxy Resin Wastes into Bisphenol A and Epoxy Monomers via Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient recycling strategy is developed, where a commercially available boron catalyst is used to selectively break C(sp3)&#9472;O bond in epoxy resins to recover bisphenol A, and the other part of epoxy resin is recovered as epoxy monomers by the reconstruction of C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and hydroxyl cyclization, realizing the high&#8208;value and full recovery of epoxy resins.








Abstract
Epoxy resins (EPs) are important thermosetting plastics and difficult to recycle because of their stable cross&#8208;linked structure. In this study, we report a full recovery strategy for the conversion of EPs into high&#8208;value platform compounds, i.e., bisphenol A (BPA) and epoxy monomers such as 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N,N&#8242;&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (AG80), which involves the selective breaking of the C(sp3)&#9472;O bond using commercially available boron trichloride (BCl3), the reconstruction of the broken C(sp3)&#9472;N bond and the cyclization of the hydroxy groups. The yield of BPA is 93 wt% with a purity of 99%, and the yield of AG80 is 96 wt% with an epoxy value of 0.43. 100% recovery of EP elements was achieved theoretically, and the actual mass recovery of the EPs is as high as 91%. Because of its versatility, simplicity of operation, mild reaction conditions, and recyclability of all solvents and by&#8208;products, this approach shows the potential in solving the current recycling challenges associated with EP waste.

         <title>Developing the Tandem Structure to Regulate Interfacial Chemistry and Promote Ion Transport Kinetics Toward High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) is designed to construct &#9472;CN&#9472;TM complexation and lithiophilic/electron&#8208;blocking interlayer for high voltage lithium metal batteries. The stable &#9472;CN&#8208;enriched CEI weakens the catalytic reaction of TM ions into the electrolyte. A hybrid SEI composed of Li&#8211;Sn alloy and LiF achieves dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the battery shows excellent cycle performance.








Abstract
The chemical properties of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) are crucial for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries, especially under extreme operating conditions. Herein, we propose a delicately designed tandem separator (CYANO&#8208;COF|PP|SnF2) to regulate the chemical stability&#160;of dual interfaces. The cyano group in CYANO&#8208;COF induces a stable CN&#8208;enriched CEI on the surface of high&#8208;nickel LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode through the adsorption/coordination effect with transition metals (TMs), inhibiting irreversible phase transitions, TMs dissolution, and other side reactions. Meanwhile, a straightforward in&#8208;situ conversion is used to construct an artificial hybrid SEI layer comprising LiF and Li&#8211;Sn alloy. As demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, the hybrid SEI with enhanced electron&#8208;blocking ability and rapid transmission characteristics can decrease the electron from the Li anode into the SEI and allow Li+ to rapidly diffuse through the SEI layer, achieving even dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating at the SEI/Li interface. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the NCM811||Li battery maintains a capacity retention of 81.8% within 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 55&#160;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the significance of regulating the chemical properties of double interfaces and provides new insights into the rational design for tandem separators.

As demonstrated theoretically and experimentally, the hybrid SEI with enhanced electron-blocking ability and rapid transmission characteristics can decrease the electron from the Li anode into the SEI and allow Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to rapidly diffuse through the SEI layer, achieving even dendrite-free lithium plating at the SEI/Li interface. With the synergistic effect of dual interfaces, the NCM811||Li battery maintains a capacity retention of 81.8% within 200 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and 55&#160;&#176;C. This work emphasizes the significance of regulating the chemical properties of double interfaces and provides new insights into the rational design for tandem separators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>NIR&#8208;Sensitized Activated Formation of Lophyl Radicals by Heptamethine Cyanines Enables Dry Film Photoresists</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;intensity NIR radiation around 800&#160;nm enables the manufacture of dry film resists (DFRs) using a combination of hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazole (HABI) and N&#8208;phenyl imino acetic acid. The mechanism is based on activated electron transfer processes supported by the respective product analysis.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensitized generation of lophyl radicals (L&#183;) by heptamethine cyanine led to initiation of radical photopolymerization of multifunctional acrylates when different hexa&#8208;arylbisimidazoles (HABIs) and N&#8208;phenylglycine (NPG) operated as coinitiator. The latter functioned as donor. For a deeper understanding, heptamethine cyanines were used following a photoinduced electron transfer (PET). HABI derivatives with electron&#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing substituents demonstrated that those with electron acceptors resulted in a higher photopolymerization efficiency of multifunctional acrylates. Tri&#8208;(propylene glycol) diacrylate (TPGDA) and tri&#8208;methylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) served as the monomers. Sensitizers (Sens) exposed with a high intense NIR&#8208;light source at 808 nm exhibiting a positive charge in the cyanine pattern significantly operate more efficiently for radical photopolymerization than a Sens without a positive charge. Differences in efficiency of PET can give an explanation for these differences. The heat generated by the cyanine's internal conversion from S1 to S0 additionally influenced the endothermic reaction between L&#183; and NPG. These systems worked in practical applications for dry film photoresists (DFRs), reported here for the first time.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene as a Primer in a Dual&#8208;Layer Coating for Corrosion Protection on Iron</title>

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) monolayer is electrodeposited on Fe foil and effectively functioned as a binder for a secondary layer of a cross&#8208;linked polymer network, which is photo&#8208;polymerized on the NHC monolayer. The dual coating, constructed of NHC monolayer and polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation on Fe.








Abstract
The development of highly stable coatings on iron is essential for mitigating corrosion formation. Herein, it is demonstrated that a self&#8208;assembled monolayer of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) can be electrodeposited on iron foil and function as a binder for a secondary, crosslinked polymer network coating. The dual layer coating, constructed of a monolayer of NHCs and a polymer film, as a primary and a secondary coating, respectively, effectively preventes corrosion formation with a protective efficiency of 99.6&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;%, as determined by polarization measurements in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Spectroscopic analysis identified the formation of a chemical interaction between the NHC monolayer and the polymer film. The strong anchoring of NHC to iron along with its chemical interaction with the polymer film induced high stability and durability of the dual&#8208;layer coating to effectively protect the coated iron from corrosion formation.

         <title>Artificial Carbon Neutrality Through Aprotic CO2 Splitting</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the reducing hydrogen&#8208;mediated natural photosynthesis, in which CO&#8322; is converted into O&#8322; and glucose, a lithium&#8208;mediated aprotic electrochemical strategy for splitting CO&#8322; into O&#8322; and carbon taking advantage of the stronger reducibility of lithium over hydrogen is developed. Within the designed electrochemical device, CO2 is reduced sequentially into Li&#8322;CO&#8323; and Li&#8322;O, followed by the oxidation of Li2O to release O2. Moreover, the high O2 yield of over 98% can be achieved with the assistance of appropriate catalysts, significantly advancing carbon&#8208;neutral technologies.








Abstract
Global climate change mitigation necessitates global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Natural photosynthesis exemplifies an ingenious approach to carbon neutrality, converting CO2 into O2 and glucose through light and dark reactions. Inspired by the hydrogen&#8208;involved processes in photosynthesis, an aprotic electrochemical strategy for CO2 splitting into O2 and carbon using lithium as a reducing mediator is presented. The designed electrochemical device features a gas cathode with a nanoscale Co catalyst and a metallic lithium anode. When CO2 is introduced to the cathode, it undergoes a two&#8208;step lithium&#8208;related electrochemical reduction, converting it sequentially into Li2CO3 and Li2O. Li2O is then oxidized to produce O2 gas at the expense of renewable electrical energy. This process achieves an impressive O2 yield exceeding 94.7%, significantly outperforming the efficiency of natural photosynthesis. Moreover, the O2 yield can be further increased to 98.6% by employing an optimized RuCo catalyst. This study offers a new practical and controllable pathway to produce O2 from CO2, strongly promoting the sustainable development of human society for realizing carbon neutrality as well as exploring and conquering nature.

         <title>A General and Mild Two&#8208;Step Strategy Using Bioderived Diols and CO2 for Chemically Recyclable Polycarbonates and Closed&#8208;Loop CO2 Fixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and mild two&#8208;step synthetic strategy was developed to synthesize chemically recyclable polycarbonates for CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. This approach involves the synthesis of a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers from bio&#8208;derived diols and CO2, followed by organocatalytic living/controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization.








Abstract
Developing chemically recyclable polymers using CO2 and sustainable co&#8208;feedstocks is an important strategy for achieving carbon&#8208;neutral production of new polymers and mitigating plastic pollution. Herein, a series of six&#8208;membered cyclic carbonate monomers with different alkyl &#945;&#8208;substituents were synthesized using CO2 and bioderived 1,3&#8208;alkanediol as raw materials at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization was systematically studied using a range of common and readily available organocatalysts. Phosphazene base (t&#8208;BuP2) was identified as the most effective catalyst, offering excellent control over the entire polymerization. The regioselectivity of the synthesized polycarbonates, ranged from 0.74 to 0.99, with the highest value achieved when the side group was isopropyl (highest steric hindrance). Notably, the &#945;&#8208;substituent in the monomers reduced the ring strains, allowing the resulting polycarbonates to be fully recycled to the monomers without decarboxylation. The recycling process effectively traps CO2 in a closed loop between monomers and polymers, preventing its release into the atmosphere. The alkyl side groups enhanced the hydrophobicity of the polycarbonates, thereby reducing the likelihood of CO2 release through hydrolysis during their lifecycle, achieving a robust CO2 closed&#8208;loop fixation. The utility of CO2&#8208;based aliphatic polycarbonates as adhesives and the ability of copolymerization with l&#8208;lactide were explored.

The utility of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based aliphatic polycarbonates as adhesives and the ability of copolymerization with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lactide were explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoisomerization of Azobenzene&#8208;Extended Charybdotoxin for the Optical Control of Kv1.2 Potassium Channel Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Click&#8208;chemistry compatible azobenzenes are synthesized and coupled on various positions at the surface of a disulfide&#8208;bridged natural peptide. Monomers and dimers are produced and linked by azobenzene. The impact of azobenzene photoswitching on the ion channel blocking potency of the peptide is evaluated and revealed that proper positioning leads to successful photomodulation.








Abstract
Natural peptides from animal venoms effectively modulate ion channel activity. While photoswitches regulate small compound pharmacology, their application to natural peptides rich in disulfide bridges and active on ion channels is novel due to larger pharmacophores. A pilot study integrating azobenzene photoswitches into charybdotoxin (ChTx), known for blocking potassium channels is initiated. Two click&#8208;chemistry&#8208;compatible azobenzene are synthesized differing in length and amide orientation (Az1 &amp; Az2). Az1 is grafted onto ChTx at various amino acid positions using L&#8208;azidohomoalanine mutation. ChTx monomers outperformed dimers, particularly with azobenzene at position 14, by exhibiting optimal photoswitching activity. In the cis configuration, Az1 altered ChTx's pharmacophore, reducing potassium channel blockage, while conversely, Az2 increased ChTx potency. This study pioneers photoswitch application to complex peptides, leveraging structure&#8208;activity relationships. Successful integration depends on precise azobenzene positioning and chemical grafting guided by SAR insights. This advancement underscores the adaptability of photoswitch technology to intricate peptide structures, offering new avenues for pharmacological modulation.

         <title>Chlorinated Bithiophene Imide&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers: Synthesis, Structure&#8211;Property Correlations, and Applications in Organic Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, ClBTI and ClBTI2, were developed, and the n&#8208;type polymers built from them showed ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility. Ternary all&#8208;polymer solar cells fabricated using them as the third component delivered power conversion efficiencies up to 19.35%, much higher than that (15.84%) of the binary one.








Abstract
Developing electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes with optimized geometries and electronic properties is imperative for advancing n&#8208;type polymers and organic electronic devices. We report here the design and synthesis of two chlorinated imide&#8208;functionalized electron&#8208;deficient heteroarenes, namely chlorine&#8208;substituted bithiophene imide (ClBTI) and its fused dimer (ClBTI2). The corresponding polymers show a near&#8208;planar framework, appropriate frontier molecular orbital levels, and good solubility. When integrated into organic thin&#8208;film transistors, ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer afforded unipolar electron mobility of up to 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6 and new polymers show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 1%. Interestingly, by introducing these polymers with ordered structure, high crystallinity, and sizable electron mobility as the third component into the host system PM6:PY&#8208;IT, continuous interpenetrating networks with large fibrillar structures can be formed. Investigations of charge transfer kinetics and energy loss analyses unveiled that ClBTI2&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer P(ClBTI2&#8208;BTI) enables optimized charge transport, reduced charge recombination, and minimized non&#8208;radiative loss within the all&#8208;polymer ternary blends, yielding a remarkable PCE of 19.35% (certified: 19.20%) through optimizing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PM6:PY&#8208;IT blend. The structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationships provide valuable insights into the design of electron&#8208;deficient (hetero)arenes and n&#8208;type polymers, marking a great progress in the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers for organic electronic devices.

         <title>Formation and Metallomimetic Reactivity of a Transient Dicoordinate Alkylborylene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Generation of the first metal&#8208;free dicoordinate alkylborylene, [(CAAC)BCy] (CAAC&#160;=&#160;cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl), is reported. This species exhibits metallomimetic reactivity with donor ligands and dihydrogen and is more reactive than amino counterparts. Metallomimetic chemistry of the carbonyl&#8208;ligated borylene [(CAAC)BCy(CO)] is also demonstrated. 








Abstract
While existing literature has primarily focused on carbene&#8208;stabilized amino&#8208; and arylborylenes of the form [(carbene)BR] (R&#160;=&#160;substituent), herein we report the generation and metallomimetic reactivity of the first carbene&#8208;stabilized alkylborylene [(CAACMe)BCy] (CAACMe&#160;=&#160;1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethylpyrrolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, Cy&#160;=&#160;cyclohexyl). Furthermore, the transition metal&#8208;like decarbonylation reactions of a borylene complex, [(CAACMe)BCy(CO)], derived from borylene [(CAACMe)BCy] and CO, are described. Additional findings described include i) the identification of the coordination stages of the ligand to boron towards forming complexes [(CAACMe)BCyL] in the reduction route from starting material [(CAACMe)BCyBr2] and in the photolysis route from carbonyl complex [(CAACMe)BCy(CO], and ii) insights from quantum&#8208;chemical computations regarding the molecular and electronic structure of the borylene at various stages.

         <title>Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Ammonia Synthesis by Using Zero&#8208;Valent Metal Powder with Alcohols or Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we discovered the first molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation with inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle zero&#8208;valent metal powders and alcohols or water in the presence of a catalytic amount of samarium compounds, where more than 1000 equiv of ammonia were formed based on the molybdenum atom of the catalyst. 








Abstract
We have recently achieved a highly effective ammonia formation from dinitrogen using samarium diiodide and water under ambient reaction conditions. However, further research is needed to establish a carbon&#8208;free green ammonia production route without carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, we have developed a novel molybdenum&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation method using a combination of zero&#8208;valent metal powders as reductants and alcohols or H2O as a proton source under ambient reaction conditions. In this reaction system, samarium compounds serve as crucial electron mediators for the molybdenum complexes. Remarkably, the combination of zinc powder and water in the presence of samarium triiodide facilitates highly selective ammonia production over dihydrogen under ambient reaction conditions, yielding up to 900 equiv of ammonia per Mo atom in the catalyst. Intriguingly, using magnesium powder, known for its potent reducing capability, reduces the requisite amount of samarium compounds to catalytic levels. We believe that the novel insights gained from this reaction system represent a substantial step toward achieving green ammonia production.

         <title>Explainable Synthesizability Prediction of Inorganic Crystal Polymorphs Using Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We utilized LLMs for structure&#8208;based general synthesizability prediction along with their explanations. Fine&#8208;tuned LLMs and LLM&#8208;embedding&#8208;based bespoke ML models showed promising performance compared to the traditional graph&#8208;based bespoke ML models. Furthermore, fine&#8208;tuned LLMs can provide explainability by inferring the reasons for determining the synthesizability with simple prompts. 








Abstract
We evaluate the ability of machine learning to predict whether a hypothetical crystal structure can be synthesized and explain those predictions to scientists. Fine&#8208;tuned large language models (LLMs) trained on a human&#8208;readable text description of the target crystal structure perform comparably to previous bespoke convolutional graph neural network methods, but better prediction quality can be achieved by training a positive&#8208;unlabeled learning model on a text&#8208;embedding representation of the structure. An LLM&#8208;based workflow can then be used to generate human&#8208;readable explanations for the types of factors governing synthesizability, extract the underlying physical rules, and assess the veracity of those rules. These explanations can guide chemists in modifying or optimizing non&#8208;synthesizable hypothetical structures to make them more feasible for materials design.

         <title>Trap&#8208;Enabled Long Exciton Lifetime in Low&#8208;Toxicity Quantum Dots for Enhanced Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing surface traps onto the low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based quantum dots, the excitation energy circulates between exciton states and trap states, leading to trap&#8208;state&#8208;mediated thermally activated delayed photoluminescence. The applications of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition reaction were achieved by leveraging the long excited&#8208;state lifetime of delayed photoluminescence.








Abstract
Prolonging exciton lifetime in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is crucial to their photochemical applications. Previously, this was achieved through a mechanism called thermally activated delayed photoluminescence (TADPL) for QDs surface&#8208;anchored with molecular triplet energy acceptors, in which the molecular triplets sensitized by QDs can repopulate QD&#8208;excitons through thermally activated reverse energy transfer. Here, we demonstrate a novel TADPL mechanism achieved by engineering the surface trap states of QDs. Rapid exciton trapping and thermally activated slow detrapping prolong the exciton lifetime of low&#8208;toxicity ZnSe&#8208;based QDs from the timescale of &#8764;10&#160;ns to &#8764;100&#160;&#181;s. Such a long exciton lifetime allows direct engagement of QDs in diffusion&#8208;assisted energy transfer, without needing surface&#8208;anchored molecules as triplet transmitters, for solution&#8208;phase photochemical applications such as photon upconversion and [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition. This advantage not only greatly streamlines the design of QD&#8208;based photochemical systems but also avoids the reliability issue associated with the anchoring between QDs and molecules, as well as enabling facile tuning of the TADPL wavelength range not limited by the availability of molecular triplet acceptors.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Covalent Organic Framework With Rich Redox Active Sites as Cathode Material for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline truxenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites has been designed and prepared. Experiments and calculations reveal that C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups are active sites during discharge/charge processes. The TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can store 27 Li+ ions in one ring and deliver a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1. This work provides a facile method to achieve high&#8208;capacity COF cathodes for lithium batteries.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been regarded as promising cathode materials for lithium batteries. However, they generally show low practical capacity. Here, the design, preparation, and battery application of a highly crystalline 2D truxenone&#8208;based COF (TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF) with rich redox active sites, realizing a high practical capacity is reported. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the lithiation reaction proceeds successively on C&#9552;O and C&#9552;N groups of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF. One ring of TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF can theoretically store 27 Li+ ions through two stages. Consequently, the highly crystalline TRO&#8208;BT&#8208;COF displays a high discharge capacity of 435 mAh g&#8722;1 when used as a cathode material for lithium batteries. This work provides a facile approach to achieve COF electrode materials with high practical capacity for lithium batteries.

         <title>Highly Ordered Polymorphism of Small Molecule Acceptor Delivering Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach employing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive enables the formation of highly ordered BTP&#8208;eC9 polymorphic crystals at low annealing temperatures. This enhances PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 active layer morphology, achieving a PCE of 20.32% with antireflection layers and exceptional device stability, advancing scalable strategies for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Advancements in narrow bandgap organic small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has promoted organic solar cell (OSC) efficiencies beyond 20%. Achieving this milestone necessitates precise control over the active layer morphology, particularly its crystallinity and phase distribution, to optimize light absorption, charge transport, and suppress charge recombination. However, controlling SMA morphology remains a significant challenge due to their strong aggregation tendency. Existing methods, including high&#8208;temperature annealing, and introducing high boiling point additives, frequently yield disordered polymorphs with limited scalability. Here, we report a novel approach of utilizing 4&#8208;bromochlorobenzene as a volatile solid additive to induce the formation of a highly ordered polymorph of BTP&#8208;eC9 through mild annealing at 60 &#176;C. This marks the first demonstration of such an ordered SMA polymorph, exhibiting optical properties comparable to ideal crystals, including enhanced anisotropy, refractive index, and extinction coefficients. The specific polymorph further enables the formation of a well&#8208;organized PM6 donor arrangement, establishing an optimal bicontinuous network morphology. Consequently, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.53%, which further increases to 20.32% with the addition of an antireflection layer. This work provides a scalable and effective strategy for enhancing OSC performance and highlights the critical role of polymorphism in optimizing photovoltaic performance.

         <title>Prediction and Validation of Mechanical Flexibility in Molecular Crystals: Dispersion Interactions Dictate Bending</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational prediction of mechanical flexibility in molecular crystals based on anisotropy in interaction topology and their experimental validation reveals certain fundamental features of the origin of bending. Analyses based on interaction anisotropy indices and interaction components show that despite stronger electrostatic motifs, the bending in these crystals is still governed by dispersion forces. 








Abstract
Mechanically flexible crystals are a rapidly growing class of functional molecular materials. Typically, such flexible crystals are discovered by serendipity. Herein, we have predicted mechanical flexibility in a series of molecular crystals based on a structure screening approach that combines interaction topology and the presence of nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interactions&#8212;a supramolecular motif hitherto not associated with bending property. Further, we have experimentally validated plastic/elastic bending properties in a series of crystal structures thus predicted. However, four out of five of these crystals showed the bending direction along &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking despite the fact that the direction of strongest interaction anisotropy was rendered by the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interaction motifs. This is contrary to the commonly perceived anisotropy model and underscores the dominant role of dispersion forces over the electrostatically stabilized motifs in dictating the bending phenomena in molecular crystals. The interaction energies of these motifs have been evaluated using accurate structures from X&#8208;ray quantum crystallography. Analyses combining elastic tensors, interaction anisotropy indices, thermal expansion studies, and high&#8208;pressure simulations quantify the relative roles of the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile motif and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking in mechanical flexibility. Our results point to the possibility of expanding the realm of flexible molecular materials to novel structural types aided by predictive computational models.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically flexible crystals are a rapidly growing class of functional molecular materials. Typically, such flexible crystals are discovered by serendipity. Herein, we have predicted mechanical flexibility in a series of molecular crystals based on a structure screening approach that combines interaction topology and the presence of nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interactions&#8212;a supramolecular motif hitherto not associated with bending property. Further, we have experimentally validated plastic/elastic bending properties in a series of crystal structures thus predicted. However, four out of five of these crystals showed the bending direction along &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking despite the fact that the direction of strongest interaction anisotropy was rendered by the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile interaction motifs. This is contrary to the commonly perceived anisotropy model and underscores the dominant role of dispersion forces over the electrostatically stabilized motifs in dictating the bending phenomena in molecular crystals. The interaction energies of these motifs have been evaluated using accurate structures from X-ray quantum crystallography. Analyses combining elastic tensors, interaction anisotropy indices, thermal expansion studies, and high-pressure simulations quantify the relative roles of the nitrile&#183;&#183;&#183;nitrile motif and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking in mechanical flexibility. Our results point to the possibility of expanding the realm of flexible molecular materials to novel structural types aided by predictive computational models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Compensating K Ions Through an Organic Salt in Electrolytes for Practical K&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
KSCN, with a low decomposition potential and high solubility in electrolytes, undergoes an oxidative reaction at 3.6&#160;V during the initial charging, releasing active K&#8208;ion and an electrolyte cosolvent (SCN)2. This electrolyte&#8208;based K&#8208;ion compensation approach is compatible with the entire battery system, allowing seamlessly integration into existing battery technologies.








Abstract
K&#8208;ion batteries face significant challenges due to a severe shortage of active K ions, with cathode materials typically containing less than 70%&#160;K ions and first&#8208;cycle irreversible reactions consuming up to 20% more. Conventional K&#8208;ion compensation methods fail to supply sufficient K ions without compromising cell integrity. To address this, we introduce potassium sulfocyanate (KSCN) as an electrolyte additive capable of delivering up to 100% active K ions. During initial charging, KSCN undergoes oxidative decomposition at 3.6&#160;V, releasing active K ions and forming the cosolvent thiocyanogen ((SCN)2). This molecule, meeting diverse electrochemical properties, was identified using unsupervised machine learning and cheminformatics. The approach demonstrated full KSCN conversion and excellent compatibility with all cell components. The presence of (SCN)2 cosolvent enhanced the rate capability of anodes by promoting K&#8208;ion desolvation. In a hard carbon|K0.5Mg0.15[Mn0.8Mg0.05]O2 pouch cell, this approach tripled the capacity through supplying 58% active K ions, showcasing a practical solution for active K&#8208;ion compensation in K&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Shelled Hollow Covalent Organic Framework Nanospheres for Stable Potassium Storage</title>

A template&#8208;free synthesis of MH&#8208;COFs is reported. Treating the designed crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneous covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with acetic acid solution produces hollow COFs. Subsequent expansion through seeded growth and acid treatment yields MH&#8208;COFs, whose applied implication is demonstrated by an MH&#8208;COFs/S composite as stable high&#8208;capacity K&#8208;ion battery anodes. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;shelled hollow covalent organic framework nanospheres (MH&#8208;COFs) with at least two shells integrate the merits of the porous crystalline covalent organic framework (COF) matrix with the complex hollow architecture, which can motivate new functions for exceptional performance. However, the fabrication of MH&#8208;COFs is still uncultivated and remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile template&#8208;free protocol for the general synthesis of different MH&#8208;COFs by controlling the simultaneous processes of surface crystallization and core etching of the crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity nanospheres of COFs precursor. The crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity solid covalent organic polymer nanospheres (COPs) with robust crystalline surface but vulnerable amorphous core were designed. Subsequently, an acetic acid aqueous solution treatment of crystalline&#8208;inhomogeneity COPs not only induced selective etching of the vulnerable cores but also promote the further crystallization of the surface layers, thereby producing hollow COFs. A further step&#8208;by&#8208;step expansion of seeded growth for inhomogeneous COP layers and then similar acid solution treatment can output the intriguing MH&#8208;COFs. An extraordinarily stable K&#8208;ion battery anode with high capacity was demonstrated with a MH&#8208;COFs/S nanocomposite fabricated by covalently bonding chain sulfur into the MH&#8208;COFs matrix. This work opened a simple but powerful avenue in designing complex hollow COFs architectures to boost their potential for applications.

         <title>Electronic Excitation and High&#8208;Energy Reactions Originate From Anionic Microdroplets Formed by Electrospray or Pneumatic Nebulization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

Droplet evaporation can lead to ion emission or droplet fission. In negatively charged droplets, charge can also be lost through electron emission. These ejected electrons can subsequently lead to ionization or electronic excitation in excess of 10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Formation of energetic species at the surface of aqueous microdroplets, including abundant hydroxyl radicals, oxidation products, and ionized N2 and O2 gas, has been previously attributed to the high electric field at the droplet surface. Here, evidence for a new mechanism for electronic excitation involving electron emission from negatively charged water droplets is shown. Droplet evaporation can lead to the emission of ions and droplet fission, but unlike positively charged droplets, negatively charged droplets can also shed charge by electron emission. With nanoelectrospray, no anions or negatively charged droplets are produced with a positive electrospray potential. In contrast, abundant O2+&#8226; and H3O+(H2O) are formed with negative electrospray. When toluene vapor is introduced with negative electrospray, abundant toluene radical cations and fragments are produced. Both O2+&#8226; and toluene radical cations are produced with pneumatic nebulization. The electrons produced from evaporating negatively charged droplets can be accelerated by an external electric field in electrospray, or by the field generated between droplets with opposite polarities produced by pneumatic nebulization. This electron emission/ionization mechanism leads to electronic excitation &gt;10&#160;eV, and it may explain some of the surprising chemistries that were previously attributed to the high intrinsic electric field at the surface of aqueous droplets.

IC&#8208;FPOMP (In&#8208;Cell Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Membrane Proteins) enables rapid, free&#8208;radical footprinting upon laser irradiation of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) in live cells by using TiO&#8322; nanoparticles or H2O2. IC&#8208;FP achieves broad coverage on a human glucose transporter and an enzyme (gamma glutamyl carboxylase), revealing conformational dynamics and interactions with drugs.








Abstract
Integral membrane proteins (IMPs) are pivotal for cellular functions but challenging to investigate. Here, IC&#8208;FPOMP (in&#8208;cell fast photochemical oxidation of MPs) is introduced, a method enabling in situ footprinting of IMPs within live cells. IC&#8208;FPOMP generates reactive oxygen radicals from various precursors (TiO2 nanoparticles or H2O2) near the membrane. Leveraging a laser and a 96&#8208;well plate platform, high&#8208;throughput and rapid footprinting of IMPs are achieved. IC&#8208;FPOMP of two human IMPs (human glucose transporter&#8208;hGLUT1 and human gamma&#8208;glutamyl carboxylase&#8208;hGGCX) are successful, providing footprinting of both the transmembrane and extramembrane regions. Comparative analysis of hGLUT1 in liposomes versus cells shows that the membrane may impact the transporter&#8216;s conformation differently. In&#8208;cell drug screening targeting hGLUT1 reveals drug&#8208;binding behavior in vivo. In summary, IC&#8208;FPOMP offers insights into IMP structure&#8208;function relationships in cells and facilitates drug discovery.

This work demonstrates an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise electrostatic catalysis, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and reveal the crucial role of the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This study offers a unique route to discover novel phenomena and unveil the intrinsic mechanisms in the processes of material transformation and life activities.








Abstract
A central goal of chemical mechanism research is to provide a comprehensive interpretation of chemical reaction pathways to clarify the evolution patterns of reactions. In this work, we present an unprecedented comprehensive monitoring of the elementary reaction pathways of the SN1 solvolysis on an in situ real&#8208;time single&#8208;molecule electrical detection platform. Through precise control of oriented external electric fields, we capture two short&#8208;lived protonated intermediates at the single&#8208;molecule level and elucidate their roles in the reaction. Both temperature&#8208; and isotope&#8208;dependent experiments, in combination with theoretical simulations, reveal crucial roles for the hydrogen&#8208;bonded acetic&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated triple&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer and the proton tunneling effect in the interconversion of these two intermediates. This work highlights the precise manipulation of chemical reactions by electrostatic fields and opens up a universal route to discover unknown intermediates or novel phenomena in the processes of material transformation and life activities.

         <title>Size Effect of Surface Defects Dictates Reactivity for Nitrogen Electrofixation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Medium&#8208;sized defects on VOx surfaces achieve an optimal synergy between electronic and geometric properties, enhancing N2 adsorption, activation, and hydrogenation while effectively suppressing HER. This results in remarkable eNRR activity and selectivity. A well&#8208;defined structure&#8211;activity relationship underscores the critical role of defect size in eNRR performance. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) offers a sustainable pathway for ammonia (NH3) production. Defect engineering enhances eNRR activity but can concurrently amplify the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), posing challenges for achieving high selectivity. Herein, VOx with systematically tuned defect sizes is engineered to establish a structure&#8211;activity relationship between defect size and eNRR performance. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that medium&#8208;sized defects (VOx&#8208;MD, 1&#8211;2 nm) provide an optimal electronic environment for enhanced N2 adsorption and activation while maintaining spatial flexibility to facilitate efficient hydrogenation. Consequently, VOx&#8208;MD exhibits outstanding eNRR performance, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 81.94&#160;&#177; 1.45&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 31.97&#160;&#177; 0.75&#160;% at &#8722;0.5 V (vs RHE). These findings highlight the critical role of defect size in governing eNRR activity, offering a scalable strategy for designing advanced catalysts for competitve electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioconvergent Hydroallylation of Acrylates Enabled by &#947;&#8208;Silyl&#8208;Substituted Allyl Acetates</title>

         <dc:description>
Regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation of acylates under Cu/Pd synergistic catalysis is reported. The incorporation of a silyl group into allyl acetates precisely controls regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity through steric hindrance. Subsequent transformation of the silyl group in the product enables the regioselective synthesis of allylated products bearing two distinct yet structurally similar aryl groups.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution provides an efficient route to chiral organic molecules featuring an allyl moiety, key intermediates in the synthesis of biologically active compounds. However, the use of unsymmetrical 1,3&#8208;disubstituted allyl electrophiles has been severely constrained by the challenges of achieving both regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity simultaneously. Herein, we present &#947;&#8208;silyl&#8208;substituted allyl acetates as highly effective electrophiles for a regio&#8208; and enantioconvergent hydroallylation, enabling the construction of vicinal stereogenic centers. This method delivers allylated products in 44%&#8211;93% yield with 79:21 to &gt;95:5 dr and 88% to &gt;99% ee. Additionally, the silyl group in the products can be readily converted into other functional groups, such as acyl and aryl groups, enhancing their synthetic utility.

         <title>Spin Polarization&#8208;Boosting Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics and Exciton Dissociation in Fe Nanoparticle&#8208;Loading Graphitic Carbon Nitride Toward Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin polarization of electrons is introduced to accelerate the exciton dissociation&#160;and the spin&#8208;selective electron transfer in CN/Fe nanohybrids to enhance selective CO2 photoreduction into CO, during which the oxidized Fe2+/Fe3+ pairs on the surface of Fe nanoparticles serve as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via double exchange interaction.








Abstract
The regulation of exciton properties plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity of photocatalysts, primarily due to the rapid recombination of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs caused by the strong Coulomb interaction between them. In this study, we explore the spin polarization effect in nanohybrids composed of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324;) and iron (Fe) nanoparticles, which accelerates exciton dissociation and spin&#8208;selective electron transfer, thereby improving the selective photoreduction of CO&#8322; into CO. Mechanistic studies reveal that the Fe2&#8314;/Fe3&#8314; redox pairs, embedded in the iron oxide layer on the surface of Fe nanoparticles, function as ultrafast charge transfer shuttles via a double exchange interaction (Fe2&#8314;&#9472;O&#9472;Fe3&#8314;). This process facilitates spin&#8208;selective electron transfer from g&#8208;C&#8323;N&#8324; to Fe species, thereby contributing to the efficient conversion of CO&#8322;. This work provides novel insights into the design of spin&#8208;dependent photocatalysts for efficient solar energy conversion.

         <title>Regulating the Dynamics of Interpenetrated Porous Frameworks for Inverse C2H6/C2H4 Separation at Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable porous crystal has demonstrated an unprecedented ability for inverse separation of C2H6/C2H4 at 328&#160;K, as the shifting degree of the H&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks, which determines the width of the narrow neck, can be finely regulated under the gas stimulus across a broad and elevated temperature range.








Abstract
Selective adsorption of ethane (C2H6) from mixtures containing ethylene (C2H4) is of interest for the direct production of high purity C2H4. However, the extremely similar molecular properties of these gases make this process challenging, particularly at elevated temperatures, an implication of saved energy consumption. To address such challenge, we present a new approach for regulating the temperature&#8208;dependent dynamics in hydrogen&#8208;bonded interpenetrated frameworks. As a single H&#8208;bond linked interpenetrated porous framework, NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 exhibits emerging structural dynamics in response to C2H6 (37&#160;kPa) and C2H4 (53&#160;kPa) and has shown a record ability to produce polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 (15.7&#160;mL g&#8722;1) at 328&#160;K, as the shifting of the interpenetrated frameworks here requires a relatively weak stimulus, allowing the optimization of adsorption at a higher temperatures range. Meanwhile, the robust and conveniently prepared NTU&#8208;101&#8208;NH2 shows good cyclic separation performance. In comparison, the framework response of the percussor NTU&#8208;101, connected by three H&#8208;bonds, occurs at 293&#160;K and has a moderate separation ability (10.2&#160;mL g&#8722;1).

     alt="Regulating the Dynamics of Interpenetrated Porous Frameworks for Inverse C2H6/C2H4 Separation at Elevated Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A robust and scalable porous crystal has demonstrated an unprecedented ability for inverse separation of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; at 328&#160;K, as the shifting degree of the H-bonded interpenetrated frameworks, which determines the width of the narrow neck, can be finely regulated under the gas stimulus across a broad and elevated temperature range.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective adsorption of ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) from mixtures containing ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is of interest for the direct production of high purity C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the extremely similar molecular properties of these gases make this process challenging, particularly at elevated temperatures, an implication of saved energy consumption. To address such challenge, we present a new approach for regulating the temperature-dependent dynamics in hydrogen-bonded interpenetrated frameworks. As a single H-bond linked interpenetrated porous framework, &lt;b&gt;NTU-101-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits emerging structural dynamics in response to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (37&#160;kPa) and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (53&#160;kPa) and has shown a record ability to produce polymer-grade C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (15.7&#160;mL g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 328&#160;K, as the shifting of the interpenetrated frameworks here requires a relatively weak stimulus, allowing the optimization of adsorption at a higher temperatures range. Meanwhile, the robust and conveniently prepared &lt;b&gt;NTU-101-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; shows good cyclic separation performance. In comparison, the framework response of the percussor &lt;b&gt;NTU-101&lt;/b&gt;, connected by three H-bonds, occurs at 293&#160;K and has a moderate separation ability (10.2&#160;mL g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work showcases the first adsorbent for direct C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; purification at elevated temperatures, and the insights into the hydrogen-bonded frameworks will pave the way for designing soft families capable of challenging separations with reduced energy requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spiro&#8208;Driven Ferroelectric Coordination Polymer Exhibiting Distinct Phase Transitions Under Thermal and Pressure Stimuli</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the first example of a 1D spiro&#8208;based ferroelectric coordination polymer, which exhibits distinct phase transitions under thermal or pressure stimuli, triggered by the flipping of a spiro ring fragment as well as the deformation of the main chain.








Abstract
Controllable strategies for the design of molecular ferroelectrics have been actively pursued in recent years due to their promising applications in modern electronic devices. In this work, we present a spiro&#8208;driven approach for the design of a new class of molecular ferroelectrics. Using 2&#8208;morpholinoethanol (MEO) as a bidentate chelating ligand and the SCN&#8315; anion as a bridging co&#8208;ligand, we obtained a neutral chain&#8208;like ferroelectric coordination polymer, [Cd(MEO)(SCN)&#8322;]. Interestingly, it undergoes both a thermal&#8208;induced phase transition, driven by ring&#8208;conformational flipping of the spiro&#8208;like [Cd(MEO)] fragment, and a pressure&#8208;induced transition, triggered by significant deformation of the spring&#8208;like [Cd(SCN)&#8322;]&#8734; helical chain. Unlike most previously reported ferroelectric coordination polymers, which often rely on organic cationic guests, this work introduces a new avenue for designing neutral ferroelectric coordination polymers. Overall, the spiro&#8208;driven strategy provides valuable insights and a novel structural motif for the development of advanced molecular ferroelectrics.

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly for Bimodal In Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, rationally designed self&#8208;assembled dyes are introduced&#8212;which offer controllable aggregate sizes and tunable NIR absorption and emission&#8212;as a unique and efficient platform for simultaneous multimodal [fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI)] and multiscale (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) biomedical imaging.








Abstract
Contrast agents (CAs) are essential in biomedical imaging to aid in the diagnosis and therapy monitoring of disease. However, they are typically restricted to one imaging modality and have fixed properties such as size, shape, toxicity profile, or photophysical characteristics, which hampers a comprehensive view of biological processes. Herein, rationally designed dye assemblies are introduced as a unique CA platform for simultaneous multimodal and multiscale biomedical imaging. To this end, a series of amphiphilic aza&#8208;BODIPY dyes are synthesized with varying hydrophobic domains (C1, C8, C12, and C16) that self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into nanostructures of tunable size (50&#160;nm&#8211;1&#160;&#181;m) and photophysical properties. While C1 exhibits oblique&#8208;type exciton coupling and negligible emission, C8&#8208;C16 bearing longer alkyl chains undergo J&#8208;type aggregation with NIR absorption and emission and excellent photoacoustic properties. Given these advantageous features, aza&#8208;BODIPY specific, semi&#8208;quantitative fluorescence reflectance and photoacoustic imaging both in vitro and in vivo are established. Additionally, in vitro cell viability as well as murine in vivo biodistribution analysis with ex vivo validation showed excellent biocompatibility and a size&#8208;dependent biodistribution of nanostructures to different organ beds. These results broaden the scope of aqueous self&#8208;assembly to multimodal imaging and highlight its great potential for rationalizing numerous biomedical questions.

         <title>Assembly of Functionalized Organic Fragments via Reductive Activation and (Cross)&#8208;Coupling of C2H4, CO, CO2 and/or H2 Using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>

A dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of N2 acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; source of a dimagnesium(I) diradical in formal reductive coupling and cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving various combinations of the simple gaseous small molecules, C2H4, CO, CO2, and H2. A range of more complex &#8220;value&#8208;added&#8221; organic fragments have been accessed from these processes.








Abstract
Reactions of 1,2&#8208;dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), formed by the two&#8208;electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross&#8208;coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;C2H4)] with CO2 led to the insertion of CO2 into both Mg&#9472;C bonds and all Mg&#9472;N bonds, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to the insertion of CO2 into all Mg&#9472;N bonds of the magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON&#8208;C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(&#956;&#8208;O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] with a CO2 analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]&#8734;. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;H)}2] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON&#8208;CO2)Mg}(&#956;&#8208;O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross&#8208;coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value&#8208;added organic fragments.

When treated with THF this yields monomeric [{K(THF)(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg(THF)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In contrast, C&#9472;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; analog, i.e., the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed radical intermediate gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg{(CyN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH}]&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;. Reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg(&#956;-H)}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)Mg}(&#956;-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH)]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has inserted into only one Mg&#9472;N bond of each &lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON ligand. This study highlights the capacity of [{K(&lt;sup&gt;TCHP&lt;/sup&gt;NON)Mg}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross-coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to give value-added organic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing Propylene Epoxidation: the Role of Ethyl Acetate Autoxidation via Cobalt&#8208;Nickel Catalyzed C(acyl)&#9472;O Bond Scission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cobalt/nickel catalytic aerobic epoxidation of propylene is described, where the autoxidation of carboxyl esters, as in ethyl acetate, ultimately provides peracetic acid as the oxidizing reagent, resulting in a remarkable epoxide selectivity. The confirmed Co(III)/Co(II) active center is stabilized through its interaction with nickel, involvement in the oxidation of the ethoxy radical (an intermediate from the ester C&#9472;O bond cleavage), as well as the single&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen.








Abstract
The selective autoxidation for the synthesis of valuable oxygenates has provoked keen interest from both academic and industrial sectors. Although the generation of reactive oxygen species via oxygen attack on C&#9472;H bonds near ester linkages is well&#8208;established, research into aliphatic ester oxidation has primarily focused on combustion, neglecting their potential utility in oxidation processes. Herein, a protocol for producing propylene oxide through the autoxidation of ethyl acetate in tandem with propylene epoxidation is demonstrated. The ethoxy radical, generated by ester C(acyl)&#9472;O bond cleavage in situ, subsequently underwent proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer with the Co(OAc)(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2Ni, followed by the formation of the peracetic acid optimally suited for the epoxidation reaction. The research not only eliminates the need for co&#8208;substrates in the epoxidation process but also fills the application gap in bulk&#8208;ester autoxidation, offering insights into the effective utilization of oxy&#8208;intermediates in autoxidation reactions.

         <title>Controlled Anodic Decomposition Pathway of Supramolecular Lithium Borate for Rationally Tuned Interphase Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular lithium borate which features a polydentate structure is reported here. The reversible supramolecular chelating/de&#8208;chelating of Li&#8314; enables the sequentially controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. Therefore, a homogeneous and robust cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters and LiF is rationally fabricated. The precise control over interfacial chemistry significantly enhances interfacial protection, thereby improving battery cycling stability.








Abstract
The rational tailoring and molecular&#8208;level engineering of stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) is paramount to advancing the performance of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy, layered nickel&#8208;rich oxide&#8208;based lithium metal batteries. However, developing well&#8208;tailored electrolyte additives with rationally controlled interfacial chemistry remains highly challenging. Here, two lithium borates: lithium (2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)trifluoroborate (C&#8208;LiMCFB) and lithium (15&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2,5,8,11,14&#8208;pentaoxahexadecan)trifluoroborate (L&#8208;LiMCFB), incorporating cyclic 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (15C5) and linear pentaethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEGME) as respective host groups tethered to the boron center are designed and synthesized. In C&#8208;LiMCFB, the supramolecular polydentate chelation/de&#8208;chelation of the 15C5 with Li+ can sequentially deactivate/activate the anodic decomposition of the C&#9472;O bonds, therefore leading to the controlled cleavage pathway of B&#9472;O and C&#9472;O bonds. The controlled interfacial chemistry leads to the formation of a uniform CEI layer, rich in lithium boron&#8211;oxygen clusters interwoven with LiF, on the NCM811 surface. This novel CEI configuration demonstrates an exceptional balance of mechanical robustness, adhesiveness, and toughness, providing highly desirable protection for the NCM811 cathode. The discovery of these novel supramolecular boron&#8208;based lithium salts not only unlocks supramolecular chemistry for rational electrolyte tuning but also provides a deeper understanding of the CEI formation mechanism in high&#8208;energy lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208; and Cerium&#8208;Mediated C&#9472;C Bond Cleavage for the Deconstructive Diversification of Cyclic Acids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of strained and non&#8208;strained cyclic tertiary acids (3&#8211;12&#8208;membered rings) under Ce/photocatalysis, with air as the sole oxidant, is reported. This strategy enables the construction of C&#9472;CN, carbon&#8211;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and carbon&#9472;oxime bonds to form various functionalized carbonyl compounds. Late&#8208;stage modifications generate valuable molecular modules, providing a pathway for antipsychotic drug synthesis. 








Abstract
The selective cleavage of inert carbon&#8208;carbon bonds in unstrained rings continues to pose a formidable challenge in chemical synthesis. Current methods for C(sp3) &#9472;C(sp3) bond cleavage are highly limited, typically relying on transition&#8208;metal catalysis to facilitate ring&#8208;opening via small&#8208;ring strain or inducing &#946;&#8208;fragmentation after generating radicals from oxygen or nitrogen atoms pre&#8208;installed in the substrate. Herein, we introduce an effective strategy for the decarboxylative ring&#8208;opening functionalization of &#945;&#8208;trisubstituted carboxylic acids, mediated by both light and cerium. This method enables the ring&#8208;opening of carboxylic acids with ring sizes ranging from 3 to 12 members, allowing the construction of C&#9472;CN, C&#8208;halide, C&#9472;C, C&#9472;Se, and C&#9472;oxime bonds. Notably, this reaction does not require the pre&#8208;installation of an oxygen atom in the substrate, as the carbonyl group is derived from atmospheric oxygen. Furthermore, late&#8208;stage modification establishes distally functionalized carbonyl compounds, which serve as versatile synthons for accessing valuable building blocks.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel layered 2D FeWN2 electrocatalyst with a rock&#8208;salt structure and abundant antisite defects is designed to enhance the electrocatalytic upgrading of ascorbic acid (AA) to dehydroascorbic acid (DHA). The presence of antisite defects effectively modulates the electronic structure, facilitating the activation of enol groups in AA.








Abstract
Hydrogen production from biomass electro&#8208;oxidation offers a promising alternative to water electrolysis by lowering the anodic oxidation barrier and producing valuable chemicals. However, current biomass electro&#8208;oxidation systems have difficulties in achieving an industrial&#8208;scale current density due to the difficulty in cleaving high&#8208;energy C&#9472;H and O&#9472;H bonds. Here, we report a ternary layer nitride FeWN2 electrocatalyst with abundant antisite defects (ASDs), which significantly improves its electrocatalytic performance for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation. The catalyst works at a remarkable current density of 2.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.69&#160;V (vs RHE) and achieves 4 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.12&#160;V in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer at 60 &#176;C with 100% Faraday efficiency for H2 production. Theoretical calculations reveal that W atoms near antipodal Fe sites replenish the electron density of Fe, maintaining moderate Fe&#8208;DHA adsorption strength induced by ASDs that achieve superior catalytic efficiency for AA&#8208;to&#8208;DHA conversion This study provides new insight for developing high&#8208;performance organic oxidation catalysts with ASDs.

         <title>&#8220;Pulsed&#8221; Chain Transfer Anionic Polymerization: A Green and Cost&#8208;Effective Approach for Controlled Polymer Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy significantly enhances catalyst atom economy in living polymerization by introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions. The temperature&#8208;sensitive catalytic system allows multiple regenerations of the initiator without using expensive organometallic compounds such as ZnEt2 or MgBu2. This green and cost&#8208;effective approach achieves up to 1500% initiator efficiency and enables the synthesis of polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, providing a sustainable alternative for producing well&#8208;defined, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers. 








Abstract
Herein, we report a method that significantly enhances the atom economy of catalysts in living polymerization. By introducing intermittent, switchable chain&#8208;transfer reactions during the polymerization process, multiple regenerations of the catalyst are achieved while preserving the &#8220;living&#8221;/controlled characteristics. The specially designed catalytic system, composed of 1,2&#8208;dipyrrolidinoethane/n&#8208;butyllithium/n&#8208;butylpotassium/toluene, exhibits a chain&#8208;transfer rate that is highly sensitive to temperature. It enables living polymerization at low temperatures, while at high temperatures, rapid chain transfer to toluene occurs. Utilizing this characteristic, polymerization is initially carried out at low temperatures; once the monomer is consumed, increasing the temperature promotes chain transfer, resulting in initiator regeneration. The regenerated initiator can then initiate new cycles of living polymerization upon the addition of fresh monomers. This process was repeated for more than a dozen cycles, achieving an initiator efficiency of up to 1500%. Using this method, we successfully synthesized polybutadiene and styrene&#8208;butadiene copolymer with an extremely narrow molecular weight distribution (&#272; = 1.1). The mechanism was investigated by in situ NMR spectroscopy, MALDI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS, and DFT calculations. This approach is particularly well&#8208;suited for the controllable, green, and cost&#8208;effective production of low&#8208; to medium&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers and block copolymers.

         <title>AIE Bottlebrush Polymers: Verification of Internal Crowdedness in Bottlebrush Polymers Using the AIE Effect</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottlebrush polymers are a unique class of macromolecules with densely grafted side chains along a central long backbone. A comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single bottlebrush polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging. Here, we synthesized AIEgen&#8208;based bottlebrush polymers using ROMP. The expected AIE phenomenon clearly visualized the steric crowding effect among the densely grafted side chains in bottlebrush polymers.








Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers, characterized by densely grafted side chains along a central backbone, have gained significant interest due to their unique properties in bulk and solution states. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of the internal crowdedness within single polymer chains in dilute solutions remains challenging, and direct evidence to visualize and manifest this effect is scarce. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) offers a novel method to address this challenge. To achieve this, a vinyl&#8208;derivatized AIE monomer was polymerized using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in a controlled way. Afterward, the end group of the synthesized polymer chain was transformed to azide, which was coupled with an alkyne&#8208;derivatized norbornene unit using click chemistry to produce the macromonomer. Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of the norbornenyl macromonomer using Grubbs catalyst, (H2IMes)(pyr)2(Cl)2Ru&#160;=&#160;CHPh (G3), resulted in well&#8208;defined bottlebrush polymers in a highly efficient way. We studied the polymerization behavior and characterized the single chain conformation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution together with coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CG&#8208;MD) simulation. Photoluminescence investigation of the bottlebrush polymers in dilute solution revealed the expected AIE phenomenon, thus verifying the steric crowding effects within bottlebrush polymers. This work bridges AIE technology with polymer science and especially bottlebrush polymers. By doing this, our research not only broadens the bottlebrush polymer library but also provides insights into bottlebrush polymer chain study for potential applications.

         <title>Enabling Aryl Chloride&#8208;Mediated Palladium/Norbornene Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first general palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) catalysis with aryl chlorides is achieved by employing a secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBE and XPhos ligand, resulting in diverse ortho/ipso difunctionalizations of arenes.








Abstract
While the palladium/norbornene (Pd/NBE) cooperative catalysis has become increasingly useful for arene functionalization, its substrate scope has been mainly restricted to reactive aryl iodides and bromides. Despite being a more available and attractive feedstock, common aryl chlorides have not been used as substrates for the Pd/NBE catalysis. Herein, we report the first general Pd/NBE&#8208;catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of aryl chlorides. Enabled by the combination of secondary&#8208;amide&#8208;substituted NBEs and XPhos ligand, diverse aryl chlorides can now undergo successful ortho alkylation, amination, and acylation with different ipso terminations, including olefination, hydrogenation, and alkynylation. To show the utility of this method, late&#8208;stage derivatizations of complex bioactive compounds and sequential functionalizations of polyhaloarenes have been achieved.

         <title>Precise Tuning of Functional Group Spatial Distribution on Porphyrin Rings for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The atropisomers o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; and &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) with dual effects are ingeniously designed to efficiently modulate CO2RR selectivity, leveraging hydrogen bonding and steric hindrance to provide adsorption sites and protect intermediates. As a result, the sterically symmetric o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) interacts with carbonate, prevents C&#8211;C coupling, and exhibits excellent CH4 selectivity.








Abstract
Molecular catalysts play a critical role in regulating the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet the understanding of ligand function is largely restricted to modulating the electronic structure of the metal and reaction kinetics. Herein, a hydroxyl (&#9472;OH) ligand is introduced into a sterically hindered amino&#8208;porphyrin (o&#8208;TAPP) to synthesize the atropisomers porphyrin&#8208;salicylimine&#8208;Cu (o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa) with hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions (O&#9472;H&#8943;O), enabling efficient selection of CO and CH4 under dual effects. Detailed analysis shows that the &#9472;OH of o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) forms a noncovalent hydrogen bond with carbonate, characterized by a bond length of 2.01&#160;&#197; and an angle of 27.6&#176;, and this interaction reduces the reaction energy barrier, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84% for CH4. Moreover, the steric hindrance effect of the symmetric distribution of &#9472;OH facilitates protonation reactions by preventing C&#8211;C coupling. In contrast, &#9472;OH aggregated on o&#8208;Cu&#8208;Por&#8208;Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;) forms a pocket&#8208;like hydrogen bond grid, which restricts free CO2 adsorption, and the rapid dissociation of *CO also interrupts the reaction. This work highlights the pivotal role of dual effects induced by ligand atropisomerization in regulating selectivity, offering new insights for the design of efficient molecular catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular catalysts play a critical role in regulating the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR), yet the understanding of ligand function is largely restricted to modulating the electronic structure of the metal and reaction kinetics. Herein, a hydroxyl (&#9472;OH) ligand is introduced into a sterically hindered amino-porphyrin (o-TAPP) to synthesize the atropisomers porphyrin-salicylimine-Cu (o-Cu-Por-Sa) with hydrogen-bonding interactions (O&#9472;H&#8943;O), enabling efficient selection of CO and CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; under dual effects. Detailed analysis shows that the &#9472;OH of o-Cu-Por-Sa (&#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;) forms a noncovalent hydrogen bond with carbonate, characterized by a bond length of 2.01&#160;&#197; and an angle of 27.6&#176;, and this interaction reduces the reaction energy barrier, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 84% for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, the steric hindrance effect of the symmetric distribution of &#9472;OH facilitates protonation reactions by preventing C&#8211;C coupling. In contrast, &#9472;OH aggregated on o-Cu-Por-Sa (&#945;&#945;&#945;&#945;) forms a pocket-like hydrogen bond grid, which restricts free CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, and the rapid dissociation of *CO also interrupts the reaction. This work highlights the pivotal role of dual effects induced by ligand atropisomerization in regulating selectivity, offering new insights for the design of efficient molecular catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arrangement of Ordered D&#8211;A Components in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered D&#8211;A components in MOFs provide a driving force for the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, resulting in excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without additional cocatalysts. Due to the arrayed uncoordinated carboxyl groups, D&#8211;A MOFs form dual channels for rapid proton transfer. Efficient charge separation and fast proton transport kinetics of the D&#8211;A MOFs promote the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The arrangement of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) components in order at a molecular level provides a means to achieve efficient electron&#8208;hole separation for promoting the activity of photocatalysts. Herein, we report the coordination assembly of D&#8211;A molecules with desired staggered energy levels in two isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) 1 and 2, which exhibit high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity without using any cocatalysts and photosensitizers. The modulation of active metal sites of the D&#8211;A MOFs leads to an increase in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates from 1260 to 3218&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. A detailed mechanism study revealed that the energy bond defined by the D&#8211;A components assisted with metal centers is the key to efficiently generating photogenerated charge carriers, and 2 has an appropriate affinity to proton to reduce the energy barrier for hydrogen evolution. Besides, the enhanced proton transport kinetics based on the arrayed free carboxyl groups in the hydrogen&#8208;bonded network endows 2 with higher proton conductivity than 1, thus promoting the usage rate of active metal sites in 2 for enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics.

P&#8594;B motifs are readily and regioselectively appended to pyrene and anthracene. In contrast with the borylative fusion approach recently developed for related N&#8594;B&#8208;functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such P&#8594;B functionalization does not extend the &#960;&#8208;system.

Abstract
The functionalization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with N&#8594;B Lewis pairs, so&#8208;called borylative fusion, has recently emerged as a simple and powerful means to modulate their electronic and photophysical properties thanks to the extension of the &#960; system. Herein, we considered a new class of PAHs appended with phosphine&#8594;borane Lewis pairs and investigated pyrene as well as anthracene derivatives. In these compounds, strong P&#8594;B interactions are enforced geometrically, but the &#960;&#8208;system is not extended. Nevertheless, such P&#8594;B functionalization was found to significantly impact the optical and electrochemical properties. The P,B&#8208;functionalized PAHs display noticeably reduced HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps and enhanced fluorescence. Both the number and position of P&#8594;B units turned out to play a significant role.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation of Olefins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 is reported for the electrohydrogenation of olefins under unusual high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source and reductant, respectively. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility and substrate scope. Additionally, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.








Abstract
Electrochemical synthesis offers a powerful and sustainable alternative to conventional chemical manufacturing techniques. The direct and selective electrohydrogenation of olefins has enormous potential applicability; however, this reactivity has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Herein, we show that an efficient Pt&#8208;based electrocatalyst from commercially available PtCl2 can promote such transformations. This approach enables olefins to be electrohydrogenated (often below &#8722;3.0&#160;V vs. Ag/AgCl) at high current density (JGeo up to 133&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) using protons and electrons as the hydrogen source. This reaction exhibits broad functional group compatibility, requires low catalyst loading, and affords a diverse series of valuable molecules (more than 60 examples) with high chemoselectivity. In addition, highly regioselective electrocatalytic hydrogenation of olefins (r.r.&#160;&gt;&#160;19:1) is demonstrated using PtCl2 and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine.

A readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine, enables rapid and highly sensitive &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence detection of PFOA in water via liquid&#8208;phase extraction.

Abstract
Mounting concerns regarding per&#8208;/poly&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on human health are focusing attention on trace&#8208;level PFAS detection in aqueous environments. Here, we report a readily prepared small molecule, 2,6&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;diethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine (receptor 1), that displays high binding affinities (logKa&#160;=&#160;4.9&#8211;6.2) and produces a strong &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission response when exposed to representative PFAS in hexanes. The hydrophobic nature of 1, and its strong affinity for various PFAS, allowed hexanes solutions of 1 to be used as &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; emission sensors for dilute aqueous solutions of long&#8208;chain (&#8805;C8) PFAS under acidic conditions (pH 2) by liquid&#8208;phase extraction (LPE). In the case of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the response was rapid (under 10&#160;min) and sensitive. Limits of detection (LOD) as low as 250&#160;ppt were readily achievable by direct naked&#8208;eye observation. LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color&#8208;scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, 1H/19F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses.

LOD as low as 40 and 100&#160;ppt, respectively, could be reached for deionized and tap water solutions of PFOA using a smartphone color-scanning application. Little change in the sensitivity was seen in the presence of a range of inorganic and organic species that could act as potential interferants. Support for the present findings came from UV&#8211;vis absorbance, fluorescence, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory calculations, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The Doping Yb3&#8314; ions into Ln coordination polymers (Ln&#8208;CPs) with the formula [Y2(FCA)6]n (FCA = 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid) has led to the preparation of 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n. Up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) of the ligand is visibly observed in [Y0.6Yb1.4(FCA)6]n, with an absolute up&#8208;conversion quantum yield (UCQY) of 0.003&#160;%.








Abstract
Ln3+&#8208;induced ligand up&#8208;conversion luminescence (UCL) in coordination polymers (CPs) effectively overcomes the inherent limitations of conventional organic UCL mechanisms. However, current research on UCL in Ln&#8208;CPs has predominantly focused on the UCL of Ln3&#8314; ions themselves, while investigations into Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL is overlooked in Ln&#8208;CPs. Herein, by doping Yb3&#8314; into the Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2(FCA)6]n 1) (FCA&#160;=&#160;9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid), Yb3+&#8208;doped 1D chain Ln&#8208;CPs of [Y2&#8208;2xYb2x(FCA)6]n (x&#160;=&#160;0.2, 2) x&#160;=&#160;0.5, 3) x&#160;=&#160;0.7, 4) x&#160;=&#160;0.9, 5) x&#160;=&#160;1, 6) are prepared. Investigation of the UCL of FCA in these CPs reveals that Ln3&#8314;&#8208;induced ligand UCL are achieved for the first time. Notably, 4 not only displays bright UCL under both 10 and 15&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 excitation power of 980&#160;nm laser but also achieves an absolute UCQY of 0.003&#160;%, opening new avenues for the development of Ln&#8208;CPs as UCL materials.

         <title>Against the Wallach's Rule Through Rational Design of Metal&#8208;Free Chiral Perovskites Toward Efficient Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the cyclohexanediammonium cations to construct the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites, thereby challenging the Wallach's rule. Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence is achieved by strategically weakening the interactions between adjacent chiral cations. The obtained chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite demonstrates an exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield of 71.22% together with |glum| of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The potential applications of circularly polarized phosphorescent materials in chiroptical devices have attracted considerable interest. Nevertheless, the design of efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescent pure organic materials remains a significant challenge, largely due to the limitations imposed by the energy&#8208;gap law and Wallach's rule. In this study, the chiral metal&#8208;free perovskite strategy is employed to overcome these restrictions. The introduction of cyclohexylenediammonium cations as the A&#8208;site of chiral metal&#8208;free perovskites results in the generation of an efficient near&#8208;infrared/red phosphorescence at 637&#160;nm with a lifetime of up to 227.98 &#181;s. Furthermore, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) can reach up to 71.22%, accompanied by an anisotropy factor of 9.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. The figure of merit (FM&#160;=&#160;PLQY&#215; |glum|) is 6.98&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is the highest value achieved among all the pure organic circularly polarized phosphorescent materials. The work proposes a unique strategy to achieve highly efficient near&#8208;infrared/red circularly polarized phosphorescence based on non&#8208;conjugated luminophores, which is accomplished by combining the superior optical and electronic properties of metal&#8208;free perovskites with chirality based on the rational molecular design.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Upgrading of Biomass and CO2 Utilization Using Fe/Ni&#8208;Derived Carbon Nanotubes Derived from CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, fossil fuel consumption has led to petroleum shortages and high carbon emissions. Thus, this study explores renewable resources for the electrochemical synthesis of 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and carbon monoxide (CO), from hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and carbon dioxide (CO2), respectively, using Fe/Ni&#8208;supported carbon nanotubes (CNTs) catalysts derived from CO2, achieving a faradaic efficiency of FDCA as 99.60% and 96.25% for CO.








Abstract
Fossil fuel consumption has caused petroleum shortages and increased carbon emissions; thus, utilizing renewable resources in biorefineries for biomass&#8208;derived chemical synthesis is promising. Among them, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a key alternative to terephthalic acid (PTA) for sustainable polyester production. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient approach for the simultaneous production of FDCA while utilizing carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) via an electrochemical approach. Complete electrooxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) at the anode yields FDCA, while CO&#8322; reduction at the cathode produces valuable compounds such as carbon monoxide (CO). This concurrent HMF electrooxidation and CO&#8322; electroreduction strategy enables high&#8208;value chemical production at mild conditions. In addition, we developed efficient single catalysts, FeNi metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes deposited on nickel foam (FeNiCNTs/NF) as both the anode and the cathode for HMF oxidation and CO2 reduction, respectively. Remarkably, faradaic efficiencies reached 99.60% for FDCA (FEFDCA) at the anode and 96.25% for CO (FECO) at the cathode. This study highlights the effective use of synthesized non&#8208;noble metals supported on CO&#8322;&#8208;derived CNTs for integrated biorefinery and CO&#8322; utilization.

         <title>Disentangling Radiative and Non&#8208;Radiative Deactivation Pathways in CuI &#8208;Based TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature dependence of individual non&#8208;radiative decay rates of the lowest singlet and triplet states has been determined in a series of Cu(I) thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds. Such temperature dependence is usually neglected, which is shown here to lead to significant errors in the determination of the singlet&#8208;triplet splittings.








Abstract
The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid&#8208;state CuI complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh3)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature&#8208;dependent lifetimes &#964;(T) into their radiative and non&#8208;radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non&#8208;radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet&#8208;triplet gaps &#916;EST from those determined in the traditional way. Our detailed analysis further confirms that non&#8208;radiative parameters follow the energy gap law and that zero field splitting effects, which are unrecognizable in the bare &#964;(T) data, are governed by the heavy atom effect. Our analysis is supported by measurements of the decay of the prompt fluorescence which is dominated by kISC in the studied compounds.

     alt="Disentangling Radiative and Non-Radiative Deactivation Pathways in CuI -Based TADF Emitters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temperature dependence of individual non-radiative decay rates of the lowest singlet and triplet states has been determined in a series of Cu(I) thermally activated delayed fluorescence compounds. Such temperature dependence is usually neglected, which is shown here to lead to significant errors in the determination of the singlet-triplet splittings.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis of thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters traditionally neglects the temperature dependence of the non-radiative singlet and triplet decay rates, which, for systems with quantum yields significantly departing from unity, unavoidably leads to inaccurate determination of the relevant photophysical parameters. Here we address this issue by performing a detailed photophysical study in three solid-state Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with the general formula [Cu(dmp)(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)X] (X = Cl, Br, I). Decomposition of the measured temperature-dependent lifetimes &#964;(&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) into their radiative and non-radiative contributions demonstrates a significant temperature dependence of the non-radiative rates, which leads to large deviations of the singlet-triplet gaps &#916;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; from those determined in the traditional way. Our detailed analysis further confirms that non-radiative parameters follow the energy gap law and that zero field splitting effects, which are unrecognizable in the bare &#964;(&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;) data, are governed by the heavy atom effect. Our analysis is supported by measurements of the decay of the prompt fluorescence which is dominated by &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Electronic Localization Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Sulfides&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose an electron localization strategy to effectively suppresses the interfacial side reactions by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within PS4 tetrahedron of Li6PS5Cl through atom&#8208;scale dual&#8208;substitution of yttrium and oxygen. This approach greatly enhances the interfacial stability and enables an ultrahigh cycling performance of 100% capacity retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C.








Abstract
Argyrodite&#8208;based sulfide electrolytes have received considerable attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries owing to their high ionic conductivity and good mechanical property. However, the reactivity between sulfide electrolytes and lithium anode leads to continuous interfacial reactions and dendrites growth, which severely hinders their practical applications. We propose an electron localization strategy by modulating the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization within the PS4 tetrahedral structure of Li6PS5Cl through homogeneous incorporation of yttrium (Y) and oxygen (O). The introduction of Y strengthens the Madelung energy with sulfur (S) atom and induces the electronic localization of S atom, which suppresses the interaction between lithium metal and S atom of the tetrahedron. The air&#8208;stability is also enhanced due to oxygen introduction. Furthermore, the in situ formation of Li2O interphase acts as a protective barrier, synergistically mitigating the interfacial reactions between lithium metal and Li6PS5Cl. The Li symmetric cell with the modulated Li6PS5Cl electrolyte achieves stable lithium plating/stripping for over 4800&#160;h. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with LiCoO2/Li&#8208;In electrode display a remarkable long cycle performance with 100% retention after 1300 cycles at 0.5 C. This study presents a distinct strategy that employs the electron localization driven by modulating orbital hybridization to achieve ultrastable interface in sulfide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Development of Chemically Tailored Peptide Binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 to Enable Versatile Design of Membrane Protein&#8208;Targeting PROTACs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically tailored peptide binders of RNF43/ZNRF3 developed by a structure&#8208;guided design strategy are used to establish a novel E3 ligase&#8208;mediated modular platform for membrane protein degradation. This innovative system enables robust generation of synthetic bispecific chimeras featuring enhanced structural diversity and smaller size. The platform demonstrates broad applicability in degrading diverse membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets, including programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).








Abstract
Targeted membrane protein degradation using cell surface E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3 via proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) represents an effective strategy for treating membrane drug targets that cannot be fully inhibited using traditional inhibitors. Several ingenious chimeras have been developed to tether RNF43/ZNRF3 to target membrane proteins, resulting in the degradation of targets at sub&#8208;nanomolar concentrations both in vitro and in vivo. However, currently available RNF43/ZNRF3 binders are genetically encoded and have poor plasticity, which limits the design and promotion of such PROTACs. Here, we exploited the AlphaFold&#8208;predicted complex structures of ligand&#8208;bound RNF43/ZNRF3 and developed a class of chemically tailored peptide binders for ZNRF3/RNF43. With these peptide binders that can be conveniently prepared by de novo peptide synthesis, we established a new membrane protein degradation platform that allows versatile modular design and targeted degradation of clinically relevant membrane proteins, i.e., PD&#8208;L1 and EGFR. This study presents a new subtype within the PROTAC field to develop therapeutic peptides targeting membrane proteins.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Meta C&#9472;H Alkoxylation and Amidation via Polarity Reversal of Nucleophilic Reagents</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. 








Abstract
Norbornene&#8208;mediated remote metaselective C&#9472;H functionalization of arenes have been limited to relatively weakly electronegative and &#8220;soft&#8221; species, such as aryl, alkyl, and alkylamino moieties. Herein, we describe the first example of the use of a nucleophilic reagent, such as an alcohol or amide, to replace the electrophilic reagent during the palladium&#8208;catalyzed meta C&#9472;H alkoxylation or amidation reaction of an arene. The reaction conditions are mild and highly site&#8208;selective, thereby facilitating the direct introduction of natural products or drug molecules containing hydroxyl or amido groups at the meta positions of arenes. In addition, the directing group is rapidly convertible into the corresponding aldehyde, which further enhances the applicability of the reaction. Control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that alcohol and amide polarity reversal induced by hypervalent iodine reagents and the subsequent formation of a Pd(IV) intermediate via the oxidative addition of the aryl&#8211;norbornyl&#8211;palladacycle intermediate are crucial for promoting the entire catalytic reaction cycle.

         <title>Elucidating the Boundary of Intercalation vs Sequestration in Supramolecular Polymers by Retrosynthetic Design Toward the Construction of Complex Supramolecular Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By retrosynthetically analyzing the molecular structure of an intercalator, clear design principles toward supramolecular sequestration can be obtained. Investigating a model supramolecular polymer in the presence of these additives offers a general approach toward dilution&#8208;induced polymerization and complex hybrid systems of dual sequestration and hybrid mechanisms of sequestration and intercalation.








Abstract
Controlled social self&#8208;sorting by intercalation can offer distinct properties at the supramolecular level that go beyond the sum of its parts. Likewise, controlling narcissistic self&#8208;sorting by sequestration can induce unique system properties. In contrast, the interface between the two cases has hitherto remained underexplored, and clear design rules remain elusive. Herein it is demonstrated that by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular similarity of supramolecular synthons, intricate control over concerted supramolecular equilibria can be achieved. By reducing the molecular similarity, a former intercalator can be tuned to become a strong or weak sequestrator. Understanding these roles in binary mixtures allows to rationalize more complex tertiary systems. Consequently, the influence of an uncommon dual sequestration mechanism is revealed. Further, an unprecedented hybrid mechanism between supramolecular intercalation and sequestration can be demonstrated. We are hopeful that the results presented herein will contribute to the development and understanding of concerted processes in complex supramolecular systems.

         <title>Robust p&#8208;d Orbital Coupling in PtCoIn@Pt Core&#8211;Shell Catalysts for Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the p&#8208;block element indium into PtCo results in a ternary L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst. This integration promotes p&#8208;d orbital coupling, enhancing the ORR activity and durability. Impressively, even after 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, this catalyst preserved its initial mass activity, showing no degradation in an H2&#8208;O2 fuel cell.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based catalysts are playing increasingly important roles in fuel cells owing to their high catalytic activity. However, harsh electrocatalytic conditions often trigger atomic migration and dissolution in these catalysts, causing rapid performance deterioration. Here, a novel L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt core&#8211;shell catalyst is introduced, where indium (In) is incorporated into a PtCo matrix. This integration promotes p&#8211;d orbital coupling, optimizing the electronic structure of Pt and causing additional lattice strain within PtCo. Impressively, L10&#8208;PtCoIn@Pt exhibits remarkable activity and durability, with only a 5.1% reduction in mass activity (MA) after 120&#8201;000 potential cycles. In H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, this cathode achieves a peak power density of 1.99&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and maintains a high MA of 0.73 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V. After enduring 60&#8201;000 square wave potential cycles, the catalyst maintains its initial MA and sustains the cell voltage at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. Theoretical studies highlight the enhancements originating from the modulated electronic structures and shifted d&#8208;band center of Pt induced by In doping and increased vacancy formation energies in Pt and Co atoms, affirming the catalyst's superior durability.

         <title>Fully Conjugated Benzobisoxazole&#8208;Bridged Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two high&#8208;quality, benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged, fully conjugated covalent organic frameworks were constructed for the first time. COF&#8208;JLU45 displayed an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with superior reusability via water splitting under visible&#8208;light irradiation.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) have attracted extensive interest in solar energy to hydrogen conversion. However, insufficient light harvesting and difficult exciton dissociation severely limit the improvement of photocatalytic activity for COFs, thereby impeding the progression of this advanced field. In this work, two benzobisoxazole&#8208;bridged and fully conjugated 2D&#8208;COFs with triazine (COF&#8208;JLU44) and pyrene (COF&#8208;JLU45) units were constructed for the first time via Knoevenagel polycondensation, and they hold long&#8208;range ordered structures, largely acceptable surface area, and fascinating photoelectric properties. Significantly, COF&#8208;JLU45 exhibits an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of 272.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and superior reusability in the presence of 1.0 wt% Pt under light irradiation, coupled with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 12.9% at a long wavelength of 600&#160;nm. Multiple spectroscopy and theoretical simulation demonstrate the ingenious design of COF&#8208;JLU45 widen its light absorption and effectively promote the exciton dissociation. This finding contributes valuable insights for constructing metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for solar energy conversion and utilization.

         <title>Biphenylene Coordination and Ring&#8208;Opening by Alkali&#8208;Metal Nickelates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of aryl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal (Li, Na, and K) nickelates that coordinate biphenylene in a &#951;4&#8208;motif have been prepared and structurally characterized. These low&#8208;valent heterobimetallic complexes undergo ring&#8208;opening and oxidative addition of the central C&#9472;C bond of biphenylene, which is highly dependent on the identity of the alkali&#8208;metal and carbanionic scaffold.








Abstract
The pre&#8208;coordination of substrates to heterobimetallic complexes plays a key role in facilitating challenging bond activations and catalytic reactions. Herein, we report a family of low&#8208;valent phenyl&#8208;alkali&#8208;metal nickelates containing a &#951;4&#8208;coordinated biphenylene ligand and demonstrate how the coordination and solvation preferences of the alkali&#8208;metal cation (Li, Na, or K) influence the rate of C&#9472;C bond oxidative addition at nickel through combined structural, spectroscopic and computational studies. The rate of C&#9472;C bond cleavage can be further manipulated by replacing the two phenyl&#8208;carbanionic ligands with a cyclic 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl scaffold, which affords thermally stable and symmetric spirocyclic nickelates upon ring&#8208;opening.

         <title>Single&#8208;Grain High&#8208;Efficiency Full&#8208;Visible&#8208;Spectrum White Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The high luminescence efficiency stems from the constructed heterojunction interface, which blocks the detrimental energy&#8208;migration process.








Abstract
Full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission phosphors are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), overcoming the complex and high costs of traditional mixed phosphors. However, their practical application is hindered by low luminescence efficiency. In this regard, a generalization strategy is developed that involves creating heterostructure interfaces to prevent detrimental energy transfer processes, thereby boosting efficiency. The SrLiPO4/Sr9MgLi(PO4)7:Eu2+ single&#8208;grain phosphors prepared in this work have achieved remarkable full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum emission efficiency, with record internal and external quantum efficiencies of 76.1% and 56.2%, respectively. The WLEDs encapsulated with this phosphor feature a high color rendering index (&#8776;93.9), a low correlated color temperature (&#8776;3100&#160;K), and stable color performance, indicating that the as&#8208;synthesized single&#8208;grain phosphors are excellent candidates for healthy full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum lighting. This innovation is expected to accelerate the development of full&#8208;visible&#8208;spectrum phosphors technology and inspires the creation of more efficient and versatile luminescent materials in the future.

         <title>Homochiral Helical Poly(thiophene)s Accessed via Living Catalyst&#8208;Transfer Polymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis of helical conjugated poly(thiophene)s via living catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization. The polymers have narrow dispersities (&#272;&#160;&lt;&#160;1.10), can be accessed with controlled molecular weights (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;100), and are stable in acids, bases, and strong nucleophiles. We envision these polymers will be useful in biomimetic and organic electronic applications due to the degree of control over the polymer structure and stability.








Abstract
Synthetic helical polymers form compact, ordered, and inherently chiral structures, enabling their uses in biomimetic applications as well as catalysis. A challenge in using synthetic helical polymers, however, is their tendency to be sensitive to pH and the presence of nucleophiles, Lewis&#8208;acids, or metal ions. We report a strategy to overcome these shortcomings by adapting catalyst&#8208;transfer polymerization, a living chain&#8208;growth polymerization typically used to access linear conjugated polymers, for the synthesis of helical poly(thiophene)s. We demonstrate that the helical poly(thiophene)s can be synthesized with a single helicity, incorporated into block copolymers, and functionalized at the chain&#8208;ends, enabling further conjugation and functionalization. The helical poly(thiophene)s are stable to a variety of conditions, providing benefits over other helical polymers which contain sensitive imine or carbonyl&#8208;based functional groups. We anticipate that the ability to access homochiral, heterotelechelic helical conjugated polymers and copolymers will enable new uses of these materials in optoelectronics as well as in applications for mimicking biomacromolecules and other polymers with precisely defined sequences.

         <title>Electrochemical Pilot H2O2 Production by Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Reactor: Insights From a Hybrid Catalyst for 2&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We combined transition metal hydroxides (NiFeW LDH, NiFe LDH, Ni(OH)&#8322;) with OCNTs electrocatalysts, carefully designed water dissociation active centers, and employed an innovative membrane&#8208;free microchannel CER electrolyte configuration to generate pure H&#8322;O&#8322; in a pilot electrolyzer, achieving an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 15 A and 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8722;1.








Abstract
The electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) offers an alluring and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process for hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;) synthesis. However, challenges remain in developing scalable electrocatalysts and cost&#8208;effective reactors for high&#8208;purity H&#8322;O&#8322; production. This study introduces a simple yet effective mechanical mixing method to fabricate a hybrid electrocatalyst from oxidized carbon nanotubes and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). This easily accessible and low&#8208;cost catalyst achieves near&#8208;perfect Faradaic efficiency (&#8764;100%) with low overpotentials of 73&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 and 588&#160;mV at 400&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 in a solid electrolyte cell. Through theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ analyses, we uncover the pivotal role played by the LDH co&#8208;catalyst in fine&#8208;tuning the local pH at the catalyst/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface that drives both the activity and selectivity. We also design a low&#8208;cost solid&#8208;state reactor using cation&#8208;exchange resin (CER) as both a proton conductor and a microchannel for efficient mass transfer, achieving a production rate of 5.29&#160;mmol cm&#8315;2 h&#8315;&#185; and continuous output concentrations of 11.8&#160;wt.% H&#8322;O&#8322;. Scaled to an industrial area of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;100 cm2, the pilot reactor achieves an impressive H&#8322;O&#8322; production rate of approximately 127.0&#160;mmol h&#8315;&#185; at 15 A, marking a significant advancement in sustainable H&#8322;O&#8322; production.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysts for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Ni Single Atom and MoC Nanoclusters Composites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel dual&#8208;site catalyst Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC demonstrates distinct catalytic functions, where the MoC sites exhibit high efficacy in catalyzing the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S8 to Li2S4. Concurrently, the Ni&#8208;N4 sites facilitate the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs from Li2S4 to Li2S. This dual functionality synergistically enhances the overall Li&#8208;S redox process while mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites.








Abstract
The practical application of sulfur (S) cathodes in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and sluggish sulfur redox kinetics. Addressing these challenges requires advanced catalytic host materials capable of trapping LiPSs and accelerating Li&#8208;S redox reactions. However, single&#8208;site catalysts struggle to effectively mediate the complex multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;phase sulfur conversion processes. In this study, we present a novel dual&#8208;site catalyst, Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC, featuring nickel single atoms anchored to nitrogen sites (Ni&#8208;N4) within a carbon nitride (NC) matrix and molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoclusters. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that MoC sites efficiently catalyze the reduction of long&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8328; to Li&#8322;S&#8324;), while Ni&#8208;N4 sites drive the reduction of short&#8208;chain LiPSs (Li&#8322;S&#8324; to Li&#8322;S), resulting in a synergistic enhancement of the complete Li&#8208;S redox process. When incorporated as a coating on the cathode side of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator, the Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC catalyst enhances sulfur utilization, suppresses LiPSs shuttling, and facilitates a uniform Li+&#8208;ion distribution, effectively mitigating the uncontrolled growth of lithium dendrites. Thereby, Li&#8208;S batteries employing an S/Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC cathode and a Ni&#8208;MoC&#8208;NC@PP separator demonstrate outstanding performance, including an initial capacity of 1624&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 0.2C and 1142&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1C, retaining 590&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8315;&#185; after 800 cycles. At a sulfur loading of 8.3&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8315;2 and an electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8315;&#185;, the system achieves an initial areal capacity of 9.57&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 0.1C, showcasing significant promise for practical applications.

Abstract
The precise regulation of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) distribution and interfacial modification is pivotal for advancing the performance of p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new co&#8208;assembly material, 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diphenylaniline iodide (TPAI), is developed to make SAM orderly assembled. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy reveal that TPAI binds with SAM via &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, effectively suppressing SAM aggregation and enhancing the orderliness of self&#8208;assembly. Further characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrates that &#9472;NH3 group in TPAI coordinates with undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate defects of cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) film. The TPAI modification creates a defect&#8208;minimized buried interface with optimized energy alignment, significantly improving hole extraction and transport kinetics. Consequently, the TPAI&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.60%, the highest reported value for inverted CsPbI3 PSCs, maintaining 96.71% initial PCE after tracking at maximum power point (MPP) for 1400&#160;h. This work provides a molecular&#8208;level strategy for interfacial engineering, advancing the development of efficient and durable perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Anomalous Magnetic Hysteresis up to 20&#160;K in a Non&#8208;Kramers Light&#8208;Lanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first praseodymium (Pr) single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) is designed and synthesized by confining single non&#8208;Kramers light&#8208;lanthanide Pr(III) inside an azafullerene cage, which shows an anomalously high&#8208;temperature magnetic bistability up to 20&#160;K, the highest value among all reported light&#8208;lanthanide SMMs, without employing a demanding strong axial ligand field.








Abstract
Light&#8208;lanthanides (Ln), despite their widespread uses in commercial permanent magnets, are among the least explored metal elements as building blocks of single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) due to their smaller magnetic moments as well as weaker spin&#8211;orbit couplings than those of the heavy&#8208;Ln counterparts, and so far, only a neodymium (Nd) complex has been reported showing a small magnetic hysteresis at 2&#160;K. Here, we report a low&#8208;coordination praseodymium (Pr) complex, namely, Pr@C81N, featuring a non&#8208;Kramers trivalent Pr ion entrapped within an azafullerene cage and behaving as the first Pr&#8208;based SMM. Although the weak nonaxial ligand field imposed only by the carbon cage on the integer&#8208;spin Pr(III) elicits nondegenerate spin states, Pr@C81N shows an anomalous magnetic hysteresis up to 20&#160;K using a field sweep rate of 20&#160;Oe/s, which is the highest temperature among all reported light&#8208;Ln SMMs. In addition to the ideally minimized spin&#8211;phonon coupling in the low coordination, the origin of such an unexpected magnetic bistability for the non&#8208;Kramers complex likely lies in nuclear sublevels arising from a large Pr hyperfine coupling, which feature distinct electronic magnetizations within the highly mixed ground electronic state.

         <title>Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes Enable High&#8208;Efficiency, Long&#8208;Cycling, and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Trivalent Antimony Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a concentrated chloride electrolyte to address the Sb3+ hydrolysis issue and achieved highly reversible three&#8208;electron Sb plating chemistry, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long life (10 months), and dendrite&#8208;free spherical morphology.








Abstract
Aqueous trivalent metal batteries are promising energy storage systems, which can leverage unique three&#8208;electron redox reactions to deliver high capacity and high energy. Among them, antimony (Sb) stands out with a high capacity (660 mAh g&#8722;1), abundant availability, and low cost. However, the severe Sb3+ hydrolysis reaction drastically hinders the development of aqueous antimony batteries. Herein, we address this issue by employing a concentrated lithium chloride electrolyte, which stabilizes reactive Sb3+ ions via forming robust antimony&#8208;chloride complexes. This approach effectively mitigates hydrolysis and achieves highly reversible Sb plating behavior, leading to high efficiency (99.7%&#8211;99.8%), long lifespan (7300 h, 10 months), and uniform spherical deposition morphology. When paired with a manganese dioxide (MnO2) cathode, the Sb&#8214;MnO2 battery demonstrates a high capacity of 309 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability of 50&#160;000 cycles (&#8764;70% retention). Additionally, Sb shows promise as a high&#8208;capacity cathode, which can integrate with low&#8208;potential zinc into novel dual&#8208;metal plating batteries with long cycling life (4,000 h). This work not only deepens our fundamental understanding of trivalent Sb3+ redox chemistry but also opens new opportunities to stabilize hydrolysable and high&#8208;charge&#8208;density cations for multivalent battery applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Inherently Chiral Pillar[5]Arenes Through Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Azide&#8211;Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is presented for synthesizing inherently chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative CuAAC reaction. By increasing the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule, a wide range of pillar[5]arenes are efficiently prepared in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes have been extensively investigated as carrier materials for applications in host&#8208;guest chemistry, nanoscience, information science, materials science, and other domains. Despite its success, the enantioselective synthesis of pillar[n]arenes is challenging and has not yet been achieved. Herein, a novel asymmetric extended side&#8208;arm strategy is presented for synthesizing chiral pillar[5]arenes through an iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. An increase in the steric hindrance on both sides of the macrocyclic molecule efficiently produced a wide range of pillar[5]arenes in high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. Moreover, this principle enables iterative copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition to enantioselectively functionalized pillar[5]arenes with different triazoles using a one&#8208;pot process.

         <title>Engineering Asymmetric Electronic Structure of Co&#9472;N&#9472;C Single&#8208;Atomic Sites Toward Excellent Electrochemical H2O2 Production and Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#9472;N5 site with asymmetric electronic structure was built to improve the activation of O2, moderate the adsorption of *OOH intermediate, and ideally conserve the generated H2O2, achieving the excellent H2O2 selectivity by 92.5%. The 2e&#8722; ORR coupled oxidation further realized the efficient cellulosic biomass upgrading into valued formic acid with a high yield of 92.1%.








Abstract
To advance electrochemical H2O2 production and unravel catalytic mechanisms, the precise structural coordination of single&#8208;atomic M&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts is urgently required. Herein, the Co&#9472;N5 site with an asymmetric electronic configuration is constructed to boost the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) compared to symmetric Co&#9472;N4, effectively overcoming the trade&#8208;off between activity and selectivity in H2O2 production. Both experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that breaking the symmetry of Co&#9472;N sites promotes the activation of O2 molecules and moderates the adsorption of the key *OOH intermediate by disrupting the linear scaling relationship for intermediates&#160;adsorption. This modulation enables efficient H&#8322;O&#8322; production and its effective retention for subsequent applications. As a proof of concept, Co&#9472;N5 achieves a H2O2 production rate as high as 16.1&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in a flow cell, outperforming most recently reported counterparts. Furthermore, the coupling of 2e&#8722; ORR with the oxidation of cellulose&#8208;derived carbohydrates accomplishes high formic acid yields (84.1% from glucose and 62.0%&#8211;92.1% from other substrates), underpinning the sustainable electro&#8208;refinery for biomass valorization at ambient conditions. By elucidating the intrinsic relationship between 2e&#8315; ORR and the asymmetry of single&#8208;atomic sites, this work paves the way for high&#8208;performance electrosynthesis.

         <title>Retarding Phase Segregation via Lattice Reinforcement for Efficient and Stable Perovskite/Organic Tandems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsically stable perovskite lattice was achieved by incorporating DMA+, which suppresses the halide phase segregation under both high&#8208;power illumination and high&#8208;bias voltage. The resultant perovskite/organic tandem solar cells with active areas of 0.062 and 1.004 cm2 achieved remarkable PCEs of 26.15% (certified: 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, and showed excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with T90 of &#8764;1350&#160;h.








Abstract
The operational perovskite/organic tandems are subjected to light irradiation and driven by a higher bias voltage than single&#8208;junction solar cells, posing a severe challenge to their stabilities. Light irradiation can trigger halide phase segregation in the perovskite subcell, exacerbated under higher bias voltage through electron&#8211;phonon coupling. To address this, dimethylammonium ion (DMA+) incorporation delays perovskite crystallization by forming an intermediate phase, enhancing crystallinity, and reducing lattice structural defects. DMA+ with a larger ionic radius entering the A&#8208;site of lattice tilts the [PbX6]4&#8722; (X: I or Br) octahedral, enlarging the perovskite bandgap, shortening Pb&#9472;I bonds, and reinforcing the lattice. This mitigates halide escaping from the lattice and subsequent ion migration. Phase segregation in the perovskite subcell is significantly suppressed under high&#8208;power irradiation and bias voltage. Consequently, the perovskite subcell exhibits increased and stable quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting values, delivering a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.34&#160;V. Notably, 0.062&#8208;cm2 and 1.004&#8208;cm2 perovskite/organic tandems achieved remarkable efficiencies of 26.15% (certified of 25.34%) and 24.87%, respectively, exhibiting excellent operational stability of T90 &#8764; 1350&#160;h.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Mediated CO2 Electrolysis for Recovering Transmembrane Carbon Loss</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy was proposed to address the transmembrane CO2 loss issue in alkaline CO2 electrolysis. By utilizing anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) as the redox mediator, the system could operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, achieving a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion while simultaneously enabling efficient recovery of transmembrane CO2 gas.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in alkaline media presents advantages by suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhancing the CO2 reduction selectivity. However, it suffers from the carbonation issue, leading to substantial carbon loss due to CO2 transmembrane transport. To tackle this issue, we here put forward a redox mediator (RM)&#8208;coupled electrolysis strategy. By integrating a highly reversible redox couple, this approach spatially separates the cathodic CO2 reduction and the anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) into two electrolyzers, thereby enabling the recovery and reuse of transmembrane CO2. Anthraquinone&#8208;2,7&#8208;disulfonic acid (AQDS) was chosen as the redox mediator owing to its suitable redox potential, excellent electrochemical reversibility, high solubility, and nontransmembrane shuttling characteristics. It allowed the RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis system to operate continuously at 100&#160;mA/cm2, maintaining a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion consistently around 90%, while effectively capturing the transmembrane CO2.&#160;This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration validates the feasibility of RM&#8208;coupled electrolysis and highlights its significant potential to advance the practical application of CO2 electrolysis.

         <title>Improving Circularity via Chemical Recycling to all Rings</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The initial monomer free energy of polymerization (&#8710;GROP) is traditionally regarded as the benchmark for the polymer's chemical recyclability. But if we instead consider every ring size present at equilibrium (&#8710;GRCE), a different viewpoint emerges. We found that polymers previously regarded as unsuitable for chemical recycling are highly chemically recyclable at low temperatures under the right concentration and catalytic conditions.








Abstract
Aliphatic polyesters synthesized via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) have properties competitive to incumbent plastic (PE, PP), while simultaneously opening up for chemical recycling to monomer (CRM). However, not all aliphatic polyesters are prone to undergo CRM, and the ability to shift the equilibrium between polymer and monomer is tightly associated with the initial monomer structure. The standard strategy to measure CRM is to evaluate the change in free energy during polymerization (&#8710;GROP). However, &#8710;GROP is only one&#8208;dimensional by assessing the equilibrium between initial monomer and polymer. But under active catalytic conditions, the depolymerization of polymers can lead to formation of larger rings, such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, and so on, via the ring&#8208;chain equilibrium (RCE), meaning that the real thermodynamic recycling landscape is multi&#8208;dimensional. This work introduces a multi&#8208;dimensional chemical recycling to all rings (CRR) via a highly active catalytic system to reach RCE. Thermodynamically &#8710;GRCE is completely different from &#8710;GROP. Using &#8710;GRCE instead of &#8710;GROP allows us to achieve CRR for polymers notoriously difficult to achieve CRM for, as exemplified within by CRR for poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone), poly(pentadecalactone), and mixed polymer systems. Overall, this work provides a new general concept of closing the material loop.

         <dc:description>A simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization, which also offers valuable insights into bridging heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Ethylene dimerization is a crucial chemical process, which currently relies on organo&#8208;metallic catalysis with the assistance of overdosed additives as cocatalysts. Heterogeneous nickel catalysts have been investigated as alternatives for ethylene dimerization, however suffer from low catalytic activity and/or poor 1&#8208;butene selectivity. Herein, we report a simple two&#8208;step ion&#8208;exchange strategy for the preparation of Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y zeolite containing well&#8208;defined coordinatively&#8208;unsaturated nickel centers as a promising catalyst for ethylene dimerization. Ni&#8208;Mg&#8208;Y shows unprecedent performance with 1&#8208;butene formation rate of 3.8 &#215; 105&#160;h&#8722;1 and 1&#8208;butene selectivity of 91.2&#160;%, without the assistance of any cocatalysts. With the combination of advanced characterization techniques and comprehensive theoretical simulations, it has been demonstrated for the first time that the in&#8208;situ generated Ni&#8208;alkyl motif is the intrinsic active site and ethylene dimerization proceeds dominantly via the Cossee&#8208;Arlman pathway. The dynamic hydrogen transfer between ethylene/alkyl ligand and zeolite framework dedicates to the observed catalytic performance.

         <title>Gem&#8208;Diboronic Acids: A Motif for Anion Recognition in Competitive Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gem&#8208;diboronic acids are an anion recognition motif that provides strong and directional binding to oxoanions in aqueous media. This motif provides a selectivity profile that is distinct from other anion recognition groups, and binding affinities that are superior to those of simple amides and (thio)ureas. A simple receptor featuring two gem&#8208;diboronic acid motifs was found to be one of the most selective malonate receptors disclosed to date.








Abstract
Gem&#8208;diboronic acid derivatives have previously been demonstrated to facilitate substrate binding within a metal's secondary coordination sphere, but their use as an anion recognition motif has not been explored. Here, we introduce the gem&#8208;diboronic acid motif as a highly effective group for recognition of oxoanions in aqueous solution. Anion receptors based on this motif demonstrate higher binding affinities than other common neutral motifs such as amides and (thio)ureas, and display a unique selectivity profile. Studies with a receptor bearing two gem&#8208;diboronic acid groups, receptor 2, indicate that the interaction with anions is highly directional. Despite its simplicity, receptor 2 represents one of the most selective receptors for malonate reported to date.

         <title>Leveraging Solvent Effects for Enhanced Oxidation and Coordination in Selective Piezocatalytic Gold Recovery from End&#8208;of&#8208;Life Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The choice of solvent in piezocatalytic Au extraction is critical to electron transfer, radical generation, and mass transport. The CH3CN&#8211;water solvent system emerges as the optimal medium, achieving a balance of oxidation ability, coordination ability, scalability, and environmental safety, resulting in a highly efficient and selective Au recovery.








Abstract
Efficient gold (Au) recovery from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) under environmentally sustainable and mild conditions presents a significant challenge in resource recycling. This study introduced a novel piezocatalytic method for Au recovery from E&#8208;waste using a mixed acetonitrile&#8211;water (CH3CN&#8208;H2O) solution. The findings emphasize the crucial role of solvent effects in modulating catalytic performance, with a 75% CH3CN solution offering the most efficient recovery. The solvent not only influenced the oxidation and coordination steps crucial for Au extraction but also facilitated electron and mass transfer, accelerating the generation of reactive species that promote Au dissolution. Furthermore, water amplified the effect of the solvent by modifying the chemical potential of surface species, thus optimizing catalytic reactivity. Under ultrasonic vibration, the piezocatalytic system achieved 100% Au recovery from various types of E&#8208;waste, exhibiting excellent adaptability across a broad pH range. Large&#8208;scale experiments at the kilogram level confirmed its practicality, with 100% recovery from printed circuit boards and 98% from central processing unit boards. This study underscores the importance of solvent effects in piezocatalysis and provides new insights into the sustainable recovery of precious metals, thereby paving the way for the design of solvent&#8208;assisted catalytic systems.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycolipid Library Reminiscent of Mycobacterial Cell Wall Motif A and Its Significance by Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of glycolipids reminiscent of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall were synthesized and their supramolecular structures in aqueous acetone were imaged by transmission electron microscopy. The self&#8208;assembled structures are affected by subtle changes in the number of sugar residues, type of glycosidic linkages, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes in the lipid.








Abstract
The cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) is distinguished by its unique glycolipid composition, notably mycolyl arabinogalactan, which features Araf, Galf, and mycolic acid. The terminal portion of arabinogalactan (AG) is motif A, a pentaarabinofuranoside characterized by two &#946;&#8208;1,2 linkages and one each of &#945;&#8208;1,5 and &#945;&#8208;1,3 linkages. The C5 positions of motif A are esterified with mycolic acids, further enriched by unusual cyclopropanes. In this study, we synthesized a diverse array of MTb cell wall glycolipids inspired by motif A and explored their self&#8208;assembly behavior using microscopy. This collection of glycolipids includes variations with &#945; or &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;2, 3, or 5) Araf linkages in di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and penta&#8208;arabinofuranosides, esterified with saturated, doubly unsaturated, or cyclopropanated long&#8208;chain fatty acids. The TEM analysis of the resulting self&#8208;assemblies revealed that subtle modifications in the anomeric linkages, length of the glycan, and the presence or absence of cyclopropanes impacted the morphology of the self&#8208;assembled structures.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Minute Fabrication of Metal Organic Framework Membranes via Additive&#8208;Accelerated Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sub&#8208;minute fabrication of permselective metal organic framework membranes via additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition is developed by using catecholamine as both biomimetic mineralization inducer and grain&#8208;boundary adhesive. The resulting ZIF&#8208;8@DA membranes exhibited excellent C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with C3H6 permeance of 145&#160;&#177;&#160;12 GPU and C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151&#160;&#177;&#160;8, surpassing most of MOF membranes.








Abstract
Efficient fabrication of metal organic framework (MOF) membranes is important for their broad applications in molecular separations. However, current approaches for MOF membrane fabrication are usually time&#8208;consuming due to the slow, random nucleation and crystal growth, particularly the lack of in&#8208;situ defect healing ability. Here, we report an additive&#8208;accelerated electrodeposition method, which allows ultrafast fabrication of MOF membranes through the synergy of electric field and catecholamine additives. The strong electric field facilitates the directed nucleation of MOF on the substrates while the multifunctional additives accelerate the MOF crystallization, growth and grain&#8208;boundary defect healing. Consequently, we fabricate well&#8208;intergrown, uniform MOF (ZIF&#8208;8) membranes with an ultrathin thickness of &#8764;180&#160;nm in 30 s, which is the most rapid fabrication of MOF membranes till now. The membranes exhibit superior C3H6/C3H8 separation performance with a C3H6 permeance of 145 GPU and a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 151, as well as good stability at high pressure of 7&#160;bar, and the ultrafast membrane fabrication can be achieved on commercial ceramic substrates, exhibiting the potential for practical applications. This work may establish a platform for fast and controllable fabrication of MOF membranes as well as many other membranes based on metal&#8208;coordination chemistry.

         <title>Highly Selective Electrocatalytic 1,4&#8208;NADH Regeneration Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition Mediated by Cucurbit[8]uril on NiO</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction, an electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed based on host&#8211;guest recognition mediated by cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) on NiO. The anchored CB[8] could preorganize the NAD+ in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to approach the Ni&#8208;Had on NiO, resulting in a high regioselectivity up to 97.8%. 








Abstract
Efficient regeneration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cofactors, particularly 1,4&#8208;NADH, is crucial for advancing oxidoreductase catalysis. Electrocatalysis provides a promising route for 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration, but an expensive catalyst, typically a rhodium organometallic complex, is frequently required to guarantee the high selectivity of 1,4&#8208;NADH, significantly limiting its large&#8208;scale application. Herein, inspired by the catalytic pocket and enzyme&#8211;substrate interaction in nature, a direct electrochemical 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration route was designed by modification of the surface of nickel oxide (NiO) with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) (denoted as CB[8]&#8211;NiO). The host&#8211;guest interaction between CB[8] and NAD+ was proved, which is similar in principle to substrate&#8211;enzyme&#8208;specific recognition. CB[8] acted as a catalytic pocket for NAD+, providing a suitable cavity volume to accommodate the positively charged nicotinamide part of NAD+. NAD+ entered the CB[8] cavity and approached the surface&#8208;adsorbed hydrogen atoms on NiO in a reaction&#8208;ready configuration to achieve the regioselective 1,4&#8208;NADH regeneration. Remarkably higher 1,4&#8208;NADH selectivity of 97.8% on CB[8]&#8211;NiO was obtained at &#8722;0.47&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) than that of bare NiO (77.4%).

A largest all&#8208;alkynyl protected rod&#8208;shaped Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#63741;C)68(BF4)5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;20) (1) (PhC&#63741;C&#160;=&#160;phenylacetylene) trimetallic nanocluster has been synthesized and its structure determined by SCXRD. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements of Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28. Compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibits exceptional photothermal conversion capability (&#951;&#160;=&#160;84.7%, &#9651;T&#160;=&#160;51.5 &#176;C, &#955;ex&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm, 0.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2, 12&#160;&#181;M). TA spectroscopy reveals that the &#964;e&#8208;ph of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1 shows excellent photothermal therapy of cancer cells at low concentration and low laser power.








Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity intermetallic nanoclusters are important for investigating the evolution of alloy materials from atoms to plasmonic alloy nanoparticles. However, the synthesis of large&#8208;size alloy nanoclusters (&#8764;2&#160;nm) is still challenging. In this work, an all&#8208;alkynyl protected trimetallic nanocluster of unprecedented size, Au9Ag126&#8208;xCux(PhC&#63741;C)68(BF4)5 (x&#160;=&#160;0&#8211;20) (1) (PhC&#63741;C&#160;=&#160;phenylacetylene), has been synthesized and its total structure determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The metal core of 1 is rod&#8208;like in structure, with a length of 1.92&#160;nm and a width of 1.45&#160;nm. Cluster 1 contains a concentric metal kernel in the manner of shell&#8208;by&#8208;shell arrangements of Au3Ag34@Au6Ag64@(AgCu)28 protected by 68 PhC&#63741;C ligands with 15 distinct alkynyl&#8211;metal binding configurations. Theoretic calculation reveals that 1 features a HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap of 0.29&#160;eV. This suggests that 1 is situated at the boundary of the transition from a molecular to a metallic state. Remarkably, compared to other reported Au/Ag/Cu/Pd based nanoclusters, 1 exhibits significantly enhanced photothermal conversion capability. A substantial temperature rise of &#8764;51.5 &#176;C within 5&#160;min (&#955;ex&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm, 0.5&#160;W cm&#8722;2) and a record high photothermal conversion efficiency of 84.7% at 12&#160;&#181;M in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) were observed. Time&#8208;resolved transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy reveals that the electron&#8211;phonon coupling (&#964;e&#8208;ph) of excited 1 occurs on the femtosecond timescale, resulting in an ultrafast electronic relaxation process and excellent photothermal performance. Cluster 1, when employed as a photothermal material, shows promise in biothermal therapy, photothermal catalysis, and photothermal imaging.

         <title>Balancing Hydrogen Evolution and Hydrogenation Reaction via Facet Engineering for Efficient Conversion of Nitrate to Ammonia in Actual Wastewater</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a critical insight into the hydrogenation mechanism, implying that facet engineering can balance hydrogen evolution and hydrogenation reaction. The Co3O4(100) facet with abundant oxygen vacancies can not only boost water dissociation to generate active hydrogen but also effectively utilize these intermediates for nitrate reduction, thereby shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to hydrogenation reaction.








Abstract
Due to the competitive relationship between nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the conventional approach to improve Faradaic efficiency is to select a catalyst without HER activity. Nevertheless, such a strategy not only limits the application of HER catalysts in NO3&#8722;RR, but also causes insufficient hydrogen source, thereby sacrificing ammonia yield rate. We believe that HER catalysts should not be excluded from hydrogenation reduction. Herein, taking traditional water electrolysis material Co3O4 as model system, we reveal that the oxygen vacancies on crystal facet can greatly promote water dissociation and capture HER intermediate for NO3&#8722;RR, successfully shifting the reaction pathway from hydrogen evolution to nitrate hydrogenation. Beyond material development, we construct a hybrid reactor and achieve an ammonia recovery rate of 1216.8&#160;g&#8208;N&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;d&#8722;1 in nuclear industry wastewater with ultra&#8208;high nitrate concentration. This study breaks through the limitation of HER catalyst in NO3&#8722;RR, which provides a significant insight into the catalyst designing and hydrogenation mechanism.

         <title>Unveil the Failure of Alkali Ion&#8208;Sulfur Aqueous Batteries: Resolving Water Migration by Coordination Regulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We first reveal an overlooked issue of water migration in decoupled systems, which leads to sulfur species dissolution and thus irreversible sulfur redox reactions. By investigating the alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration, the MPI of the electrolyte is proposed as a universal descriptor. In practice, an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy is proven effective in resolving water migration and constructing stable alkali ion&#8208;SABs effectively.








Abstract
Sulfur aqueous battery (SAB) is promising owing to its high theoretical capacity and cost competitiveness. Although decoupled electrolyte design has successfully endowed transition metal ion&#8208;SABs with customizability to achieve high energy density, its effectiveness in alkali ion&#8208;SABs remains problematic. Here, we identify for the first time an intractable phenomenon of alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;driven water migration between decoupled electrolytes through ex situ NMR, which is recognized as the origin of the irreversible sulfur redox reactions. To address the challenge, we propose an alkali&#8208;ion&#8208;H2O&#8208;poor coordination strategy to effectively regulate water migration by incorporating low molecular polarity index (MPI) anions. In situ Raman, synchrotron spectroscopy, and molecule dynamic simulations reveal that the repulsion of low MPI anions to water effectively disrupts the hydration patterns around the alkali cations, and thereby minimizes the concomitant water migration. The elaborated Na+&#8208;SAB achieved an ultrahigh capacity of 1634&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (97.7% sulfur utilization) and prolonged stability over 500 cycles.

     alt="Unveil the Failure of Alkali Ion-Sulfur Aqueous Batteries: Resolving Water Migration by Coordination Regulation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first reveal an overlooked issue of water migration in decoupled systems, which leads to sulfur species dissolution and thus irreversible sulfur redox reactions. By investigating the alkali-ion-driven water migration, the MPI of the electrolyte is proposed as a universal descriptor. In practice, an alkali-ion-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-poor coordination strategy is proven effective in resolving water migration and constructing stable alkali ion-SABs effectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur aqueous battery (SAB) is promising owing to its high theoretical capacity and cost competitiveness. Although decoupled electrolyte design has successfully endowed transition metal ion-SABs with customizability to achieve high energy density, its effectiveness in alkali ion-SABs remains problematic. Here, we identify for the first time an intractable phenomenon of alkali-ion-driven water migration between decoupled electrolytes through ex situ NMR, which is recognized as the origin of the irreversible sulfur redox reactions. To address the challenge, we propose an alkali-ion-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-poor coordination strategy to effectively regulate water migration by incorporating low molecular polarity index (MPI) anions. In situ Raman, synchrotron spectroscopy, and molecule dynamic simulations reveal that the repulsion of low MPI anions to water effectively disrupts the hydration patterns around the alkali cations, and thereby minimizes the concomitant water migration. The elaborated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-SAB achieved an ultrahigh capacity of 1634&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (97.7% sulfur utilization) and prolonged stability over 500 cycles. Furthermore, the versatility of the alkali-ion-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-poor coordination strategy is further substantiated in Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-SAB and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-SAB batteries, boosting the scope of the following SAB systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Ultraviolet Light&#8208;Activated Asymmetric Photopolymerization for the Synthesis of CPL&#8208;Active Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL, &#955;em&#160;=&#160;360&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;0.188), achieved through thermodynamic regulation of the chiral supramolecular assembly. The asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257&#8208;based blend film can be realized by utilizing the CP&#8208;UVL as a chiral excitation source, resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072).








Abstract
Circularly polarized ultraviolet light (CP&#8208;UVL) offers significant potential for practical applications in asymmetric photocatalysis and photopolymerization. However, the development of CP&#8208;UVL&#8208;active materials has been hindered by their low emission dissymmetry factors (gem). Here, we present a high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL material for asymmetric photopolymerization, achieved through thermodynamic regulation of a chiral supramolecular assembly. The chiral coassembled enantiomers, R/S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7, are synthesized using the naphthylamine derivative R/S&#8208;BNC as the chiral donor and OXD&#8208;7 as the achiral acceptor. Upon annealing at different temperatures, OXD&#8208;7 detaches from the chiral coassembly of S&#8208;BNC/OXD&#8208;7 and then self&#8208;assembles into ordered helical nanostructures, exhibiting temperature&#8208;dependent CP&#8208;UVL (&#955;em = 360&#160;nm, with gem up to&#160;+0.188). Remarkably, the strong CP&#8208;UVL emission acts as a chiral excitation source, triggering the asymmetric photopolymerization of RM257 (which contains the achiral dye TPABBI and the photoinitiator Irg651), resulting in the generation of blue CPL (&#955;em&#160;=&#160;460&#160;nm, gem&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.072). This study provides a simple yet effective strategy for designing high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;UVL materials for CPL&#8208;induced asymmetric photopolymerization.

         <title>Selectively Deoxygenative Deuteration of Aldehydes by Superwetting Porous Carbon&#8208;Supported Palladium Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a class of superwetting carbon&#8208;supported Pd catalysts, which facilitate the site&#8208;specific deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes to aromatics with &#8208;CD3 group benefitting from the catalyst's surface polarity and electron&#8208;rich effect.








Abstract
We present a method of deoxygenative deuteration of aldehydes (DDA) over heterogeneously superwetting porous carbon&#8208;supported palladium catalyst (Pd/SPC), which is efficient for the synthesis of deuterated aromatic compounds with &#8208;CD3 group. Exemplified by the DDA reaction of 2&#8208;naphthaldehyde (2&#8208;NAL) to 2&#8208;methylnaphthalene (2&#8208;MNE), the total deuterium incorporation radio in the resultant aromatic hydrocarbons was higher than 95% and the selectivity toward 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3 reached 87%. The impressed catalytic activity was found relevant to the combined effect of surface wettability and the electron&#8208;rich properties of Pd species of this kind of heterogeneous Pd/SPC catalyst. Mechanistic studies suggest a successive deuteration pathway, that is, hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE), deuterium addition, and ultimate deoxygenative deuteration over Pd/SPC in the cost&#8208;effective D2O/H2 reaction conditions. The in situ&#8208;formed D2 from the first step HIE between H2 and D2O can be readily captured by the electron&#8208;rich Pd centers, which then boost the subsequent deuterogenolysis of C&#9472;O bonds through deuterated alcohol intermediates toward the formation of 2&#8208;MNE&#8208;d3. This work provides a design principle of heterogeneous catalysts for targeted deuterium labeling from aldehyde substrates and may inspire the development of alternative deuterium labeling techniques beyond dominated homogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Pd Ensemble Sites Tuned Local Environment of Cu Catalysts for Matching Propyne Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction pathways of catalytic hydrogenations exemplified by the propyne hydrogenation here are obediently regulated by manipulating the local environments. The presence of Pd ensemble sites is shown to enable a facile dissociation of hydrogen and control the hydrogenation via the semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway, which contributes to high activity and selectivity for propyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation.








Abstract
Tailoring local environments of active sites to match targeted configuration of key species is significant for controlling reaction pathways in selective hydrogenations. Herein, differently typed Pd sites are introduced onto Cu catalysts to tune the local environment of Cu sites for controlling the configuration of semi&#8208;hydrogenation pathway of propyne hydrogenation used in production of polymer&#8208;grade propylene. Detailed structure characterizations demonstrate the controllable construction of Pd single&#8208;atom and Pd ensemble sites modified Cu surfaces and PdCu alloy via fine tuning the Pd/Cu ratios. Catalytic tests, kinetics analysis, and temperature&#8208;programmed experiments demonstrate that the presence of Pd ensemble sites on Cu surface directly catalyzes the hydrogenation of propyne that occurs on the Cu sites in other cases, and enables a facile activation for hydrogen and simultaneously promotes the desorption of propylene against its hydrogenation. Accordingly, the selectivity to target propylene is up to 95.3% at the full conversion of propyne on the corresponding Pd0.1Cu catalyst. In contrast, the C&#9472;C coupling pathway is quite facile on the Cu surface tuned by single&#8208;atom Pd sites, which is similar to that on the pristine Cu sites on the Cu catalyst, and the well&#8208;defined Pd&#9472;Cu coordination on PdCu alloy catalyst leads to facile over&#8208;hydrogenation process.

         <title>Blocking Orbital &#960;&#8208;Conjugation to Boost Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl&#8208;Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;&#8208;conjugation via either molecular&#8208;structure distortion or meta&#8208;arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl&#8208;embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters. This work not only provides a deep insight into the structure&#8208;property relationship on SOC but also opens the door for designing more efficient OLED emitters with large SOCs.








Abstract
Both reducing singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES1T1) and enhancing spin&#8208;orbit couplings (SOCs) are key to improving reverse intersystem crossing rates (kRISC) in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials. While considerable efforts have focused on reducing &#916;ES1T1, investigations on SOCs remain limited.

     alt="Blocking Orbital &#960;-Conjugation to Boost Spin-Orbit Coupling in Carbonyl-Embedded Polycyclic Heteroaromatic Emitters"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effective approach, i.e., blocking orbital &#960;-conjugation via either molecular-structure distortion or meta-arrangement of chemical substituents is proposed, to boost spin-orbit couplings (SOC) in carbonyl-embedded polycyclic heteroatomic emitters. This work not only provides a deep insight into the structure-property relationship on SOC but also opens the door for designing more efficient OLED emitters with large SOCs.

         <title>Impact of Hydrogen Vacancies on Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination in Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen vacancies in hybrid perovskites have a dramatic influence on the non&#8208;radiative recombination. It can exhibit multiple metastable configurations, resulting in variations in carrier capture coefficient by over 10 orders of magnitude. By uncovering the negligible role of hydrogen vacancies on the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial, thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
Hydrogen vacancies (VH) were considered major non&#8208;radiative recombination centers in hybrid perovskites. By employing a multiscale approach that combines first&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics (MDs) simulations, our findings indicated that the VH impact was overestimated due to the previous metastable VH configurations. The organic molecules with VH located on either the nitrogen or carbon atom act as the ligands that form energetically stable dimers with Pb2+ cations. These dimers lower VH energy by 0.35&#8211;0.97&#160;eV in MAPbI3 and by 0.88&#8211;1.01&#160;eV in FAPbI3, compared to non&#8208;bonding configurations. These dimers significantly boosted potential energy barriers of hole capture, resulting in a dramatic reduction in carrier capture coefficients by over 10 orders of magnitude. Consequently, the total capture coefficients (Ctotal) for the dominant VH in MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 are on the order of 10&#8722;17 and 10&#8722;31 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1, respectively. By uncovering the negligible impact of VH on non&#8208;radiative recombination, this work shifts the focus toward more significant defects, for instance, iodine interstitial (with a capture coefficient on the order of 10&#8722;8 cm&#8722;3s&#8722;1), thereby paving the way for optimizing perovskite solar cells efficiency to meet the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

         <title>Steering the Product Selectivity of CO2&#160;Electroreduction by Single Atom Switching in Isostructural Copper Nanocluster Catalysts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of isostructural Cu nanoclusters (Cu13 and Cu14) with one&#8208;atom&#8208;change was synthesized by precisely single atom manipulation. One atom switching steers electrochemical CO2 reduction direction, in which Cu13 shows barely activity towards only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V, while, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V.








Abstract
Even single atom manipulation can cause drastic changes in catalytic activity and selectivity, especially in atomic&#8208;level catalysts. However, it is challenging to accurately elucidate the influence of specific atoms on performance due to the intertwined factors in catalysts. Atomically precise isostructural nanoclusters (NCs) can serve as ideal platforms to uncover the impact of individual atoms on catalytic properties. Herein, a pair of isostructural Cu NCs ([Cu13(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)7H10]0 and [Cu14(SC6H3F2)3(P(PhF)3)8H10]+ namely as Cu13 and Cu14) were synthesized. In the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, Cu13 shows barely any activity toward only 2e product CO with a maximum 13% FE at &#8722;1.1&#160;V. In contrast, Cu14 can promote CO2 deep reduction to hydrocarbons (CH4 and C2H4) with maximum FE of 54.3% at &#8722;1.2&#160;V. Based on the crystallographic and computational analyses, the extra Cu at the top in Cu14 squeezes the H connected with three core Cu into the center of the same plane, optimizing the electronic structure and thereby promoting CO2 activation and H2O dissociation, which is further confirmed by comprehensive in situ characterizations, kinetic experiments, and theoretical calculations. This work provides a unique isostructural NCs system to gain fundamental insights into switching catalytic reactivity by single&#8208;atom manipulation.

         <title>Polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) for Next Generation Anion Exchange Membranes</title>

Novel polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant piperidinium structures are effectively designed and synthesized, laying the foundation for the development of next&#8208;generation AEMs for applications in highly stable AEM&#8208;WEs.








Abstract
Terawatt&#8208;scale hydrogen production using anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEM&#8208;WEs) requires the development of facilely prepared, alkali&#8208;stable, and high&#8208;performance anion exchange membranes (AEMs). State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyarylpiperidinium AEMs fail to match the alkaline stability of piperidinium due to conformational deformation caused by the stiff cardo structure. Herein, polyarylmethylpiperidinium (PAMP) AEM with pendant structure is constructed by utilizing 4&#8208;formylpiperidine as a functional monomer. The inclusion of an aldehyde group in the synthesis enhances polymerization reactivity, reduces the amount of superacid required, and ensures that the piperidinium is suspended from the ether&#8208;free polymer backbone. The accelerated aging analysis demonstrates that the pendant structure of piperidinium effectively suppresses the Hofmann elimination, resulting in PAMP AEM with exceptional alkali stability, surpassing that of the commercial PiperION&#8208;A40. Most importantly, when assembled with non&#8208;noble metal OER/HER catalysts, the related AEM&#8208;WE achieves a remarkably high transient current density of 7.35 A cm&#8722;2 (@2&#160;V, 80&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;m KOH). Moreover, the AEM&#8208;WE can operate stably at industrial current density over 1500&#160;h (&#8776;1.70&#160;V at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2).

Most importantly, when assembled with non-noble metal OER/HER catalysts, the related AEM-WE achieves a remarkably high transient current density of 7.35 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (@2&#160;V, 80&#160;&#176;C, 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH). Moreover, the AEM-WE can operate stably at industrial current density over 1500&#160;h (&#8776;1.70&#160;V at 1.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Single&#8208;Atom Based Double&#8208;Reaction&#8208;Center Catalysis Triggers Internal&#8208;Driven and External&#8208;Driven Pathways for Green Fenton&#8208;Like Chemistry</title>

Iron single atoms in double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs)&#8208;based catalysts substituted the oxidants and dissolved oxygen as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07, and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere.








Abstract
Double&#8208;reaction&#8208;centers (DRCs) Fenton&#8208;like chemistry with low or zero oxidant addition has garnered increasing attentions due to their alignment with the principles of green and sustainable development. However, the regulation of such processes remains a significant challenge, primarily due to deficiencies in the microscopic interpretation of their electron migration mechanisms operating with low or zero oxidant addition. In this work, iron single&#8208;atom DRCs catalyst (Fe/N&#8208;SAC) was prepared for internal&#8208;driven system (zero oxidant addition) and external&#8208;driven system (low peroxymonosulfate [PMS] addition). Results indicated the absence of dissolved oxygen activation in the PMS&#8208;zreo Fe/N&#8208;SAC system, and the iron single atoms in the Fe/N&#8208;SAC acted as the predominate electron acceptors to extract the electrons from the electron&#8208;donating pollutants with iron valence decreasing from +2.37 to +2.07 and they could also be recovered under O2 atmosphere. In contrast, the electrons from the pollutants could be transferred to both PMS and iron atoms in the external&#8208;driven Fe/N&#8208;SAC/PMS system involving both predominant electron transfer process (ETP) and iron internal&#8208;driven. Furthermore, two experimental devices based on core mechanisms of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven systems were designed to achieve long&#8208;term operation. These studies will complement the core catalytic mechanisms and module applications of internal&#8208;driven and external&#8208;driven DRCs systems.

         <title>Engineered Polymeric Microspheres with Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Nanotraps and Multisite Adsorption for Ultrafast Herbicide Decontamination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crosslinked polymer microsphere &#947;CD&#8208;PF was constructed utilizing hydrogen bond&#8208;incorporating cyclodextrins and conjugated hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene. The removal efficiencies exceeding 98% for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s, with pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order adsorption kinetics constants (k2) of 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, respectively. The ultrafast adsoprtion is facilitated by a hydrogen&#8208;bond nanotrap&#8208;dominated multisite adsorption, which follows an initial electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction&#8208;induced surface enrichment.








Abstract
The ultrafast removal of trace herbicides like paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) from water is urgent yet challenging due to their highwater stability and strong&#8208;binding properties. Here, efficient PQ and DQ removal based on hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps dominant multisite adsorption were developed. Two crosslinked polymeric microspheres, &#946;CD&#8208;PF and &#947;CD&#8208;PF, were synthesized from cyclodextrins (CDs) and hexafluorocyclotriphosphazene (HFP). The &#947;CD&#8208;PF microsphere with sufficient hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps on the pore surface prompts adsorption kinetics constants of PQ and DQ up to 127.09 and 192.64&#160;g mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, achieving 99% removal efficiency for PQ and DQ within 5&#160;s. &#947;CD&#8208;PF exhibits exceptional selectivity for PQ and DQ over larger competing dyes. Importantly, trace PQ (1&#160;ppm) can be effectively treated with &#947;CD&#8208;PF to achieve a concentration far below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standard (0.003&#160;ppm) within 30&#160;s. The ultrafast adsorption is driven by a multisite mechanism: electrostatic and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions from HFP promote adsorbate accumulation on the CD surface, while the high&#8208;density hydrogen&#8208;bonding nanotraps in &#947;CD&#8208;PF enhance hydrogen bond strength, enabling rapid capture. This work provides a valuable strategy for designing ultrafast adsorbents for effective herbicide removal from water.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Activated Near Infrared/Shortwave Infrared Emissive Chromophores: Synthesis of Triphenylamine&#8208;Appended Pyrazinacenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active triphenylamine&#8208;appended pyrazinacenes show extreme reversible redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties. In their reduced state, absorption and emission bands fall well within the visible region. Oxidation results in a shift in the absorption and fluorescence bands to the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions while maintaining high fluorescence quantum yields.








Abstract
Organic dyes showing absorbance and fluorescence in the near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared regions are attractive for a variety of applications. Redox&#8208;coupled reversible switching of absorbance or fluorescence implies enhanced functionality of such dyes, especially where large changes in photophysical properties across the redox process can be realized. Here, the synthesis of two new pyrazinacenes containing four and five fused pyrazine units, appended with electron&#8208;donor triphenylamine groups, and redox&#8208;coupled switching of their photophysical properties is reported. In their reduced state, the compounds show absorbance and fluorescence in the visible region. Reversible shifts in absorbance and fluorescence from the visible to the near infrared or even short&#8208;wave infrared regions are observed upon chemical and electrochemical oxidations. Such large redox&#8208;coupled shifts in photophysical properties are unprecedented for a redox process that affects only a single, six&#8208;membered ring in which both reduced and oxidized states consist of neutral, closed&#8208;shell species. The compounds show high fluorescence quantum yields in their reduced states, and oxidized species show fluorescence quantum yields that compare well with existing near infrared and short&#8208;wave infrared active fluorescent dyes.

         <title>Universal Albumin Drugs&#8208;Cored Spherical Nucleic Acid (ad&#8208;SNA) Platform for Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By one&#8208;step aptamer modification of FDA&#8208;approved albumin drugs, we developed a versatile albumin drugs&#8208;spherical nucleic acid (adSNA) platform with tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, high aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, diverse drug loading capabilities, and simplified preparation with reduced costs. This platform achieves precise drug delivery, shows promising tumor mild photothermal therapy, and allows single&#8208;batch synthesis for clinical translation.








Abstract
Albumin&#8208;based drug delivery system, exemplified by FDA&#8208;approved treatments like Abraxane, have demonstrated significant potential in cancer therapy. However, albumin carriers still suffer from poor tumor&#8208;targeting capability, leading to low efficacy and systemic side effects on healthy cells in applications. Here, we report a general method for modification of albumin drugs by aptamer coating shell that are hydrophobically inserted into the albumin surface, for constructing albumin drugs&#8208;cored spherical nucleic acid (adSNA). This adSNA platform allows for the versatile loading of various therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy drugs, polyphenols, cuproptosis inducers, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photosensitizers, enabling targeted tumor delivery. Compared with covalent method, the hydrophobic insertion method has been proven to be of greater simplicity, higher aptamer&#8208;grafting efficiency, superior tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities, and comparable stability under physiological conditions. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we delivered NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents and heat shock protein inhibitors for tumor&#8208;specific mild photothermal therapy. Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR&#8208;II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures. In addition, the adSNAs are straightforward to synthesize and scalable for large&#8208;scale production, offering significant potential to advance the development of clinical targeted drugs.

Compared to traditional photothermal therapy (PTT), this approach utilizes NIR-II PTT agents to achieve greater tissue penetration while downregulating heat shock proteins in tumor cells, resulting in precise thermal ablation at lower temperatures. In addition, the adSNAs are straightforward to synthesize and scalable for large-scale production, offering significant potential to advance the development of clinical targeted drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise PBAEs: A Highly Efficient Single&#8208;Molecularly Defined Gene&#8208;Delivery System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, single&#8208;molecularly defined poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters) are synthesized for gene delivery. These precisely defined polymers exhibit relatively high gene&#8208;delivery efficiency and low toxicity, highlighting their potential for advanced therapeutic applications. The precise polymers also reveal new design principles for polymer&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery vectors, emphasizing the impact of structural precision.








Abstract
Gene&#8208;delivery polymers have wide therapeutic applications. The structures (e.g., molecular weight, polymer sequence, end groups, and topology) of gene&#8208;delivery polymers are of crucial importance to their properties including transfection efficiency, toxicity, and targeting capability. Thus, precise control over the structures of gene&#8208;delivery polymers is extremely beneficial for property optimizations and manufacturing reproducibility. However, sequence&#8208;defined gene&#8208;delivery polymers with high efficiency and low toxicity are rare, limited by synthetic strategies. In this work, we developed a method that enables poly(&#946;&#8208;amino esters), one of the most promising gene&#8208;delivery polymers, to be synthesized with precisely controlled and vastly variable molecular weight, end group, and topology. This synthetic strategy creates a new family of gene&#8208;delivery polymers with defined structures, offering significant potentials and revealing new design principles.

         <title>Kinetic Redox Shotgun Proteomics Reveals Specific Lipopolysaccharide Effects on Intestinal Epithelial Cells, Mitigated by a Mn Superoxide Dismutase Mimic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomics and redoxomics are efficient to quantify the effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide in intestinal epithelial cells (HT29) at the proteome and at the Cys&#8208;redoxome levels. Oxidative stress is the initial trigger of LPS leading to inflammation. A Mn&#8208;based superoxide mimetic (or mimic) was able to reduce oxidative stress and to mitigate the effects at the proteome level.








Abstract
Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2) dysregulation contribute to chronic inflammation such as generated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A kinetic redox shotgun proteomic strategy (OcSILAC for Oxidized cysteine Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture) was used to explore the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects including LPS&#8208;induced oxidation and inflammation cascades on a dedicated intestinal epithelial cell line (HT29&#8208;MD2) together with the potential mitigating role of a Mn&#8208;based SOD&#8208;mimic Mn1. While LPS induced transient oxidative damages at early times (15&#160;min), cells incubated with Mn1 showed, in this time frame, a significantly reduced cysteine oxidation, highlighting Mn1 antioxidant properties. Over time, cysteine oxidation of LPS&#8208;treated cells was counteracted by an overexpression of antioxidant proteins (SOD1, NQO1) and a late (6&#160;h) preponderant increase in SOD2 level. Mn1, when co&#8208;incubated with LPS, attenuated the level of most LPS&#8208;modified proteins, that is, proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Our results highlight Mn1 as a potentially effective antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent to consider in the treatment of IBD, as well as a useful tool for exploring the interconnection between oxidative stress and inflammation.

         <title>Establishing an Efficient Electron Transfer System for P450 Enzyme OleP to Improve the Biosynthesis of Murideoxycholic Acid by Redox Partner Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic redox partner engineering strategy is proposed for three&#8208;component P450s, including selection, reconstitution, engineering, and analysis of the most suitable redox partner. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.








Abstract
The electron transfer from NAD(P)H to heme is a rate&#8208;limiting step in the redox partner&#8208;mediated catalysis of P450 enzyme. However, due to the lack of efficient engineering strategies, it is difficult to improve the properties of redox partner. Herein, we construct an effective approach to modify the redox partner for a typical P450 enzyme (OleP) that can catalyze the stereoselective conversion of lithocholic acid to murideoxycholic acid. First, the combination of computational modeling and experimental validation was performed to rapidly identify the most suitable redox partner (PetH/PetF). Next, the interactions between PetF and OleP were investigated and the engineering on PetF was conducted to enhance the efficiency of electron transfer. Using a novel microplate screening method, a superior mutant (PetFF64D) was efficiently selected, which exhibited a significant enhancement in MDCA conversion yield from 32.5% to 80.9% and total turnover number (TTN) from 406.2 to 1617.9. Finally, through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, the analysis of electron transfer pathway, and the calculations of electron transfer rate, the mechanism of electron transfer was investigated. The applied engineering strategies, high&#8208;throughput screening methods, and analytical approaches provide a feasible way to construct an ideal redox partner for other P450 enzymes.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Post&#8208;Perovskite for Ultra&#8208;Sensitive Hard X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3 were achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. The assembled BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited excellent X&#8208;ray absorption capacity and high X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity.








Abstract
The density properties of semiconductors play a crucial role in applications, such as radiation detection, electronic devices, and aerospace technologies. However, controlling the density of semiconductors often leads to significant alterations in their electronic structure, which can result in the loss of their original semiconductor properties. Perovskite semiconductors, known for their excellent carrier transport properties, face limitations in hard X&#8208;ray detection due to their relatively low density and loose atomic packing. This study explores a series of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors with densities exceeding 5&#160;g&#160;cm&#8315;3, achieved through edge&#8208; and face&#8208;sharing connectivity of octahedra and strong polarization between metal and chalcogenide ions. These dense materials retain semiconductor properties while exhibiting superior electrical transport characteristics. When applied to hard X&#8208;ray detection, the post&#8208;perovskite materials demonstrated superior attenuation cross&#8208;sections compared to the heaviest 3D CsPbI3 perovskite and 0D Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite. Specifically, the BiCuSCl2 post&#8208;perovskite detector exhibited a high sensitivity of 4126&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a minimum detection limit of 4.3&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. The enhanced density also mitigates ionic migration, ensuring excellent electrical stability. These findings underscore the potential of post&#8208;perovskite semiconductors for advanced optoelectronic and radiation detection applications.

B, F, P, S, and N co&#8208;doped high&#8208;entropy nanocarbon (HENC) is synthesized through ZIF&#8208;8 modification and pyrolysis. It exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction, rivaling Pt/C, and notable stability. Simulations highlight synergistic heteroatom effects and entropy enhancement, with N, P, and S as crucial active sites. In zinc&#8211;air batteries, HENC achieves a peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2, surpassing Pt/C (542 mW cm&#8722;2), while maintaining durability. This study introduces a novel route for high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective catalysts.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability. In this study, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept high&#8208;entropy engineered nanocarbon (HENC) co&#8208;doped with five nonmetal elements (B, F, P, S, and N), synthesized via in situ polymerization modification of ZIF&#8208;8 followed by pyrolysis. The HENC exhibits outstanding performance as a nonmetal electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with activity on par with benchmark Pt/C electrocatalysts and superior cyclic stability. Simulations and all&#8208;site calculations reveal that the synergistic effects of abundant heteroatoms and increased system entropy facilitate the formation of *O2 species, with N, P, and S acting as the key active elements, while co&#8208;doping with B and F further enhances stability. Notably, HENCs have been validated as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8211;air batteries, achieving an impressive peak power density of 604 mW cm&#8722;2 and demonstrating long&#8208;term stability over a 16&#8208;day period, outpacing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (542 mW cm&#8722;2). This work not only enriches the concept of high entropy and advances the understanding of high&#8208;entropy materials but also opens a new avenue for the development of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;High-entropy materials are poised to revolutionize materials science and industrial applications due to their design flexibility, peculiar performance, and broad applicability.

         <title>Thiazolium&#8208;Linked Crystalline Porous Covalent Organic Frameworks for Mixed Electronic&#8208;Ionic Transport</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>

The new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs) were synthesized by a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach with well crystallinity, and high chemical stability, where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. Ionic thiazolium linkage endow these MEICOFs with recorded electronic (55.2 S m&#8722;1) and well ionic conductivity, thereby enabling ORR catalysis without additional conductive agent and the rotation of electrode.








Abstract
Developing efficiently mixed electronic&#8208;ionic (MEI) conductive microcosmic pathways within a single functional material is essential yet challenging for electronic devices. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) feature pre&#8208;designed functionalities and uniform pores, making them highly desirable platforms for transporting electrons and ions. However, for MEI conductive COFs, achieving high crystallinity when incorporating high&#8208;density ionic groups within the extensively &#960;&#8208;electron delocalized skeletons remain a challenge due to intermolecular interactions. Herein, we reported a &#8220;pre&#8208;polymerization followed by self&#8208;ionization&#8221; approach to synthesize new thiazolium&#8208;linked COFs (MEICOFs, M&#9552;Cu, Co, Fe), where the ionic groups synthesized following the connection of building blocks. MEICOFs demonstrated broad ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared absorption bands and narrow bandgaps. As a proof of concept, the mixed electronic and hydroxide ionic conductivity of CuEICOF was determined to be 55.2 and 0.01 S m&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, MEICOFs film could directly catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction without additional conductive agent and the rotation of the electrode.

         <title>Chiral Bimetallic Pt@Au Octapods with Spiral Four&#8208;Petal Flower&#8208;Like Symmetric Configuration as Sensitive SERS Probes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods with a g&#8208;factor of 0.026 at 724 nm have been fabricated, which endow the strong SERS signal due to the chiral selective enhancement of localized electromagnetic fields. Thus, an ultrasensitive detection method for the early clinical detection of AD is presented.








Abstract
Here, we synthesized chiral bimetallic Pt@Au octapods by using l/d&#8208;cysteine&#8211;threonine (CT) dipeptide as chiral ligands. These had a distinct spiral four&#8208;petal flower&#8208;like symmetric configuration with a twisted concave morphology on each facet. The twisted concave structure of the Pt@Au octapods facilitated intraparticle coupling, resulting in highly concentrated electric fields within the concave regions, thus creating &#8220;hot spots&#8221; that produced a potent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods showed a nearly twofold stronger SERS response to A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils than the d&#8208;Pt@Au octapods. The different association constants arose from the unique chiral recognition capabilities of the CT ligands on the surfaces of the l&#8208;Pt@Au octapods, which allowed them to form specific hydrogen bonds with A&#946;40 and A&#946;42 monomers and fibrils, producing significant differences in their Raman spectra. The data from clinical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples showed that the quantitative analysis of the A&#946;42/A&#946;40 ratio with Raman spectroscopy can be used as an effective biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a cut&#8208;off value of 0.085. Our results pave the way for the use of chiral nanomaterials with strong optical activities in the development of clinical testing instruments with biomedical applications.

         <title>Hybrid Linking Sites Constructed Non&#8208;Fully Conjugated Asymmetric Dimerized Giant Molecule Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells with an Efficiency of &#8776;20%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 64, Issue 19, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid linking site engineering was developed for the first time to construct nonfully conjugated asymmetric dimeric giant molecule acceptor (GMA) named 2Y&#8208;we, and the related organic solar cells achieved an efficiency of 19.9%, which is the highest value in the reported non&#8208;fully conjugated GMAs to date.








Abstract
Linking&#8208;site engineering, used to graft two or more monomers, is crucial for achieving high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;series giant molecule acceptors (Y&#8208;GMAs). However, the reported Y&#8208;GMAs all use a single&#8208;typed linking site, making it difficult to finely&#8208;tune their optoelectronic properties. Herein, we develop a non&#8208;fully conjugated Y&#8208;GMA (named 2Y&#8208;we), with hybrid linking sites at the wing and end&#8208;group of monomers, to combine the respective advantages of the wing and end&#8208;group site linked counterparts. Compared to its parental monomer, 2Y&#8208;we shows different intermolecular interactions, crystallinity, packing, and glass transition temperature, allowing optimized active layer morphology (including appropriate phase separation and ordered molecular packing) and stability. Consequently, the D18/2Y&#8208;we&#8208;based organic solar cells (OSCs) obtain an improved power&#8208;conversion&#8208;efficiency (PCE) of 17.4% with both higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC), due to the reduced energy loss and efficient exciton dissociation. Inspired by its high VOC&#160;&#215;&#160;JSC, 2Y&#8208;we is introduced into D18:L8&#8208;BO to fabricate ternary devices. Thanks to the further optimized morphology and improved charge transport, the ternary OSCs achieve a superior PCE of 19.9%, which is the highest value among the reported nonfully conjugated Y&#8208;GMAs. Our developed hybrid linking&#8208;site engineering for constructing high&#8208;performance Y&#8208;GMAs offers an approach to boost device efficiency.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Radical Allylic Substitution of Unprotected Allylic Alcohols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic substitution reactions are essential in organic synthesis, enabling the transformation of allylic reagents into diverse alkenes. Traditional methods, which typically operate through ionic pathways, often require substrate pre&#8208;activation to address high C&#8211;O bond dissociation energies, leading to challenges in regioselectivity and limited substrate compatibility. Here, we introduce an iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway for allylic substitution that directly activates unprotected allylic alcohols, leveraging the redox and oxophilic properties of low&#8208;valent iron to promote selective C&#8211;O bond cleavage and allylic transposition. This radical approach achieves high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity, providing access to a broad array of di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetra&#8208;substituted alkenes with moderate to excellent yields and exceptional E/Z selectivity. Mechanistic studies confirm that the iron catalyst generates radical intermediates and mediates efficient dehydroxylation, enabling this direct transformation without protective groups or Lewis acid activators. The method&#8217;s versatility is demonstrated through a broad substrate scope, including complex natural derivatives and functionalized alkyl halides, along with successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis and downstream derivatization. This iron&#8208;catalyzed radical pathway offers a sustainable and efficient alternative to conventional ionic methods, expanding the scope of allylic substitutions and advancing radical&#8208;based methodologies in synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Spin State Modulation in Spinel Oxides for Enhanced Nonradical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel oxides hold tremendous potential for driving advanced oxidation processes, yet the underlying mechanism for maximizing their activity remains unclear. In this study, we leverage tetrahedral and octahedral site interactions in MnxCo3&#8208;xO4 to modulate the spin states, specifically spin alignment and spin moment, thereby enhancing periodate (PI) activation and catalytic performance in contaminant degradation. Through combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) analyses, we elucidate the role of spin alignment at synergetic tetrahedral and octahedral sites in facilitating a quantum spin exchange interactions (QSEI) with an efficient electronic spin channel for charge transfer. Meanwhile, the engineered high spin configuration in CoMn2O4 raises the d&#8208;band center, favoring stable PI* surface complex formation and accelerating the rate&#8208;determining desorption of IO3&#8208; with a lower &#8208;ICOHP value during the catalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin. As a result, the fine&#8208;tuned spin state of CoMn2O4 leads to enhanced overall reaction kinetics, with a 2.5&#8208;fold increase compared to MnCo2O4and up to 22&#8208;fold increase compared to the octahedrally&#8208;active only catalysts. Such a site&#8208;specific modulation has been found applicable to other spinel oxides, enlightening fine&#8208;tuned electronic structure for maximizing catalytic performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial Water Structure Modulation  on Unconventional Phase Non&#8208;Precious Metal Alloy Nanostructures for Efficient Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia in Neutral Media</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) has been recognized as a sustainable route for nitrate removal and value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) synthesis. Regulating the surface active hydrogen (*H) behavior is crucial but remains a formidable challenge, especially in neutral electrolyte, greatly limiting the highly selective NH3 formation. Herein, we report the controlled synthesis of heterophase hcp/fcc non&#8208;precious CuNi alloy nanostructures for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis in neutral media. Significantly, hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 exhibits excellent performance with NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 98.1% and 57.4 mg h&#8208;1 mgcat&#8208;1, respectively. In&#8208;situ studies suggest that the high proportion of interfacial K+ ion hydrated water (K+&#8208;H2O) on hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 creates high *H coverage via boosting interfacial water dissociation, enabling the rapid hydrogenation kinetics for NH3 synthesis. Theoretical calculations reveal that the superior NO3RR performance of hcp/fcc Cu10Ni90 originates from both the existence of hcp phase to improve the electroactivity and the high Ni content to guarantee efficient active hydrogen supply. The strong interaction between Ni and Cu also optimizes the electronic structures of Cu sites to realize fast intermediate conversions with low energy barriers. This work provides a novel strategy to optimize surface *H behavior via tuning interfacial water structure by crystal phase control.</dc:description>

         <title>Interweaving Covalent Organic Polymer Chains into Two&#8208;Dimensional Networks: Synthesis, Single Crystal Structure and Application for Stabilizing Lithium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroscopic weaving has been proven to be the most enduring and effective method for manufacturing fabrics to meet the practical needs of humanity for thousands of years. However, the construction of molecular structures with exquisite topologies and specific properties based on molecular weaving is still in its infancy. Herein, we designed and fabricated a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) woven covalent organic polymer (COP) network (named as CityU&#8208;46) driven by the dative N&#8594;B bonds between the 1,4&#8208;bis(benzodioxa&#8208;borole)benzene (BACT) and 2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazole (BPT). The complex woven topology of CityU&#8208;46 was determined using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, revealing that it features a well&#8208;defined two&#8208;over and two&#8208;under interweaving pattern at the molecular level. Due to its structural merits, CityU&#8208;46 can be used as an artificial organic solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase layer on the surface of Li metal anodes, significantly improving the stability and long&#8208;term performance of lithium metal cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Bipolar Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Selective Acid Extraction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of bipolar covalent organic framework membranes with tunable charge distributions is fabricated, demonstrating a significant rectification effect and an internal electric field. These features promote the translocation of NO3&#8722;, which has a low valence and dispersed charge density, resulting in a higher transmembrane diffusion coefficient than its self&#8208;diffusion rate. This enhances the selective extraction of NO3&#8722; from mixed waste.








Abstract
Nitric acid (HNO3) is a vital industrial chemical, and its recovery from complex waste streams is essential for sustainability and resource optimization. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of bipolar covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with tunable ionic site distributions as a solution for this challenge. The membranes are fabricated by layering anionic COF nanosheets on cationic COF layers, supported by a porous substrate. The resulting membranes exhibit significant rectifying behavior, driven by the asymmetric charge polarity and the intrinsic electric field, which enhances HNO3 transport. The transmembrane diffusion coefficient of 2.74&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 cm2 s&#8722;1 exceeds the self&#8208;diffusion rate of NO3&#8722;, leading to increased HNO3 flux and selectivity compared to the individual anionic and cationic COF membranes. The optimized bipolar membrane configuration achieves remarkable separation factors, ranging from 22 to 242,000 for HNO&#8323;, in comparison to other solutes such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, and various metal salts in an eight&#8208;component mixed waste stream. This results in a substantial increase in HNO&#8323; purity, from 12.5% to 94.1% after a single membrane separation. With the broad range of COF materials and the versatility of the proposed membrane design, this work represents a significant advancement in chemical separation technologies.

This results in a substantial increase in HNO&#8323; purity, from 12.5% to 94.1% after a single membrane separation. With the broad range of COF materials and the versatility of the proposed membrane design, this work represents a significant advancement in chemical separation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Transformation in Lanthanum Nickelate for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the reconstruction mechanism of catalysts and designing methods to promote reconstruction are crucial for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) research. By employing a ferric ion surface pre&#8208;etching method, rapid reconstruction of the LaNiO3 catalyst is observed at low OER potentials, thus achieving high OER activity and stability.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;based perovskite oxides are identified as promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in view of their low cost, highly tunable structure, and potential high activity. However, the performance and catalyst design are hindered by their sluggish surface reconstruction kinetics. We introduce a ferric ion pre&#8208;etching strategy to enhance the surface reconstruction of typical LaNiO3. The hydrolysis of ferric ions generates hydrated protons that corrode the La&#8208;O terminal sites, inducing lattice distortion and lowering the energy barrier for reconstruction. Concurrently, ferric ion substitution for Ni creates crucial active sites after OER reconstruction, and enables the low&#8208;activity LaNiO3 to become highly active and superior to the benchmark RuO2 and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal substantial surface transformation from corner&#8208;sharing to edge&#8208;sharing NiO6 at 1.43&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the surface pre&#8208;etched sample (LNFeIII&#8208;spe). This reconstruction is initiated by the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) and transitions to the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), underscoring the transformation of distinct OER mechanisms.

However, the performance and catalyst design are hindered by their sluggish surface reconstruction kinetics. We introduce a ferric ion pre-etching strategy to enhance the surface reconstruction of typical LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The hydrolysis of ferric ions generates hydrated protons that corrode the La-O terminal sites, inducing lattice distortion and lowering the energy barrier for reconstruction. Concurrently, ferric ion substitution for Ni creates crucial active sites after OER reconstruction, and enables the low-activity LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to become highly active and superior to the benchmark RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs).

         <title>Design of Intrinsically Stable Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers by Introducing Fused&#8208;ring Intramolecular Donor&#8208;Acceptor Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hole&#8208;selective self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) incorporating electron&#8208;donating conjugated units as head groups have witnessed remarkable success in helping achieve high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, the shallow lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of these molecules often render their susceptibility to photodegradation. To tackle this problem, we introduce fused&#8208;ring intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions into the design of SAM molecules to downshift the LUMO level. The resultant molecule, JJ32, shows both enhanced photostability and intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the fused&#8208;ring intramolecular D&#8208;A interactions also help stabilize the radical cation state of JJ32 to result in significantly improved redox stability. This enables them to be included into polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based composite hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) for resulting in an impressive efficiency of 19.62% alongside significantly enhanced stability in corresponding OSCs. This study not only validates the concept of using fused&#8208;ring D&#8208;A&#8208;structure SAMs to improve the efficiency and stability of OSCs, but also elucidates the relationship between SAM structures and POM doping behaviors to provide an effective strategy in designing intrinsically stable SAM molecules for high&#8208;performance OSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Fe Catalysts With Improved Metal Loading for Efficient Ammonia Synthesis Under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing Zn atoms with Fe in Fe1&#8211;Zn1&#8211;N&#8211;C, a porphyrin MOF&#8208;pyrolyzed porous carbon involving single&#8208;atom Fe and Zn sites, affords FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C with improved single&#8208;atom Fe loading. The resulting FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C exhibits an exceptionally high ammonia synthesis rate under mild conditions (1 atm, 300 &#176;C), significantly outperforming all other counterparts, the traditional dominant fused iron and Ru&#8208;based precious metal catalysts.








Abstract
Ammonia synthesis is a cornerstone in the chemical industry. Given that the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch (H&#8208;B) process requires very high temperature and pressure, it is imperative to develop catalysts capable of facilitating ammonia synthesis under mild conditions. In this work, a post&#8208;metal replacement strategy is developed to improve the Fe loading in single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;implanted N&#8208;doped carbon catalysts. Starting from the Zn&#8211;Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C material with single&#8208;atom Zn and Fe sites coexisting in N&#8208;doped porous carbon pyrolyzed from porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the replacement of single&#8208;atom Zn with Fe sites is performed, which significantly increases the Fe loading from 1.33 to 2.39 wt%. This effectively suppresses the migration and agglomeration of Fe, yielding Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C with high metal loading (FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C). Notably, the FeHL&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits a catalytic rate of 558&#160;&#181;mol&#183;gcat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at 300 &#176;C for ammonia synthesis at atmospheric pressure, far surpassing the performance of the traditional dominant fused iron and even Ru&#8208;based precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Inside Front Cover: Exploring the Mechanism of Surface Cationic Vacancy Induces High Activity of Metastable Lattice Oxygen in Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism by which surface cation vacancies induce high activity of metastable lattice oxygen is reported by Yao Xiao, Xiaoxian Zhao, Weibo Hua, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202419664). The grasping of the robotic arm is used to metaphorically describe the directional extraction of Li+ on the surface by dilute acid. The ripples spreading layer by layer from the center outward in a circular ring shape metaphorically represent the redistribution of electrons.

         <title>To Make a Painstaking Investigation: Revealing the Electrochemical Reactions in Aqueous Zn&#9472;Mn Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition mechanism is not clear. To verify the underlying mechanism, skillfully managing compositional Zn||MnO2 battery, revealing the dual&#8208;discharge platform chemistry due to dissolution reaction rather than Zn2+/H+ intercalation. They influenced by proton concentration and Zn2+ hydrolysis, with Discharge Plateau I driven by excess H+ and Plateau II by Zn2+ hydrolysis.








Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous Zn||MnO2 batteries have been extensively explored, but the electrochemical reaction mechanisms, especially in terms of Mn2+/MnO2 dissolution/deposition and Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry, are still not fully understood. Herein, a Zn||MnO2&#8208;based battery system is constructed and the variation of the battery composition is skillfully regulated by the separation of variables. The possibility of Zn2+/H+ intercalation chemistry is ruled out and the dominance of the dissolution/deposition mechanism is strongly demonstrated. This study confirms that the chemistry of the controversial double&#8208;discharge platform is a dissolution reaction, determined by different proton concentrations and zinc ions hydrolysis. Discharge Plateau I is the MnO2 dissolution dominated by the surplus H+ in the electrolyte, while Discharge Plateau II is the smooth discharge plateau resulting from the hydrolysis of Zn2+ releasing protons when the proton concentration decreases to the point of Zn(OH)2 generation. This work provides a better understanding of the dissolution/deposition mechanism of Zn||MnO2 and paves the way for the practical application of manganese&#8208;based aqueous batteries. It also provides a comprehensive method to study the mechanism of electrochemical reactions.

         <title>Control over S(VI)&#8208;Stereogenic Center: NHC&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of N&#8208;Acyl Cyclic Sulfonimidamides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first organocatalytic enantioselective synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides (SIAs) via desymmetrization of prochiral SIA anions is presented. The in situ generated acylazolium from easily available aldehydes using NHC was intercepted with SIA anions to deliver configurationally stable N&#8208;acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies, including DFT, provide insight into the possible reaction pathway, and functionalization of the SIAs are also provided.








Abstract
The catalytic enantioselective synthesis of aza&#8208;sulfur(VI) compounds holds significant potential in pharmaceuticals owing to their broad spectrum of biological properties. Herein, we report the first N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective synthesis of cyclic sulfonimidamides (SIAs). The free N&#8211;H containing SIAs often exhibit configurational lability through tautomerization. We investigated this by demonstrating their nonsymmetric nature in both solid state and solution. The in situ generated chiral acylazolium intermediates from easily accessible aldehydes in the presence of NHC and oxidant were trapped with the prochiral cyclic SIA anions, allowing the enantioselective synthesis of configurationally stable N&#8208;acyl cyclic SIAs. Mechanistic studies reveal that the present strategy proceeds via the desymmetrization of the prochiral SIA anions. Moreover, the derivatization of the synthesized N&#8208;acyl SIAs highlights the practical utility of the present methodology.

         <title>Photoactivated Enzymatic Reaction Network Enables Spatiotemporal Programming of Thiol/Disulfide Redox Systems</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a redox&#8208;based enzymatic reaction network that can be photoactivated and recharged multiple times to sustain dissipative disulfide formation. The innovative system integrates an upstream oxidative enzymatic process with a downstream reducing agent&#8208;regenerating enzymatic mechanism. The redox&#8208;based enzymatic reaction network facilitates lithographic programming of sol&#8208;gel transformation in a hydrogel material system.








Abstract
Implementing photoactivation into chemical reaction networks (CRNs) offers opportunities for on&#8208;demand and remote activation, fuel storage, creating autonomous materials and systems with precise spatial activation. However, examples in this domain remain limited. Here, we introduce a cascaded redox&#8208;based enzymatic reaction network (ERN) capable of photoinitiation and refueling, centered around dissipative aromatic disulfide bond formation. To achieve photoinitiation, we integrate an upstream enzymatic module (EM) into the ERN, where the substrate of the EM can be photouncaged using blue light irradiation. A downstream regeneration system enhances the robustness of the reducing environment for repeated fueling. This cascaded ERN operates in solution, allowing for controlled dissipative disulfide formation while avoiding short&#8208;circuit reactions (SCR) between the oxidative and reductive halves of the reaction cycle. To showcase the utility of this photoactivated ERN, we couple it with aromatic thiol&#8208;terminated star polymers (sPEG&#8208;ArSH) to enable spatiotemporally controlled dissipative hydrogel formation using lithographic masks.

         <title>Functional Dendrimer Nanogels for DNA Delivery and Gene Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrimer nanogels are designed by emulsion&#8208;free method, endowing them with dual&#8208;active groups, o&#8208;hydroxyl amine, temperature&#8208;responsiveness, polyampholyte property, and self&#8208;triggered aminolysis. With these unique characters, dendrimer nanogels display high gene transfection and therapeutic efficacies with low side effects, thus solving the dilemma between efficacy and cytotoxicity of conventional cationic colloidal vectorsin gene delivery.








Abstract
Solving the dilemma between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors is one of the biggest challenges in gene delivery. Cationic dendrimer assemblies with hierarchical structure, smart and biomimetic behaviors have been developed for drug/gene delivery in vivo. Among different dendrimer assemblies, the dendrimer&#8208;based nanogels were not intensively studied due to complicated synthesis and unknown properties. Here, for the first time, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels with high yield and purity, tunable size, uniform morphology, and good colloidal stability were synthesized using the emulsion&#8208;free method, which cannot be obtained by the miniemulsion method. Importantly, the dendrimer nanogels integrate the advantages of low&#8208;generation dendrimer and stimuli&#8208;responsive polymer, thus achieving dual&#8208;active groups, o&#8208;hydroxyl amine units, temperature&#8208;responsiveness, polyampholyte property, and self&#8208;triggered aminolysis. With these unique properties, dendrimer nanogels can &#8220;temporarily&#8221; acquire high charge density through the covalent crosslinking of low&#8208;generation dendrimer for improved DNA compression, promoted cell internalization and lysosomal escape, and efficient DNA delivery, followed by self&#8208;triggered aminolysis into small dendrimers to control DNA release, reduce cytotoxicity, and facilitate metabolism in vivo. Compared to high&#8208;generation dendrimers, low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels display higher gene transfection and therapeutic efficacies, and lower side effects simultaneously. This work provides a facile strategy for the preparation of low&#8208;generation dendrimer nanogels that break up the contradiction between efficacy and cytotoxicity of cationic colloidal vectors in gene therapy. This innovative approach to construct low&#8208;generation dendrimers into smart dendrimer nanogels will have broad applicability in clinical translation.

This study synthesizes four isomers of benzodipyrrole&#8208;based A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type organic semiconductor acceptors for organic solar cells (OSCs), and investigates their molecular geometry&#8208;property relationship. The results highlight the effect of geometry on the physicochemical properties, molecular orientation and stacking, as well as donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and miscibility, ultimately contributing to the high power conversion efficiency of 19.94% (certified as 19.54%) for the OSCs based on D18:C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl.








Abstract
Molecular geometry plays a crucial role in determining the physical and chemical properties of organic semiconductor materials. However, there is little research on the molecular geometry&#8208;property relationship of A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs), which are the most representative organic semiconductor materials used in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, we used dichlorine&#8208;substituted benzene as the A&#8217; unit to overcome the geometry constraints imposed by the conventional A&#8217; unit that has a large size. Four isomers of benzodipyrrole&#8208;based SMAs (C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, &#577;&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, M&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl, and S&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl) with C&#8208;, &#577;&#8208;, M&#8208;, and S&#8208;shaped molecular geometries were synthesized, and the effect of molecular geometry on their photovoltaic performance was studied. We revealed that the molecular geometry influences the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties in three aspects: 1) intrinsic physicochemical properties, including energy levels, absorption, and reorganization energy; 2) molecular stacking pattern, which governs the exciton diffusion and charge transport processes; and 3) donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and miscibility. We found that the C&#8208;shaped molecular geometry possesses a suitable energy level and absorption range, dense and ordered molecular stacking, and improved donor&#8211;acceptor interaction and miscibility. These advantages enable a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.94% (certified as 19.54%) for the binary OSCs based on D18:C&#8208;Cl46&#8208;Cl active layer. The other SMAs showed weaknesses in different aspects, such as limited absorption of &#577;&#8208;shaped SMA, large reorganization energies and loose molecular stacking of M&#8208;shaped SMA, low solubility and strong aggregation of S&#8208;shaped SMA. These properties resulted in inferior photovoltaic device performance. These findings on the molecular geometry&#8208;property relationships will be instructive for future molecular design of high&#8208;performance A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs.

The first total syntheses of rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;Wallichanol A, (&#8208;)&#8208;Sanguinolane, and (&#8208;)&#8208;Wallichanol B were accomplished via a concise sequence featuring an intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition to forge a unique tricyclo[3.3.1.02,&#8311;]nonane core. Key steps include a selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reduction, Robinson annulation, and aerobic oxidations to &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones.








Abstract
Herein, we report the first enantioselective total syntheses of three rearranged ent&#8208;trachylobane diterpenoids, (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol A (1), (&#8211;)&#8208;Wallichanol B (2), and (&#8211;)&#8208;Sanguinolane (3), using a 13, 17, and 14 step longest&#8208;linear sequences respectively, featuring a novel intramolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition to construct the unique pentacyclic framework containing an unprecedented tricyclo[3.3.1.02,7]nonane motif. Other key steps in the synthetic route include a highly challenging, selective alkene reduction via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), leveraging the thermodynamic preference for a tertiary carbon&#8208;centered radical; a Robinson&#8208;type annulation to construct the tricyclic terpenoid building block; and applying aerobic oxidation at two distinct points to form &#945;&#8208;hydroxy ketones, facilitating the enantioselective syntheses of these diterpenoids.

         <dc:description>The systematic design of organotin&#8208;oxo macrocycles with enhanced extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photon&#8208;harvesting capability and sub&#8208;50 nm lithographic resolution remains a pivotal challenge in advancing nanofabrication technologies. Herein, we present a novel series of polynuclear nbutyltin&#8208;oxygen macrocycles&#8212;Sn8, Sn12&#8208;&#945;, Sn12&#8208;&#946;, and Sn12Fe18&#8212;constructed through selenite ligand&#8208;driven supramolecular assembly. Among these, Sn12&#8208;&#945; demonstrated exceptional electron beam lithography (EBL) performance, achieving a critical dimension resolution of 50 nm at a low dose of 50 &#956;C&#183;cm&#8208;2, attributed to its elevated Sn/Se content, compact molecular architecture (diameter, 1.5 nm), and excellent film&#8208;forming ability (surface roughness, 0.59 nm). By replacing conventional carboxylate ligands with inorganic selenite, this study addresses longstanding limitations in structural versatility and EUV absorption efficiency inherent to traditional organotin&#8208;oxo systems. These findings establish a paradigm for engineering metal&#8208;oxide photoresists through ligand&#8208;driven cluster dimensionality control, offering a scalable pathway to high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution patterning for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Basis for the Catalytic Mechanism of ATP&#8208;Dependent Diazotase CmaA6</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several diazotases have been reported in recent years, but the detailed catalytic mechanism is unclear. From X&#8208;ray crystallography and Cryo&#8208;EM analysis, we obtained the structure of a diazotase CmaA6, which synthesizes 3&#8208;diazocoumaric acid. Kinetic analysis and computational analysis indicated that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via an unprecedented sequential mechanism in which three substrates are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket.








Abstract
Although several diazotases have been recently reported, the details of the reaction mechanism are not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of CmaA6, an ATP&#8208;dependent diazotase, which catalyzes the diazotization of 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid using nitrous acid. X&#8208;ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy&#8208;single particle analysis revealed CmaA6 structures in the substrate&#8208;free and AMP&#8208;binding states. Kinetic analysis suggested that CmaA6 catalyzes diazotization via a sequential reaction mechanism in which three substrates (nitrous acid, ATP, and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid) are simultaneously bound in the reaction pocket. The nitrous acid and 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid binding sites were predicted based on the AMP&#8208;binding state and confirmed by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis. In addition, computational analysis revealed a tunnel for 3&#8208;aminocoumaric acid to enter the reaction pocket, which was advantageous for the sequential reaction mechanism. This study provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism of diazotization in natural product biosynthesis.

         <title>Giant Birefringence Enabled by the Highly Anisotropic Linear IX2&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br) Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel, easily grown birefringent crystals featuring linear interhalogen birefringence&#8208;active groups, IX&#8322;&#8315; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), namely [H&#8208;4AP][ICl&#8322;], [HDMA]&#8322;[ICl&#8322;]&#183;Cl, [H&#8208;4AP][IBr&#8322;], and [HDMA]&#8322;[IBr&#8322;]&#183;Br, exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions, while achieving an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap. 








Abstract
Birefringent crystals are essential for polarized optical devices, yet achieving large birefringence through rational design remains challenging. The key lies in constructing birefringence&#8208;active groups (BAGs) with giant polarization anisotropy and optimal spatial arrangements. Here, we report the successful construction of linear interhalogen BAGs, IX2&#8722; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), enabling giant polarization anisotropy. This was accomplished by simple halogenation of IO3&#8722; groups in an aqueous solution. Four novel birefringent crystals were synthesized: [H&#8208;4AP][ICl2] (1, 4AP&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;aminopyridine), [HDMA]2[ICl2]&#183;Cl (2, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylamine), [H&#8208;4AP][IBr2] (3), and [HDMA]2[IBr2]&#183;Br (4). In all these compounds, the linear IX2&#8722; BAG adopts parallel arrangements, effectively maximizing synergistic polarization anisotropy. As a result, compounds 1&#8211;4 exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible (0.647, 0.585, 0.836, and 0.782 at 546&#160;nm) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions (0.510, 0.356, 0.762, and 0.509 at 1064&#160;nm), surpassing commercial birefringent crystals and many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials. Furthermore, these compounds achieve an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap among linear BAG&#8208;based materials. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the IX2&#8722; BAGs play a dominant role in this exceptional birefringence. This study demonstrates the remarkable potential of linear interhalogen anions for developing high&#8208;performance birefringent crystals.

&lt;p&gt;Four novel, easily grown birefringent crystals featuring linear interhalogen birefringence-active groups, IX&#8322;&#8315; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), namely [H-4AP][ICl&#8322;], [HDMA]&#8322;[ICl&#8322;]&#183;Cl, [H-4AP][IBr&#8322;], and [HDMA]&#8322;[IBr&#8322;]&#183;Br, exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible and near-infrared regions, while achieving an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birefringent crystals are essential for polarized optical devices, yet achieving large birefringence through rational design remains challenging. The key lies in constructing birefringence-active groups (BAGs) with giant polarization anisotropy and optimal spatial arrangements. Here, we report the successful construction of linear interhalogen BAGs, IX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br), enabling giant polarization anisotropy. This was accomplished by simple halogenation of IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; groups in an aqueous solution. Four novel birefringent crystals were synthesized: [H-4AP][ICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 4AP&#160;=&#160;4-aminopyridine), [HDMA]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[ICl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#183;Cl (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, DMA&#160;=&#160;dimethylamine), [H-4AP][IBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and [HDMA]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[IBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#183;Br (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). In all these compounds, the linear IX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; BAG adopts parallel arrangements, effectively maximizing synergistic polarization anisotropy. As a result, compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibit giant birefringence values in both the visible (0.647, 0.585, 0.836, and 0.782 at 546&#160;nm) and near-infrared (NIR) regions (0.510, 0.356, 0.762, and 0.509 at 1064&#160;nm), surpassing commercial birefringent crystals and many state-of-the-art materials. Furthermore, these compounds achieve an optimal balance between giant birefringence and moderate bandgap among linear BAG-based materials. Detailed theoretical calculations confirm that the IX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; BAGs play a dominant role in this exceptional birefringence. This study demonstrates the remarkable potential of linear interhalogen anions for developing high-performance birefringent crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ba&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ge Clathrate Transformation Maximizes Active Site Utilization of Nickel for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, this study demonstrates a huge advantage of the clathrate Ba&#8211;Ni&#8211;Ge intermetallic bulk over metallic nickel as a high&#8208;performance alkaline OER precatalyst. It displays remarkable activity and stability under high current densities, facilitated by a thorough reconstruction process that yields a porous and defective NiOOH nanoarchitecture, as comprehensively examined through a series of in situ and ex situ techniques.








Abstract
Discovering novel oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (pre)catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is pivotal for advancing decarbonization technologies. In this study, we present the ternary Ba8Ni6Ge40 phase with an open clathrate structure exhibiting remarkable performance in alkaline OER. When integrated into an alkaline water electrolyzer, this clathrate precatalyst achieves high stability under a sustained current density of &#8764;550&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 10 days. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and (micro)structural characterizations, we elucidate the complete electrochemical transformation of Ba8Ni6Ge40 (~90 weight% leaching) forming ultrathin nanosheets composed of a porous and defective NiOOH nanostructure with maximized accessible active site exposure. Notably, a reversible phase transition mainly between Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH has also been established in the electrochemical redox process. Meanwhile, the successful application of the model Ba8Ni6Ge40 precatalyst represents a promising new class of functional inorganic materials for water electrolysis.

         <title>Enhancing Built&#8208;In Electric Field via Balancing Interfacial Atom Orbit Hybridization at Boride@Sulfide Heterostructure for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field in transition metal&#8208;based boride@sulfide heterostructured catalysts by balancing interfacial atom orbit hybridization, induces the upshifted d&#8208;band center, optimizes the adsorption energy of OH* intermediates, and reduces the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (OH* desorption step), thus favoring the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Exploring nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts for cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has facilitated the realization of hydrogen economy toward water electrolysis in alkaline media. However, the difficult water dissociation process for the Volmer step (H2O&#160;&#8594;&#160;H*&#160;+&#160;OH*) and the subsequent unsuitable OH* adsorption energy on nonprecious metal&#8208;based catalysts severely reduce the kinetics of HER. Herein, the universal synthesis for a series of transition metal (Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, and W)&#8208;based boride@sulfide heterostructured catalysts is realized by using the molten&#8208;salt method to conduct the in situ boronization of commercial sulfides. Significantly, WB2@WS2 heterostructured catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity and stability for HER. Balancing interfacial atom orbit hybridization between W(d)&#8208;B(s,p) and W(d)&#8208;S(s,p) at WB2@WS2 heterostructured interface enhances the built&#8208;in electric field. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the strong built&#8208;in electric field in WB2@WS2 optimizes the adsorption and desorption of OH* intermediate, reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (OH* desorption step), and thus favoring the enhancement of catalytic performance toward HER.

         <title>Engineering a Proximity Biosensor via Constitutional Dynamic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel proximity biosensor was introduced based on the principle of constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC), achieving high binding affinity, low background, and robust performances for homogeneous antibody detection in both buffer and human serum samples.








Abstract
Affinity binding&#8208;induced DNA assembly is a fundamental principle for designing proximity biosensors for sensitive and wash&#8208;free protein detection and imaging. However, current design strategies for these biosensors face an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between binding affinity and background signal. Here, we demonstrate that this intrinsic issue can be addressed by using constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC) as a guiding principle in the rational design of proximity biosensors. As exists in a dynamic equilibrium, the constitutional dynamic network (CDN)&#8208;based proximity biosensors can be adjusted to maximize the affinity to the target protein while minimizing non&#8208;specific interactions that contribute to background signals. By further detecting the ratio of agonist to antagonist within the CDN, we also significantly improved assay robustness, enabling the sensitive detection of antibodies in complex matrices such as human serum. With the high affinity, low background, and high robustness, we anticipate that our CDN&#8208;based design strategy will find wide applications in biosensor development. Our study also opens the possibility to engineer protein&#8208;responsive synthetic systems with complex dynamic behaviors and functions.

         <title>Polyphosphorus Ligand Complexes of Coinage Metals for Multiple Capturing of Intact P4 Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 and C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) with coinage metal salts and white phosphorus afforded an unprecedented novel class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes in which metal ions multiply coordinate intact P4 tetrahedra. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the right choice of the solvent tune the structure and the content of P4 in the coordination products that can release P4 upon decomplexation.








Abstract
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly reactions of [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR&#160;=&#160;C5(CH3)5 (Cp*, 1a), C5(4&#8208;EtC6H4)5) (CpPEt, 1b)) with the coinage metal salts [Cu(CH3CN)4][SbF6] or AgSbF6 were investigated to study the prerequisites for the potential coordination of white phosphorus by using a sterically encumbered CpR ligand and noncoordinating anions. In the self&#8208;assembly reactions with white phosphorus, either 0D or 1D coordination complexes are formed, all of which feature coordinated intact P4 tetrahedra and thus comprise an unprecedented class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes capable of complete release of P4 in solution confirmed by NMR studies. The bulkiness of the used CpR ligand and the correctly chosen solvent allowed for obtaining more beneficial structural motifs, the first discrete tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinated cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand complexes, that provide the maximal content of coordinated P4 molecules per species known so far. All products are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.

&lt;p&gt;Two- and three-component self-assembly reactions of [Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;Fe(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;=&#160;C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (Cp*, &lt;b&gt;1a&lt;/b&gt;), C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(4-EtC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) (Cp&lt;sup&gt;PEt&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1b&lt;/b&gt;)) with the coinage metal salts [Cu(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] or AgSbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; were investigated to study the prerequisites for the potential coordination of white phosphorus by using a sterically encumbered Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; ligand and noncoordinating anions. In the self-assembly reactions with white phosphorus, either 0D or 1D coordination complexes are formed, all of which feature coordinated intact P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra and thus comprise an unprecedented class of mixed polyphosphorus ligand complexes capable of complete release of P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in solution confirmed by NMR studies. The bulkiness of the used Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; ligand and the correctly chosen solvent allowed for obtaining more beneficial structural motifs, the first discrete tetra- and penta-coordinated &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-P&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ligand complexes, that provide the maximal content of coordinated P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; molecules per species known so far. All products are characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fused Dual&#8208;Donor Design for Accelerating Reverse Intersystem Crossing Rates of Spatially Folded Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A type TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2) with dual&#8208;donor fusion design have been developed, which achieve the accelerated RISC rates (up to 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1) through dense excited&#8208;state engineering, enabling solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with high EQEs (23.9%) and low efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
The development of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT)&#8208;thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material is defective in relatively low reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates (commonly &lt;5&#160;&#215;&#160;105 s&#8722;1). Herein, we fuse two 3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;8H&#8208;indolo[3,2,1&#8208;de]acridine (IAc) donor units to obtain large planar donors (m&#8208;bIAc and p&#8208;bIAc) for forming spatially folded A&#8211;D|D&#8211;A configured TSCT emitters (DCT&#8208;1 and DCT&#8208;2). The configuration of highly parallel and large&#8208;plane intramolecular multiple &#960;&#8208;stacking has been achieved. The symmetrical multi&#8208;channel charge transfer networks of emitters induce multiple energetically proximal excited states within a small energy range (&lt;0.12&#160;eV) at the lowest excited state, creating additional configuration interaction and spin&#8208;orbit coupling channels to accelerate the RISC process. This molecular configuration yields enhanced RISC rates of 6.19&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;1 and 1.05&#160;&#215;&#160;106 s&#8722;1 for DCT&#8208;2. Solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes employing these emitters achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies of 18.9% (DCT&#8208;1, 474&#160;nm sky&#8208;blue emission) and 23.9% (DCT&#8208;2, 498&#160;nm green emission), with attenuated efficiency roll&#8208;offs of DCT&#8208;2 (12% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2). This work provides a critical pathway for manipulating dense excited states to address the bottleneck of the RISC rates while maintaining structural rigidity, promoting further advancement of TSCT&#8208;TADF materials.

         <title>Uni&#8208;Electrolyte: An Artificial Intelligence Platform for Designing Electrolyte Molecules for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial intelligence platform, namely Uni&#8208;Electrolyte, was constructed to design electrolyte molecules for rechargeable batteries. The Uni&#8208;Electrolyte includes three parts, i.e., EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor, which can design new molecules, predict their retrosynthesis pathways and reaction conditions, and predict the chemical mechanism to produce a solid electrolyte interphase, respectively.








Abstract
Electrolytes are an essential part of rechargeable batteries, such as lithium batteries. However, electrolyte innovation is facing grand challenges due to the complicated solution chemistry and infinite molecular space (&gt;1060 for small molecules). This work reported an artificial intelligence (AI) platform, namely Uni&#8208;Electrolyte, for designing advanced electrolyte molecules, which mainly includes three parts, i.e., EMolCurator, EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor. New molecules can be designed by combining high&#8208;throughput screening and generative AI models from more than 100 million alternative molecules in the EMolCurator module. The molecular properties, including frontier molecular orbital information, formation energy, binding energy with a Li ion, viscosity, and dielectric constant, can be adopted as the screening parameters. The EMolForger and EMolNetKnittor modules can predict the retrosynthesis pathway and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation mechanism for a given molecule, respectively. With the assistance of advanced AI methods, the Uni&#8208;Electrolyte is strongly supposed to discover new electrolyte molecules and chemical principles, promoting the practical application of next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

         <title>In Situ Cation Exchange Enables Air&#8208;Processed Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with over 25% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ cation exchange strategies were utilized to fabricate a PbI&#8322; shell on perovskite surfaces, improving crystallinity, the energy level alignment, and reducing defects of perovskite films. The devices fabricated in ambient air could achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% with excellent stability under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I protocols. 








Abstract
The scalable fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) in humid air with an antisolvent&#8208;free process is essential for future industrial applications. However, high humidity poses significant challenges for achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films, making it difficult to attain efficient IPSCs under ambient conditions. Here, we present an in situ cation exchange strategy to create a compact and uniform PbI&#8322; shell on the perovskite surface by using ZnI&#8322; in acetonitrile (ACN), where Zn2+ replaces Pb2+. This transformation is attributed to the surface defects of the perovskite, which undergo a cation exchange reaction in humid air, forming a compact PbI&#8322; shell. The n&#8208;type PbI&#8322; shell effectively encapsulates the perovskite films, minimizing air exposure while optimizing energy level alignment, thereby enhancing electron transport and extraction. As a result, we demonstrate IPSCs with efficiencies of 25.2% under ambient conditions (25&#176;&#8211;30&#160;&#176;C, 60%&#160;&#177;&#160;10% relative humidity [RH]), on par with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices fabricated in inert atmospheres. The devices demonstrated remarkable stability, enduring aging tests under the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS) protocols ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1I and ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2I for over 4770 and 2000&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Coupling Zn2+ Ferrying Effect With Anion&#8211;&#960; Interaction to Mitigate Space Charge Layer Enables Ultra&#8208;High Utilization Rate Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;anion&#8211;cation co&#8208;regulation&#8221; strategy, associated with a fundamental principle for screening potential electrolyte additives coupling the Zn2+ ferrying effect with anion&#8211;&#960; interaction, is put forward to construct a dendrite&#8208;free, high&#8208;ZUR Zn anode. By constructing the ion&#8208;rich interface to retard the negative impact of the space charge layer, our Zn anode can endure &#8764;240&#160;h continuous cycling at an ultrahigh ZUR of 87.3%.








Abstract
A major dilemma faced by Zn anodes at a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is the insufficient supply of ionic carriers that initiate the space charge layer (SCL) subject to the rampant growth of Zn dendrites. Herein, an &#8220;anion&#8211;cation co&#8208;regulation&#8221; strategy, associated with a fundamental principle for screening potential electrolyte additives coupling the Zn2+ ferrying effect with anion&#8208;retention capability, is put forward to construct dendrite&#8208;free, high&#8208;ZUR Zn anode. Taking ninhydrin&#8208;modified ZnSO4 system as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the multiple zincophilic polar groups of ninhydrin facilitate the transport of Zn2+ ions, while its electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ring retains SO42&#8722; counterions via anion&#8211;&#960; interaction, constructing an ion&#8208;rich interface that minimizes the SCL&#8208;driven Zn deterioration. Consequently, the Zn anode can endure &#8764;240&#160;h continuous cycling at an ultrahigh ZUR of 87.3%. The superiority brought by ninhydrin is further reflected by the ultralong cycling durability of Zn&#8208;I2 batteries (over 100&#160;000 cycles). Even at an ultralow N/P ratio of 1.1 (&#8764;90.6% ZUR), the battery with a capacity of &#8764;5.27&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 can still sustain for 350 cycles, which has been hardly achieved in aqueous Zn batteries. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this strategy is fully validated by a series of additives sharing similar fundamentals.

&lt;p&gt;A major dilemma faced by Zn anodes at a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR) is the insufficient supply of ionic carriers that initiate the space charge layer (SCL) subject to the rampant growth of Zn dendrites. Herein, an &#8220;anion&#8211;cation co-regulation&#8221; strategy, associated with a fundamental principle for screening potential electrolyte additives coupling the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ferrying effect with anion-retention capability, is put forward to construct dendrite-free, high-ZUR Zn anode. Taking ninhydrin-modified ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; system as a proof-of-concept, the multiple zincophilic polar groups of ninhydrin facilitate the transport of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, while its electron-deficient aromatic ring retains SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; counterions via anion&#8211;&#960; interaction, constructing an ion-rich interface that minimizes the SCL-driven Zn deterioration. Consequently, the Zn anode can endure &#8764;240&#160;h continuous cycling at an ultrahigh ZUR of 87.3%. The superiority brought by ninhydrin is further reflected by the ultralong cycling durability of Zn-I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries (over 100&#160;000 cycles). Even at an ultralow N/P ratio of 1.1 (&#8764;90.6% ZUR), the battery with a capacity of &#8764;5.27&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; can still sustain for 350 cycles, which has been hardly achieved in aqueous Zn batteries. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this strategy is fully validated by a series of additives sharing similar fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Enzymatic Platform for Aniline Synthesis Through Oxidative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocatalytic platform for aniline synthesis, based on the oxidative amination of readily available cyclohexanones, has been reported. Engineered variants exhibit broad substrate compatibility, enabling the synthesis of 40 structurally diverse secondary and tertiary anilines with conversions of up to 91%. Mechanistic studies revealed that directed evolution enhanced enzyme performance in imine desaturation while suppressing phenol formation.








Abstract
Aniline motifs are commonly found in natural products and synthetic molecules. While chemists have developed numerous methods for constructing C(sp2)&#9472;N bonds, their biocatalytic counterparts in nature are primarily limited to P450&#8208;based protein machineries. To address this limitation, we developed a biocatalytic platform for aniline synthesis based on oxidative amination of cyclohexanones. Through directed evolution of a flavin&#8208;dependent enzyme PtOYE, we identified several protein catalysts (e.g., OYE_G3 and OYE_M3) that exhibited activity across a broad array of substrates, enabling the preparation of 40 different secondary and tertiary anilines with various substitution patterns in up to 91% GC conversion. Mechanistic investigations revealed the improved kinetic performance of the evolved variants on the desaturation of imines. Additionally, mutations introduced through protein engineering further reduced the propensity for phenol formation. This enzymatic platform represents a highly promising application of flavin&#8208;dependent enzymes, showcasing their great potential in organic synthesis and drug development.

         <title>Boosting Electronic Charge Transport in Conductive Hydrogels via Rapid Ion&#8208;Electron Transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel featuring a hierarchical network with an inhomogeneous network is constructed from entangled PSS chains and PEDOT:PSS polycrystals. The dense PSS assemblies with ultrahigh ionic concentrations lower the electron hopping barrier between PEDOT microcrystals under an electric field&#8211;induced local polarization, thereby enhancing electron transport. As a result, the charge transport mechanism in these hydrogels becomes predominantly electronic rather than ionic, effectively mimicking the behavior of conventional electronic conductors.








Abstract
Traditional design of conductive hydrogels involves embedding conductive components within a hydrated polymeric network to establish interconnected electron pathways. While the hydration shell of the polymeric network is typically considered insulating, we demonstrate that it can enhance electron transport. Using a PEDOT:PSS hydrogel, we propose a hierarchical network with an inhomogeneous topological structure, consisting of entangled PSS chains, dense PSS assemblies, and PEDOT microcrystals. In the hydrated state, the dense PSS assemblies significantly lower the energy barrier for electron hopping between PEDOT microcrystals, thereby promoting electron transport. As a result, the charge transport mechanism in these hydrogels is predominantly electronic rather than ionic, effectively mimicking the behavior of electronic conductors. The charge transport rate reaches up to 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1, which is approximately five orders of magnitude higher than that of ion&#8208;based processes. This characteristic imparts the hydrogels with kinetically sensitive ion&#8208;electron transduction, enabling time&#8208;resolved electrochemical analysis of biochemical processes.

         <title>Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis from Pure Nitrate Reduction via Tuning Bimetallic Sites in Redox&#8208;Active Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction was enhanced by modulating the adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption of species in the CoN4&#8211;NiS4 system. a The [CoN4] site selectively adsorbs and reduces nitrate, while the [NiS4] site mimics ferredoxin to accelerate nitrite conversion. Dynamic *H equilibrium suppresses the HER and enhances ammonia selectivity. The thiophene unit facilitates electron transfer and optimizes reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) represents a promising approach for ammonia synthesis, but existing application has been constrained by the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer and the sluggish kinetics induced by various intermediates. Herein, we synthesized a series of metalized covalent organic frameworks: NiTP&#8208;MTAPP MCOFs (M&#160;=&#160;2H, Co, Cu, and Fe), based on dual redox&#8208;active centers: thiophene&#8208;substituted Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) ligand&#8208;Ni[C2S2(C4H2SCHO)2]2 and metallic porphyrin. Through regulating the adsorption and desorption of species at the catalytic sites, we have identified the optimal NITRR electrocatalyst: NiTP&#8208;CoTAPP MCOF, which achieved the highest faradaic efficiency (FE) of approximately 85.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V (vs. RHE) in pure nitrate solution, with an impressive yield rate of 160.2&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1cat. The generation of active hydrogen at [NiS4] sites achieved dynamic equilibrium with the timely hydrogenation reaction at CoN4 sites, effectively suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the incorporation of thiophene (TP) groups and metal ions facilitates charge transfer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the reduction in energy barriers at different catalytic sites. The CoN4&#8722;NiS4 system exhibited the optimal adsorption&#8208;to&#8208;desorption capability and the lowest energy barrier (0.58&#160;eV) for the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO&#160;&#8594;&#160;*HNO), which is supported by the moderate d&#8208;band center and Bader charge value.

         <title>Supramolecular Recognition of a DNA Four&#8208;Way Junction by an M2L4 Metallo&#8208;Cage, Inspired by a Simulation&#8208;Guided Design Approach</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA Holliday junctions, or four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) are an attractive therapeutic target due to their prevalence in DNA replication and repair, and viral disease. Combining experimental and computational methods, we show that quadruple&#8208;stranded dinuclear platinum metallo&#8208;cages are an excellent size and shape match for the cavity of the 4WJ open conformation, binding with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for junctions. 








Abstract
DNA four&#8208;way junctions (4WJs) play an important biological role in DNA repair and recombination, and viral regulation, and are attractive therapeutic targets. Compounds that recognise the junction structure are rare; in this work, we describe cationic metallo&#8208;supramolecular M2L4 cages as a new type of 4WJ binder with nanomolar affinities. A combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and biophysical experiments show that the size and shape of a compound comprising square planar Pd or Pt and anthracene&#8208;based ligands is an excellent fit for the 4WJ cavity. Whilst the cage is also capable of binding to three&#8208;way junctions (3WJs) and Y&#8208;fork structures, we show that the 4WJ is the preferred DNA target, and that duplex B&#8208;DNA is not a competitor. Among 3WJs, T&#8208;shape bulged 3WJs are bound more preferably than perfect Y&#8208;shaped 3WJs. Whilst previous work studying M2L4 metallo&#8208;supramolecular cages has focused on binding inside their structures, this work exploits the external aromatic surfaces of the supramolecule, creating a supramolecular guest that ideally matches the DNA host cavity. This approach allows available structures to be identified as potential junction binders and then screened for their fit to a nucleic acid junction target using simulations. This has potential to significantly accelerate discovery.

         <title>Decoding Variants of Pyrite, Arsenopyrite, and Marcasite Using an Electron Counting Rule</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new &#8216;structure determining electron&#8217; (SDE) rule allows identifying marcasite (M), arsenopyrite (A), and pyrite (P) related compounds based on the electron distribution around transition metals. It offers a framework for categorising structural variants as compounds with M, A, and P layers. Nine new ternary representatives, including the first to show both hetero&#8208; and homoatomic dumbbells, demonstrate enhanced chemical diversity. 








Abstract
Pyrite (P), marcasite (M), and arsenopyrite (A) are of significant historical and contemporary interest. Compounds adopting these structure types are studied for their crystallographic properties and potential applications in energy storage and conversion. Despite numerous investigations since the 1970s, understanding the chemical behaviour of pyrite, marcasite, and arsenopyrite remains limited. This study proposes a new structure determining electron (SDE) rule to systematise these compounds without relying on formal charge assignments. The SDE rule predicts structure types based on the distribution of non&#8208;localised electrons around transition metals, providing a framework for identifying and categorising related compounds. We observe good agreement with literature data and furthermore synthesised nine new ternary compounds within the Pt/Ir&#8208;Ge&#8211;As/Sb systems, demonstrating the applicability of&#160;SDE. Our findings reveal that these compounds can be seen as layer configurations of P, M and A, enhancing our understanding of their chemical diversity. This work not only categorises existing compounds, but also paves the way for future exploration of new materials, highlighting the structural potential of P,&#160;M,&#160;A&#8208;related compounds beyond traditional frameworks. Preliminary results indicate that the type of layers influences physical properties, such as electrical conductivity, warranting further investigation into the relationship between structure and function in these compounds.

         <title>Tuning Multi&#8208;Active Sites in Cu Catalyst via Ag/Ni Doping for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites can effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, ultimately achieving highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) for the synthesis of C2+ products.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) to C2+ products is a promising sustainable carbon conversion pathway, yet simultaneously achieving high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density remains a challenge. Herein, we found that creating Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni multi&#8208;metal sites could effectively modulate the adsorption energies of *H and *CO on the catalyst surface, thereby achieving highly efficient ECR to synthesize C2+ products. In situ measurements coupling theoretical calculations indicated that by systematically altering the spatial arrangement and distribution of active sites in Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalysts, the electronic structure and the local *CO coverage on the Cu surface could be tuned, consequently steering the ECR to C2+ pathway. In particular, Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi DNPs) could more effectively reduce the energy barrier for C&#9472;C coupling than Cu&#8208;Ag&#8208;Ni catalyst with phase&#8208;separated multi&#8208;sites (CuxAgNi PNPs). As a result, the Cu40AgNi DNPs catalyst with dispersed multi&#8208;sites yielded C2+ products with a FE of 93.2% and a current density up to 818.1 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.38&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE), which are higher than most reported up to date for C2+ production. This work provides a methodology for designing robust multi&#8208;metallic ECR catalysts with tailored multi&#8208;active site configurations.

         <title>A Carboxylate&#8208;based Hydrophilic Organic Photovoltaic Catalyst with a Large Molecular Dipole Moment for High&#8208;Performance Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ester hydrolysis to remove the side chain, a carboxylate&#8208;functionalized hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7&#8208;Th, was obtained. The carboxylates significantly amplify the molecular dipole moment, creating a giant built&#8208;in electric field within the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction photocatalyst. This facilitates ultrafast exciton dissociation and efficient charge transport, thereby enhancing hydrogen evolution activity and stability.








Abstract
Achieving ultrafast dissociation of photogenerated excitons and efficient charge transport within the photocatalyst is a fundamental issue. Additionally, enhancing the interaction between semiconductors and water is crucial for efficient photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we synthesized a carboxylate&#8208;based hydrophilic polymer, hPTB7&#8208;Th. Exposed carboxylates enhance semiconductor&#8208;water interfacial compatibility, reducing contact resistance and accelerating charge transfer kinetics. Furthermore, the carboxylate substitution shifts polarity centers, amplifying the molecular dipole moment by 10&#8208;fold. This induces a giant built&#8208;in electric field, enabling ultrafast electron&#8208;transfer process (ca. 0.31 ps) in the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM bulk heterojunction. Consequently, the hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM&#8208;based bulk heterojunction nanoparticles exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity, achieving an optimal hydrogen evolution rate of 111.5 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, four times over the ester&#8208;based counterpart (PTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM). Moreover, the electrostatic stability imparted by the carboxylates endows hPTB7&#8208;Th:PCBM with outstanding operational stability, maintaining 81% of its initial hydrogen evolution rate after 100&#160;h operation. This result places it among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction photocatalysts in terms of stability. This work establishes a molecular engineering strategy for high&#8208;performance bulk heterojunction photocatalysts, emphasizing synergistic optimization of hydrophilicity, dipole engineering, and interfacial dynamics.

         <title>Cyclization Polymerization of Elemental Sulfur and Diisocyanate: New Polymerization Toward High&#8208;Performance Polymer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a new polymerization reaction, cyclization polymerization of aliphatic diisocyanate with elemental sulfur. It is the first report about directly converting elemental sulfur and isocyanate into a high&#8208;performance polymer. The polymer exhibits remarkably strong adhesion to a variety of substrates either in air or underwater.








Abstract
The development of polymer materials heavily relies on new polymerization reactions. Herein, we report the discovery of cyclization polymerization of element sulfur (S8) and aliphatic diisocyanate at room temperature with 1,5,7&#8208;triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec&#8208;5&#8208;ene (TBD) organic base as the catalyst, where the two monomers are covalently linked via the formation of thiadiazolidinone (TDZD) or a cyclic isocyanurate ring. The polymer of S8 and 1,6&#8208;diisocyanatohexane (HDI) exhibits remarkable thermal stability and mechanical properties. Particularly, it has exceptionally high adhesion to various substrates in air or under water, e.g., the underwater adhesion strength is as high as &#8764;26.5&#160;MPa for poly(ethylene glycol&#8208;co&#8208;1,4&#8208;cyclohexanedimethanol terephthalate) (PETG) and &#8764;2.3&#160;MPa for poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Teflon). The cyclization polymerization provides the basis for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance polymers with elemental sulfur.

         <title>De Novo Design of Structure&#8208;Tunable Multivalent Targeting Chimeras for Tumor&#8208;Targeted PD&#8208;L1 Degradation and Potentiated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi&#8208;TACs) was presented for tumor&#8208;specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on the surface of the tumor cell membrane. The multi&#8208;TACs were synthesized by copolymerization of PD&#8208;L1 inhibitor BMS&#8208;1 with various acid&#8208;responsive monomers. The multi&#8208;TACs with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme&#8208;sensitivity highly efficiently abolished PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways.








Abstract
Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology holds significant potential for modulating protein homeostasis and treating diseases. However, current methods for degrading membrane proteins highly depend on the lysosome&#8208;targeting ligands or membrane receptors. In this study, we present a set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi&#8208;TACs) for tumor&#8208;specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on the surface of the tumor cell membrane. The multi&#8208;TACs are synthesized by copolymerization of small&#8208;molecule PD&#8208;L1 inhibitor BMS&#8208;1 with acid&#8208;responsive monomers. The chemical structures of the multi&#8208;TACs are optimized by investigating the correlation between PD&#8208;L1 degradation efficacy and the key parameters, including acid&#8208;sensitive moieties, BMS&#8208;1 valency, and spacer length. Mechanistic study reveals that the multi&#8208;TACs highly efficiently degrade PD&#8208;L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption&#8208;mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways, which differ from the reported strategies for membrane protein degradation. The outperformed multi&#8208;TAC GG56 with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme&#8208;sensitivity dramatically reduces PD&#8208;L1 levels and suppresses tumor growth in mouse models of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast tumors. Furthermore, GG56 serves as a versatile nanoplatform for combinatory chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and radio&#8208;immunotherapy of 4T1 breast tumor by co&#8208;delivery of chemotherapeutic and radio&#8208;sensitizer, respectively.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted protein degradation (TPD) technology holds significant potential for modulating protein homeostasis and treating diseases. However, current methods for degrading membrane proteins highly depend on the lysosome-targeting ligands or membrane receptors. In this study, we present a set of multivalent targeting chimeras (multi-TACs) for tumor-specific degradation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the surface of the tumor cell membrane. The multi-TACs are synthesized by copolymerization of small-molecule PD-L1 inhibitor BMS-1 with acid-responsive monomers. The chemical structures of the multi-TACs are optimized by investigating the correlation between PD-L1 degradation efficacy and the key parameters, including acid-sensitive moieties, BMS-1 valency, and spacer length. Mechanistic study reveals that the multi-TACs highly efficiently degrade PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells via the adsorption-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation pathways, which differ from the reported strategies for membrane protein degradation. The outperformed multi-TAC GG56 with tumor extracellular acidity and enzyme-sensitivity dramatically reduces PD-L1 levels and suppresses tumor growth in mouse models of B16-F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast tumors. Furthermore, GG56 serves as a versatile nanoplatform for combinatory chemo-immunotherapy and radio-immunotherapy of 4T1 breast tumor by co-delivery of chemotherapeutic and radio-sensitizer, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macrocyclic Peptide Probes for Immunomodulatory Protein CD59: Potent Modulators of Bacterial Toxin Activity and Antibody&#8208;Dependent Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents novel macrocyclic peptides with low nanomolar affinity for CD59, an immunomodulatory cell surface receptor associated with human disease. Crystallographic and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies reveal peptide CP&#8208;06 mimics the binding of biologically relevant CD59 interaction partners. Dimeric and lipidated CP&#8208;06 analogues control both complement&#8208;mediated killing of human cells and lytic activity of bacterial virulence factors via CD59 inhibition.








Abstract
CD59 is an immunomodulatory cell surface receptor associated with human disease. Despite its importance in complement regulation and bacterial pathogenesis, CD59 remains a challenging therapeutic target. Research to date has focused on antibody or protein&#8208;based strategies. Here we present a new approach to target CD59 using macrocyclic peptides with low nanomolar affinity for CD59. Through X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies and structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) studies, we identify key interactions that are essential for binding and activity. We find that the macrocyclic peptide CP&#8208;06 adopts a beta&#8208;hairpin structure and binds CD59 through an intermolecular beta&#8208;sheet, mimicking protein&#8211;protein interactions of biologically relevant CD59 interaction partners. We create dimeric and lipidated macrocyclic peptide conjugates as enhanced cell&#8208;active CD59 inhibitors and show that these probes can be used to modulate both complement&#8208;mediated killing of human cells and lytic activity of bacterial virulence factors. Together, our data provide a starting point for future development of macrocyclic peptides to target CD59 activity in diverse cellular contexts.

         <title>Hopping&#8208;Type Charge Transport in Controllably p&#8208;Doped Polaronic Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report explores polaron&#8208;based charge transport in controllably p&#8208;type doped 2D polymers. Substoichiometric injection of holes in 2DP lattices leads to the lowest optical bandgaps and maximal electronic conductivities. Variable&#8208;temperature conductivity reveals the existence of hopping&#8208;type transport with two distinct Arrhenius regimes, which may be related to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane directional electronic transport.








Abstract
In this work, we find that controllable p&#8208;type doping leads to Holstein&#8208;type polarons in four electron&#8208;rich two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs). Substoichometrically injecting holes into these 2DPs leads to small optical bandgaps (&lt;1.0&#160;eV) and electrical conductivities (17&#160;mS&#160;m&#8722;1) significantly higher than their undoped analogs. Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy both reveal that this arises from the formation of paramagnetic polarons. We achieve maximal conductivities when 2DPs comprised of electron&#8208;rich nodes and electron&#8208;rich linkers are combined, which is a consequence of more delocalized polarons as unveiled by diffuse&#8208;reflectance UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Variable&#8208;temperature electrical conductivity measurements reveal two distinct Arrhenius regimes in all 2DPs investigated, which we attribute to the different thermally activated processes inherent to in&#8208;plane and cross&#8208;plane electronic transport in stacked 2DP multilayers. This resulted in a maximum electronic conductivity of 326 mS m&#8722;1 at an elevated temperature. Collectively, this report provides fundamental insight into polaron&#8208;based charge&#8208;transport in p&#8208;type 2D organic layers, which we expect will form the foundation for the eventual deployment of these materials in electronic devices.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Protein Degradation: An Emerging Therapeutics Technology</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a transformative therapeutic strategy for eliminating disease&#8208;associated proteins, with relevance across disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Since its inception nearly two decades ago, TPD has attracted strong academic and commercial interest, with multiple candidates advancing into clinical trials. Despite this progress, the field faces persistent challenges, including limited solubility, poor cellular uptake, and unpredictable structure&#8208;activity relationship of small&#8208;molecule degraders, which complicate rational design. To address these limitations, alternative platforms such as nanoparticle&#8208;mediated protein degraders (NanoPDs) have gained attention. First reported 17 years ago, NanoPDs harness a diverse array of materials, degradation mechanisms, and linker chemistries to achieve protein clearance through novel pathways. While promising, their clinical translation remains constrained by barriers such as lysosomal entrapment, protein corona formation, and biocompatibility concerns. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of nanoparticle&#8208;mediated TPD. We emphasize the design principles underlying nano&#8208;bio interfaces and explore the role of proximity&#8208;induced biology as a mechanism for orchestrating protein interactions. Finally, we highlight critical challenges and key questions that must be addressed to fully realise the therapeutic potential of NanoPDs.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Sulfur&#8208;containing polymers uniquely expand the catalogue of accessible material properties compared to current commodity materials, yet their synthesis remains underdeveloped. Combining sulfur&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;containing monomers in ring&#8208;opening copolymerisation leads to a reshuffling reaction of the sulfur centres, which has been challenging to control &#8212; a central task for reliably tailoring properties. However, very recent methodologies have emerged that not only suppress but also utilise this phenomenon to precisely access sulfur&#8208;containing polymer structures. These structures can exhibit improved degradability, chemical recyclability, refractive indices, and crystallinity compared to their all&#8208;oxygen analogues.

         <title>Multiple and Alternative Sites Make Tau Protein an Adaptable Sticky Surface for the SH3 Domain of Fyn Kinase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between the microtubule associated protein Tau and the tyrosine kinase Fyn is believed to play a pivotal role in the early stage of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Previous studies have identified the SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domain of Fyn as the binding receptor of several proline&#8208;rich motifs in Tau. However, the role of each proline rich motif and their interplay in molecular recognition are still unclear. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of Fyn&#8208;SH3 recognition by the multiple PxxP sites inserted within the full&#8208;length Tau protein by using NMR spectroscopy combined with computational, calorimetric and in&#8208;cell FRET methods. Both in vitro and in&#8208;cell experiments revealed no single binding site strictly necessary for the binding. Instead, Fyn&#8208;SH3 contacts full&#8208;length Tau on multiple hot spot regions, located over a distance of 85 residues, through global moderate&#8208;to&#8208;low affinity interactions. Beyond two principal regions containing classical PxxP motifs, we identified a novel non&#8208;canonical binding site at the beginning of the microtubule binding domain. Our study indicates that multiple binding sites in Tau are involved in the interaction, making Tau an adaptable recognition surface that can function when single consensus motifs are deleted.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Postfunctionalization of Poly(methacrylate) Derivatives via Radical&#8211;Polar Crossover Phosphonylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed postfunctionalization of poly(meth)acrylate&#8208;based copolymers bearing phthalimide moieties can produce novel polymer architectures that are inaccessible using polymerization approaches; however, this method is restricted to radical reactions. To expand the scope of reactions applicable to photoredox&#8208;catalyzed postfunctionalization, this study focused on the radical&#8211;polar crossover process, in which a carbocation equivalent is generated to react with nucleophiles. The organophotoredox&#8208;catalyzed reaction of a random copolymer of N&#8208;(methacryloxy)phthalimide and methyl acrylate using trialkyl phosphite nucleophiles afforded the corresponding phosphonate&#8208;containing polymers. Although simultaneous hydrogenation was inevitable, a novel polymer comprising dialkyl isopropenylphosphonate, propylene, and methyl acrylate units was obtained, which is of interest because phosphonate&#8208;containing polymers are potentially applicable as thermoresponsive materials, flame&#8208;retardant materials, and additives in Li&#8208;ion batteries. A series of copolymers with different components were successfully applied to the postfunctionalization method. The organophotoredox catalysis&#8211;based postfunctionalization strategy developed in this study provides versatile functional polymers in a simple, green, and sustainable manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Driven Exploration of Surface Reconstructions of Reduced Rutile TiO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials, integrated with active learning, reveal novel reduced surface reconstructions of rutile TiO2 (110). These include subsurface shear plane structures, verified experimentally. Theoretical and experimental insights into structural, electronic, and catalytic properties highlight their implications in catalysis.








Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is widely used as a catalyst support due to its stability, tunable electronic properties, and surface oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalytic processes such as the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Reduced TiO2 surfaces undergo complex surface reconstructions that endow unique properties but are computationally challenging to describe. In this study, we utilize machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) integrated with an active&#8208;learning workflow to efficiently explore reduced rutile TiO2 surfaces. This approach enabled the prediction of a phase diagram as a function of oxygen chemical potential, revealing a variety of reconstructed phases, including a previously unreported subsurface shear plane structure. We further investigate the electronic properties of these surfaces and validate our results by comparing experimental and theoretical high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Our findings provide new insights into how extreme surface reductions influence the structural and electronic properties of TiO2, with potential implications for catalyst design.

         <title>Photoelectrocatalytic activation of C&#8211;H bond in toluene by titanium dioxide&#8208;supported sub&#8208;nanometric PtO x  clusters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective oxidation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds via photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) strategy provides a promising approach to synthesize valuable oxygenates, but the efficiency of this process is still unsatisfactory due to the stable nature of hydrocarbon molecules. Herein, we report the PEC oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde (BA) over a sub&#8208;nanometric PtOx cluster&#8208;loaded TiO2 (PtOx/TiO2) photoanode, achieving BA production rate of 1.75 &#956;mol cm&#8210;2 h&#8210;1 with selectivity of 83.5% in aqueous medium, which is 4.4&#8208;fold higher than that of pristine TiO2. The strategy is also effective for the selective oxidation of toluene derivatives. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we fabricate a self&#8208;powered PEC tandem device with S&#8208;shaped flow channels for the oxidation of toluene, producing BA with a productivity of ~170 &#956;mol under light irradiation. Experimental studies combined with density functional theory (DFT) results demonstrate that the toluene oxidation over PtOx/TiO2 photoanode follow an electrophilic hydroxyl species (OH*)&#8208;mediated pathway, which can suppress the over&#8208;oxidation of BA. Moreover, we reveal that sub&#8208;nanometric PtOx clusters promote toluene adsorption and OH* species generation, leading to the high efficiency of toluene oxidation. This work is expected to broaden the avenue towards the activation of C(sp3)&#8211;H bond under mild conditions in aqueous solution via a sustainable way.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Asymmetric Molecular Engineering Enables Regio&#8208;Regular Selenium&#8208;Substituted Acceptor with High Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;Low Energy Loss in Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric molecular engineering utilized for developing efficient small molecular acceptors (SMAs), while adopting multiple asymmetric strategies at the terminals, side chains, and cores of efficient SMAs remains a challenge and effects on reducing energy loss (Eloss) have been rarely investigation. Herein, four regio&#8208;regular multiple&#8208;asymmetric SMAs (DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, TASe&#8208;2Cl2F, and TASe&#8208;2F2Cl) are constructed by delicately manipulating the number and position of F and Cl on end groups. Triple&#8208;asymmetric TASe&#8208;2F2Cl not only exhibits a unique and most compact 3D network crystal stacking structure, but also possesses excellent crystallinity and electron mobility in neat film. Surprisingly, the PM1:TASe&#8208;2F2Cl&#8208;based binary Organic solar cells (OSCs) yield a champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 19.32%, surpassing the PCE of 18.27%, 17.25% and 16.30% for DASe&#8208;4F, DASe&#8208;4Cl, and TASe&#8208;2Cl2F&#8208;based devices, which attributed to the optimized blend morphology with proper phase separation and more ordered intermolecular stacking, excellent charge transport. Notably, the champion PCE of 19.32% with ultra&#8208;low non&#8208;radiative recombination energy loss (&#916;E3) of 0.179 eV marks a record&#8208;breaking result for selenium&#8208;containing SMAs in binary OSCs. Our innovative multiple&#8208;asymmetric molecular engineering of precisely modulating the number and position of fluorinated/chlorinated end groups is an effective strategy for obtaining highly&#8208;efficient and minimal &#916;E3 of selenium&#8208;substituted SMAs&#8208;based binary OSCs simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific On&#8208;Site Activation of Cisplatin via Cascade Catalytic&#8208;Redox Reactions for Highly Efficient Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The therapeutic efficiency of platinum drugs is always limited by low utilization, side effects and Pt&#8208;resistance. Herein, a double&#8208;lock protected PtII nanomedicine named PtNP@Cu has been developed, which performs cascade unlocking of dechlorinated cisplatin (DP) via catalytic&#8208;redox reactions, thus achieving tumor&#8208;specific &#8220;on&#8208;site&#8221; activation of cisplatin (cDDP) in the nucleus accompanied with substantial induction of ferroptosis of cancer cells. This design avoids the premature release of active PtII species in normal cells or in the cytoplasm of cancer cells before reaching nucleus, thereby ensuring maximum amplification of Pt&#8208;DNA crosslinking with tumor&#8208;specificity. Meanwhile, substantial GSH depletion and ROS production induced by cascade catalytic&#8208;redox reactions results in ferroptosis of cancer cells, which further reduces GSH&#8208;mediated cDDP detoxification, overcomes Pt&#8208;resistance, and enhances immunogenicity, ultimately realizing highly efficient tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy and anti&#8208;tumor immunity in vivo. This work provides a new strategy for effectively and comprehensively addressing the issues of low utilization, side effects, and drug resistance problems of platinum drugs, which is also promising for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides Catalyze Rate&#8208;Determining Redox in Fast&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sluggish kinetics of the solid&#8208;solid Zn&#8208;S redox process significantly hinders the practical energy density and lifespan of fast&#8208;charging aqueous Zn&#8208;S batteries (AZSBs). Conventional catalysts often fail to address these challenges, exhibiting limited sulfur utilization and cycling stability under fast&#8208;charging conditions. To overcome this limitation, we present a three&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) nanorod catalysts to accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) in the Zn&#8208;S redox process. Operando synchrotron powder diffraction, operando synchrotron infrared reflectance microscopy, and operando Raman spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the HES catalysts improve sulfur utilization by accelerating the RDS conversion of ZnS2 to wurtzite ZnS. In contrast, utilizing low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy catalysts results in the formation of by&#8208;products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Furthermore, near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. Consequently, the AZSBs with the HES catalysts deliver over 4,000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A g&#8722;1 with a capacity decay of 0.086% per cycle. This entropy&#8208;driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast&#8208;charging aqueous metal&#8208;sulfur batteries.</dc:description>

In contrast, utilizing low- and medium-entropy catalysts results in the formation of by-products, including S52&#8722;, S32&#8722;, and SO32&#8722; species. Furthermore, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses demonstrate that the HES catalysts effectively suppress the leaching effect of transition metals and water splitting of the aqueous electrolyte, improving cycling stability. Consequently, the AZSBs with the HES catalysts deliver over 4,000 cycles at a high current density of 20 A g&#8722;1 with a capacity decay of 0.086% per cycle. This entropy-driven catalytic strategy provides an effective approach for developing stable and fast-charging aqueous metal-sulfur batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The ATM Kinase Inhibitor AZD0156 is a Potent Inhibitor of Plasmodium Phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;Kinase (PI4K&#946;) and is an Attractive Candidate for Medicinal Chemistry Optimisation Ag&#8230;</title>

         <dc:description>New compounds targeting human malaria parasites are critical for effective malaria control and elimination. Here, we pursued the imidazoquinolinone AZD0156 (MMV1580483), a human ataxia&#8208;telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor that completed Phase I clinical trials as an anticancer agent. We validated its in vitro activity against the two main forms of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite in the human host, viz. the asexual blood (symptomatic) stage and sexual gametocyte (transmission) stage. Resistance selection, cross&#8208;resistance, biochemical and conditional knockdown studies revealed that AZD0156 inhibits P. falciparum phosphatidylinositol 4&#8208;kinase type III beta&#160;(PfPI4K&#946;), a clinically&#8208;validated target for the treatment of malaria. Metabolic perturbations, fixed&#8208;ratio isobolograms, killing kinetics and morphological evaluation correlated AZD0156 inhibition with other known PI4K&#946; inhibitors. The compound showed favourable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and 81% antimalarial efficacy (4 x 50 mg/kg) in a P. berghei mouse malaria infection model. Importantly, a cleaner biochemical profile was measured against human kinases (MAP4K4, MINK1) implicated in embryofoetal developmental toxicity associated with the PfPI4K&#946; inhibitor MMV390048. This improved kinase selectivity profile and structural differentiation from other PI4K&#946; inhibitors, together with its multistage antiplasmodial activity and favourable pharmacokinetic properties, makes AZD0156 an attractive candidate for target&#8208;based drug repositioning against malaria via a medicinal chemistry optimisation approach.</dc:description>

         <title>On&#8208;demand Ligate and Release Strategy based on Photoclick Reaction in Tandem with Pd&#8208;mediated Deallylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of chemoselective tools that can conjugate, modify and decouple chemical groups from biomacromolecules has enabled the study of biological processes at increasing levels of fidelity. Until recently, these tools can either couple chemical entities to biomacromolecules or decouple them, but not both. A method that can perform these functions in distinct steps on demand would be highly useful. To that end, we devised a new&#8208;to&#8208;nature strategy by bringing together and modifying two biocompatible transformations. In this new strategy, ligation is accomplished via the photoclick reaction between an allenyl motif with 9,10&#8208;phenanthrenequinone which installs an allyl group at the site of conjugation. This allyl group can then be selectively utilized as a handle for phenolic release via Pd&#8208;mediated deallylation. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated its utility in the selective labelling and delabelling of model protein scaffolds and cellular matrix. This multifunctional method paves the way for controllable &#8220;ligate and release&#8221; strategy that enables on&#8208;demand visualization of biological entities but with an in&#8208;built release mechanism to restore their original state.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Approach for Tunable and Efficient Circularly Polarized Delayed Fluorescence and Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) in purely organic systems is a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research. Recently, the growing interest in ambient organic phosphors has offered a promising alternative for achieving CPL with remarkable quantum yields by utilizing triplet states. While supramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions are well&#8208;established to improve |glum| by enhancing magnetic transition dipole components, their application to triplet&#8208;harvesting organic systems remains unexplored. In this context, our current work introduces a supramolecular strategy to achieve highly efficient and tunable circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and phosphorescence by the involvement of intermolecular triplet CT states. Through&#8208;space intermolecular CT interactions between heavy atom&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;chromophoric pyromellitic diimides (acceptors) and achiral phenyl carbazole derivatives (donors) enable one of the most efficient circularly polarized delayed luminescent systems, characterized by a high quantum yield (~46%) and a significant |glum| ~ 3.6 &#215; 10&#8315;&#178;. Additionally, the modularity of this non&#8208;covalent design allows for the tuning of emission from the orange to deep&#8208;red regions by incorporating various donors. The strategy presented here opens new avenues for designing efficient CPL&#8208;active organic phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Desulfurizative Fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 Thioformamides for the Efficient Synthesis of N(CF3)(CF2H) Amines with Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines, which display a 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability over N&#8208;CF3 amines. The compounds are synthesized through a desulfurization&#8211;fluorination of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides. 








Abstract
With poor metabolic stability being a major cause of failure in drug development, there is a pressing need for strategic molecular modifications to optimize for desired properties and function. N&#8208;substitution has emerged as a powerful approach, with N&#8208;CF3 amines previously demonstrating enhanced lipophilicity and reduced susceptibility to oxidation, albeit inherent instability to hydrolysis. This report discloses the further evolution of this motif&#8212;the introduction of an additional N&#8208;difluoromethyl unit, resulting in an extraordinary 2000&#8208;fold increase in stability. We present the first general synthetic strategy for accessing N(CF3)(CF2H) amines. The method relies on an operationally simple desulfurization&#8211;fluorination strategy of N&#8208;CF3 thioformamides and is characterized by broad functional group tolerance.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Dactyloquinone A and Spiroetherone A via a Metal&#8208;Hydride Hydrogen Atom Transfer (MHAT) Process and a Quinol&#8211;Enedione Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total syntheses of the meroterpenoid quinones dactyloquinone A and spiroetherone A were achieved from a common intermediate through the following original key steps: a metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process with a quinone monoacetal in the case of dactyloquinone A, and a quinol&#8211;enedione rearrangement in the case of spiroetherone A.








Abstract
We report the total synthesis of dactyloquinone A and spiroetherone A from a meroterpenoid scaffold obtained by the deconjugative alkylation of a Wieland&#8211;Miescher type ketone. For dactyloquinone A, we employed an intramolecular hydrofunctionalisation of the internal trisubstituted alkene with a quinone monoacetal via a metal&#8208;hydride hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) process to form the key C&#9472;O bond. For spiroetherone A, we relied on a stereospecific quinol&#8211;spiroenedione rearrangement. The initially postulated structure of spiroetherone A was first synthesized, but was found to be different from the natural product. Finally, spiroetherone A was shown to be epimeric at the spirocyclic carbon. This finding was confirmed by total synthesis involving epimerization of the spirocycle via a late&#8208;stage singlet oxygen [4+2] cycloaddition to a cyclohexadiene derived from the initial enedione.

         <title>Catching Fullerenes: Synthesis of Molecular Nanogloves</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we disclose the synthesis of curved cavitands. The efficient and straightforward hybridization of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene results in well&#8208;defined rigid receptors capable of capturing fullerenes with high affinity. 








Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a new series of rigid, all meta&#8208;phenylene, conjugated deep&#8208;cavity molecules, displaying high binding affinity towards buckyballs. A facile synthetic approach with an overall combined yield of approximately 53% in the last two steps has been developed using a templating strategy that combines the general structure of resorcin[4]arene and [12]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;phenylene. These two moieties are covalently linked via four acetal bonds, resulting in a glove&#8208;like architecture. 1H NMR titration experiments reveal fullerene binding affinities (Ka) exceeding &#8805;106&#160;M&#8722;1. The size complementarity between fullerenes and these scaffolds maximizes CH&#8943;&#960; and &#960;&#8943;&#960; interactions, and their host:guest adduct resembles a ball in a glove, hence their name as nanogloves. Fullerene recognition is tested by suspending carbon soot in a solution of nanoglove in 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrachloroethane, where more than a dozen fullerenes are observed, ranging from C60 to C96.

         <title>P&#8208;type Cathode Material Design Guided by Material Descriptors for High&#8208;energy Density Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>P&#8208;type organic electrode materials (OEMs) face considerable challenges in constructing high&#8208;energy density sodium metal batteries (SMBs) due to the low capacity. To preserve their voltage advantage, developing effective structural design strategies is essential. However, the lack of material descriptors hampers the efficiency of material design and screening. Herein, two material descriptors: the benzene ring/active nitrogen (R/N) ratio and energy density factor (Ef) are established to guide high&#8208;energy density SMB design. As proof of concept, triphenylamine (TPA, 3 R/N ratio and 573.6 Ef value) and a porous organic polymer condensation of triiodotriphenylamine and dihydrophenazine named p&#8208;PZA POP (1.5 R/N ratio and 907.5 Ef value) are chosen. As a result, the p&#8208;PZA POP achieves a high energy density of 524.6 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1, nearly double that of TPA (273.3 Wh kg&#8208;1). Remarkably, p&#8208;PZA POP demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance from 50 &#176;C (166.2 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1) to &#8208;20 &#176;C (141.6 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8208;1). This work establishes a theoretical framework for the rational design and screening of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OEMs through predictive material descriptors.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Shamrock&#8208;Shaped Giant Molecule Acceptors for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of non&#8208;fullerene small molecule acceptor materials has breathed new development in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it has also introduced the issue of insufficient device stability. Enhancing the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials by connecting small molecules into giant molecules, thereby improving morphological stability, represents an effective material design strategy to address this issue. In this work, we have synthesized the shamrock&#8208;shaped giant molecule materials T&#8208;Qx based on high efficiency Qx&#8208;series small molecule materials. Through systematically modulating the terminal and the central halogen atoms, precise control of the molecular conformation can be achieved. Notably, the fully chlorine&#8208;substituted giant molecule T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl exhibits the largest torsion angle of approximately 40&#176; and achieves the highest Tg (up to 188&#176;C) among these new materials. Photovoltaic devices based on these giant molecules demonstrate a low non&#8208;radiative energy loss of approximately 0.21 eV, which results in a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) above 0.93 V. T&#8208;Qx&#8208;15Cl presents the strongest interaction with the polymer donor PM6, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 20%. This remarkable performance is attributed to the large twisting angle that effectively prevents the excessive aggregation of large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Ionic Transport Network via Supramolecular Composite Binder in Cathode for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Binders play a pivotal role in maintaining the structural integrity and stability of electrodes. However, conventional polyvinylidene fluoride binder with low ionic conductivity could not meet the ionic transport requirements of the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, a composite binder (PPCL) derived from the cross&#8208;linking of linear molecules and mechanically interlocked molecules with typical supramolecular channel structure is designed. The supramolecular channel structure is afforded through &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin rings crosslinked polyethylene oxide chains by hydrogen bond interaction. Through the coordination of supramolecular with linear polymer, the PPCL binder provides multiple and synergistic Li+ transport channels to achieve stable Li+ transport inside the cathode. As a result, the obtained PPCL binder not only maintains exceptional adhesive strength which could achieve robust electrode structural stability but also helps to construct multiple and highly efficient Li+ transport channels. Therefore, with PPCL binder, the LiFePO4&#8208;based ASSLBs show an excellent rate capability and long cyclic stability over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Notably, a pouch ASSLB shows excellent cycling stability over 250 cycles at 0.2 C. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced ASSLBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking One&#8208;Step Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction via Metalloid Boron&#8208;Modified Zn3In2S6 for Efficient H2O2 Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The indirect two&#8208;step two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) dominates photocatalytic H2O2 synthesis but suffers form sluggish kinetics, &#8226;O2&#8722;&#8208;induced catalyst degradation, and spatiotemporal carrier&#8208;intermediate mismatch. Herein, we pioneer a metal&#8208;metalloid dual&#8208;site strategy to unlock the direct one&#8208;step 2e&#8722; ORR pathway, demonstrated through boron&#8208;engineered Zn3In2S6 (B&#8208;ZnInS) photocatalyst with In&#8208;B dual&#8208;active sites. The In&#8208;B dual&#8208;site configuration creates a charge&#8208;balanced electron reservoir by charge complementation, which achieves moderate O2 adsorption via bidentate coordination and dual&#8208;channel electron transfer, preventing excessive O&#8722;O bond activation. Simultaneously, boron doping induces lattice polarization to establish a built&#8208;in electric field, quintupling photogenerated carrier lifetimes versus pristine ZnInS. These synergies redirect the O2 activation pathway from indirect to direct 2e&#8722; ORR process, delivering an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 3121 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm&#8722;2)&#8212;an 11&#8208;fold enhancement over ZnInS. The system achieves an unprecedented apparent quantum yield of 49.8% at 365 nm for H2O2 photosynthesis among inorganic semiconducting photocatalysts, and can continuously produce medical&#8208;grade H2O2 (3 wt%). This work provides insights for designing efficient H2O2 photocatalysts and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Ion Transport through Direct Coordination in Composite Gel Polymer Electrolytes towards High&#8208;voltage and High&#8208;loading Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;based composite gel polymer electrolyte is widely used in lithium metal batteries to address dendrite growth and side reactions. However, the low oxidative decomposition potential (&lt; 4 V) of poly(ethylene oxide) limits the cyclic stability with Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes.

         <title>Dinitrogen Activation with Low&#8208;Valent Strontium</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DFT calculations on b&#8208;diketiminate (BDI) complexes with the full series of alkaline&#8208;earth (Ae) metals show that (BDI)AeAe(BDI) complexes of the heavier Ae metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) have long weak Ae&#8208;Ae bonds that are prone to homolytic bond cleavage. They also show that isolation of (BDI)Sr(m&#8208;N2)Sr(BDI) with a side&#8208;on bridging N22&#713; dianion should be feasible. Attempts to stabilize such a complex with the superbulky BDI* ligand failed (BDI* = HC[(Me)C=N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;Et2CH&#8208;phenyl). A heterobimetallic approach enabled first N2 fixation with a Sr complex stabilized with a bulky bis&#8208;amide ligand DIPePNN: DIPePN&#8208;Si(Me)2CH2CH2Si(Me)2&#8208;NDIPeP. Reduction of (DIPePNN)Sr with K/KI gave (DIPePNN)2Sr2K2(N2) (6&#8208;Sr); a similar Ca product was also isolated (6&#8208;Ca). Crystal structures reveal a N22&#713; anion with side&#8208;on bonding to Ae2+ and end&#8208;on coordination to K+. DFT calculations and Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules analyses show mainly ionic bonding. Both 6&#8208;Ae complexes are synthons for hitherto unknown (BDI*)AeAe(BDI*) (Ae = Ca, Sr) and react by releasing N2 and two electrons. Although surprisingly stable in benzene, the reduction of I2 and H2 is facile. Fast reaction with Teflon led to isolation of crystalline [(DIPePNN)SrKF]2 (7) which is labile and decomposed to KF and (DIPePNN)Sr. Latter reactivity underscores potential use of 6&#8208;Ae complexes as very strong, hydrocarbon&#8208;soluble reducing agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Modification of Formate Zr&#8208;MOF (ZrFA) toward Scalable and Cost&#8208;Cutting Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mass production of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with affordable cost is highly demanding yet limited for commercial applications, e.g., purification of polymer&#8208;grade ethylene (C2H4) via acetylene (C2H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) removal faces the challenge of developing low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale physisorbents with efficiency and recyclability. Herein, we developed a viable synthetic protocol to scale&#8208;up a series of ultramicroporous Zr&#8208;MOFs (ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I)) with the simplest monocarboxylate, formate (FA), through consecutive production by recycling solvent/modulator. Besides a size&#8208;exclusion effect disfavoring C2H4 adsorption, introduction of defective and Cu(I) sites was found to enhance gas affinity and uptake capacity. A comprehensive evaluation of C2H4 separation and economic efficiency has been proposed, suggesting the improvement of C2H2 uptake capacity is effective for the binary C2H2/C2H4 separation, while the separation process of the ternary C2H2/CO2/C2H4 mixtures depends on subtle tradeoff of complex factors and limited by challenging CO2/C2H4 separating. Notably, the large&#8208;scale separation has been testified to significantly improve separation efficiency, and the low&#8208;cost preparation benefits high economic efficiency. The distinct C2H2/C2H4/CO2 adsorption mechanism in ZrFA/ZrFA&#8208;D/ZrFA&#8208;D&#8208;Cu(I) has been elucidated by the theoretical calculations. This work may shed a light on the future C2H4 purification technology by pushing MOF&#8208;syntheses towards low&#8208;cost, scale&#8208;up, and recyclable production.</dc:description>

         <title>Phenacetin[3]arenes: Mannich&#8208;type Macrocyclization, Unique Structure, Versatile Functionalization, and Strong Allosteric Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work introduces a novel NAm&#8208;CH&#8322;&#8208;CAr&#160;macrocyclization pathway, diverging from the conventional CAr&#8208;CH&#8322;&#8208;CAr&#160;linkages prevalent in macrocyclic arenes. This approach involves a one&#8208;pot condensation of readily available Phenacetin and its homologs with formaldehyde, yielding phenacetin[3]arenes (Ph[3]) in yields up to 25.9%.&#160;Ph[3]&#160;exhibits an unsymmetrical hourglass&#8208;shaped architecture, featuring an upper rim adorned with&#160;amide groups&#160;and a lower rim comprising an alkoxylbenzene cavity. This unique structure facilitates reversible equilibrium between conformers via benzene ring flipping, which simultaneously reverses the orientation of the amide groups, establishing equilibrium between C3&#160;and F conformers. Increasing concentrations of organic ammonium guests lead to a transition from a predominantly 1:1 to a 1:2 host&#8211;guest complexation. The estimated binding constants for the 1:1 complexes are in the order of 104&#8208;105&#160;M&#8208;1, the overall binding constants for the 1:2 complexes are greater than 106&#160;M&#8208;2. This stepwise complexation triggers a conformational shift from the C3&#160;to the F conformer, demonstrating intriguing allosteric behavior. Furthermore, interactions with chiral guests selectively influence the equilibrium of planar chiral conformers, generating chiroptical responses suitable for chirality sensing applications. The distinct functional groups on the two rims&#8212;amides and alkoxyl groups&#8212;facilitate diverse chemical modifications, including reduction, deprotection, and condensation, &#8230;</dc:description>

         <title>Effective Hole Utilization for Atomically Dispersed Low&#8208;coordination Molybdenum Accelerating Photocatalytic C&#8211;H Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols offers a promising strategy to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds and clean fuel H2. However, the sluggish kinetics of the alkoxy C&#8211;H bond cleavage attributes to the inefficiency utilization of photogenerated holes greatly restricts the photocatalytic activity. Here we develop atomically dispersed low&#8208;coordination Mo on ultrathin ZnIn2S4 nanosheets, that can greatly accelerate photocatalytic C&#8211;H activation. An internal quantum efficiency of 45.2% at 400 nm together with 99% benzaldehyde (BAD) selectivity is achieved using benzyl alcohol (BA) as a model substrate. Extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical calculation reveal that the low&#8208;coordination Mo tunes the local atomic configuration of highest occupied molecular orbital to trap holes produced under photoexcitation within picosecond. Moreover, the incorporated site&#8208;specific Mo greatly improves the lifetime and diffusion length of photogenerated holes and optimizes the driving force of alkoxy C&#8211;H activation, which are responsible for the excellent performance. This work marks a significant stride to enhance the utilization efficiency of holes for promoting photocatalytic C&#8211;H activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Spatially Engineering the Internal Microstructure of a Single Crystal via Nanoparticle Occlusion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystals are characterized by their continuous, highly ordered atomic lattices. Therefore, introducing impurities or structural defects into their matrices presents a major challenge, particularly in spatially&#8208;controlled manner. Herein, we demonstrate a nanoparticle occlusion approach that enables the microstructure of cuprous oxide (Cu2O) single crystals to be engineered in a tunable way. This is achieved by directly incorporating poly(glycerol monomethacrylate)51&#8208;block&#8208;poly(benzyl methacrylate)100 [G51&#8208;B100] diblock copolymer nanoparticles into growing Cu2O crystals, leading to the formation of G51&#8208;B100@Cu2O composite crystals with structural defects localized at the G51&#8208;B100/Cu2O interfaces. The spatial distribution of these defects can be systematically engineered, ranging from surface region to the entire crystal. Remarkably, the G51&#8208;B100 occlusion endows the resulting composite crystals with excellent catalytic performance in dye degradation under dark conditions, with activity correlated to the extent of nanoparticle occlusion. This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.</dc:description>

This study offers a unique strategy to create interfacial defects in single crystals, imparting emerging functionalities to the resulting composites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugation&#8208;Promoted Electrochemiluminescence of Halogenated Covalent Organic Framework Nanoemitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a kind of promising electrochemiluminescence (ECL) crystalline nanoemitters due to their rapid intrareticular charge transfer and predesigned structures. However, the high polarization of heteroatom&#8208;containing linkages impedes the charge transfer within reticular structures. In this study, we construct a series of halogenated COFs nanoemitters composed of terephthalaldehyde ortho&#8208;substitutions and 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)pyrene ligands via a covalent halogenation predesign strategy. The incorporation of covalently bonded halogen atoms promotes a dense electron population in carbon&#8208;carbon antibonding molecular orbitals, thereby facilitating efficient p&#8208;&#960; conjugation within the COF structure. Based on the improved intrareticular charge transfer along carbon skeleton, as evidenced by the Hall effect and terahertz spectroscopy, the brominated COF demonstrates a 49&#8208;fold enhancement in ECL intensity compared to non&#8208;halogenated COF. Furthermore, the performance of four partially brominated COFs establishes a positive correlation between the degree of Br doping and ECL intensity. Beyond the corresponding model compounds, the conjugated frameworks of COFs significantly amplify the halogenation&#8208;induced enhancement effect. This halogenation&#8208;promoted p&#8208;&#960; conjugation in reticular skeleton provides a universal strategy to sensitize crystalline nanoemitters for decoding ECL enhancement mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>A Shelf&#8208;Stable Reagent for Photocatalytic Radical Pentafluorosulfanylation of Styrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed the first family of air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable pentafluorosulfanylation (SF&#8325;) reagents. Although the SF&#8325; group is a bioisostere of the trifluoromethyl group (CF&#8323;)&#8212;exhibiting even greater electronegativity and lipophilicity, attributes that have earned it the nickname "super trifluoromethyl group"&#8212;the development of shelf&#8208;stable, non&#8208;toxic, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle SF&#8325;&#8208;incorporating reagents had remained elusive for over 70 years since its discovery. Our discovery enables the synthesis of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&#8208;free fluorinated compounds, offering significant advantages over traditional CF&#8323; analogs. These new reagents exhibit promising reactivity under photochemical conditions, efficiently facilitating the formation of novel SF&#8325;&#8208;containing molecules. Moreover, our approach is compatible with the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules. Mechanistic studies have provided valuable insights into the underlying reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials have attracted intensive attention for their potential applications in real&#8208;time stress sensing and structural damage monitoring. To avoid interference from daylight or artificial lighting sources, the ML&#8208;based sensors can be only used in dark&#8208;field scenarios, which becomes the most serious limitation for their development. Herein, we proposed a new strategy that adjusts the ML spectra to the solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet region to address this challenge. By strategically breaking the molecular conjugation and adjusting the packing mode, a series of diphenylphosphine oxide derivatives were successfully designed. To our delight, the shortest ML emission, among all reported organic ML materials, with the maxima at ca. 293 nm (in solar&#8208;blind UV region) was achieved. Photophysical studies, single crystal analysis and theoretical calculations were performed to investigate the solar&#8208;blind UV ML properties. Furthermore, wide&#8208;range color&#8208;tunable ML emissions spanning from 293 nm to 741 nm were achieved. Under various external stimuli such as stretching, folding, and vehicle impact in daylight, obvious ML signals could be directly recorded, and the quantitative relationship between the mechanical stimuli and the ML intensities was also studied. This work suggests a feasible strategy to realize solar&#8208;blind UV ML materials and makes bright&#8208;field environment ML sensors possible.</dc:description>
