         <title>Ostwald&#8208;Ripening Induced Interfacial Protection Layer Boosts 1,000,000&#8208;Cycled Hydronium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Collapsing and degradation of active materials caused by the electrode/electrolyte interface instability in aqueous batteries are one of the main obstacles that mitigate the capacity. Herein by reversing the notorious side reactions include the loss and dissolution of electrode materials: as we applied Ostwald ripening (OR) in the electrochemical cycling of a copper hexacyanoferrate electrode in a hydronium&#8208;ion batteries, the dissolved Cu and Fe ions undergo a crystallization process that creates a stable interface layer of cross&#8208;linked cubes on the electrode surface. The layer exposed the low&#8208;index crystal planes (100) and (110) through OR&#8208;induced electrode particle growth, supplemented by vacancy&#8208;ordered (100) superlattices that facilitated ion migration. Our design stabilized the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface considerably, achieving a cycle life of one million cycles with capacity retention of 91.6%, and a capacity retention of 91.7% after 3000 cycles for a full battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Biocatalytic Desymmetrization for the Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls Using an Engineered Imine Reductase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enzymatic atroposelective synthesis of biaryl compounds is relatively rare, despite considerable attention received by biocatalysis in academic and industrial sectors. Imine reductases (IREDs) are an important class of enzymes that have been applied in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amine building blocks. In this work, two IREDs (IR140 and IR189) were identified to catalyze the efficient desymmetrization of biaryls utilizing various amine donors. Further protein engineering enabled the identification of variants (IR189 M8&#8208;M9 and IR189 M13&#8208;M14) that are able to catalyze the formation of both (R) and (S) atropisomers in excellent yields and atroposelectivities for up to 24 examples (up to 99% ee and yield). The absolute configuration and rotational barriers were confirmed, and the reactions were readily enlarged to allow isolation of the atropisomeric products in 99% ee and 82% isolated yields. The optically pure biaryl amines were further derivatized into various synthetically useful atropisomers. To shed light on the molecular recognition mechanisms, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed, offering plausible explanations for the improved atroposelectivities and enzymatic activities. The current strategy expands the scope of IRED&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of axially chiral biaryl amines, contributing significantly to the field of atroposelective biocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Water Dissociation and Weakening Active Hydrogen Adsorption to Boost the Hydrogen Transfer Reaction over a Cu&#8208;Ag Superlattice Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prerequisite for electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions (EHRs) is H2O splitting to form surface hydrogen species (*H), which occupy catalytic sites and lead to mismatched coverage of *H and reactants, resulting in unsatisfactory activity and selectivity. Thus, modulating the splitting pathway of H2O is significant for optimizing the EHR process. Herein, a Cu&#8208;Ag alloy with a superlattice structure of staggered&#8208;ordered Cu and Ag is theoretically predicted and experimentally proven to undergo a pathway for H2O splitting called the hydrogen transfer reaction (HTR) in the water layer, which involves the formation of *H, the capture of *H by a water cluster to form H*(H2O)x and subsequent hydrogenation reactions by H*(H2O)x. Taking acetylene hydrogenation as a model case, the as&#8208;proposed HTR pathway could lead to a relaxation hydrogenation process to modulate the matching degree of C2H2 and *H, thus enabling a 91.2% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency at a partial current density of 0.38 A cm&#8722;&#8201;2, greatly outperforming its counterpart without a superlattice structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Origin of Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Restructured Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), praised for structural flexibility and tunability, are prominent catalyst prototypes for exploring oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their intricate transformations under OER, especially in industrial high&#8208;current environments, pose significant challenges in accurately elucidating their structure&#8208;activity correlation. Here, we harnessed an electrooxidation process for controllable MOF reconstruction, discovering that Fe doping expedites Ni(Fe)&#8208;MOF structural evolution, accompanied by the elongation of Ni&#8208;O bonds, monitored by in&#8208;situ Raman and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Theoretical modeling further reveals that Fe doping and defect&#8208;induced tensile strain in the NiO6 octahedra augments the metal ds&#8208;Op hybridization, optimizing their adsorption behavior and augmenting OER activity. The reconstructed Ni(Fe)&#8208;MOF, serving as the anode in anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, achieves a noteworthy current density of 3.3 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.2 V while maintaining equally stable operation for 160 h spanning from 0.5 A cm&#8208;2 to 1 A cm&#8208;2. This undertaking elevates our comprehension of OER catalyst reconstruction, furnishing promising avenues for designing highly efficacious catalysts across electrochemical platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalyzed Aryl C&#8208;H Fluorocarbonylation with CF2Br2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of abundant and inexpensive fluorine feedstocks to synthesize fluorinated compounds is a promising strategy that has not been extensively investigated. Dibromodifluoromethane (CF2Br2) is an inexpensive fluorine source that has rarely been used for C&#8208;H fluoroalkylation. This study reveals an iridium&#8208;catalyzed, tunable strategy for synthesizing acyl fluorides and difluorobromomethylated products using CF2Br2. To achieve the desired products, this process only requires the change of solvent (from DMSO to 1,4&#8208;dioxane) under blue LED illumination. A variety of arenes and heteroarenes with electron&#8208;donating substituents were successfully used, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields. Mechanistic experiments revealed that DMSO served a dual role, functioning as both solvent and nucleophilic reagent in C&#8208;H fluorocarbonylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Stable Propane Dehydrogenation on a Self&#8208;supporting Single&#8208;component Zn2SiO4 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Current industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes predominantly use either toxic Cr&#8208;based or expensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts, necessitating urgent exploration for alternatives. Herein, we present Zn2SiO4, an easily prepared, cost&#8208;effective material, as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. Uniquely, Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals do not require dispersion on support materials, commonly needed for catalytic active oxide clusters, but function as a self&#8208;supporting catalyst instead. During the reaction's induction period, surface Zn species on the Zn2SiO4 crystal reduce to coordinately unsaturated ZnOx single sites, serving as highly active catalytic centers. The Zn2SiO4 catalyst demonstrates a stable performance over 200 hours of PDH operation at 550 &#176;C. We further find that introducing a minuscule amount of CO2 into the propane feed significantly extends the catalyst lifespan to over 2000 hours. This enhancement arises from the special role of CO2 in facilitating the removal of strongly adsorbed H*, preventing the complete reduction of ZnOx. After prolonged reaction, the activity of Zn2SiO4 can be fully restored by etching the surface layer to expose fresh Zn species, available throughout the crystals. The combination of CO2 introduction and catalytic site regeneration strategies is expected to enable a year&#8208;long PDH operation using a single batch of Zn2SiO4 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Opal&#8208;Inspired SiO2&#8208;Mediated Carbon Dot Doping Enables the Synthesis of Monodisperse Multifunctional Afterglow Nanocomposites for Advanced Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite recent advancements in inorganic and organic phosphors, creating monodisperse afterglow nanocomposites (NCs) remains challenging due to the complexities of wet chemistry synthesis. Inspired by nanoinclusions in opal, we introduce a novel SiO2&#8208;mediated carbon dot (CD) doping method for fabricating monodisperse, multifunctional afterglow NCs. This method involves growing a SiO2 shell matrix on monodisperse nanoparticles (NPs) and doping CDs into the SiO2 shell under hydrothermal conditions. Our approach preserves the monodispersity of the parent NP@SiO2 NCs while activating a green afterglow in the doped CDs with an impressive lifetime of 1.26 s. Additionally, this method is highly versatile, allowing for various core and dopant combinations to finely tune the afterglow through core&#8208;to&#8208;CD or CD&#8208;to&#8208;dye energy transfer. Our findings significantly enhance the potential of SiO2 coatings, transforming them from merely enhancing the biocompatibility of NCs to serving as a versatile matrix for emitters, facilitating afterglow generation and paving the way for new applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Photocatalytic Synthesis of Acetic Acid at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetic acid, a key intermediate compound, is synthesized by oxidization of ethane with H2O2 at 0&#8201;&#176;C at ambient pressure through an integrated thermal catalysis and photocatalysis. The selectivity for producing acetic acid reaches 98.7&#8201;%. The positively charged Pd1 atom with an adsorbed OH group is the site for activating the first C&#8722;H of C2H6 with an energy barrier of only 0.14&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Acetic acid (AA), a vital compound in chemical production and materials manufacturing, is conventionally synthesized by starting with coal or methane through multiple steps including high&#8208;temperature transformations. Here we present a new synthesis of AA from ethane through photocatalytic selective oxidation of ethane by H2O2 at 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C. The catalyst designed for this process comprises g&#8208;C3N4 with anchored Pd1 single&#8208;atom sites. In situ studies and computational simulation suggest the immobilized Pd1 atom becomes positively charged under photocatalytic condition. Under photoirradiation, the holes on the Pd1 single&#8208;atom of OH&#8722;Pd1

/g&#8208;C3N4 serves as a catalytic site for activating a C&#8722;H instead of C&#8722;C of C2H6 with a low activation barrier of 0.14&#8197;eV, through a concerted mechanism. Remarkably, the selectivity for synthesizing AA reaches 98.7&#8201;%, achieved under atmospheric pressure of ethane at 0&#8201;&#176;C. By integrating photocatalysis with thermal catalysis, we introduce a highly selective, environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient synthetic route for AA, starting from ethane, presenting a promising alternative for AA synthesis. This integration of photocatalysis in low&#8208;temperature oxidation demonstrates a new route of selective oxidation of light alkanes.

         <title>High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Ion Covalent Organic Framework Electrolytes Enabled by Nitrile Migration Ladders for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered the key importance of nitrile (&#8722;CN) functionality and for the first time developed a novel single&#8208;ion conducting COF electrolyte (CN&#8722;iCOF) that is high&#8208;voltage stable in solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. Utilizing Strecker reaction to convert the reversible imine&#8208;based linkage to a stable &#945;&#8208;aminonitrile linkage, azanide&#8208;based anionic centers that are adjacent to the strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups were generated followed by deprotonation. When the CN&#8722;iCOF was assembled in solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries, excellent performance including stable Li electrodeposition and reversible high&#8208;voltage battery cycling up to 4.5&#8197;V was achieved at ambient temperature. The revealed significance of nitrile functionality and the design of new COF structures with high Li+ transport and high electrochemical stability shed light on a novel approach for the rational design of next&#8208;generation batteries.







Abstract
The poor electrochemical stability window and low ionic conductivity in solid&#8208;state electrolytes hinder the development of safe, high&#8208;voltage, and energy&#8208;dense lithium metal batteries. Herein, taking advantage of the unique electronic effect of nitrile groups, we designed a novel azanide&#8208;based single&#8208;ion covalent organic framework (CN&#8722;iCOF) structure that possesses effective Li+ transport and high&#8208;voltage stability in lithium metal batteries. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) revealed that electron&#8208;withdrawing nitrile groups not only resulted in an ultralow HOMO energy orbital but also enhanced Li+ dissociation through charge delocalization, leading to a high tLi+ of 0.93 and remarkable oxidative stability up to 5.6&#8197;V (vs. Li+/Li) simultaneously. Moreover, cyanation leveraging Strecker reaction transformed reversible imine&#8208;linkage to a stable sp3&#8208;carbon&#8208;containing azanide anion, which facilitated contorted alignment of transport &#8220;ladders&#8221; along the one&#8208;dimensional anionic channels and the ionic conductivity could reach 1.33&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at ambient temperature without any additives. As a result, CN&#8722;iCOF allowed operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries with high&#8208;voltage cathodes such as LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NCM811), demonstrating stable lithium deposition up to 1,100&#8197;h and reversible battery cycling at ambient temperature up to 4.5&#8197;V, shedding light on the importance of discovering new functionality for forthcoming high&#8208;performance batteries.

         <title>Solvent Attenuation of London Dispersion in Polycyclic Aromatic Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The energetic attenuation of polycyclic aromatic stacking due to solvent competition is measured experimentally. Interaction energies scale with surface contact area but are attenuated by an order of magnitude in solution. The extent of attenuation scales with the bulk polarisability of the solvent.







Abstract
Solvent competition for London dispersion attenuates its energetic significance in molecular recognition processes. By varying both the stacked contact area and the solvent, here we experimentally deconvolute solvent attenuation using molecular balances. Experimental stacking energies (phenyl to pyrene) correlated strongly with calculations only when dispersion was considered. Such calculations favoured stacking by up to &#8722;27&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 in the gas phase, but it was weakly disfavoured in our solution&#8208;phase experiments (+0.5 to +4.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Nonetheless, the propensity for stacking increased with contact area and in solvents with lower bulk polarisabilities that compete less for dispersion. Experimental stacking energies per unit change in solvent accessible area ranged from &#8722;0.02&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CS2, to &#8722;0.05&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2 in CD2Cl2, but were dwarfed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase energy of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;&#197;&#8722;2. The results underscore the challenge facing the exploitation of dispersion in solution. Solvent competition strongly but imperfectly cancels dispersion at molecular recognition interfaces, making the energetic benefits difficult to realise.

Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of active materials, the resulting binder&#8208;free layered double hydroxides electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading with high areal capacity and cycling stability.







Abstract
The main challenges faced by aqueous rechargeable nickel&#8208;zinc batteries are their comparatively low energy density and poor cycling stability, mainly due to the limited capacity and reversibility of existing Ni&#8208;based cathodes. Moreover, the preparation procedures of these cathodes are complex and not easily scalable, which makes them less promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage. Herein, we utilized MXene as a functional additive to effectively improve the electrodeposition preparation of NiCo layered double hydroxides (LDH). Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between nickel foam (NF) and platting solution and the enhanced ionic conductivity of platting product based on MXene additives, the resulting binder&#8208;free NiCo LDH electrode can achieve ultrahigh areal loading (~65&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with abundant active surface for redox reactions and maintained short transport pathway for ion diffusion and charge transfer. Furthermore, the as&#8208;fabricated alkaline NiCo LDH&#8208;based battery delivers high discharge capacity, up to 20.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 (311&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1), accompanied by remarkable rate performance (9.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 or 148&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 120&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Due to the high structural and chemical stability of MXenes/LDH&#8208;based electrode, excellent cycling life can also be achieved with 88.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. In addition, ultrahigh areal energy density (31.2&#8197;mWh cm&#8722;2) and gravimetric energy density (465&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1) can be simultaneously achieved. This work has inspired the design of advanced cathode materials to develop high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries.

         <title>One Iron for Two Iron Sites in a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Toward Simultaneous N2&#8722;H2 Activation under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iron site in a metal&#8211;organic framework skeleton was introduced as an activator for the two types of iron sites in Fe3O4. Integration of these three kinds of iron sites in one catalytic system exhibited a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; effect, which played the roles in nitrogen activation, hydrogen activation and products transfer simultaneously, and hydrogenation of nitrogen to ammonia was achieved under mild conditions.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts play an important role in the ammonia industry. As one of the most abundant iron minerals, Fe3O4 containing FeII and FeIII sites is widely distributed in the earth's crust and even on exoplanets, theoretically giving it both economic and catalytic potentials in ammonia synthesis. However, in the absence of specific active co&#8208;catalyst and harsh conditions, Fe3O4 is impossible to achieve ammonia synthesis alone. Here, we designed to activate the relatively inert FeII and FeIII sites in Fe3O4 with a third FeIII site inlayed in a coordination framework (MIL&#8208;101(Fe)) to achieve the unpresented multi&#8208;site collaborative catalysis. In&#8208;depth mechanism study confirmed the roles of three different Fe sites in N2 activation, H2 activation, and product transfer, respectively. Efficient N2&#8722;H2 activation to NH3 on the Fe3O4&#8208;based catalytic system has been achieved at extremely mild conditions. Our research provides a theoretical basis and a new strategy for designing efficient non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based ammonia synthesis catalyst with minimized energy consumption.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Template&#8208;Guided Synthesis of High&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Assemblies for Humidity Gradient&#8208;Based Power Generators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organized assembly of fundamental building blocks into intricate molecular architectures remains challenging due to the dynamic building blocks. A general strategy has been developed to synthesize high&#8208;dimensional complex architectures by choosing appropriate anion templates and flexible, non&#8208;planar organic linkers. Further, the complex architecture possesses multifunctions suitable for humidity&#8208;electric power generation.







Abstract
Systematically orchestrating fundamental building blocks into intricate high&#8208;dimensional molecular assemblies at molecular level is imperative for multifunctionality integration. However, this remains a formidable task in crystal engineering due to the dynamic nature of inorganic building blocks. Herein, we develop a multi&#8208;template&#8208;guided strategy to control building blocks. The coordination modes of ligands and the spatial hindrance of anionic templates are pivotal in dictating the overall structures. Flexible multi&#8208;dentate linkers selectively promote the formation of oligomeric assembly ([TeO3(Mo2O2S2)3O2(OH)(C5O2H7)3]4&#8722; {TeMo6}) into tetrahedral cages ([(TeO3)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O4P)6]8&#8722; {Te4Mo24} and [(AsO4)4(Mo2O2S2)12(OH)12(C9H9O6)4]12&#8722; {As4Mo24}), while steric hindrance from anionic templates further assists in assembling cages into an open quadruply twisted M&#246;bius nanobelt ([(C6H5O3P)8(Mo2O2S2)24(OH)24(C8H10O4)12]16&#8722; {P8Mo48}). Among these structures, the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic hybrid cage {Te4Mo24} emerges as an exemplary molecular model for proton conduction and serves as a prototype for humidity gradient&#8208;based power generators (HGPGs). The Te4Mo24&#8208;PVDF&#8208;based HGPG (PVDF=Poly(vinylidene fluoride)) exhibits notable stability and power generation, yielding an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.51&#8197;V and a current density of 77.8&#8197;nA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 90&#8201;% relative humidity (RH). Further insights into the interactions between water molecules and microscale molecules within the generator are achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. This endeavor unveils a universal strategy for synthesizing multifunctional integration molecules.

         <title>Multifunctional Self&#8208;Assembled Bio&#8208;Interfacial Layers for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is employed as an electrolyte additive in the aqueous ZnSO4 electrolyte, which can form a bio&#8208;interfacial layer on the Zinc (Zn) anode via a self&#8208;assembly process. The BSA&#8208;based interfacial layer with hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments forms unique ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions and contributing to improved cycling performance.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion (Zn&#8208;ion) batteries are widely regarded as important candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems for low&#8208;cost renewable energy storage. However, the development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries is currently facing significant challenges due to uncontrollable Zn dendrite growth and severe parasitic reactions on Zn metal anodes. Herein, we report an effective strategy to improve the performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries by leveraging the self&#8208;assembly of bovine serum albumin (BSA) into a bilayer configuration on Zn metal anodes. BSA&#8242;s hydrophilic and hydrophobic fragments form unique and intelligent ion channels, which regulate the migration of Zn ions and facilitate their desolvation process, significantly diminishing parasitic reactions on Zn anodes and leading to a uniform Zn deposition along the Zn (002) plane. Notably, the Zn||Zn symmetric cell with BSA as the electrolyte additive demonstrated a stable cycling performance for up to 2400&#8197;hours at a high current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates the pivotal role of self&#8208;assembled protein bilayer structures in improving the durability of Zn anodes in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Dynamic Evolution of Antisite Defect and Coupling Anionic Redox in High&#8208;Voltage Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic evolution of Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect and its coupling relationship with anionic redox in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes are revealed using operando neutron diffraction techniques. Further, a strategy that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes is proposed.







Abstract
High&#8208;voltage ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes (LiNixCoyMn1&#8722;x&#8722;yO2, x&#8805;0.9) can significantly enhance the energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness of Li&#8208;ion batteries beyond current levels. However, severe Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and their undetermined dynamic evolutions during high&#8208;voltage cycling limit the further development of these ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. In this study, we quantify the dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect using operando neutron diffraction and reveal its coupling relationship with anionic redox, another critical challenge restricting ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. We detect a clear Ni migration coupled with an unstable oxygen lattice, which accompanies the oxidation of oxygen anions at high voltages. Based on these findings, we propose that minimized Li&#8722;Ni antisite defects and controlled Ni migrations are essential for achieving stable high&#8208;voltage cycling structures in ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathodes. This is further demonstrated by the optimized ultrahigh&#8208;Ni cathode, where reduced dynamic evolutions of the Li&#8722;Ni antisite defect effectively inhibit the anionic redox, enhancing the 4.5&#8197;V cycling stability.

         <title>A Highly Stable and Non&#8208;Flammable Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we report a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. Due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility.







Abstract
Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) are regarded as one of the next&#8208;generation electrolytes to promote the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) due to their unparalleled advantages compared to both liquid electrolytes and solid electrolytes. However, its application in LMBs is limited by electrode interface compatibility. Here, we introduce a novel solid dimethylmalononitrile (DMMN)&#8208;based DEE induced by N coordination to dissociate LiTFSI. We confirmed that the DMMN molecule can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI by the interaction between the N atom and Li+, and form the hydrogen bond with TFSI&#8722; anion, which can promote the dissociation of LiTFSI to form DEE. More importantly, due to the absence of active &#945;&#8208;hydrogen, DMMN exhibits greatly enhanced reduction stability with Li metal, resulting in favorable electrode/electrolyte interface compatibility. Polymer electrolytes based on this DEE exhibit high ionic conductivity (0.67&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C), high oxidation voltage (5.0&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), favorable interfacial stability, and nonflammability. Li&#8214;LFP and Li&#8214;NCM811 full batteries utilizing this DEE polymer electrolyte exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability and excellent rate performance at high rates. Therefore, the new DMMN&#8208;based DEE overcomes the limitations of traditional electrolytes in electrode interface compatibility and opens new possibilities for improving the performance of LMBs.

         <title>Recyclable Polythioesters and Poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s via Ring&#8208;Opening Cascade Polymerization of Amino Acid N&#8208;Carboxyanhydrides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens a new paradigm for polymerization of N&#8208;carboxyanhydride based on a S&#8208;to&#8208;N shift reaction, producing unexpected recyclable polythioesters and unprecedent poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s.







Abstract
Polythioesters (PTEs) are emerging sustainable polymers for their degradability and recyclability. However, low polymerizability of monomers and extensive side reactions often hampered the polymerization process. Moreover, copolymers containing both thioester and other types of functional groups in the backbone are highly desirable but rarely accomplished owing to several synthetic challenges. Here, we report the ring&#8208;opening cascade polymerization (ROCAP) of N&#8208;(2&#8208;(acetylthio)ethyl)&#8208;glycine N&#8208;carboxyanhydrides (TE&#8208;NCA) to afford recyclable PTEs and unprecedented poly(thioester&#8208;co&#8208;peptoid)s (P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s) in a controlled manner. By developing appropriated carboxylic acid&#8208;tertiary amine dual catalysts, intramolecular S&#8208;to&#8208;N acyl shift is coupled into the ROCAP process of TE&#8208;NCA to yield products with dispersity below 1.10, molecular weight (Mn) up to 84.5&#8197;kDa, and precisely controlled ratio of thioester to peptoids. Random copolymerization of sarcosine NCA (Sar&#8208;NCA) and TE&#8208;NCA gives thioester&#8208;embedded polysarcosine with facile backbone degradation while maintaining the water solubility. This work represents a paradigm shift for the ROP of NCAs, enriches the realm of cascade polymerizations, and provides a powerful synthetic approach to functional PTEs and P(TE&#8208;co&#8208;PP)s that are otherwise difficult or impossible to make.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol was achieved by using a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, aldol/elimination reaction to assemble the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations.







Abstract
Kalmanol, the flagship member of the kalmane diterpene family, possesses a complex and highly oxidized 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton with nine contiguous stereocenters and exhibits significant analgesic effects and cardiotoxic properties. We have achieved the efficient total synthesis of (+)&#8208;kalmanol in 22&#8197;steps with 2.3&#8201;% yield. The synthesis featured a Rh&#8208;catalyzed [5+2+1] cycloaddition reaction to construct 5/5/8 tricyclic skeleton, and a meticulously designed sequence of stereoselective oxidations of the 5/5/8/5 tetracyclic skeleton.

         <title>Successively Controlling Nanoscale Wrinkles of Ultrathin 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose manipulating MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions to control the synthesis of wrinkled Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;CX nanosheets. Using C1 to C8 acids as modulators, varying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity alters wrinkle sizes. Increased hydrophobicity strengthens MOF&#8208;MOF interactions and weakens MOF&#8208;solvent interactions, producing larger wrinkles. Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C2, Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C3, and Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 show increased nanoscale wrinkles, with Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 having the largest pores, enhancing GC separation performance.







Abstract
The wrinkles are pervasive in ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, but the regulation of wrinkles is rarely explored systematically. Here, we employed a series of carboxylic acids (from formic acid to octanoic acid) to control the wrinkles of Zr&#8208;BTB (BTB=1, 3, 5&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxylphenyl)&#8208;benzene) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet. The wrinkles at the micrometer scale were observed with transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field (HAADF) images showed lattice distortion in many nanoscale regions, which was precisely matched to the nano&#8208;wrinkles. With the changes of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, MOF&#8208;MOF and MOF&#8208;solvent interactions were possibly synergistically regulated and wrinkles with different sizes were obtained, which was supported by HAADF, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculation. Different wrinkle sizes resulted in different pore sizes between the Zr&#8208;BTB nanosheet interlayers, providing highly&#8208;oriented thin films and the successive optimization of kinetic diffusion pathways, proved by grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and nitrogen adsorption. The most suitable wrinkle pore from Zr&#8208;BTB&#8208;C4 exhibited highly efficient chromatographic separation of the substituted benzene isomers. Our work provides a rational route for the modulation of nanoscale wrinkles and their stacked pores of MOF nanosheets and improves the separation abilities of MOFs.

Using C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; acids as modulators, varying hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity alters wrinkle sizes. Increased hydrophobicity strengthens MOF-MOF interactions and weakens MOF-solvent interactions, producing larger wrinkles. Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; show increased nanoscale wrinkles, with Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; having the largest pores, enhancing GC separation performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wrinkles are pervasive in ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) materials, but the regulation of wrinkles is rarely explored systematically. Here, we employed a series of carboxylic acids (from formic acid to octanoic acid) to control the wrinkles of Zr-BTB (BTB=1, 3, 5-(4-carboxylphenyl)-benzene) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheet. The wrinkles at the micrometer scale were observed with transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images showed lattice distortion in many nanoscale regions, which was precisely matched to the nano-wrinkles. With the changes of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, MOF-MOF and MOF-solvent interactions were possibly synergistically regulated and wrinkles with different sizes were obtained, which was supported by HAADF, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory calculation. Different wrinkle sizes resulted in different pore sizes between the Zr-BTB nanosheet interlayers, providing highly-oriented thin films and the successive optimization of kinetic diffusion pathways, proved by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering and nitrogen adsorption. The most suitable wrinkle pore from Zr-BTB-C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited highly efficient chromatographic separation of the substituted benzene isomers. Our work provides a rational route for the modulation of nanoscale wrinkles and their stacked pores of MOF nanosheets and improves the separation abilities of MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Hexabenzocoronene&#8208;Cored Graphdiyne Nanosheets through Dehydrogenative Coupling on Au(111) Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexabenzocoronene core&#8208;expanded graphdiyne nanosheets with a sixfold symmetry were synthesized on Au(111) via dehydrogenative coupling reactions of ethyl&#8208;substituted hexaphenylbenzene. Their chemical and electronic configurations were thoroughly investigated using scanning probe microscopy, providing a band gap (2.8&#8197;eV) of a single&#8208;layer graphdiyne&#8208;like nanosheet.







Abstract
Thermally&#8208;induced dehydrogenative coupling of polyphenylenes on metal surfaces is an important technique to synthesize

&#8208;conjugated carbon nanostructures with atomic precision. However, this protocol has rarely been utilized to fabricate structurally defined carbon nanosheets composed of sp&#8208; and sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. Here, we present the synthesis of butadiyne&#8208;linked hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) on Au(111) surfaces as core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes. The reaction started from hexa(4&#8208;ethylphenyl)benzene, which undergoes dehydrogenation toward hexa(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)benzene, followed by planarization to hexabenzocoronene, coupling between the vinyl groups, and further dehydrogenation. In addition to butadiyne linkages, benzene groups were also found as another type of linker. The reaction sequences were monitored by scanning tunneling microscopy and bond&#8208;resolved non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy, which disclose the structures of intermediates and final products. In combination with density functional theory simulations, the key steps from ethyl substituents to butadiyne and benzene linkers were elucidated. This is a new on&#8208;surface synthesis of core&#8208;expanded graphdiynes with unprecedented electronic properties.

         <title>Exploring Geometric Chirality in Nanocrystals for Boosting Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrogen Conversion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of geometric chiral effect was explored to enhance photocatalytic H2 evolution using a chiral composite of geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) and C3N4 nanosheets. The chiral Au NPs enable efficient charge carrier separation and high&#8208;activity facets, boosting performance over achiral counterparts and resulting in a quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic performance was also revealed.







Abstract
Advancing catalyst design is pivotal for the enhancement of photocatalytic processes in renewable energy conversion. The incorporation of structural chirality into conventional inorganic solar hydrogen nanocatalysts promises a significant transformation in catalysis, a feature absent in this field. Here we unveil the unexplored potential of geometric chirality by creating a chiral composite that integrates geometric chiral Au nanoparticles (NPs) with two&#8208;dimensional C3N4 nanosheets, significantly boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution beyond the achiral counterparts. The superior performance is driven by the geometric chirality of Au NPs, which facilitates efficient charge carrier separation through the favorable C3N4&#8208;chiral Au NP interface and chiral induced spin polarization, and exploits high&#8208;activity facets within the concave surfaces of chiral Au NPs. The resulting synergistic effect leads to a remarkable increase in photocatalytic H2 evolution, with an apparent quantum yield of 44.64&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. Furthermore, we explore the selective polarized photo&#8208;induced carrier separation behavior, revealing a distinct chiral&#8208;dependent photocatalytic HER performance. Our work advances the design and utilization of chiral inorganic nanostructures for superior performance in energy conversion processes.

         <dc:description>
Confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with copper single atoms (CuSAs) inside defective UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 nanocrystals is achieved by the straightforward method of low&#8208;temperature thermolysis. The prepared composite CuSAs@PCN@UiO, combining the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis, exhibits an excellent photocatalytic performance for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion.







Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to value&#8208;added fuels displays an attractive scenario to enhance energy supply and reduce global warming. We report herein the confinement synthesis of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) incorporating with Cu single atoms (CuSAs) inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, which combines the merits of heterojunction photocatalysis and single&#8208;atom catalysis (SAC) to achieve high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. A series of spectral studies displays the formation of CuSAs@PCN inside the crystalline UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, the ternary composite shows an excellent photocatalytic turnover frequency of 4.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH3OH conversion. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the doping of CuSAs, as well as the formation of type&#8208;II heterojunction, are causal factors to achieve CH3OH generation. The study provides new insights designing high&#8208;performance photocatalyst for CO2 conversion to fuels at atomic scale.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms of High&#8208;Rate Copper Electrochemical Machining in Nitrate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dissolution mechanism of copper during high&#8208;rate electrochemical machining in nitrate electrolyte is investigated and proposed to change to overcome mass transport limitation. Prerequisites are derived from polarization measurements under various (hydrodynamic) conditions. A new complexation mechanism involving nitrate ions is proposed at overlimiting currents.







Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical dissolution of copper in nitrate electrolytes is investigated primarily via polarization curves, while varying parameters such as the electrolyte flow velocity, the electrolyte resistance, the anode geometry, and the temperature. This study focuses on the re&#8208;rise in current at high voltages after the limiting current plateau. As a result of the studies, a change in the complexation mechanism from hydration to &#8220;solvo&#8208;nitration&#8221; is proposed, which requires an additional potential drop within the electrochemical double layer.

A copper porphyrin&#8208;derived metal&#8211;organic framework electrocatalyst, FICN&#8208;8, was synthesized and its catalytic activity for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) was investigated. FICN&#8208;8 selectively catalyzed electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO in anhydrous acetonitrile electrolyte. However, formic acid became the dominant CO2RR product with the addition of a proton source to the system. Mechanistic studies revealed the change of major reduction pathway upon proton source addition, while catalyst&#8208;bound hydride (*H) species was proposed as the key intermediate for formic acid production. This work highlights the importance of electrolyte composition on CO2RR product selectivity.

         <title>Fence&#8208;Type Molecular Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To attain high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries, we've proposed a novel strategy for fence&#8208;type molecular electrocatalyst. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer (as catalyst), via nucleophilic substitution formation, creates a reaction space for multiphase transformation of sulfur species. And the uniformly distributed CE sites on the polymer regulate the molecular structures of sulfur species through coordination, boosting the overall redox kinetics.







Abstract
Improving the slow redox kinetics of sulfur species and shuttling issues of soluble intermediates induced from the multiphase sulfur redox reactions are crucial factors for developing the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. In this study, we successfully constructed a novel molecular electrocatalyst through in situ polymerization of bis(3,4&#8208;dibromobenzene)&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (BD18C6) with polysulfide anions on the cathode interface. The crown ether (CE)&#8208;based polymer acts as a spatial &#8220;fence&#8221; to precisely control the unique redox characteristics of sulfur species, which could confine sulfur substance within its interior and interact with lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) to optimize the reaction barrier of sulfur species. The &#8220;fence&#8221; structure and the double&#8208;sided Li+ penetrability of the CE molecule may also prevent the CE catalytic sites from being covered by sulfur during cycling. This new fence&#8208;type electrocatalyst mitigates the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221;, enhances the redox activity of sulfur species, and promotes the formation of three&#8208;dimensional stacked lithium sulfide (Li2S) simultaneously. It thus enables lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries to exhibit superior rate performance and cycle stability, which may also inspire development facing analogous multiphase electrochemical energy&#8208;efficient conversion process.

         <title>Surficial Homogenic Effect Enables Highly Stable Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we innovatively proposed a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition technique to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer and perovskite surface by introducing the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T). Ultimately, we successfully fabricated efficient deep&#8208;blue device delivering the stable emission at 460&#8197;nm with enhanced EQE of 5.01&#8201;% with superior half&#8208;time of 31.3&#8197;min.







Abstract
The device performance of deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is primarily constrained by low external quantum efficiency (EQE) especially poor operational stability. Herein, we develop a facile strategy to improve deep&#8208;blue emission through rational interface engineering. We innovatively reported the novel electron transport material, 4,6&#8208;Tris(4&#8208;(diphenylphosphoryl)phenyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (P&#8208;POT2T), and utilized a sequential wet&#8208;dry deposition method to form the homogenic gradient interface between electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite surface. Unlike previous reports that achieved carrier injection balance by inserting new interlayers, our strategy not only passivated uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite via P=O functional groups but also reduced interfacial carrier recombination without introducing new interfaces. Additionally, this strategy enhanced the interface contact between the perovskite and ETL, significantly boosting device stability. Consequently, the fabricated deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs delivered an EQE exceeding 5&#8201;% (@ 460&#8197;nm) with an exceptional halftime extended to 31.3 minutes. This straightforward approach offers a new strategy to realize highly efficient especially stable PeLEDs.

         <title>Cascade Effect of a Dimerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Dendrimer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecule with an improved horizontal emitting dipole orientation, fast reverse intersystem crossing, and high photoluminescence quantum yield in a pristine film was constructed. The solution&#8208;processable non&#8208;doped device and the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibited maximum external quantum efficiencies of 32.6&#8201;% and 30.7&#8201;%, respectively, and alleviated efficiency roll&#8208;off.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with a high horizontal orientation are highly essential for improving the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes; however, pivotal molecular design strategies to improve the horizontal orientation of solution&#8208;processable TADF emitters are still scarce and challenging. Herein, a phenyl bridge is adopted to connect the double TADF units, and generate a dimerized TADF dendrimer, D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF. Compared to its counterpart with a single TADF unit, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept molecule not only exhibits an improved horizontal dipole ratio (78&#8201;%) due to the &#960;&#8208;delocalization&#8208;induced extended molecular conjugation, but also displays a faster reversed intersystem crossing rate constant (6.08&#215;106&#8197;s&#8722;1) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 95&#8201;% in neat film. Consequently, the non&#8208;doped solution&#8208;processed device with D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as the emitter achieves an ultra&#8208;high maximum EQE of 32.6&#8201;%, which remains at 26.6&#8201;% under a luminance of 1000 cd/m2. Furthermore, when using D4CzBNPh&#8208;SF as a sensitizer, the TADF&#8208;sensitized fluorescence device exhibits a high maximum EQE of 30.7&#8201;% at a luminance of 575&#8197;cd/m2 and a full width at half maximum of 36&#8197;nm.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Metastable Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Polyrotaxanes with Tunable Threading Ratios</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planetary centrifugal mixing was the key to the rapid and convenient synthesis of cyclodextrin&#8208;based polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs). The thiol&#8208;ene click reaction served as the end&#8208;capping reaction using glutathione (GSH) to prepare metastable PRs. The GSH stoppers prevent de&#8208;threading at room temperature, such that heating controls the de&#8208;threading rate, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range.







Abstract
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyrotaxanes (CD&#8208;PRs) are gaining attention for their dynamic sliding rings along the polymer axis, enabling various applications in molecular shuttles, drug delivery, and durable polymers with slidable cross&#8208;links. However, the conventional synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs with tunable threading ratios is typically laborious, time&#8208;consuming, and complicated, which limits their scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, we highlight the great potential of planetary centrifugal mixing, a process that significantly accelerates and simplifies the initial synthesis of polypseudorotaxanes (PPRs), followed by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction as an efficient end&#8208;capping reaction for the synthesis of PRs. Notably, PRs synthesized with glutathione (GSH) as the end&#8208;capping reagent are in a metastable state, where GSH act as a molecular bumper that significantly prevent de&#8208;threading of &#945;&#8208;CD rings at room temperature. Moreover, the rate of ring de&#8208;threading can be precisely controlled by heating, enabling the preparation of metastable PRs with tunable threading ratios over a wide range. The developed strategy is of great significance to the efficient synthesis of CD&#8208;PRs, thus marking a significant step towards their practical application in advanced functional materials and devices.

         <title>Conformational Locking Induced Enantioselective Diarylcarbene Insertion into B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bonds Using a Cationic Rh(I)/Diene Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cationic rhodium(I)/chiral diene catalytic system has been developed, and the first example of rhodium(I)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H Bond Insertion of gem&#8208;diarylcarbenes has been realized. The computational study indicates that the combination of a stereochemically favored &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction and a rotation&#8208;restricted conformation is crucial to the reaction enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective transformations of aryl/aryl carbene are inherently challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing between two arene rings in the reaction process thus remain largely less explored. The few successful examples reported so far, without exception, have all been catalyzed by Rh(II)&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe our successful development of a novel cationic Rh(I)/chiral diene catalytic system capable of efficient enantioselective B&#8722;H and O&#8722;H insertions with diaryl diazomethanes, allowing the access to a broad range of gem&#8208;diarylmethine boranes and gem&#8208;diarylmethine ethers in good yields with high enantioselectivities. Notably, previously unattainable asymmetric diarylcarbene insertion into the O&#8722;H bond was achieved for the first time. A remarkable feature of this newly designed Rh(I)/diene catalyst bearing two ortho&#8208;amidophenyl substitutents is that it can distinguish between two arene rings of the diaryl carbene through a stereochemically selective control of &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions. DFT calculations indicate that the rotation&#8208;restricted conformation of Rh(I)/diene complex played an important role in the highly enantioselective carbene transformations. This work provides an interesting and unprecedented stereocontrol mode in diaryl metal carbene transformations.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Tough, yet Rigid and Healable Supramolecular Polymers with Variable Stiffness for Multimodal Actuators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymers were developed by incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs into densely interconnected hydrogen networks, achieving both exceptional mechanical strength and dynamic chain flexibility. These materials can be utilized to create variable stiffness layers for soft actuators, enhancing their motion versatility and structural robustness.







Abstract
Variable stiffness materials have shown considerable application in soft robotics. However, previously reported materials often struggle to reconcile high stiffness, stretchability, toughness, and self&#8208;healing ability, because of the inherently conflicting requisite of these properties in molecular design. Herein, we propose a novel strategy that involves incorporating acid&#8208;base ionic pairs capable of from strong crosslinking sites into a dense and robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network to construct rigid self&#8208;healing polymers with tunable stiffness and excellent toughness. To demonstrate these distinct features, the polymer was employed to serve as the strain&#8208;regulation layers within a fiber&#8208;reinforced pneumatic actuator (FPA). The exceptional synergy between the configuration versatility of FPA and the dynamic molecular behavior of the supramolecular polymers equips the actuator with simultaneous improvement in motion dexterity, multimodality, loading capacity, robustness, and durability. Additionally, the concept of integrating high dexterity at both macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale is prospective to inspire the design of intelligent yet robust devices across various domains.

         <title>A Rationally Designed Azobenzene Photoswitch for DNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Regulation in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are increasingly acknowledged as promising targets in cancer research, and the development of G4&#8208;specific stabilizing compounds may lay a fundamental foundation in precision medicine for cancer treatment. Here, we propose a light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binder for precise modulation of drug activation, providing dynamic and spatiotemporal control over G4&#8208;associated biological processes contributing to cancer cell death. We developed a specialized fluorinated azobenzene (AB) switch equipped with a quinoline unit and a positively charged carboxamide side chain, Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C, designed for targeted binding to G4 structures within cells. Biophysical studies, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, provide insights into the unique coordination modes of the photoswitchable ligand in its trans and cis configurations when interacting with G4s. The observed variations in complexation processes between the two isomeric states in different cancer cell lines manifest in more than 25&#8208;fold reversible cytotoxic activity. Immunostaining conducted with the structure&#8208;specific G4 antibody (BG4), establishes a direct correlation between cytotoxicity and the varying extent of G4 induction regulated by the two isoforms. Finally, we demonstrate the photo&#8208;driven reversible regulation of G4 structures in lung cancer cells by Q&#8208;Azo4F&#8208;C. Our findings highlight the potential of light&#8208;responsive G4&#8208;binders in advancing precision cancer therapy through dynamic control of G4&#8208;mediated pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Diatomic Catalysts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries: Mechanistic Insights and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There has been a growing interest in developing catalysts to enable the reversible iodine conversion reaction for high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (AZIBs). While diatomic catalysts (DACs) have demonstrated superior performance in various catalytic reactions due to their ability to facilitate synergistic charge interactions, their application in AZIBs remains unexplored. Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn&#8208;Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix (MnZn&#8208;NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high&#8208;performance AZIB with a capacity of 224 mAh g&#8208;1 at 1 A g&#8208;1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000 cycles. The electron hopping along the Mn&#8208;N&#8208;Zn bridge is stimulated via a spin exchange mechanism. This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d&#8208;orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d&#8208;band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn&#8208;NC and I&#8208;based species. Furthermore, our mechanism demonstrates potential applicability to other Metal&#8208;Zn&#8208;NC DACs with spin&#8208;polarized atoms. Our work elucidates a clear mechanistic understanding of diatomic catalysts and provides new insights into catalyst design for AZIBs.</dc:description>

Herein, we present, for the first time, a DAC comprising Mn-Zn dual atoms anchored on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (MnZn-NC) for iodine loading, resulting in a high-performance AZIB with a capacity of 224 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 and remarkable cycling stability over 320,000 cycles.

This process broadens the Mn 3dxy band width and enhances the metallic character of the catalyst, thus facilitating charge transfer between the catalysts and reaction intermediates. Additionally, the increased electron occupancy within the d-orbital of Zn elevates Zn's d-band center, thereby enhancing chemical interactions between MnZn-NC and I-based species.

         <title>Wavy Graphene Nanoribbons Containing Periodic Eight&#8208;Membered Rings for Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Precision graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) offer distinctive physicochemical properties that are highly dependent on their geometric topologies, thereby holding great potential for applications in carbon&#8208;based optoelectronics and spintronics. While the edge structure and width control has been a popular strategy for engineering the optoelectronic properties of GNRs, non&#8208;hexagonal&#8208;ring&#8208;containing GNRs remain underexplored due to synthetic challenges, despite offering an equally high potential for tailored properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of a wavy GNR (wGNR) embedding periodic eight&#8208;membered rings into its carbon skeleton, which is achieved by the A2B2&#8208;type Diels&#8208;Alder polymerization between dibenzocyclooctadiyne (6) and dicyclopenta[e,l]pyrene&#8208;5,11&#8208;dione derivative (8), followed by a selective Scholl reaction of the obtained ladder&#8208;type polymer (LTP) precursor. The obtained wGNR, with a length of up to 30 nm, is thoroughly characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, FT&#8208;IR, Raman, and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy with the support of DFT calculations. The non&#8208;planar geometry of wGNR efficiently prevents the inter&#8208;ribbon &#960;&#8208;&#960; aggregation, leading to photoluminescence in solution. Consequently, the wGNR can function as an emissive layer for organic light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (OLECs), offering a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept exploration in implementing luminescent GNRs into optoelectronic devices. The fast&#8208;responding OLECs employing wGNR will pave the way for advancements in OLEC technology and other optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction: Atom&#8208;Economical Synthesis of Axially Chiral Carbazoles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (DDA) reaction is a powerful method for the construction of aromatic compounds. However, the enantioselective DDA reaction has been rarely developed, probably due to the competitive thermal reaction. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction through vinyl cation pathway. The reaction leads to the atom&#8208;economical synthesis of axially chiral phenyl and indolyl carbazoles in generally excellent yields with good to excellent atroposelectivities. This methodology represents the first example of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective DDA reaction. Notably, new chiral ligand and organocatalyst derived from the constructed axially chiral carbazole are demonstrated to be useful in asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Loading Lewis Acid/Base Pair on Metal Nanocluster for Catalytic Ugi Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Constructing structurally robust and catalytically active metal nanoclusters for catalyzing multi&#8208;component reactions is an interesting while challenging task. Inspired by Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysis, we realized the combination of both Lewis acid and Lewis base sites on the surface of a stable gold nanocluster Au35Cd2. The catalytic potential of Au35Cd2 in four&#8208;component Ugi reaction was explored, demonstrating high activity and exceptional recyclability. In&#8208;depth mechanism studies indicate that the catalytic synergy of the Lewis acid/base pair is crucial for the high efficiency of Au35Cd2&#8208;catalyzed Ugi reaction. Bearing the stable structure, multiple activation sites and hierarchical chirality, Au35Cd2 is expected to display further interesting catalytic performance such as asymmetric catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dual Purpose Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acid for the Expanded Genetic Code: Combining Metal&#8208;Binding and Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A rationally designed dual purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid (Trz) has been synthesised and successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold via genetic code expansion. Trz contains a 5&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine system, which allows for inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions to occur on the triazine ring and for metal ions to be chelated both before and after the click reaction. Trz was successfully incorporated into a protein scaffold and the IEDDA utility of Trz demonstrated through the site&#8208;specific labelling of the purified protein with a bicyclononyne. Additionally, Trz was shown to successfully coordinate a cyclometallated iridium(III) centre, providing access to a bioorthogonal luminogenic probe. The luminescent properties of the Ir(III)&#8208;bound protein blue&#8208;shift upon IEDDA click reaction with bicyclononyne, providing a unique method for monitoring the extent and location of the labelling reaction. In summary, Trz is a new dual purpose non&#8208;canonical amino acid, which has great potential for myriad bioapplications where metal&#8208;based functionality is required, for example in imaging, catalysis, or photo&#8208;dynamic therapy, in conjunction with a bioorthogonal reactive handle to impart additional functionalities, such as dual modality imaging or therapeutic payloads.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic N&#8208;Formylation&#160;of CO2 by Atomically Precise Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+&#160;Clusters into a Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By highly efficient ligand&#8208;exchange strategy, atomically precise Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ (PPh3 = triphenylphosphine) cluster can be transformed into a Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ (DPPF = 1,1'&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene) cluster that can maintain the atomic&#8208;packing structure but overcome the lability of Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+. Catalytic evaluation for the CO2 hydrogenation coupled with o&#8208;phenylenediamine demonstrates that the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst can remarkably enhance both activity and stability&#160;compared to the Au8Pd1(PPh3)82+ catalyst. More notably, the direct construction of a two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (2D MOF) can be elaborately accomplished in the formylation process of o&#8208;phenylenediamine, CO2 and H2 with zinc nitrate enabled by the Au8Pd1(DPPF)42+ catalyst. The 2D MOF further enables the capture and transformation of CO2 to combine in the organic synthesis with epoxides under mild conditions.This work provides opportunities for creating highly active cluster sites for the chemical recycling of CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Local and Charge Transfer Emitters Utilizing Hyperconjugation Effect Towards Solution&#8208;Processed Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiency Approaching 12%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) excited state materials, which possess weak donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) pure organic structures, deserve one of the most promising efficient and stable blue emitters. Through high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC) process, 75% triplet excitons generated by electrical excitation could be harvested and utilized in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, there are still significant challenges to achieve high&#8208;efficiency ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue HLCT emitters with low Commission Internationale de l&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) 1931 chromaticity coordinate y values. Here, a series of novel blue HLCT emitters based on spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2'&#8208;imidazole] structure were designed and synthesized by fine&#8208;tuning the spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,2'&#8208;imidazole] core structure in our previous work through heteroatom substitution and hyperconjugation effect. The target emitters were endowed with excellent photophysical and electrochemical merits, thermal stability and solution processibility. The solution&#8208;processed OLED device based on 4',5'&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)spiro[1,8&#8208;diazafluorene&#8208;9,2'&#8208;imidazole] (NFIP&#8208;CZ) achieved efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission (CIEx,y = 0.1581, 0.0422) with the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax), maximum current efficiency (CEmax) and maximum power efficiency (PEmax) of 11.94%, 4.07 cd&#183;A&#8208;1 and 2.56 lm&#183;W&#8208;1.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptide&#8208;based nanofibers are promising materials for many essential applications and can be generalized into two categories, self&#8208;assembling peptide nanofibers (SAPNs) and poly(amino acid) nanofibers (PAANs). Non&#8208;covalent SAPNs are sequence&#8208;controllable, but poorly stable and not suitable for post&#8208;modification. While covalent PAANs are post&#8208;modifiable, however, their sequences are either monotonic or undefined. The nanofibers obtained by head&#8208;to&#8208;tail covalent coupling polymerization of sequence&#8208;known peptides, which we call series&#8208;connected peptide nanofibers (SCPNs), promise to have the advantages of both SAPNs and PAANs, but they are barely reported. The undesired backbiting effect during the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail polymerization is one of the possible challenges. Here, we present a template&#8208;assisted strategy to trigger the flexible&#8208;to&#8208;rigid transition of peptide units, which can avoid the backbiting effect and enable consecutive intermolecular polymerization of peptides to produce desired sequence&#8208;controlled covalent SCPNs. SCPNs are highly stable and can function as excellent parent materials for various post&#8208;processing to create diverse hierarchical materials independent of the peptide sequence. Moreover, SCPNs allow for the display of predetermined functional groups at regular intervals along the nanofibers by pre&#8208;modification of the initial peptide sequence. SCPNs represent a new category of peptide&#8208;based nanofibers with outstanding performances and vast potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycosylated AIE&#8208;active Red Light&#8208;triggered Photocage with Precisely Tumor Targeting Capability for Synergistic Type I Photodynamic Therapy and CPT Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocaging is an emerging protocol for precisely manipulating spatial and temporal behaviors over biological activity. However, the red/near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered&#160;photolysis process of current photocage is largely singlet oxygen (1O2)&#8208;dependent and lack of compatibility with other reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;activated techniques, which has proven to be the major bottleneck in achieving efficient and precise treatment. Herein, we reported a lactosylated photocage BT&#8208;LRC by covalently incorporating camptothecin (CPT) into hybrid BODIPY&#8208;TPE fluorophore via the superoxide anion radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;)&#8208;cleavable thioketal bond for type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anticancer drug release. Amphiphilic BT&#8208;LRC could be self&#8208;assembled into aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanoparticles (BT&#8208;LRCs) owing to the regulation of carbohydrate&#8208;carbohydrate interactions (CCIs) among neighboring lactose units in the nanoaggregates. BT&#8208;LRCs could simultaneously&#160;generate abundant O2&#8722;&#8226; through the aggregation modulated by lactose interactions, and DNA&#8208;damaging agent CPT was subsequently and effectively released. Notably, the type I PDT and CPT chemotherapy collaboratively amplified the therapeutic efficacy in HepG2 cells and tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Furthermore, the inherent AIE property of BT&#8208;LRCs endowed the photocaged prodrug with superior bioimaging capability, which provided a powerful tool for real&#8208;time tracking and finely tuning the PDT and photoactivated drug release behavior in tumor therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced &#8216;Click Reaction&#8217; Involving Coordination and Covalent Assembly of Hybrid Borates for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of hybrid borates by the organic ligand modification method are urgent and undeveloped areas of research. It is difficult to directly integrate organoboronic acids within inorganic borate chemistry by adopting the traditional preparation approaches. This work reports a facile synthetic method to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. A unique cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring has been identified as the cluster core for all these hybrid borates with two different conformations (boat and crown). This strategy can be applied to a system of pyrazolyl molecules to generate such hybrid borates in two independent routes from organoboronic or inorganic boric acids. Furtherly, the mechanism of &#8216;click reaction&#8217; between boric acid and pyrazole induced by copper ions has been proposed based on the synthetic conditions and the structure of intermediate. Due to the bimetallic Cu sites and the functional surfaces, these materials can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and efficiently enhance the selectivity of HCOOH and C2H4. Our strategy can be regarded as a typical template technique for organic molecule&#8208;protected borates.</dc:description>

         <title>Complexity&#8208;Building Exhaustive Dearomatization of Benzenoid Aromatics within an ESIPT&#8208;Initiated Three&#8208;Step Photochemical Cascade.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomative cycloadditions offer rapid access to complex 3D molecular architectures, commonly via a sp2&#8208;to&#8208;sp3 rehybridization of two atoms of an aromatic ring. Here we report that the 6e &#960;&#8208;system of a benzenoid aromatic pendant could be exhaustively depleted within a single photochemical cascade. An implementation of this approach involves the initial dearomative [4+2] cycloaddition of the Exited State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT)&#8208;generated azaxylylene, followed by two consecutive [2+2] cycloadditions of auxiliary &#960; moieties strategically positioned in the photoprecursor. Such photochemical cascade fully dearomatizes the benzenoid aromatic ring, saturating all six sp2 atoms to yield a complex sp3&#8208;rich scaffold with high control of its 3D molecular shape, rendering it a robust platform for rapid systematic mapping of underexplored chemical space. Significant growth of molecular complexity &#8211; starting with a modular synthesis of photoprecursors from readily available building blocks &#8211; is quantified by B&#246;ttcher score calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Induced Division of Polymersomes for Biomimetic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymersomes are synthetic vesicles that mimic the architecture of cellular compartments such as the cell membrane and organelles. These biomimetic compartments facilitate the creation of cell&#8208;like chemical systems, including microreactors and synthetic organelles. However, the construction of hierarchical multi&#8208;compartment systems remains challenging and typically requires the encapsulation of pre&#8208;formed vesicles within a host compartment. Here, we report the formation of multicompartment polymersomes with a vesicle&#8208;in&#8208;vesicle architecture achieved through self&#8208;division induced by short peptides incorporated into the vesicle membrane. A phenylalanine&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;methionine (FFM) tripeptide was designed and encapsulated into the polymersome via microfluidics. We demonstrate that vesicle self&#8208;division occurs due to peptide incorporation into the membrane in response to pH changes. This self&#8208;division creates internal vesicles capable of colocalizing enzymes. The hybrid polymer&#8208;peptide system described here provides a straightforward method for developing subcompartmentalized systems, paving the way for engineering microreactors with life&#8208;like properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Nuclear Polarization with Conductive Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low sensitivity of liquid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be overcome by hyperpolarizing nuclear spins by dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP). It consists of transferring the near&#8208;unity polarization of unpaired electron spins of stable radicals to the nuclear spins of interest at liquid helium temperatures, below 2 K, before melting the sample in view of hyperpolarized liquid&#8208;state magnetic resonance experiments. Reaching such a temperature is challenging and requires complex instrumentation, which impedes the deployment of dDNP. Here, we propose organic conductive polymers such as polyaniline (PANI) as a new class of polarizing matrices and report&#160;1H polarizations of up to 5%. We also show that&#160;13C spins of a host solution impregnated in porous conductive polymers can be hyperpolarized by relayed DNP. Such conductive polymers can be synthesized as chiral and display current induced spin selectivity leading to electron spins hyperpolarization close to unity without the need for low temperatures nor high magnetic fields. Our results show the feasibility of solid&#8208;state DNP in conductive polymers that are known to exhibit chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioconvergent Cross&#8208;Nucleophile Coupling: Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Deborylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organoboron compounds are widely utilized in organic synthesis for their diverse reactivity, modular preparation, and stability compared to other classes of organometallic reagents. While organoboron species are commonly employed as nucleophiles in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, their potential as racemic building blocks in enantioconvergent transformations remains largely untapped. Herein, we demonstrate the&#160;direct utilization of alkylboronic pinacol esters in intermolecular enantioconvergent transformations. Specifically, this work describes the development and mechanistic study of an enantioconvergent deborylative cyanation enabled by Cu catalysis. This method imparts a high degree of enantioselectivity and tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction is proposed to proceed through a radical&#8208;relay mechanism. Aniline&#8208;assisted homolysis of the carbon&#8211;boron bond results in prochiral alkyl radicals that are functionalized by in situ generated Cu(II)(CN)2 species in an enantioselective fashion. The Cu(II)(CN)2 intermediate was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, and its electronic structure was probed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Computational studies were carried out to corroborate the proposed radical&#8208;relay mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report a robust nickel&#8208;catalyzed &#945;,&#946;&#8208;dehydrogenation process designed for substrates that contain electron&#8208;withdrawing sulfur and phosphorus groups. Leveraging the formation of organozinc intermediates and the utilization of a mild oxidant, allyl methyl carbonate, this methodology exhibits remarkable efficiency and outstanding diastereoselectivities across a diverse array of substrates, achieving E:Z ratios exceeding 20:1.

         <title>Redox Activity and Potentials of Bidentate N&#8208;Ligands Commonly Applied in Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bidentate N&#8208;ligands are paramount to recent advances in nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Through comprehensive organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies on bi&#8208;oxazoline and imidazoline ligands, we reveal that a square planar geometry enables redox activity of these ligands in stabilizing nickel radical species. This finding contrasts with the prior assumption that bi&#8208;oxazoline lacks redox activity due to strong mesomeric donation. Moreover, we conducted systematic cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses of bidentate pyridyl, oxazoline, and imidazoline nitrogen ligands, along with their corresponding nickel complexes. Complexation with nickel shifts the reduction potentials to a more positive region and narrows the differences in redox potentials among the ligands. Additionally, various ligands led to different degrees of bromide dissociation from singly reduced (L)Ni(Ar)(Br) complexes, reflecting varying reactivity in the subsequent activation of alkyl halides, a crucial step in cross&#8208;electrophile coupling. These insights highlight the significant electronic effects of ligands on the stability of metalloradical species and their redox potentials, which interplay with coordination geometry. Quantifying the electron&#8208;donating, p&#8208;accepting properties of these ligands, as well as their effect on catalyst speciation, provides crucial benchmarks for controlling catalytic activity and enhancing catalyst stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Intermolecular Interactions and Film Formation Kinetics for Record Efficiency in Difluorobenzothiadizole&#8208;based Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The difluorobenzothiadizole (ffBT) unit is one of the most classic electron&#8208;accepting building blocks used to construct D&#8208;A copolymers for applications in organic solar cells (OSCs). Historically, ffBT&#8208;based polymers have achieved record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in fullerene&#8208;based OSCs owing to their strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation (TDA) characteristics. However, their excessive miscibility and rapid aggregation kinetics during film formation have hindered their performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Herein, we synthesized two ffBT&#8208;based copolymers, PffBT&#8208;2T and PffBT&#8208;4T, incorporating different &#960;&#8208;bridges to modulate intermolecular interactions and aggregation tendencies. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed that PffBT&#8208;4T exhibits reduced electrostatic potential differences and miscibility with L8&#8208;BO compared to PffBT&#8208;2T. This facilitates improved phase separation in the active layer, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Moreover, PffBT&#8208;4T demonstrated a prolonged nucleation and crystal growth process, leading to enhanced molecular packing and optimized morphology. Consequently, PffBT&#8208;4T&#8208;based devices achieved a remarkable PCE of 17.5%, setting a new record for ffBT&#8208;based photovoltaic polymers. Our findings underscore the importance of conjugate backbone modulation in controlling aggregation behavior and film formation kinetics, providing valuable insights for the design of high&#8208;performance polymer donors in organic photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening of Silver&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Catalysts for NO Electroreduction to NH3 by DFT Calculations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring NO reduction reaction (NORR) electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity toward NH3 is essential for both NO removal and NH3 synthesis. Due to their superior electrocatalytic activities, single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted considerable attention. However, the exploration of SAAs is hindered by a lack of fast yet reliable prediction of catalytic performance. To address this problem, we comprehensively screened a series of transition&#8208;metal atom doped Ag&#8208;based SAAs. This screening process involves regression machine learning (ML) algorithms and a compressed&#8208;sensing data&#8208;analytics approach parameterized with density&#8208;functional inputs. The results demonstrate that Cu/Ag and Zn/Ag can efficiently activate and hydrogenate NO with small &#934;max(&#951;), a grand&#8208;canonical adaptation of the Gmax(&#951;) descriptor, and exhibit higher affinity to NO over H adatoms to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The NH3 selectivity is mainly determined by the s orbitals of the doped single&#8208;atom near the Fermi level. The catalytic activity of SAAs is highly correlated with the local environment of the active site. We further quantified the relationship between the intrinsic features of these active sites and &#934;max(&#951;). Our work clarifies the mechanism of NORR to NH3 and offers a design principle to guide the screen of highly active SAA catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia on AuCu Single&#8208;atom Alloy Aerogels under Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) is very attractive for nitrate removal and ammonia production in industrial processes. However, the nitrate reduction reaction is characterized by intense hydrogen competition at strong reduction potentials, which greatly limits the Faraday efficiency at strong reduction potentials. Herein, we reported an AuxCu single&#8208;atom alloy aerogels (AuxCu SAAs) with three&#8208;dimensional network structure with significant nitrate reduction performance of Faraday efficiency (FE) higher than 90% over a wide potential range (0 ~ &#8208;1 VRHE). The FE of the catalyst was close to 100% at a high reduction potential of &#8208;0.8 VRHE, accompanying with NH3 yield reaching 6.21 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2. More importantly, the catalyst maintained a long&#8208;term operation over 400 h at 400 mA cm&#8208;2 for the NO3RR using a continuous flow system in a H&#8208;cell. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the catalyst can lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation reaction of *NO2, leading to a rapid consumption of the generated *H, facilitate the hydrogenation process of NO3RR, and inhibit the competitive HER at high overpotentials, which efficiently promotes the nitrate reduction reaction, especially in industrial applications.</dc:description>

Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on perovskite quantum dots (QDs), abbreviated as P&#8208;QLEDs have been regarded as significantly crucial emitters for lighting and displays. Efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs still lack ideal electron transport materials (ETM), which could efficiently block hole, transport electron, reduce interface non&#8208;radiative recombination and possess high thermal stability. Here, we report 2,4,6&#8208;Tris(3&#8242;&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;yl) biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TmPPPyTz, 3P) with strong electron&#8208;withdrawing moieties of pyridine and triazine to modulate the performance of P&#8208;QLEDs. Compared with commonly used 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi), the pyridine in 3P have a strong interaction with perovskites, which can effectively suppress the interface non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by the Pb2+ defects on the surface of QDs. In addition, 3P have deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (enhancing hole&#8208;blocking properties), matched lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and excellent electron mobility (enhancing electron transport properties), realizing the carrier balance and maximizing the exciton recombination. Furthermore, high thermal resistance of 3P obviously improves the stability of QDs under variable temperature, continuous UV illumination, and electric field excitation. Resultantly, the P&#8208;QLEDs using the 3P as ETM achieved an outstanding performance with a champion EQE of 30.2&#8201;% and an operational lifetime T50 of 3220&#8197;hours at an initial luminance of 100&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, which is 151&#8201;% and about 11&#8208;fold improvement compared to control devices (EQE=20&#8201;%, T50=297&#8197;hours), respectively. These results provide a new concept for constructing the efficient and stable P&#8208;QLEDs from the perspective of selective ETM.

&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=297&#8197;hours), respectively. These results provide a new concept for constructing the efficient and stable P-QLEDs from the perspective of selective ETM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zr(OH)4&#8208;Catalyzed Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Phenylacetylene with Terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H as Active Site: Inactive for Free Styrene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zr(OH)4 was firstly applied to catalyze semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene. It can achieve a 95&#8201;% removal rate of 1&#8201;%&#8201;mol of phenylacetylene in styrene, and the terminal hydroxyl group is confirmed as the active site.







Abstract
In the field of industrial semi&#8208;hydrogenation of trace alkynes amidst alkene feedstocks, the pivotal challenge lies in circumventing the hydrogenation of alkenes. Herein, we present Zr(OH)4 as an innovative catalyst for the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene, demonstrating remarkable selectivity towards styrene (&gt;96&#8201;%), while exhibiting inactivity towards free styrene. Notably, Zr(OH)4 achieves a 95&#8201;% conversion of quasi&#8208;industry 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% phenylacetylene within styrene, with a mere 0.44&#8201;% styrene loss. Experimental and theoretical results confirm both terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H and bridge Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H can dissociate H2, while the terminal Zr&#8722;O&#8722;H plays a crucial role on activating phenylacetylene through the sequential hydrogenation process of C6H5C&#8801;CH&#8594;C6H5C=CH2&#8594;C6H5CH=CH2. The high rate of phenylacetylene removal is attributed to its strong adsorption capacity, while Zr(OH)4 has a significantly weaker adsorption capacity for styrene.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly of glycan nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy granted access to previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, allowing for molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of carbohydrates.







Abstract
A comprehensive molecular understanding of carbohydrate aggregation is key to optimize carbohydrate utilization and to engineer bioinspired analogues with tailored shapes and properties. However, the lack of well&#8208;defined synthetic standards has substantially hampered advances in this field. Herein, we employ a phosphorylation&#8208;assisted strategy to synthesize previously inaccessible long oligomers of cellulose, chitin, and xylan. These oligomers were subjected to enzyme&#8208;triggered assembly (ETA) for the on&#8208;demand formation of well&#8208;defined carbohydrate nanomaterials, including elongated platelets, helical bundles, and hexagonal particles. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy and electron diffraction analysis provided molecular insights into the aggregation behavior of these oligosaccharides, establishing a direct connection between the resulting morphologies and the oligosaccharide primary sequence. Our findings demonstrate that ETA is a powerful approach to elucidate the intrinsic aggregation behavior of carbohydrates in nature. Moreover, the ability to access a diverse array of morphologies, expanded with a non&#8208;natural sequence, underscores the potential of ETA, coupled with sequence design, as a robust tool for accessing programmable glycan architectures.

         <title>Bilateral Embedded Anchoring via Tailored Polymer Brush for Large&#8208;Area Air&#8208;Processed Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical manipulation strategy of bilateral embedded anchoring by planting polymer brush in the inorganic HTL is important to realize air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs and the highly desirable for large&#8208;area devices. The efficiencies of the achieved air&#8208;processed large&#8208;area blue PeLEDs reached 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glove box.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) that can be air&#8208;processed promises the development of displaying optoelectronic device, while is challenged by technical difficulty on both the active layer and hole transport layer (HTL) caused by the unavoidable humidity interference. Here, we propose and validate that, planting the polymer brush with tailored functional groups in inorganic HTL, provides unique bilateral embedded anchoring that is capable of simultaneously addressing the n phases crystallization rates in the active layer as well as the deteriorated particulate surface defects in HTL. Exemplified by zwitterionic polyethyleneimine&#8208;sulfonate (PEIS) in present study, its implanting in NiOx HTL offers abundant nuclei sites of amino and sulfonate groups that balance the growth rate of different n phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. Moreover, the PEIS effectively nailed the interfacial contact between perovskite and NiOx, and reduced the particulate surface defects in HTL, leading to the enhanced PLQY and stability of large&#8208;area blue perovskite film in ambient air. By virtue of these merits, present work achieves the first demonstration of the air&#8208;processed blue PeLEDs in large emitting area of 1.0&#8197;cm2 with peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2.09&#8201;%, which is comparable to the similar pure&#8208;bromide blue PeLEDs fabricated in glovebox.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ripening Enabled by Hygroscopic Salts for Hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;Free Printable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 20&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ripening induced by the synergy of hygroscopic salt and moisture is reported for preparing efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with efficiency surpassing 20&#8201;%. The post&#8208;treatment enables significant secondary crystallization of perovskite through moisture absorption which liquefies the grain boundary and activates sufficient mass transfer by offering channels and promoting desired dissolution.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskite films generally possess small grain sizes and high density of grain boundaries, which intensify non&#8208;radiative recombination of carriers and limit the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. In this study, we report the room&#8208;temperature ripening enabled by the synergy of hygroscopic salts and moisture in air for efficient hole&#8208;conductor&#8208;free printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs). Treating perovskite films with proper hygroscopic salts in damp air induces obvious secondary recrystallization, which coarsens the grains size from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. It's proposed that the hygroscopic salt at grain boundaries could absorb moisture and form a complex which could not only serve as mass transfer channel but also assist in the dissolution of perovskite grains. This activates mass transfer between small grains and large grains since they possess different solubilities, and thus ripens the perovskite film. Consequently, p&#8208;MPSCs treated with the hygroscopic salt of NH4SCN show an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.13&#8201;% from 17.94&#8201;%, and maintain &gt;98&#8201;% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point tracking at 55&#177;5&#8201;&#176;C for 350&#8197;hours.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Heterobenzylic Amines via Carbonyl Azinylative Amination</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indium metal&#8208;mediated carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) reaction provides an operationally straightforward protocol for the multicomponent coupling carbonyls, amines and 2&#8208;iodo azines to form &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines. This modular reaction displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile.

Transformations enabling the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;alkyl, &#945;&#8242;&#8208;2&#8208;azinyl amines by addition of 2&#8208;heteroaryl&#8208;based nucleophiles to in situ&#8208;generated and non&#8208;activated alkyl&#8208;substituted iminium ions are extremely rare. Approaches involving classical 2&#8208;azinyl organometallics, such as the corresponding Grignard reagents, often fail to produce the desired products. Here, we report an operationally straightforward solution to this problem through the development of a multicomponent coupling process wherein a soft 2&#8208;azinyl indium nucleophile, generated in situ from the corresponding 2&#8208;iodo heteroarene and indium powder, adds to an iminium ion that is also formed directly in the reaction. This modular carbonyl azinylative amination (CAzA) displays a broad scope and only a metal reductant is needed to generate a reactive 2&#8208;azinyl nucleophile. Beyond the addition to iminium ions, the 2&#8208;azinyl addition to polyfluoromethyl ketones forms the corresponding tertiary alcohols. Together, the products of these reactions possess a high degree of functionality, are typically challenging to synthesize by other methods, and contain motifs recognized as privileged in the context of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

         <title>Using In situ Transmission Electron Microscopy to Study Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interactions in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is currently a prominent subject of study in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Comprehending the atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of SMSI is crucial for directing the design and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts. This article reviews the latest advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) research on SMSI. It also offers a concise overview of the obstacles and potential solutions for future progress in this emerging domain.







Abstract
Precisely controlling the microstructure of supported metal catalysts and regulating metal&#8208;support interactions at the atomic level are essential for achieving highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) not only stabilizes metal nanoparticles and improves their resistance to sintering but also modulates the electrical interaction between metal species and the support, optimizing the catalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, understating the formation mechanism of SMSI and its dynamic evolution during the chemical reaction at the atomic scale is crucial for guiding the structural design and performance optimization of supported metal catalysts. Recent advancements in in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have shed new light on these complex phenomena, providing deeper insights into the SMSI dynamics. Here, the research progress of in situ TEM investigation on SMSI in heterogeneous catalysis is systematically reviewed, focusing on the formation dynamics, structural evolution during the catalytic reactions, and regulation methods of SMSI. The significant advantages of in situ TEM technologies for SMSI research are also highlighted. Moreover, the challenges and probable development paths of in situ TEM studies on the SMSI are also provided.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Mimetic Metal&#8208;Free Heterogeneous Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Alkyne Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic molecular mimic metal&#8208;free catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized graphite exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency and 99&#8201;% selectivity for the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts.







Abstract
The direct construction of metal&#8208;free catalysts on conductive substrates for electrocatalytic organic hydrogenation reactions is significant but still unexplored. Here, learning from the homogeneous molecular catalysts, an organic molecular mimetic metal&#8208;free heterogeneous catalyst is designed and constructed in situ on a graphite flake electrode via a mild electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction relay strategy. The as&#8208;prepared &#8722;COOH&#8208; and &#8722;OH&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;free catalyst exhibits an electrocatalytic alkyne semihydrogenation performance with a 72&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency, 99&#8201;% selectivity and 96&#8201;% yield of the alkene product, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts. The removal of these oxygen&#8208;containing groups leads to negligible activity. The experimental and calculation results reveal that the origin of the high activity can be assigned to the &#8722;COOH and &#8722;OH groups on graphite. A flow electrolytic cell delivers ten grams of hydrogenated products with 81&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. This metal&#8208;free catalyst is also suitable for gas&#8208;phase acetylene semihydrogenation and other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Progressive Endergonic Synthesis of Diels&#8211;Alder Adducts Driven by Chemical Energy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going uphill. While most chemical reactions proceed towards equilibrium, we describe herein how to drive Diels&#8211;Alder reactions away from equilibrium (&#916;G &gt;0) using the hydration energy of carbodiimides. Our strategy yielded products up to 400&#8201;% of what thermodynamics would allow at equilibrium. Progressive accumulation upon repeated fueling cycles unlocks adaptive behaviors in chemical reaction networks.







Abstract
The overwhelming majority of artificial chemical reaction networks respond to stimuli by relaxing towards an equilibrium state. The opposite response&#8212;moving away from equilibrium&#8212;can afford the endergonic synthesis of molecules, of which only rare examples have been reported. Here, we report six examples of Diels&#8211;Alder adducts formed in an endergonic process and use this strategy to realize their stepwise accumulation. Indeed, systems respond to repeated occurrences of the same stimulus by increasing the amount of adduct formed, with the final network distribution depending on the number of stimuli received. Our findings indicate how endergonic processes can contribute to the transition from responsive to adaptive systems.

         <title>Nonalternant B,N&#8208;Embedded Helical Nanographenes Containing Azepines: Programmable Synthesis, Responsive Chiroptical Properties and Spontaneous Resolution into a Single&#8208;Handed Helix</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a programmable and modular approach to fledged B,N&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes was achieved by stepwise Scholl reactions with privileged formation of [9]helicene moiety. The controllable integration of negatively curved azepines into 6 afforded the dynamic chiral skeleton, which induced spontaneous resolution into single&#8208;handed helix at the single&#8208;crystal scale.







Abstract
Heteroatom&#8208;embedded helical nanographenes (NGs) constitute an important and appealing class of intrinsically chiral materials. In this work, a series of B,N&#8208;embedded helical NGs (BN&#8208;HNGs) bearing azepines was synthesized via stepwise regioselective cyclodehydrogenation. First, the phenyl&#8208; or nitrogen&#8208;bridged dimers were efficiently clipped into highly congested model compounds 1 and 2. Later, the controllable Scholl reactions of the tetraphenyl&#8208;tethered precursor generated 1, 7 or 8 new C&#8722;C bonds, thereby establishing a robust method for the preparation of nonalternant BN&#8208;HNGs with up to 31 fused rings. The helical bilayer nature was unambiguously verified by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The helical chirality was transferred to the stereogenic boron centers upon fluoride coordination, with a concave&#8208;concave structure to comply with the bilayer skeleton. Notably, the largest nonalternant BN&#8208;HNG (6) spontaneously resolved into a homochiral 41 helix structure as a molecular spiral staircase during crystallization via conglomerate formation at the single&#8208;crystal scale. The large twisted C2&#8208;symmetric &#960;&#8208;surface and the dynamic chiral skeleton induced by curved azepines might have synergistic effects on self&#8208;recognition of enantiomers of 6 to achieve the intriguing spontaneous resolution behavior. The chiroptical properties of the enantiomer of 6 were further investigated, revealing that 6 had a strong chiroptical response in the visible range (400&#8211;700&#8197;nm).

         <title>Regioselective Oxidative Phenol Coupling by a Mushroom Unspecific Peroxygenase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phlegmacin biosynthesis in the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer reveals that CoUPO1, an unspecific peroxygenase, catalyzes the dimerization step by regio&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative phenol coupling. This study demonstrates that mushrooms evolved aryl coupling independently of any other group of organisms.







Abstract
Bioactive dimeric (pre&#8208;)anthraquinones are ubiquitous in nature and are found in bacteria, fungi, insects, and plants. Their biosynthesis via oxidative phenol coupling (OPC) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, peroxidases, or laccases. While the biocatalysis of OPC in molds (Ascomycota) is well&#8208;known, the respective enzymes in mushroom&#8208;forming fungi (Basidiomycota) are unknown. Here, we report on the biosynthesis of the atropisomers phlegmacin A1 and B1 of the mushroom Cortinarius odorifer. The biosynthesis of these unsymmetrically 7,10&#8217;&#8208;homo&#8208;coupled dihydroanthracenones was heterologously reconstituted in the mold Aspergillus niger. Methylation of the parental monomer atrochrysone to its 6&#8208;O&#8208;methyl ether torosachrysone by the O&#8208;methyltransferase CoOMT1 precedes the regioselective homocoupling to phlegmacin, catalyzed by the enzyme CoUPO1 annotated as an &#8220;unspecific peroxygenase&#8221; (UPO). Our results reveal an unprecedented UPO reaction, thereby expanding the biocatalytic portfolio of oxidative phenol coupling beyond the commonly reported enzymes. The results show that Basidiomycota use peroxygenases to selectively couple aryls independently of and convergently to any other group of organisms, emphasizing the central role of OPC in natural processes.

         <title>Incorporation of Pd Single&#8208;Atom Sites in Perovskite with an Excellent Selectivity toward Photocatalytic Semihydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd active phases have been successfully incorporated in the lattices of SrTiO3 as single&#8208;atom sites (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) for the semihydrogenation of alkynes. The Pd atoms with an optimized electronic structure and coordination environment facilitate the desorption of alkenes, thereby exhibiting an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability.







Abstract
Semihydrogenation is a crucial industrial process. Noble metals such as Pd have been extensively studied in semihydrogenation reactions, owing to their unique catalytic activity toward hydrogen activation. However, the overhydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes often happens due to the rather strong adsorption of alkenes on Pd active phases. Herein, we demonstrate that the incorporation of Pd active phases as single&#8208;atom sites in perovskite lattices such as SrTiO3 can greatly alternate the electronic structure and coordination environment of Pd active phases to facilitate the desorption of alkenes rather than further hydrogenation. Furthermore, the incorporated Pd sites can be well stabilized without sintering by a strong host&#8211;guest interaction with SrTiO3 during the activation of H species in hydrogenation reactions. As a result, the Pd incorporated SrTiO3 (Pd&#8208;SrTiO3) exhibits an excellent time&#8208;independent selectivity (&gt;99.9&#8201;%) and robust durability for the photocatalytic semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene to styrene. This strategy based on incorporation of active phases in perovskite lattices will have broad implications in the development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Leap&#8208;Type Response of Redox/Photo&#8208;Active Lanthanide&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Early and Accurate Screening of Prostate Cancer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating mixed&#8208;valent redox metal center, charge/energy donor and photo&#8208;active center in one interface, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;amplified sensitivity is developed for precisely distinguishing the negative and positive acid phosphatase (ACP, prostate cancer marker), which exhibits bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence (&#8220;leap&#8221; response from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221;) at ACP threshold.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;accuracy technologies to distinguish the quite tiny concentration change of tumor markers between negative and positive is of vital significance for early screening and diagnosis of cancers, but is still a great challenge for the conventional biosensors because of their &#8220;gradual&#8221; detection mode. Herein, a unique &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; responsive lanthanide MOF&#8208;based biosensor (designated as Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X) with defect&#8208;mediated redox&#8208;/photo&#8208;activities is developed for precisely identifying acid phosphatase (ACP), an early pathological marker of prostate cancer (PCa) in serum. The engineered Tb&#8208;CeMOF&#8208;X probe achieves a bursting switch&#8208;on luminescence at the critical concentration of ACP (9&#8197;U&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;L&#8722;1), while keeping silent below this threshold, undergoing a qualitative signal change from &#8220;zero&#8221; to &#8220;one&#8221; between negative and positive indicators and thus significantly improving the identification precision. Significantly, such &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; response performance can be further edited and amplified by rational defect engineering in the crystal structure to improve the accessibility of active centers, consequently maximizing the detection sensitivity toward ACP in the complex biological media. This study proposes the first paradigm for the development of &#8220;leap&#8208;type&#8221; biosensors with ultra&#8208;sensitive differentiation capability between negative and positive, and provides a potentially valuable tool for early and accurate screening of PCa.

         <title>New Insights for High&#8208;Through CO2 Hydrogenation to High&#8208;Quality Fuel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional catalytic system of the composite NaFeGaZr&amp;HZSM&#8208;5 catalyst exhibits rapid responsiveness to high&#8208;throughput CO2 hydrogenation, leading to the production of liquid fuels that meet commercial gasoline standards. With an impressive space&#8208;time yield of 0.9&#8197;kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1, this achievement bears significant strategic importance for advancing the future development of sustainable energy.







Abstract
In the case of CO2 thermal&#8208;catalytic hydrogenation, highly selective olefin generation and subsequent olefin secondary reactions to fuel hydrocarbons in an ultra&#8208;short residence time is a huge challenge, especially under industrially feasible conditions. Here, we report a pioneering synthetic process that achieves selective production of high&#8208;volume commercial gasoline with the assistance of fast response mechanism. In situ experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that the designed NaFeGaZr presents exceptional carbiding prowess, and swiftly forms carbides even at extremely brief gas residence times, facilitating olefin production. The created successive hollow zeolite HZSM&#8208;5 further reinforces aromatization of olefin diffused from NaFeGaZr via optimized mass transfer in the hollow channel of zeolite. Benefiting from its rapid response mechanism within the multifunctional catalytic system, this catalyst effectively prevents the excessive hydrogenation of intermediates and controls the swift conversion of intermediates into aromatics, even in high&#8208;throughput settings. This enables a rapid one&#8208;step synthesis of high&#8208;quality gasoline&#8208;range hydrocarbons without any post&#8208;treatment, with high commercial product compatibility and space&#8208;time yield up to 0.9&#8197;kggasoline&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kgcat&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1. These findings from the current work can provide a shed for the preparation of efficient catalysts and in&#8208;depth understanding of C1 catalysis in industrial level.

         <title>Modular, Scalable Total Synthesis of Lapparbin with a Noncanonical Biaryl Linkage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization enabled total synthesis of the cyclic peptide natural product lapparbin. The key steps to construct the highly strained C&#8722;N biaryl linkage between the Tyr C6 and Trp N1&#8242; centers were found to be applicable to the synthesis of analogues of lapparbin.







Abstract
We report the development of a novel synthetic approach for the highly strained atrop&#8208;Tyr C&#8208;6&#8208;to&#8208;Trp N&#8208;1&#8242; linkage, which can be executed on a decagram scale using a modular strategy involving palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization. The first total synthesis of lapparbin (1) was achieved by applying this synthetic strategy. Furthermore, the modular synthesis utilizing C&#8722;H arylation and Larock macrocyclization, discovered in the total synthesis of lapparbin (1), was demonstrated to be applicable to various arbitrary biaryl linkages, including non&#8208;natural types.

&lt;p&gt;Palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization enabled total synthesis of the cyclic peptide natural product lapparbin. The key steps to construct the highly strained C&#8722;N biaryl linkage between the Tyr C6 and Trp N1&#8242; centers were found to be applicable to the synthesis of analogues of lapparbin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the development of a novel synthetic approach for the highly strained atrop-Tyr C-6-to-Trp N-1&#8242; linkage, which can be executed on a decagram scale using a modular strategy involving palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation followed by Larock macrocyclization. The first total synthesis of lapparbin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was achieved by applying this synthetic strategy. Furthermore, the modular synthesis utilizing C&#8722;H arylation and Larock macrocyclization, discovered in the total synthesis of lapparbin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), was demonstrated to be applicable to various arbitrary biaryl linkages, including non-natural types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging Ligand Steric Demand to Control Ligand Exchange and Domain Composition in Stratified Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MOFs having diverse components partitioned into unique domains may exhibit cooperative properties and functions reliant on domain composition and ordering. Inter&#8208;domain ligand exchange scrambles components across domains. This study provides strategies for mitigating ligand exchange and thus controlling domain compositional integrity, factors that are critical for building robust structure&#8211;property relationships in these classes of MOFs.







Abstract
Incorporating diverse components into metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can expand their scope of properties and applications. Stratified MOFs (sMOFs) consist of compositionally unique concentric domains (strata), offering unprecedented complexity through partitioning of structural and functional components. However, the labile nature of metal&#8208;ligand coordination handicaps achieving compositionally distinct domains due to ligand exchange reactions occurring concurrently with secondary strata growth. To achieve complex sMOF compositions, characterizing and controlling the competing processes of new strata growth and ligand exchange are vital. This work systematically examines controlling ligand exchange in UiO&#8208;67 sMOFs by tuning ligand sterics. We present quantitative methods for assessing and visualizing the outcomes of strata growth and ligand exchange that rely on high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field images and elemental mapping via scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy. In addition, we leverage ligand sterics to create &#8216;blocking layers&#8217; that minimize ligand exchange between strata which are particularly susceptible to ligand exchange and inter&#8208;strata ligand mixing. Finally, we evaluate strata compositional integrity in various solvents and find that sMOFs can maintain their compositions for &gt;12&#8197;months in some cases. Collectively, these studies and methods enhance understanding and control over ligand placement in multi&#8208;domain MOFs, factors that underscore careful tunning of properties and function.

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction in Spinel Oxides via Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Phase Boundary Construction for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides requires comprehensive understanding of the surface reconstruction. Traditionally, the surface reconstruction is an electrochemical irreversible process, accompanied by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process as competitive reaction, which makes it difficult to solely study the surface reconstruction. Surface reconstruction has attracted significant scientific curiosity, and unveiling the elusive mechanism of structure&#8211;property relationship may offer the new design paradigm of advanced catalyst. In this work, we prepare CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 as model catalysts to investigate its reconstruction process. The results demonstrate that such a surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel oxides is a spontaneous chemical process, and phase boundary construction from tetrahedral to octahedral units is employed to decrease oxygen vacancy formation energy in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results show that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rises to 64&#8201;%, a 3.5&#8197;nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer generates on the catalyst surface after the reconstruction process, with a 158&#8197;mV decrease in overpotential. Furthermore, the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8722;T) phase will result in lattice mismatch, thus decreasing the oxygen vacancy formation energy and benefiting the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Then more active lattice oxygen combines with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;), followed by the soluble cation leaching, which eventually leads to promoted reconstruction. This work provides a new comprehending on the correlation between the intrinsic structure of the pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction process in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of surface reconstruction is crucial for developing highly efficient lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) based spinel oxides. Traditionally, the reconstruction has been achieved through electrochemical procedures, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). In this work, we found that the surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based CoFe0.25Al1.75O4 catalyst was an irreversible oxygen redox chemical reaction. And a lower oxygen vacancy formation energy (EO&#8208;V) could benefit the combination of the activated lattice oxygen atoms with adsorbed water molecular. Motivated by this finding, a strategy of phase boundary construction from Co tetrahedral to octahedral was employed to decrease EO&#8208;V in CoFe0.25Al1.75O4. The results showed that as the Co octahedral occupancy ratio rose to 64&#8201;%, a 3.5&#8197;nm&#8208;thick reconstructed layer formed on the catalyst surface with a 158&#8197;mV decrease in overpotential. Further experiments indicated that the coexistence of tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral (O&#8722;T) phase would result in lattice mismatch, promoting non&#8208;bonding oxygen states and lowering EO&#8208;V. Then more active lattice oxygen combined with H2O molecules to generate hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;), followed by soluble cation leaching, which enhanced the reconstruction process. This work provided new insights into the relationship between the intrinsic structure of pre&#8208;catalysts and surface reconstruction in LOM&#8208;based spinel electrocatalysts.

         <title>Redox and Kinetic Properties of Composition&#8208;Dependent Active Sites in Copper&#8208;Exchanged Chabazite for Direct Methane&#8208;to&#8208;Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactivity tests and advanced in situ/operando spectroscopic techniques are employed to elucidate the Cu speciation in Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites with varying Cu loading and Si/Al ratio and its influence on CH4 partial oxidation to CH3OH. An improved CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency of materials containing primarily monomeric Cu(II) active sites in contrast to zeolites with a significant fraction of dimeric Cu(II) centers has been found.







Abstract
The CH4 oxidation performance of Cu&#8208;chabazite zeolites characterized by distinct Si/Al ratios and Cu loadings has been studied and the observed variations in reactivity have been correlated to the differences in the nature of the formed active centers. Plug flow reactor tests, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrate that a decrease in Cu loading shifts the reactivity/redox profile to higher temperatures and increases the CH3OH selectivity and Cu&#8208;efficiency. In situ electron paramagnetic resonance, Raman, ultraviolet&#8208;visible, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopies reveal that this behavior is associated with the presence of monomeric Cu active sites, including bare Cu2+ and [CuOH]+ present at low Si/Al ratio and Cu loading. Formation of two distinct [Cu2(&#956;&#8208;O)]2+ moieties at higher Si/Al ratio or Cu loading forces these trends into the opposite direction. Operando electron paramagnetic resonance and ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy show that the apparent activation energy of monomeric Cu active species decreases with increasing Si/Al ratio, whereas the one of dimeric centers is unaffected.

         <title>Fuel&#8208;Driven Dynamic Combinatorial Peptide Libraries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) using a catalytic reaction cycle to form transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. Fueled by a chemical reaction, the library explores liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and advances DCC by engineering peptide structures, paving the way for tunable materials exhibiting emergent, life&#8208;like behaviors.







Abstract
Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) creates libraries of molecules that are constantly interchanging in a dynamic combinatorial library. When a library member self&#8208;assembles, it can displace the equilibria, leading to emergent phenomena like its selection or even its replication. However, such dynamic combinatorial libraries typically operate in or close to equilibrium. This work introduces a new dynamic combinatorial chemistry fueled by a catalytic reaction cycle that forms transient, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium peptide&#8208;based macrocycles. The products in this library exist out of equilibrium at the expense of fuel and are thus regulated by kinetics and thermodynamics. By creating a chemically fueled dynamic combinatorial library with the vast structural space of amino acids, we explored the liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behavior of the library members. The study advances DCCs by showing that peptide structures can be engineered to control the dynamic library&#8242;s behavior. The work paves the way for creating novel, tunable material systems that exhibit emergent behavior reminiscent of biological systems. These findings have implications for the development of new materials and for understanding life&#8242;s chemistry.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Assisted Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvation Structure for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid ester&#8208;ether electrolyte is proposed by introducing weakly solvated tetrahydrofuran into commonly used propylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, which simultaneously achieves the anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity. These merit the gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface with accelerated desolvation process, guaranteeing the fast&#8208;charging performance of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure favors the formation of inorganic&#8208;rich robust electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, which endows fast ion transport and high strength modulus to enable improved electrochemical performance. However, such a unique solvation structure inevitably injures the ionic conductivity of electrolytes and limits the fast&#8208;charging performance. Herein, a trade&#8208;off in tuning anion&#8208;reinforced solvation structure and high ionic conductivity is realized by the entropy&#8208;assisted hybrid ester&#8208;ether electrolyte. Anion&#8208;reinforced solvation sheath with more anions occupying the inner Na+ shell is constructed by introducing the weakly coordinated ether tetrahydrofuran into the commonly used ester&#8208;based electrolyte, which merits the accelerated desolvation energy and gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. The improved ionic conductivity is attributed to the weakly diverse solvation structures induced by entropy effect. These enable the enhanced rate performance and cycling stability of Prussian blue||hard carbon full cells with high electrode mass loading. More importantly, the practical application of the designed electrolyte was further demonstrated by industry&#8208;level 18650 cylindrical cells.

         <title>Enantioselective S&#8208;Alkylation of Sulfenamides by Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 and an average yield of 94&#8201;% across a broad scope of inputs is achieved. Development of a catalyst to synthesize the opposite enantiomer with high selectivity and a demonstration of the utility of the method via application to the synthesis of a drug candidate is shown.







Abstract
A general phase&#8208;transfer catalyst (PTC) mediated enantioselective alkylation of N&#8208;acylsulfenamides is reported. Essential to achieving high selectivity was the use of the triethylacetyl sulfenamide protecting group along with aqueous KOH as the base under biphasic aqueous conditions to enable the reaction to be performed at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. With these key parameters, enantiomeric ratios up to 97.5&#8201;:&#8201;2.5 at the newly generated chiral sulfur center were achieved with an inexpensive cinchona alkaloid derived PTC. Broad scope and excellent functional group compatibility was observed for a variety of S&#8208;(hetero)aryl and branched and unbranched S&#8208;alkyl sulfenamides. Moreover, to achieve high selectivity for the opposite enantiomer, a pseudoenantiomeric catalyst was designed and synthesized from inexpensive cinchonidine. Given that sulfoximines are a bioactive pharmacophore of ever&#8208;increasing interest, selected product sulfilimines were oxidized to the corresponding sulfoximines with subsequent reductive cleavage affording the free&#8208;NH sulfoximines in high yields. The utility of the disclosed method was further demonstrated by the efficient asymmetric synthesis of atuveciclib, a phase I clinical candidate for which only chiral HPLC separation had previously been reported for isolation of the desired (R)&#8208;sulfoximine stereoisomer.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of Vesicle Microreactors for Oscillating ATP Synthesis and Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered vesicle microreactors with multiple functional proteins are constructed for bioenergy oscillation. Modulating biocatalytic reaction involved with each fuel (glucose, urea) generates and consumes protons respectively, which facilitates ATP synthesis and hydrolysis of ATPase in a tunable fashion.







Abstract
We construct a compartmentalized nanoarchitecture to regulate bioenergy level. Glucose dehydrogenase, urease and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are encapsulated inside through liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. ATPase and glucose transporter embedded in hybrid liposomes are attached at the surface. Glucose is transported and converted to gluconic acid catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase, resulting in an outward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP synthesis. In parallel, urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to generate ammonia, which leads to an inward proton gradient to drive ATPase for ATP hydrolysis. These processes lead to a change of the direction of proton gradient, thus achieving artificial ATP oscillation. Importantly, the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillation can be programmed. The work explores nanoarchitectonics integrating multiple components to realize artificial and precise oscillation of bioenergy level.

         <title>Biosynthesis of the Non&#8208;Canonical C17 Sesquiterpenoids Chlororaphen A and B from Pseudomonas Chlororaphis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of the non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenes chlororaphen A and B was investigated in isotopic labelling experiments and by DFT calculations. The results revealed unexpected regular scrambling of 13C&#8208;labelling that can be explained through a late&#8208;stage multistep rearrangement. Up to 14 deuterium atoms were incorporated from D2O, setting a new record in terpene biosynthesis.







Abstract
Chlororaphens A and B are structurally unique non&#8208;canonical C17 sesquiterpenoids from Pseudomonas chlororaphis that are made by two SAM&#8208;dependent methyltransferases and a type&#8197;I terpene synthase. This study addresses the mechanism of their formation in isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The results demonstrate an astonishing complexity with distribution of labellings within a cyclopentane core that is reversely connected to two acyclic fragments in chlororaphen A and B. In addition, the uptake of up to 14 deuterium atoms from D2O was observed. These findings are explainable by a repeated late stage multistep rearrangement sequence. The absolute configurations of the chlororaphens and their biosynthetic intermediates were elucidated in stereoselective labelling experiments.

         <title>Controlled Protein&#8208;Membrane Interactions Modulate Self&#8208;Organization of Min Protein Patterns</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;organization of proteins is a fundamental process in living systems. The Zieske research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light in Erlangen now reconstituted snowflake&#8208;like patterns using purified proteins and synthetic lipid membranes. Their work reveals membrane linkage as a key biophysical parameter, determining whether proteins self&#8208;organize into expanding snowflake&#8208;like patterns or into travelling surface waves.







Abstract
Self&#8208;organizing protein patterns are crucial for living systems, governing important cellular processes such as polarization and division. While the field of protein self&#8208;organization has reached a point where basic pattern&#8208;forming mechanisms can be reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins, understanding how cells can dynamically switch and modulate these patterns, especially when transiently needed, remains an interesting frontier. Here, we demonstrate the efficient regulation of self&#8208;organizing protein patterns through the modulation of simple biophysical membrane parameters. Our investigation focuses on the impact of membrane affinity changes on Min protein patterns at lipid membranes composed of Escherichia coli lipids or minimal lipid compositions, and we present three major results. First, we observed the emergence of a diverse array of pattern phenotypes, ranging from waves over flower&#8208;shaped patterns to snowflake&#8208;like structures. Second, we demonstrated the dependency of these patterns on the density of protein&#8208;membrane linkers. Finally, we demonstrate that&#160;the shape of snowflake&#8208;like patterns is&#160;fine&#8208;tuned by membrane charge. Our results demonstrate the significant influence of membrane linkage as a straightforward biophysical parameter governing protein pattern formation. Our research points towards a simple yet intriguing mechanism by which cells can adeptly tune and switch protein patterns on the mesoscale.

         <title>Copper Intercalation Induces Amorphization of 2D Cu/WO3 for Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was achieved for a Cu intercalated, amorphous 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest the magnetic enhancement of 2D Cu/WO3 is originated from oxygen lattice distortion induced by Cu intercalation, leading to the formation of bound magnetic polaron for ferromagnetism.







Abstract
Ferromagnetism in the two&#8208;dimensional limit has become an intriguing topic for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications. To induce ferromagnetism in 2D materials, intercalation has been proposed to be an effective strategy, which could introduce lattice distortion and unpaired spin into the material to modulate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. To strengthen the understanding of the magnetic origin of 2D material, Cu was introduced into a 2D WO3 through chemical intercalation in this work (2D Cu/WO3). In contrast to the diamagnetic nature of Cu and WO3, room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was characterized for 2D Cu/WO3. Experimental and theoretical results attribute the ferromagnetism to the bound magnetic polaron in 2D Cu/WO3, which is consist of unpaired spins from W5+/W4+ with localized carriers from oxygen vacancies. Overall, this work provides a novel approach to introduce ferromagnetism into diamagnetic WO3, which could be applied for a wider scope of 2D materials.

         <title>Methoxide&#8208;Enabled Zirconium&#8208;Catalyzed Migratory Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the zirconium&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation of alkenes is presented that allows the direct use of zirconocene dichloride as catalyst through mild activation with a methoxide additive. The reaction can be applied to terminal, internal, and conjugated alkenes. A catalytic zirconium walk ensures the selective formation of linear silane products. Based on additional experiments and calculations, a zirconium(IV) mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
A zirconocene dichloride&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation is reported that can be applied to non&#8208;activated and conjugated terminal and internal alkenes. It involves a catalytic Zr&#8208;walk process and leads to a selective conversion to the linear product. Lithium methoxide serves as mild catalyst activating agent, which significantly increases the applicability and operational simplicity in comparison to earlier zirconium(II)&#8208;based protocols. Supported by additional experiments and calculations, a mechanism via zirconium(IV) intermediates is proposed. Due to the benign nature and ready&#8208;availability of the zirconium catalyst, the reaction is an attractive alternative to established alkene hydrosilylation methods.

         <title>Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 Sites Coupling Atop&#8208;type and Bridge&#8208;type Adsorbed *C1 for Electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 site leads to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure and the regulation of adsorption strength of several key adsorbates, reaching the simultaneous atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 for electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion.







Abstract
2D functional porous frameworks offer a platform for studying the structure&#8211;activity relationships during electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Yet challenges still exist to breakthrough key limitations on site configuration (typical M&#8722;O4 or M&#8722;N4 units) and product selectivity (common CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion). Herein, a novel 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with planar asymmetric N/O mixed coordinated Cu&#8722;N1O3 unit is constructed, labeled as BIT&#8208;119. When applied to CO2RR, BIT&#8208;119 could reach a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion with C2 partial current density ranging from 36.9 to 165.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in flow cell. Compared to the typical symmetric Cu&#8722;O4 units, asymmetric Cu&#8722;N1O3 units lead to the re&#8208;distribution of local electron structure, regulating the adsorption strength of several key adsorbates and the following catalytic selectivity. From experimental and theoretical analyses, Cu&#8722;N1O3 sites could simultaneously couple the atop&#8208;type (on Cu site) and bridge&#8208;type (on Cu&#8722;N site) adsorption of *C1 species to reach the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 conversion. This work broadens the feasible C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on 2D functional porous frameworks.

Abstract
Introduction of non&#8208;hexagons and/or heteroatoms allows for finely tuning the physicochemical properties of nanographenes. Heteroatoms doping have dominated the modulation of nanographenes with tunable band gap, rich electrochemical activities and so on. The pair of non&#8208;hexagons, for instance, pentagon&#8208;heptagon pairs, have furnished nanographenes with aromatic and/or antiaromatic characteristics, open&#8208;shell properties and so on. In order to meet the growing demand for versatile nanographenes in materials science, research on novel nanographenes with heteroatom doped non&#8208;hexagonal pairs has been aroused in recent years. In this review, we focus on nanographenes with nitrogen&#8208;doped non&#8208;hexagonal paris including the synthesis, structure analysis, photophysical properties, and potential applications in organic devices.

         <title>Unbiased Photoelectrochemical H2O2 Coupled to H2 Production via Dual Sb2S3&#8208;Based Photoelectrodes with Ultralow Onset Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial photosynthesis with a photoanode of two&#8208;electron water oxidation into H2O2 and a photocathode of H2 by one sun illumination as the only energy input was developed on Sb2S3 photoelectrodes.







Abstract
The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. Moreover, the formation of H2O2 through two&#8208;electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four&#8208;electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H2O2 production. The photoanode exhibits an outstanding average FE of 85&#8201;% in the potential range of 0.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;VRHE and the H2O2 yield of 1.01&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 at 1.6&#8197;VRHE, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8211;0.55&#8197;VRHE with 80.4&#8201;% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H2 production on both the Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3 photoanode and the Pt/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H2O2 production rate of 0.637&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;min&#8722;1 without applying any addition bias. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes exhibit H2O2/H2 two&#8208;side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value&#8208;added products in neutral conditions.

&lt;p&gt;The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. Moreover, the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through two-electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four-electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. The photoanode exhibits an outstanding average FE of 85&#8201;% in the potential range of 0.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 1.01&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.6&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8211;0.55&#8197;V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; with 80.4&#8201;% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production on both the Ru/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode and the Pt/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 0.637&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; without applying any addition bias. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based photoelectrodes exhibit H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; two-side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value-added products in neutral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Four&#8208;Membered Ring&#8208;Embedded Cycloarene Enabling Anti&#8208;Aromaticity and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene MF2 was synthesized, demonstrating the local anti&#8208;aromaticity and ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit FWHM of only 7&#8197;nm, which sets a new record of FWHM among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules. Here, we provide an innovative design strategy to synthesize ultra&#8208;narrowband emission materials for the OLED display technology.







Abstract
The synthesis of fully fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated cycloarenes embedded with nonbenzenoid aromatics is challenging. In this work, the first example of four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;embedded cycloarene (MF2) was designed and synthesized in single&#8208;crystal form by macrocyclization and ring fusion strategies. For comparison, single bond&#8208;linked chiral macrocycle MS2 without two fused four&#8208;membered rings and its linear&#8208;shaped polycyclic benzenoid monomer L1 were also synthesized. The pronounced anti&#8208;aromaticity of four&#8208;membered rings significantly adjusts the electronic structures and photophysical properties of cycloarene, resulting in an enhancement of the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) from 10.66&#8201;% and 10.74&#8201;% for L1 and MS2, respectively, to 54.05&#8201;% for MF2, which is the highest PLQY among the reported cycloarenes. Notably, owing to the embedded anti&#8208;aromatic four&#8208;membered rings that reduce structural displacements, MF2 exhibits an ultra&#8208;narrowband emission with a single&#8208;digit full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 7&#8197;nm (0.038&#8197;eV), which sets a new record among all reported organic narrowband luminescent molecules, and represents the first example of ultra&#8208;narrowband emission in conventional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) devoid of heteroatoms.

         <title>Transforming Element Sulfur to High Performance Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Polymer via Proton Transfer Enabled Anionic Hybrid Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of sulfur has been a global issue. Copolymerization of element sulfur (S8) with other monomers is a promising route to convert it to useful materials but is limited by the comonomers. Here, we report anionic hybrid copolymerization of S8 with acrylate and epoxide at room temperature, where S8 does not copolymerize with epoxide in the absence of acrylate. Yet, the proton transfer from the methyne in acrylate to the oxygen anion enables the ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic comonomer and hence the copolymerization. The cyclic comonomers can be expanded to lactone and cyclic carbonate. Specifically, the copolymer of S8 with bisphenl A diglycidyl ether and diacrylate displays mechanical properties comparable to those of most common plastics, namely, it has ultimate tensile strength as high as 60.8 MPa and Young&#8217;s modulus up to 680 MPa. It also exhibits high UV resistance and good transparency. Particularly, it has excellent UV&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing, reprocessability and closed&#8208;loop recyclability due to the abundant dynamic S&#8208;S bonds and ester groups. This study provides an efficient strategy to turn element sulfur into closed&#8208;loop recyclable polymer with high mechanical and optical performances.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Isomerisation Catalysed by a Superbasic Sodium Amide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using superbasic sodium amide NaTMP as a catalyst, isomerisation of alkenes at room temperature under mild condition has been accomplished. Isolation of organometallic intermediates and DFT calculations have revealed the key role on TMP(H), acting as a proton source and facilitatitng the migration of the double bond.







Abstract
Typically catalysed by transition metals, alkene isomerisation is a powerful methodology for preparation of internal olefins. In contrast, the use of more earth abundant main group reagents is limited to activated substrates, requiring high temperatures and excess stoichiometric amounts. Opening a new avenue for progressing this field, here we report applications of bulky sodium amide NaTMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide) when partnered with tridentate Lewis donor PMDETA (N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8242;,N&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) in catalytic alkene isomerisation of terminal olefins under mild reaction conditions. An array of distinct olefins could successfully be isomerised, including unactivated olefins, allylamines, and allylethers, showing the high activity of this partnership. In&#8208;depth mechanistic insights provided by X&#8208;ray crystallography, real&#8208;time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) monitoring, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have unveiled the crucial role of in situ&#8208;generated TMP(H) in facilitating efficient isomerisation, and the choice of alkali&#8208;metal. Additionally, theoretical studies shed light on the observed E/Z selectivity, particularly accounting for the selective formation of Z&#8208;vinyl ethers. The versatility of our method is further demonstrated through the isomerisation of unactivated cycloalkenes, which undergo hydrogen isotope exchange to produce deuterated compounds.

         <title>Photoswitchable Carbamazepine Analogs for Non&#8208;Invasive Neuroinhibition In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoswitchable derivatives of the antiseizure drug carbamazepine have been developed to inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand using light. Two compounds allow controlling hippocampal neuron firing and zebrafish larvae locomotion with light, and Carbadiazocine (right) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non&#8208;invasive illumination.







Abstract
A problem of systemic pharmacotherapy is off&#8208;target activity, which causes adverse effects. Outstanding examples include neuroinhibitory medications like antiseizure drugs, which are used against epilepsy and neuropathic pain but cause systemic side effects. There is a need of drugs that inhibit nerve signals locally and on&#8208;demand without affecting other regions of the body. Photopharmacology aims to address this problem with light&#8208;activated drugs and localized illumination in the target organ. Here, we have developed photoswitchable derivatives of the widely prescribed antiseizure drug carbamazepine. For that purpose, we expanded our method of ortho azologization of tricyclic drugs to meta/para and to N&#8208;bridged diazocine. Our results validate the concept of ortho cryptoazologs (uniquely exemplified by Carbazopine&#8208;1) and bring to light Carbadiazocine (8), which can be photoswitched between 400&#8211;590&#8197;nm light (using violet LEDs and halogen lamps) and shows good drug&#8208;likeness and predicted safety. Both compounds display photoswitchable activity in vitro and in translucent zebrafish larvae. Carbadiazocine (8) also offers in vivo analgesic efficacy (mechanical and thermal stimuli) in a rat model of neuropathic pain and a simple and compelling treatment demonstration with non&#8208;invasive illumination.

         <title>Polymer Free Volume&#8208;Controlled Molecular Clock and Emitter for Multicolored Transient Data Display in Advanced Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular clock and emitter consisting of pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP and PTF1 has been developed via an &#8220;one stone (rigidity) two birds (clock and emitter)&#8221; strategy. Combining the synergistical responses of both pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP and PTF1 toward the rigidity change of polymer network enables transient data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for innovative applications from data security to display.







Abstract
The booming demand on data security has aroused great interest for developing smart materials with temporal display feature and dynamic multicolor fluorescence. However, it remains challenging to implement both features on most responsive molecules. Herein, we construct a polymer free volume&#8208;controlled &#8220;molecular clock and emitter&#8221; via covalently embedding a multi&#8208;stimuli responsive molecular switch (i.e., spiropyran) into a polymer network (i.e., poly(pentafluorophenyl acrylate)) with programmable crosslink density and free volume. By the aminolysis of pentafluorophenyl ester with different amount of diamine crosslinkers, pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP networks with controllable crosslink densities are generated, which have different confinement effects on the rate constant of SP/MC isomerization, thus leading to time&#8208;dependent photochromism. In addition, PTF1, a fluorescent probe that is sensitive to polymer rigidity, is introduced to further endow pPFPA&#8208;co&#8208;SP system with phototunable dynamic full&#8208;color emission. Therefore, relying on their synergistical responses to the rigidity of the polymer network, we have successfully developed a versatile molecular clock and emitter via an &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; manner, which shows time&#8208;dependent data display along with dynamic multicolor fluorescence switching, providing great potential for advanced encryption and anticounterfeiting with a high security level.

         <title>Amorphous FeSnOx Nanosheets with Hierarchical Vacancies for Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous 2D nanosheets with abundant nano&#8208;sized perforations and oxygen vancancies, mixed with a small amount of monolayer MXene, are coated on PP separators. This simultaneously regulates uniform Na deposition, facilitates the kinetics of polysulfides conversion, and enhances the mechanical properties.







Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8722;S) batteries, noted for their low material costs and high energy density, are emerging as a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in various applications including power grids and standalone renewable energy systems. These batteries are commonly assembled with glass fiber membranes, which face significant challenges like the dissolution of polysulfides, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and the growth of Na dendrites. Here, we develop an amorphous two&#8208;dimensional (2D) iron tin oxide (A&#8208;FeSnOx) nanosheet with hierarchical vacancies, including abundant oxygen vacancies (Ovs) and nano&#8208;sized perforations, that can be assembled into a multifunctional layer overlaying commercial separators for RT Na&#8722;S batteries. The Ovs offer strong adsorption and abundant catalytic sites for polysulfides, while the defect concentration is finely tuned to elucidate the polysulfides conversion mechanisms. The nano&#8208;sized perforations aid in regulating Na ions transport, resulting in uniform Na deposition. Moreover, the strategic addition of trace amounts of Ti3C2 (MXene) forms an amorphous/crystalline (A/C) interface that significantly improves the mechanical properties of the separator and suppresses dendrite growth. As a result, the task&#8208;specific layer achieves ultra&#8208;light (~0.1&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2), ultra&#8208;thin (~200&#8197;nm), and ultra&#8208;robust (modulus=4.9&#8197;GPa) characteristics. Consequently, the RT Na&#8722;S battery maintained a high capacity of 610.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.9&#8201;% after 400&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;C.

         <title>A General Photoactive H&#8208;Bonding EDA Complex Model Drives the Selective Hydrothiolation and Hydroxysulfenylation of Carbonyl Activated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel model of H&#8208;bonding EDA complex was first reported for the modular and selective hydrothiolation and hydroxysulfenylation of carbonyl activated alkenes with diverse thiols under visible light conditions.







Abstract
Excitation of photoactive electron donor&#8722;acceptor (EDA) complexes to generate radical is a promising approach in radical chemistry. In this study, we introduce a new model of H&#8208;bonding EDA complexes for the selective hydrothiolation and hydroxysulfenylation of carbonyl&#8208;activated alkenes with diverse thiols under visible light conditions. The reliability of this H&#8208;bonding EDA complex model has been confirmed by meticulous experimental and theoretical calculations. Mechanistic investigations have revealed the significant influence of the solvent in determining whether the excitation of photoactive H&#8208;bonding EDA complex leads to charge transfer (CT) or energy&#8208;charge transfer (En&#8208;CT), thereby controlling Markovnikov and anti&#8208;Markovnikov selectivity. Notably, the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analysis clearly shows that the excited state of the C=O&#8722;H&#8722;S EDA complex involves closed&#8208;shell partially covalent interactions.

         <title>Directional Bias in Molecular Photogearing Evidenced by LED&#8208;Coupled Chiral Cryo&#8208;HPLC</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant directionality bias for the coupled rotations of a light&#8208;powered molecular photogear is evidenced by analysis of its enantiomeric states. Using a custom designed LED&#8208;coupled chiral cryo&#8208;HPLC setup, the sense of directionality of coupled double&#8208; and single bond rotations during photogearing could be elucidated directly. Electronic effects are found to be crucial for directionality bias instead of steric effects.







Abstract
Molecular gearing systems are technomimetic nanoscale analogues to complex geared machinery in the macroscopic world. They are defined as systems incorporating intermeshed movable parts which perform correlated rotational motions by mechanical engagement. Only recently, new methods to actively drive molecular gearing motions instead of relying on passive thermal activation have been developed. Further progress in this endeavor will pave the way for unidirectional molecular gearing devices with a distinct type of molecular machine awaiting its realization. Within this work an essential step towards this goal is achieved by evidencing directional biases for the light&#8208;induced rotations in our molecular photogear system. Using a custom&#8208;designed LED&#8208;coupled chiral cryo&#8208;HPLC setup for the in situ irradiation of enantiomeric analytes, an intrinsic selectivity for clockwise or counterclockwise rotations was elucidated experimentally. Significant directional biases in the photogearing processes and light&#8208;induced single bond rotations (SBRs) are observed for our photogear with directional preferences of up to 4.8&#8201;:&#8201;1. Harnessing these effects will allow to rationally design and construct a fully directional molecular gearing motor in the future.

         <title>A Conductive Binder Based on Mesoscopic Interpenetration with Polysulfides Capturing Skeleton and Redox Intermediates Network for Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating network was synthesized. The lithium sulfur battery assembled with this binder has excellent electrochemical performance, especially rate performance and cycling stability.







Abstract
The practical application of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with high theoretical energy density and readily available cathode active materials is hampered by problems such as sulfur insulation, dramatic volume changes, and polysulfide shuttling. The targeted development of novel binders is the most industrialized solution to the problem of sulfur cathodes. Herein, an aqueous conductive emulsion binder with the sulfonate&#8208;containing hard elastic copolymer core and the conjugate polymer shell, which is capable of forming a bicontinuous mesoscopic interpenetrating polymer network, is synthesized and investigated. Not only can the elastic skeleton formed by the copolymer bind the active substance under drastic volume changes, but also the rich ester and cyanide groups in it can effectively capture lithium polysulfide. Meanwhile, the conducting skeleton consisting of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) both provides the additional charge conduction pathways and acts as the redox intermediates, significantly accelerating the kinetic process of lithium polysulfide conversion. Based on the synergistic effect of the above mechanisms, the use of the prepared binder on the sulfur carbon cathode significantly improves the rate performance and cycle stability of lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Electrocatalysis and Spatial Nanoconfinement to Accelerate Sulfur Conversion Kinetics in Aqueous Zn&#8722;S Battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur/nitrogen dual&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers spatially confined sulfur nanoparticles (S@S,N&#8722;CNF) composite with yolk&#8211;shell sulfur@carbon nanostructure is elaborately fabricated. Benefiting from both the synergistic electrocatalysis and spatial nanoconfinement of S,N&#8722;CNF host, S@S,N&#8722;CNF cathode exhibits reduced energy barrier and accelerated sulfur reduction reaction kinetics enabling highly improved aqueous Zn&#8722;S battery performances.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc batteries based on the conversion&#8208;type sulfur cathodes are promising in energy storage system due to the high theoretical energy density, low cost, and good safety. However, the multi&#8208;electron solid&#8208;state intermediate conversion reaction of sulfur cathodes generally possess sluggish kinetics, which leads to lower discharge voltage and inefficient sulfur utilization, thus suppressing the practical energy density. Herein, sulfur nanoparticles derived from metal&#8211;organic frameworks confined in situ within electrospun fibers derived sulfur and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (S@S,N&#8722;CNF) composite, which possesses yolk&#8211;shell S@C nanostructure, is fabricated through successive sulfidation, pyrolysis, and sulfide oxidation processes, and served as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for Zn&#8722;S battery. The S and N dopants on carbon can collectively catalyse sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) by lowering energy barrier and accelerating kinetics to increase discharge voltage and specific capacity. Meanwhile, the yolk&#8211;shell S@C structure with spatially confined S nanoparticle yolks is beneficial to improve charge transfer and lower activation energy, thus further expediting SRR kinetics. Furthermore, extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that S and N dual&#8208;doping can thermodynamically and dynamically reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step (i.e., the transformation of *ZnS4 into *ZnS2) for the overall SRR, thereby significantly accelerating SRR kinetics.

         <title>mRNA Display in Cell Lysates Enables Identification of Cyclic Peptides Targeting the BRD3 Extraterminal Domain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to perform mRNA display selections against protein targets expressed in mammalian cell lysates has been developed. This approach circumvents the need for purified proteins to be produced, giving access to targets that are aggregation&#8208;prone, contain disordered regions or that require post&#8208;translational modifications.







Abstract
mRNA display is a powerful technology to screen libraries of &gt;1012 cyclic peptides against a protein target, enabling the rapid discovery of high affinity ligands. These cyclic peptides are particularly well suited to challenging protein targets that have been difficult to drug with small molecules. However, target choice can still be limited as screens are typically performed against purified proteins which often demands the use of isolated domains and precludes the use of aggregation&#8208;prone targets. Herein, we report a method to perform mRNA display selections in mammalian cell lysates without the need for prior target purification, vastly expanding the potential target scope of mRNA display. We have applied the methodology to identify low to sub&#8208;nanomolar peptide binders for two targets: a NanoLuc subunit (LgBiT) and full&#8208;length bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 3 (BRD3). Our cyclic peptides for BRD3 were found to bind to the extraterminal (ET) domain of BRD3 and the closely related BRD proteins, BRD2 and BRD4. While many chemical probes exist for the bromodomains of BRD proteins, the ET domain is relatively underexplored, making these peptides valuable additions to the BRD toolbox.

         <title>Anodic H2O2 Generation in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes&#8212;Mechanistic Insight from Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local pH measurement reveals that main anion at the interface is HCO3&#8722;, at potentials where H2O2 is preferentially formed, regardless of the bulk electrolyte pH. A Au&#8722;Pt double barrel microelectrode demonstrates that the local HCO3&#8722; concentration is collectively determined by the oxidation current, buffer capacity, and bulk electrolyte pH.







Abstract
For the anodic H2O2 generation, it has been shown that the electrolyte composition can steer the reaction pathway toward increased H2O2 generation. Previous efforts made on composition optimization found that the impact of the molar fraction of carbonate species varies for different anodes, and therefore, controversies remain concerning the reaction pathways as well as the species involved in H2O2 formation. Considering that water oxidation results in the liberation of protons within the anode microenvironment, the corresponding acidification would cause an equilibrium shift between carbonate species, which in turn may modulate the reaction pathway. We determined the changes in the fraction of carbonate species in the vicinity of an anode by performing local pH measurements using a Au nanoelectrode positioned in close proximity to an operating anode by shear&#8208;force scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). It could be confirmed that the main anionic species at the interface is HCO3&#8722;, at potentials where H2O2 is preferentially formed, regardless of the pH value in the bulk. The simultaneous use of a Au&#8722;Pt double barrel microelectrode in generator&#8208;collector SECM measurements demonstrates that the local HCO3&#8722; concentration is collectively determined by the oxidation current, buffer capacity, and bulk pH of the electrolyte.

         <title>Unlocking Fast Potassium Ion Kinetics: High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Potassium Dual&#8208;Ion Battery for Operation at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C</title>

A potassium&#8208;based DIBs with superior cycling stability at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C is established by coupling MXenes anode with PTPAN cathode, in which the co&#8208;intercalation behavior of solvated K+ endows MXenes anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures.







Abstract
Energy storage devices operating at low temperatures are plagued by sluggish kinetics, reduced capacity, and notorious dendritic growth. Herein, novel potassium dual&#8208;ion batteries (PDIBs) capable of superior performance at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, and fabricated by combining MXenes and polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) as the anode and cathode, respectively, are presented. Additionally, the reason for the anomalous kinetics of K+ (faster at low temperature than at room temperature) on the Ti3C2 anode is investigated. Theoretical calculations, crossover experiments, and in situ XRD at room and low temperatures revealed that K+ tends to bind with solvent molecules rather than anions at subzero temperatures, which not only inhibits the participation of PF6&#8722; in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), but also guarantees co&#8208;intercalation behavior and suppresses undesirable K+ storage. The advantageous properties at low temperatures endow the Ti3C2 anode with fast K+ kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures. The PDIBs exhibit superior rate capability and high capacity retention at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, after charging&#8208;discharging for 20,000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, the PDIB retained 86.7&#8201;% of its initial capacity. This study reveals the influence of temperatures on MXenes and offers a unique design for dual&#8208;ion batteries operating at ultralow temperatures.

Theoretical calculations, crossover experiments, and in situ XRD at room and low temperatures revealed that K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tends to bind with solvent molecules rather than anions at subzero temperatures, which not only inhibits the participation of PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), but also guarantees co-intercalation behavior and suppresses undesirable K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage. The advantageous properties at low temperatures endow the Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode with fast K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; kinetics to unlock the outstanding performance of PDIB at ultralow temperatures. The PDIBs exhibit superior rate capability and high capacity retention at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C. Impressively, after charging-discharging for 20,000&#8197;cycles at &#8722;60&#8201;&#176;C, the PDIB retained 86.7&#8201;% of its initial capacity. This study reveals the influence of temperatures on MXenes and offers a unique design for dual-ion batteries operating at ultralow temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aluminum Alkyl Induced Isomerization of Group&#8197;IV meso Metallocene Complexes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methoxy substituents of group&#8197;IV meso metallocene complexes enable their aluminum&#8208;alkyl (TIBA/TMA) promoted isomerization. The meso isomers were previously considered useless and needed to be separated tediously when the rac analogs were employed for the polymerization of propylene. Upon isomerization, the yield of isotactic polypropylene is increased by 400&#8201;%; a mechanism is proposed.







Abstract
The synthesis of group&#8197;IV metallocene precatalysts for the polymerization of propylene generally yields two different isomers: The racemic isomer that produces isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the meso isomer that produces atactic polypropylene (aPP). Due to its poor physical properties, aPP has very limited applications. To avoid obtaining blends of both polymers and thus diminish the mechanical and thermal properties of iPP, the meso metallocene complexes need to be separated from the racemic ones tediously&#8212;rendering the metallocene&#8208;based polymerization of propylene industrially far less attractive than the Ziegler/Natta process. To overcome this issue, we established an isomerization protocol to convert meso metallocene complexes into their racemic counterparts. This protocol increased the yield of iPP by 400&#8201;% while maintaining the polymer's excellent physical properties and was applicable to both hafnocene and zirconocene complexes, as well as different precatalyst activation methods. Through targeted variation of the ligand frameworks, methoxy groups at the indenyl moieties were found to be the structural motifs responsible for an isomerization to take place&#8212;this experimental evidence was confirmed by density functional theory calculations. Liquid injection field desorption ionization mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance studies, allowed the proposal of an isomerization mechanism.

         <title>Unlocking Giant Third&#8208;Order Optical Nonlinearity in (MA)2CuX4 through Introducing Jahn&#8208;Teller Distortion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
(MA)2CuX4 (MA=methylammonium; X=Cl, Br) leads to giant nonlinear absorption coefficients and substantial modulation depth. These performance improvements are correlated with the specific alignment of metal d bands and ligand p band in the Mott&#8208;Hubbard compound, and a larger p&#8208;d transition probability to d&#8208;d transition probability associated with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion.







Abstract
Nonlinear absorption coefficient and modulation depth stand as pivotal properties of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials, while the existing NLO materials exhibit limitations such as low nonlinear absorption coefficients and/or small modulation depths, thereby severely impeding their practical application. Here we unveil that introducing Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion in a Mott&#8208;Hubbard system, (MA)2CuX4 (MA=methylammonium; X=Cl, Br) affords the simultaneous attainment of a giant nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth. The optimized compound, (MA)2CuCl4, demonstrates a nonlinear absorption coefficient of (1.5&#177;0.08)&#215;105&#8197;cm&#8201;GW&#8722;1, a modulation depth of 60&#8201;%, and a relatively low optical limiting threshold of 1.22&#215;10&#8722;5&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;2. These outstanding attributes surpass those of most reported NLO materials. Our investigation reveals that a more pronounced distortion of the [CuX6]4&#8722; octahedron emerges as a crucial factor in augmenting optical nonlinearity. Mechanism study involving structural and spectral characterization along with theoretical calculations indicates a correlation between the compelling performance and the Mott&#8208;Hubbard band structure of the materials, coupled with the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion&#8208;induced d&#8208;d transition. This study not only introduces a promising category of high&#8208;performance NLO materials but also provides novel insights into enhancing the performance of such materials.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Hydrated Eutectic Electrolytes with Diverse Solvation Configurations for All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolytes (HEE) with abundant solvation configurations are proposed for all&#8208;temperature Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The diverse and uniform solvation structures distribution enables the HEE possess much higher solvation configurational entropy than conventional aqueous electrolytes, leading to its superior anti&#8208;freezing ability and high thermal stability.







Abstract
Batteries always encounter uncontrollable failure or performance decay under extreme temperature environments, which is largely limited by the properties of electrolytes. Herein, an entropy&#8208;driven hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) with diverse solvation configurations is proposed to expand the operating temperature range of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The HEE possesses over 40 types of Zn2+ solvation structure with uniform distribution, contributing to its much higher solvation configurational entropy compared to the conventional aqueous counterpart (only 6 types). These effectively promote its anti&#8208;freezing ability under ultralow temperatures, with a high ionic conductivity of 0.42&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 even at a low temperature of &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the entropy&#8208;driven property can simultaneously enhance the thermal stability under a high temperature over +140&#8201;&#176;C. Therefore, the HEE can enable full cells stably working over a wide temperature range of &#8722;40~+80&#8201;&#176;C, performing over 1500 cycles with 100&#8201;% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C and 1000 cycles with ~72&#8201;% capacity retention at +80&#8201;&#176;C. This inspiring concept of entropy&#8208;driven electrolyte with quantized solvation configurational entropy value has charming potential for designing future special batteries with excellent adaptability towards extreme temperature environments.

         <title>piSTING: A Pocket&#8208;Independent Agonist Based on Multivalency&#8208;Driven STING Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate downstream signalling pathways. piSTINGs could serve as novel STING agonists for vaccines and combination therapies. And STING oligomerization is a useful strategy for the development of a new generation of STING agonists.







Abstract
The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a potent therapeutic target for innate immunity. Despite the efforts to develop pocket&#8208;dependent small&#8208;molecule STING agonists that mimic the endogenous STING ligand, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), most of these agonists showed disappointing results in clinical trials owing to the limitations of the STING pocket. In this study, we developed novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate STING. Additionally, a piSTING&#8208;adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant antibody response and inhibited tumour growth in therapeutic models. Moreover, a piSTING&#8208;based vaccine combination with aPD&#8208;1 showed remarkable potential to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In particular, piSTING can strengthen the impact of STING pathway in immunotherapy and accelerate the clinical translation of STING agonists.

Despite the efforts to develop pocket-dependent small-molecule STING agonists that mimic the endogenous STING ligand, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), most of these agonists showed disappointing results in clinical trials owing to the limitations of the STING pocket. In this study, we developed novel pocket-independent STING-activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency-driven oligomerization to activate STING. Additionally, a piSTING-adjuvanted vaccine elicited a significant antibody response and inhibited tumour growth in therapeutic models. Moreover, a piSTING-based vaccine combination with aPD-1 showed remarkable potential to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy. In particular, piSTING can strengthen the impact of STING pathway in immunotherapy and accelerate the clinical translation of STING agonists.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) Coupling via a NiII Aryl Amido Intermediate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical Cross&#8208;Electrophile (XEC) reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides was achieved via an in situ generated NiII aryl amido intermediate. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8211;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8211;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates.







Abstract
Cross&#8208;electrophile coupling (XEC) between aryl halides and alkyl halides is a streamlined approach for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond construction, which is highly valuable in medicinal chemistry. Based on a key NiII aryl amido intermediate, we developed a highly selective and scalable Ni&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical XEC reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and primary and secondary alkyl halides. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies indicate that an amine secondary ligand slows down the oxidative addition process of the Ni&#8208;polypyridine catalyst to the aryl bromide and a NiII aryl amido intermediate is formed in situ during the reaction process. The relatively slow oxidative addition is beneficial for enhancing the selectivity of the XEC reaction. The NiII aryl amido intermediate stabilizes the NiII&#8211;aryl species to prevent the aryl&#8211;aryl homo&#8208;coupling side reactions and acts as a catalyst to activate the alkyl bromide substrates. This electrosynthesis system provides a facile, practical, and scalable platform for the formation of (hetero)aryl&#8211;alkyl bonds using standard Ni catalysts under mild conditions. The mechanistic insights from this work could serve as a great foundation for future studies on Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings.

         <title>Stereodivergent Total Synthesis of Tacaman Alkaloids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetric total synthesis of eight tacaman alkaloids was accomplished. A chemoenzymatic Baeyer&#8211;Villiger reaction was used to produce seven&#8208;membered lactones, establishing a stereogenic center at the C14 position. Acid&#8208;regulated cyclization cascades involving the Pictet&#8211;Spengler reaction afforded cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;fused tetracyclic cores. DFT calculations indicated that the stereochemistry of this cascade was controlled via hydrogen bonding.







Abstract
This paper describes a concise, asymmetric and stereodivergent total synthesis of tacaman alkaloids. A key step in this synthesis is the biocatalytic Baeyer&#8211;Villiger oxidation of cyclohexanone, which was developed to produce seven&#8208;membered lactones and establish the required stereochemistry at the C14 position (92&#8201;% yield, 99&#8201;% ee, 500&#8197;mg scale). Cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;tetracyclic indoloquinolizidine scaffolds were rapidly synthesized through an acid&#8208;triggered, tunable acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler type cyclization cascade, serving as the pivotal reaction for building the alkaloid skeleton. Computational results revealed that hydrogen bonding was crucial in stabilizing intermediates and inducing different addition reactions during the acyl&#8208;Pictet&#8211;Spengler cyclization cascade. By strategically using these two reactions and the late&#8208;stage diversification of the functionalized indoloquinolizidine core, the asymmetric total syntheses of eight tacaman alkaloids were achieved. This study may potentially advance research related to the medicinal chemistry of tacaman alkaloids.

         <title>Discovery of A G&#8208;Quadruplex Unwinder That Unleashes the Translation of G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Containing mRNA without Inducing DNA Damage</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a G4 unwinder, 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3, capable of promoting the unwinding of both DNA and RNA G4 structures. In living cells, 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3 does not induce severe DNA damage at a concentration below 10&#8197;&#956;M, nor does it broadly interfere with G4&#8208;related biological processes. Specially, it can enhance the translation level of G4&#8208;containing mRNA.







Abstract
To explore the mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) mediated diseases, it is crucial to manipulate and intervene in intracellular G4 structures using small molecular tools. While hundreds of G4 stabilizers have been developed, there is a significant gap in the availability of G4 unwinding agents. Here, we propose a strategy to disrupt G&#8208;quadruplexes by forming G&#8722;C hydrogen bonds with chemically modified cytidine trimers. We validated a good G4 unwinder, the 2&#8242;&#8208;F cytidine trimer (2&#8242;&#8208;F C3). 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3 does not inhibit cell growth nor cause severe DNA damage at a concentration below 10&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, 2&#8242;&#8208;F C3 does not affect gene transcription nor RNA splicing, while it significantly enhances the translation of G4&#8208;containing mRNA and upregulates RNA splicing, RNA processing and cell cycle pathways. The discovery of this G4 unwinder provides a functional tool for the chemical modulation of G4s in living cells.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of an Improbable Directly Bonded Phosphorene&#8208;Fullerene Heterodimensional Hybrid toward Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid with fullerene directly bonded onto the surface (basal plane) of phosphorene via P&#8722;C bonds was theoretically predicted &#8220;improbable&#8221; due to the strong repulsion between phosphorene and neutral fullerene.It is now synthesized by an electrosynthesis method involving C602&#8722; dianion as an intermediate generated by electroreduction of C60, significantly improving the stability and visible light/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates of phosphorene.







Abstract
Phosphorene and fullerene are representative two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nanomaterials respectively, constructing their heterodimensional hybrid not only complements their physiochemical properties but also extends their applications via synergistic interactions. This is however challenging because of their diversities in dimension and chemical reactivity, and theoretical studies predicted that it is improbable to directly bond C60 onto the surface of phosphorene due to their strong repulsion. Here, we develop a facile electrosynthesis method to synthesize the first phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid featuring fullerene surface bonding via P&#8722;C bonds. Few&#8208;layer black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) obtained from electrochemical exfoliation react with C602&#8722; dianion prepared by electroreduction of C60, fulfilling formation of the &#8220;improbable&#8221; phosphorene&#8208;fullerene hybrid (BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60). Theoretical results reveal that the energy barrier for formation of [BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60]2&#8722; intermediate is significantly decreased by 1.88&#8197;eV, followed by an oxidization reaction to generate neutral BPNS&#8208;s&#8208;C60 hybrid. Surface bonding of C60 molecules not only improves significantly the ambient stability of BPNSs, but also boosts dramatically the visible light and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates, reaching 1466 and 1039&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 respectively, which are both the highest values among all reported BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free photocatalysts.

Surface bonding of C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; molecules not only improves significantly the ambient stability of BPNSs, but also boosts dramatically the visible light and near-infrared (NIR) photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates, reaching 1466 and 1039&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, which are both the highest values among all reported BP-based metal-free photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exhaled Anesthetic Xenon Regeneration by Gas Separation Using a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Sorbent&#8208;Sorbate Induced&#8208;Fit</title>

CUPMOF&#8208;5, an efficient CO2&#8208;specific adsorbent to be used in a closed&#8208;circuit Xe recovery process, offers a promising solution to Xenon scarcity in medicine. With exceptional molecular sieving capabilities confirmed via SCXRD and simulations, CUPMOF&#8208;5 achieves an outstanding 99.8&#8201;% Xe recovery rate by dynamic breakthrough experiments, making it ideal for online CO2 removal and Xe recovery in anesthetic circuits.







Abstract
Noble gas xenon (Xe) is an excellent anesthetic gas, but its rarity, high cost and constrained production prohibits wide use in medicine. Here, we have developed a closed&#8208;circuit anesthetic Xe recovery and reusage process with highly effective CO2&#8208;specific adsorbent CUPMOF&#8208;5 that is promising to solve the anesthetic Xe supply problem. CUPMOF&#8208;5 possesses spacious cage cavities interconnected in four directions by confinement throat apertures of ~3.4&#8197;&#197;, which makes it an ideal molecular sieving of CO2 from Xe, O2, N2 with the benchmark selectivity and high uptake capacity of CO2. In situ single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and computational simulation solidly revealed the vital sieving role of the confined throat and the sorbent&#8208;sorbate induced&#8208;fit strengthening binding interaction to CO2. CUPMOF&#8208;5 can remove 5&#8201;% CO2 even from actual moist exhaled anesthetic gases, and achieves the highest Xe recovery rate (99.8&#8201;%) so far, as verified by breakthrough experiments. This endows CUPMOF&#8208;5 great potential for the on&#8208;line CO2 removal and Xe recovery from anesthetic closed&#8208;circuits.

         <title>Fully Fused Indacenodithiophene&#8208;Centered Small&#8208;Molecule n&#8208;Type Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featured with fully fused structure has been synthesized by a newly developed strategy to generate high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic solar cells. The properties of these new organic semiconductors were systematically investigated and elucidated experimentally.







Abstract
Developing novel n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is an on&#8208;going research endeavour, given their pivotal roles in organic electronics and their relative scarcity compared to p&#8208;type counterparts. In this study, a new strategy was employed to synthesize n&#8208;type organic semiconductors featuring a fully fused conjugated backbone. By attaching two sets of adjacent amino and formyl groups to the indacenodithiophene&#8208;based central cores and triggering a tandem reaction sequence of a Knoevenagel condensation&#8208;intramolecular cyclization, DFA1 and DFA2 were realized. The solution&#8208;processed organic field effect transistors based on DFA1 exhibited unipolar n&#8208;type transport character with a decent electron mobility of ca. 0.10&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 (ca. 0.038&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for DFA2 based devices). When employing DFA1 as a third component in organic solar cells, a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2&#8201;% can be achieved in ternary devices fabricated with PM6&#8201;:&#8201;L8&#8208;BO&#8201;:&#8201;DFA1. This work provides a new pathway in the molecular engineering of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, propelling relevant research forward.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Streptamidine and Klebsazolicin Using Biomimetic On&#8208;Resin Ring&#8208;Closing Amidine Formation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile on&#8208;resin ring&#8208;closing amidine formation method was developed to synthesize peptides bearing diketopiperazine derived cyclic amidine structure at the N&#8208;terminus. Natural products streptamidine and klebsazolicin as well as analogues were synthesized by using this method.







Abstract
Diketopiperazine (DKP) derived cyclic amidine structures widely exist in peptide natural products according to the genome mining result. The largely unknown bioactivity and mode of action are partially caused by the poor availability of the compounds via microbiological and chemical approaches. To tackle this challenge, in this work, we have developed the on&#8208;resin ring&#8208;closing amidine formation strategy to synthesize peptides containing N&#8208;terminal DKP derived cyclic amidine structure, in which the 6&#8208;exo&#8208;trig cyclization mediated by HgCl2 activation of thioamides was the key step. Leveraging from this new strategy, we finished the total syntheses of streptamidine and klebsazolicin. Meanwhile, eleven klebsazolicin analogues were synthesized for its structure&#8211;activity relationship study.

         <title>Carbon Superstructure&#8208;Supported Half&#8208;Metallic V2O3 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Efficiency Photorechargeable Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Half&#8208;metallic V2O3 was firstly reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZlBs. The half&#8208;metallic V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photo cathode delivered record zinc ion storage and photo rechargeable properties. This study offered a promising direction for the capture and storage of solar energy.







Abstract
Photorechargeable zinc ion batteries (PZIBs), which can directly harvest and store solar energy, are promising technologies for the development of a renewable energy society. However, the incompatibility requirement between narrow band gap and wide coverage has raised severe challenges for high&#8208;efficiency dual&#8208;functional photocathodes. Herein, half&#8208;metallic vanadium (III) oxide (V2O3) was first reported as a dual&#8208;functional photocathode for PZIBs. Theoretical and experimental results revealed its unique photoelectrical and zinc ion storage properties for capturing and storing solar energy. To this end, a synergistic protective etching strategy was developed to construct carbon superstructure&#8208;supported V2O3 nanospheres (V2O3@CSs). The half&#8208;metallic characteristics of V2O3, combined with the three&#8208;dimensional superstructure assembled by ultrathin carbon nanosheets, established rapid charge transfer networks and robust framework for efficient and stable solar&#8208;energy storage. Consequently, the V2O3@CSs photocathode delivered record zinc ion storage properties, including a photo&#8208;assisted discharge capacities of 463&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term cycling stability over 3000&#8197;cycles. Notably, the PZIBs assembled using V2O3@CSs photocathodes could be photorecharged without an external circuit, exhibiting a high photo conversion efficiency (0.354&#8201;%) and photorecharge voltage (1.0&#8197;V). This study offered a promising direction for the direct capture and storage of solar energy.

Consequently, the V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CSs photocathode delivered record zinc ion storage properties, including a photo-assisted discharge capacities of 463&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2.0&#8197;A&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and long-term cycling stability over 3000&#8197;cycles. Notably, the PZIBs assembled using V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@CSs photocathodes could be photorecharged without an external circuit, exhibiting a high photo conversion efficiency (0.354&#8201;%) and photorecharge voltage (1.0&#8197;V). This study offered a promising direction for the direct capture and storage of solar energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Accelerated Growth of Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Layer&#8208;Stacking</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we devised a novel approach termed &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; to fabricate seven staggered stacking Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs). This method leverages ionic liquids as both solvents and mediators, operating under mild conditions. Through meticulous selection, ionic liquids possessing appropriate molecular volumes and symmetric bipolar functional groups were identified as pivotal elements in manifesting the confined interlocking effect and steric hindrance essential for the synthesis of staggered stacking COFs.







Abstract
Layer&#8208;stacking behaviors are crucial for two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) to define their pore structure, physicochemical properties, and functional output. So far, fine control over the stacking mode without complex procedures remains a grand challenge. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;key&#8208;cylinder lock mimic&#8221; strategy to synthesize 2D COFs with a tunable layer&#8208;stacking mode by taking advantage of ionic liquids (ILs). The staggered (AB) stacking (unlocked) COFs were exclusively obtained by incorporating ILs of symmetric polarity and matching molecular size; otherwise, commonly reported eclipsed (AA) stacking (locked) COFs were observed instead. Mechanistic study revealed that AB stacking was induced by a confined interlocking effect (CIE) brought by anions and bulky cations of the ILs inside pores (&#8220;key&#8221; and &#8220;cylinder&#8221;, respectively). Excitingly, this strategy can speed up production rate of crystalline powders (e.g., COF&#8208;TAPT&#8208;Tf@BmimTf2N in merely 30 minutes) under mild reaction conditions. This work highlights the enabling role of ILs to tailor the layer stacking of 2D COFs and promotes further exploration of their stacking mode&#8208;dependant applications.

         <title>Remarkable Second Harmonic Generation Response in (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722;: Unraveling the Role of Hydrogen Bond in Thermal Driven Nonlinear Optical Switch</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a novel material (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722; (4HPMS), exhibiting the strongest second harmonic generation (SHG) intensity among all heat&#8208;stimulated nonlinear optical (NLO) switches. We unravel an unprecedently easier breaking of the shorter hydrogen bond and a rare large thermal hysteresis of 50&#8201;&#176;C during the reversible structural phase transition.







Abstract
Heat&#8208;activated second harmonic generation (SHG) switching materials are gaining interest for their ability to switch between SHG on and off states, offering potential in optoelectronic applications. The novel nonlinear optical (NLO) switch, (C5H6NO)+(CH3SO3)&#8722; (4&#8208;hydroxypyridinium methylsulfonate, 4HPMS), is a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermal driven material with a strong SHG response (3.3 &#215; KDP), making it one of the most potent heat&#8208;stimulated NLO switches. It offers excellent contrast of 13 and a high laser&#8208;induced damage threshold (2.5 &#215; KDP), with reversibility &gt; 5&#8197;cycles. At 73&#8201;&#176;C, 4HPMS transitions from the noncentrosymmetric Pna21 room temperature phase (RTP) to the centrosymmetric P21/c phase, caused by the rotation of the (C5H6NO)+ and (CH3SO3)&#8722; due to partially thermal breaking of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The reverse phase change exhibits a large 50&#8201;&#176;C thermal hysteresis. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that (C5H6NO)+ primarily dictates both the SHG coefficient (dij) and birefringence (&#9653;n(Zeiss) = 0.216 vs &#9653;n(cal.) = 0.202 at 546&#8197;nm; &#916;n(Immersion) = 0.210 vs &#9653;n(cal.) = 0.198 at 589.3&#8197;nm), while the band gap (Eg) is influenced synergistically by (C5H6NO)+ and (CH3SO3)&#8722;. Additionally, 4HPMS&#8208;RTP also exhibits mechanochromism upon grinding as well as an aggregation&#8208;enhanced emission in a mixture of acetone and water.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Synthesis of Non&#8208;Covalent Crosslinkers while Folding Single&#8208;Chain Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic combinatorial macrocyclic disulfides acted as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers, adapting to polymer folding. Initially, small macrocycles fold the polymer into a loose state, which then catalysed the formation of larger macrocycles to enhance folding efficiency. Our work deepens the understanding of interplay between adaptive synthesis and dynamic folding, advancing the strategy for replicating protein folding into functional nanoparticles.







Abstract
Peptide folding is a dynamic process driven by non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;linking leading to functional nanostructures for essential biochemical activities. However, replicating this process in synthetic systems is challenging due to the difficulty in mimicking nature&#8216;s real&#8208;time regulation of non&#8208;covalent crosslinking for single&#8208;chain polymer folding. Here, we address this by employing anionic dithiol building blocks to create macrocyclic disulfides as non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers that adapted to the folding process. Initially, small macrocycles facilitated a low degree folding of a polycation. Then, this preorganized structure catalysed the production of larger macrocycles that enhanced the folding conversely. The self&#8208;adaptive synthesis was verified through the encapsulation of an anticancer drug, showing an updated production distribution of non&#8208;covalent crosslinkers and maximizing drug&#8208;loading efficiency against drug&#8208;resistant cancer in vitro. Our research advances the understanding of molecular systems by exploring species evolution via the structural dynamics of polymer folding. Additionally, adaptive synthesis enables controlled, sequential folding of synthetic polymers, with the potential to mimic protein functions.

         <title>Linearly Arranged Multi&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Stacked Structure for Efficient Through&#8208;Space Charge&#8208;Transfer Emitters</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer materials excel in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, with &#960;&#8208;stacked structures being effective frameworks, but the lack of robust construction methods hinders progress. Double C&#8722;H activation has now been used to construct two donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D|A|D) type through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer materials derived from C11&#8208;substituted indenofluorene skeletons, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 28.6&#8201;% and 16.2&#8201;% achieved.







Abstract
Noncovalent spatial interaction has become an intriguing and important tool for constructing optoelectronic molecules. In this study, we linearly attached three conjugated units in a multi &#960;&#8208;stacked manner by using just one trident bridge based on indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene. To achieve this structure, we improved the synthetic approach through double C&#8722;H activation, significantly simplifying the preparation process. Due to the proximity of the C10, C11, and C12 sites in indeno[2,1&#8208;b]fluorene, we derived two novel donor|acceptor|donor (D|A|D) type molecules, 2DMB and 2DMFB, which exhibited closely packed intramolecular stacking, enabling efficient through&#8208;space charge transfer. This molecular construction is particularly suitable for developing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials.

&lt;p&gt;Through-space charge-transfer materials excel in organic light-emitting diodes, with &#960;-stacked structures being effective frameworks, but the lack of robust construction methods hinders progress. Double C&#8722;H activation has now been used to construct two donor-acceptor-donor (D|A|D) type through-space charge-transfer materials derived from C11-substituted indenofluorene skeletons, with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 28.6&#8201;% and 16.2&#8201;% achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noncovalent spatial interaction has become an intriguing and important tool for constructing optoelectronic molecules. In this study, we linearly attached three conjugated units in a multi &#960;-stacked manner by using just one trident bridge based on indeno[2,1-b]fluorene. To achieve this structure, we improved the synthetic approach through double C&#8722;H activation, significantly simplifying the preparation process. Due to the proximity of the C10, C11, and C12 sites in indeno[2,1-b]fluorene, we derived two novel donor|acceptor|donor (D|A|D) type molecules, &lt;b&gt;2DMB&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2DMFB&lt;/b&gt;, which exhibited closely packed intramolecular stacking, enabling efficient through-space charge transfer. This molecular construction is particularly suitable for developing high-performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. With donor(s) and acceptor(s) constrained and separated within this spatially rigid structure, elevated radiative transition rates, and high photoluminescence quantum yields were achieved. Organic light-emitting diodes incorporating &lt;b&gt;2DMB&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2DMFB&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated superior efficiency, achieving maximum external quantum efficiencies of 28.6&#8201;% and 16.2&#8201;%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full Selectivity Control over the Catalytic Hydrogenation of Nitroaromatics Into Six Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single catalytic system has been developed for the production of six products, namely nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo and aniline compounds, from nitroaromatics. Furthermore, a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics has been constructed based on systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities via oxygen&#8208;isolated characterisation techniques.







Abstract
A full selectivity control over the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics leads to the production of six possible products, i.e., nitroso, hydroxylamine, azoxy, azo, hydrazo or aniline compounds, which has however not been achieved in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Currently, there is no sufficient evidence to support that the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics with the use of heterogeneous metal catalysts would follow the Haber's mechanistic scheme based on electrochemical reduction. We now demonstrate in this work that it is possible to fully control the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics into their all six products using a single catalytic system under various conditions. Employing SnO2&#8208;supported Pt nanoparticles facilitated by the surface coordination of ethylenediamine and vanadium species enabled this unprecedented selectivity control. Through systematic investigation into the controlled production of all products and their chemical reactivities, we have constructed a detailed reaction network for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Crucially, using oxygen&#8208;isolated characterization techniques is essential for identifying unstable compounds such as nitroso, hydroxylamine, hydrazo compounds. The insights gained from this research offer invaluable guidance for selectively transforming nitroaromatics into a wide array of functional N&#8208;containing compounds, both advancing fundamental understanding and fostering practical applications in various fields.

         <title>Paired Electrolysis Enables Reductive Heck Coupling of Unactivated (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of aryl radicals generated at a carbon cathode from (hetero)aryl halides and protons generated at a carbon anode from H&#252;nig's base enables the efficient anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroarylation of olefins via a paired electrolysis pathway.







Abstract
The formation of carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8722;C) bonds is a cornerstone of organic synthesis. Among various methods to construct Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds, the reductive Heck reaction between (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes stands out due to its potential efficiency and broad substrate availability. However, traditional reductive Heck reactions are limited by the use of precious metal catalysts and/or limited aryl halide and alkene compatibility. Here, we present an electrochemically mediated, metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free reductive Heck reaction that tolerates both unactivated (hetero)aryl halides and diverse alkenes such as vinyl boronates and silanes. Detailed electrochemical and deuterium&#8208;labeling studies support that this transformation likely proceeds through a paired electrolysis pathway, in which acid generated by the oxidation of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) at the anode intercepts an alkyl carbanion formed after radical&#8208;polar crossover at the cathode. As such, this approach offers a sustainable method for the construction of Csp2&#8722;Csp3 bonds from (hetero)aryl halides and alkenes, paving the way for the development of other electrochemically mediated olefin difunctionalization reactions.

         <title>Asynchronous Ring Opening of Cyclic Carbonate and Glycidyl Ether Induced Phase Evolution Towards Heat&#8208;Free and Rapid&#8208;Bonding Superior Epoxy Adhesive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly&#8208;branched polyurethane capped by cyclic carbonate was reported to perform asynchronous crosslinking with epoxy. The distinctive ring opening kinetics between the cyclic carbonate and epoxide groups, combined with a moderate branching degree, result in unique phase evolution. This process effectively toughens the adhesive and rapidly increases shear strength at room temperature to a level suitable for structural bonding.







Abstract
Structural adhesives that do not require heating are in high demand in the automotive and electronics industries. However, it remains a challenge to develop robust adhesives that rapidly achieve super adhesion near ambient temperature. Herein, a room&#8208;temperature curable, fast&#8208;bonding, and super strong epoxy&#8208;based structural adhesive was designed from the perspective of cross&#8208;scale structure, which lies in threefold pivotal aspects: (i) high branching topology of glycerol carbonate&#8208;capped polyurethane (PUGC) increases the kinetics of the ring&#8208;opening reaction, contributing to fast crosslinking and the formation of abundant urethane and hydroxyl moieties; (ii) asynchronous crosslinking of epoxy and PUGC synergistically induces phase separation of PUGC within the epoxy resin and the resulting PUGC domains surrounded by interpenetrated shell serves to efficiently toughen the matrix; (iii) abundant dynamic hydrogen bonds including urethane and hydroxyl moieties, along with the elastomeric PUGC domains, dissipate energy of shearing force. As a result, the adhesive strength rapidly grows to 16&#8197;MPa within 4&#8197;hours, leveling off to 21&#8197;MPa after 7&#8197;hours, substantially outperforming commercial room&#8208;temperature curable epoxy adhesives. The results of this study could advance the field of high&#8208;performance adhesives and provide valuable insights into designing materials for efficient curing at room temperature.

         <title>Confining Conversion Chemistry in Intercalation Host for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confining conversion chemistry in intercalation host enables an integrated anode structure of iron oxide/hydroxide&#8208;pillared titanate. The iron&#8208;based conversion reaction is spatially and kinetically confined within sub&#8208;nano interlayer of titanate, achieving long cycle life, fast kinetics, and universal generality to the electrolyte medium. Two unique types of full batteries are further assembled, exhibiting low redox polarization and long cycling stability.







Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type anode materials with high theoretical capacities play a pivotal role in developing future aqueous rechargeable batteries (ARBs). However, their sustainable applications have long been impeded by the poor cycling stability and sluggish redox kinetics. Here we show that confining conversion chemistry in intercalation host could overcome the above challenges. Using sodium titanates as a model intercalation host, an integrated layered anode material of iron oxide hydroxide&#8208;pillared titanate (FeNTO) is demonstrated. The conversion reaction is spatially and kinetically confined within sub&#8208;nano interlayer, enabling superlow redox polarization (ca. 4&#8211;6&#8197;times reduced), ultralong lifespan (up to 8700&#8197;cycles) and excellent rate performance. Notably, the charge compensation of interlayer via universal cation intercalation into host endows FeNTO with the capability of operating well in a broad range of aqueous electrolytes (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, etc.). We further demonstrate the large&#8208;scale synthesis of FeNTO thin film and powder, and rational design of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state high&#8208;voltage ARB pouch cells powering wearable electronics against extreme mechanical abuse. This work demonstrates a powerful confinement means to access disruptive electrode materials for next&#8208;generation energy devices.

         <title>Coordination Desymmetrization of Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that asymmetric coordination of single&#8208;atom copper catalysts can greatly enhance the efficiency and stability of NO3RR catalysis, which attributes to the accumulation of NO3&#8722; on the surface and the reduction of the energy barrier regarding the formation of the key reaction intermediate.







Abstract
Coordination engineering strategy for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) has been rapidly developed over the last decade. However, previous reports on copper SACs for nitrate reduction reactions (NO3RR) have mostly focused on symmetric coordination configurations such as Cu&#8208;N4 and Cu&#8208;N3. In addition, the mechanism in terms of the regulation of coordination environment and catalytic properties of SACs has not been well demonstrated. Herein, we disrupted the local symmetric structure of copper atoms by introducing unsaturated heteroatomic coordination of Cu&#8722;O and Cu&#8722;N to achieve the coordination desymmetrization of Cu&#8208;N1O2 SACs. The Cu&#8208;N1O2 SACs exhibit an efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with a high FE of ~96.5&#8201;% and a yield rate of 3120&#8197;&#956;g NH3 h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.60&#8197;V vs RHE. As indicated by in situ Raman spectra, the catalysts facilitate the accumulation of NO3&#8722; and the selective adsorption of *NO2, which were further confirmed by the theoretical study of surface dipole moment and orbital hybridization. Our work illustrated the correlation between the coordination desymmetrization and the catalytic performance of copper SACs for NO3RR.

         <title>Unexpected Elevated Working Voltage by Na+/Vacancy Ordering and Stabilized Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage by Transition&#8208;Metal Honeycomb Ordering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material featuring dual&#8208;site ordering superstructures is prepared by simply regulating the calcination time, where the optimized Na+/vacancy ordering significantly elevates the operating voltage and the transition&#8208;metal honeycomb ordering effectively stabilizes the structure, leading to the increased energy density and high cycling stability in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Na+/vacancy ordering in sodium&#8208;ion layered oxide cathodes is widely believed to deteriorate the structural stability and retard the Na+ diffusion kinetics, but its unexplored potential advantages remain elusive. Herein, we prepared a P2&#8208;Na0.8Cu0.22Li0.08Mn0.67O2 (NCLMO&#8208;12&#8197;h) material featuring moderate Na+/vacancy and transition&#8208;metal (TM) honeycomb orderings. The appropriate Na+/vacancy ordering significantly enhances the operating voltage and the TM honeycomb ordering effectively strengthens the layered framework. Compared with the disordered material, the well&#8208;balanced dual&#8208;ordering NCLMO&#8208;12&#8197;h cathode affords a boosted working voltage from 2.85 to 3.51&#8197;V, a remarkable ~20&#8201;% enhancement in energy density, and a superior cycling stability (capacity retention of 86.5&#8201;% after 500&#8197;cycles). The solid&#8208;solution reaction with a nearly &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; character, the charge compensation mechanisms, and the reversible inter&#8208;layer Li migration upon sodiation/desodiation are unraveled by systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations. This study breaks the stereotype surrounding Na+/vacancy ordering and provides a new avenue for developing high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;durability sodium layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Crystalline Porous Organic Cage Membranes Constructed Using Fortified Intermolecular Interactions for Molecular Sieving</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imine&#8208;linked crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage (POC) membranes were constructed via interfacial polymerization at room temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions for molecular sieving. The crystalline POC membranes were fabricated by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Among the various types of materials with intrinsic porosity, porous organic cages (POCs) are distinctive as discrete molecules that possess intrinsic cavities and extrinsic channels capable of facilitating molecular sieving. However, the fabrication of POC membranes remains highly challenging due to the weak noncovalent intermolecular interactions and most reported POCs are powders. In this study, we constructed crystalline free&#8208;standing porous organic cage membranes by fortifying intermolecular interactions through the induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which was confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To elucidate the driving forces behind, a series of terephthaldehyde building blocks containing different substitutions were reacted with flexible triamine under different conditions via interfacial polymerization (IP). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that intramolecular hydrogen bonding can significantly boost the intermolecular interactions. The resulting membranes exhibited fast solvent permeance and high rejection of dyes not only in water, but also in organic solvents. In addition, the membrane demonstrated excellent performance in precise molecular sieving in organic solvents. This work opens an avenue to designing and fabricating free&#8208;standing membranes composed of porous organic materials for efficient molecular sieving.

         <title>Tandem Proton Transfer in Carboxylated Supramolecular Polymer for Highly Efficient Overall Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carboxyl&#8208;enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid&#8212;PTCA) has been elaborately prepared. The efficient tandem proton transfer process remarkably facilitates 2e&#8722; ORR to synthesize H2O2 and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&#8722; WOR to evolve O2. As expected, the catalyst realizes outstanding H2O2 yield in air and even argon atmospheres without any sacrificial reagents.







Abstract
Proton supply is as critical as O2 activation for artificial photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR). However, proton release via water dissociation is frequently hindered because of the sluggish water oxidation reaction (WOR), extremely limiting the efficiency of photocatalytic H2O2 production. To tackle this challenge, carboxyl&#8208;enriched supramolecular polymer (perylene tetracarboxylic acid&#8212;PTCA) is elaborately prepared by molecular self&#8208;assembly for overall photosynthesis of H2O2. Interestingly, the interconversion between carboxyl as Br&#248;nsted acid and its conjugated base realizes rapid proton circulation. Through this efficient tandem proton transfer process, the spatial effect of photocatalytic reduction and oxidation reaction is greatly enhanced with reduced reaction barrier. This significantly facilitates 2e&#8722; photocatalytic ORR to synthesize H2O2 and in the meanwhile promotes 4e&#8722; photocatalytic WOR to evolve O2. Consequently, the as&#8208;developed PTCA exhibits a remarkable H2O2 yield of 185.6&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1 in pure water and air atmosphere under visible light illumination. More impressively, an appreciable H2O2 yield of 78.6&#8197;&#956;M&#8201;h&#8722;1 can be well maintained in an anaerobic system owing to in situ O2 generation by 4e&#8722; photocatalytic WOR. Our study presents a novel concept for artificial photosynthesis of H2O2 via constructing efficient proton transfer pathway to enable rapid proton circulation.

         <title>A Stable Site&#8208;Isolated Mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rhodium Catalyst on a Metal&#8208;Organic Layer for Highly Efficient Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a highly efficient and reusable metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) catalyst is described. The stable site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;rhodium complex on the MOL exhibits high catalytic efficiency in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes and the reduction of nitriles to primary amines with turnover numbers of up to 390000 due to the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of catalytic active sites.







Abstract
Phosphine&#8208;ligated transition metal complexes play a pivotal role in modern catalysis, but our understanding of the impact of ligand counts on the catalysis performance of the metal center is limited. Here we report the synthesis of a low&#8208;coordinate mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh catalyst on a metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL), P&#8208;MOL&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;Rh, and its applications in the hydrogenation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and tri&#8208;substituted alkenes as well as aryl nitriles with turnover numbers (TONs) of up to 390000. Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory calculations revealed the lowering of reaction energy barriers by the low steric hindrance of site&#8208;isolated mono(phosphine)&#8208;Rh sites on the MOL to provide superior catalytic activity over homogeneous Rh catalysts. The MOL also prevents catalyst deactivation to enable recycle and reuse of P&#8208;MOL&#8201;&#8226;&#8201;Rh in catalytic hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Cage Framework with High Selectivity and Reversibility in Fullerene Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal porous frameworks were constructed from shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage building blocks and unambiguously characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The resulting framework showed a high fullerene binding capacity, fast binding kinetics, and a high C60/C70 binding selectivity. The host&#8211;guest binding interaction can be turned on and off by treatment with weak acid/base, which enabled the high&#8208;efficiency flow&#8208;separation of fullerene mixtures.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest chemistry, a pivotal branch of supramolecular chemistry, plays an essential role in understanding and constructing complex structures through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Organic molecular cages, characterized by their intrinsic confined cavities, can selectively bind a variety of guest molecules. Their host&#8211;guest chemistry has been well studied in the solution phase, and several attempts have been made to encode well&#8208;defined molecular architectures into solid&#8208;state polymeric materials. However, only limited studies have explored their potential in the solid state, where their lack of robustness and less ordered networks significantly hinder practical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a single&#8208;crystal cage framework and a systematic study of its host&#8211;guest chemistry, spanning from the solution state to the solid state. Our studies reveal that the host&#8211;guest interactions inherent to the cage are successfully maintained in the solid&#8208;state polymeric material. Furthermore, the framework's robustness allows for the guest molecules (fullerene) to be released triggered by an organic acid (trifluoroacetic acid), with subsequent regeneration of the framework through an organic base (triethylamine) treatment. Our findings represent the first synthesis of a robust, single&#8208;crystal cage framework exhibiting highly selective and reversible host&#8211;guest chemistry, thus showing great potential towards molecular separation application.

         <title>In Situ Analysis of Interfacial Morphological and Chemical Evolution in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using complementary in situ characterizations including atomic force microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we directly detected morphological/chemical evolution, Li plating/stripping processes and SEI dynamics in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Furthermore, Li&#8208;ion field distribution at the interface between different solid&#8208;state electrolytes was successfully visualized by Kelvin probe force microscopy.







Abstract
In situ analysis of Li plating/stripping processes and evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are critical for optimizing all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries (ASSLMB). However, the buried solid&#8208;solid interfaces present a challenge for detection which preclude the employment of multiple analysis techniques. Herein, by employing complementary in situ characterizations, morphological/chemical evolution, Li plating/stripping dynamics and SEI dynamics were directly detected. As a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting interface, Li|Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) performed distinct interfacial morphological/chemical evolution and dynamics from ionic&#8208;conducting/electronic&#8208;isolating interface like Li|Li3PS4 (LPS), which were revealed by combination of in situ atomic force microscopy and in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Though Li plating speed in LGPS was higher than LPS, speed of SSE decomposition was similar and ~85&#8201;% interfacial SSE turned into SEI during plating and remained unchanged in stripping. To leverage strengths of different SSEs, an LPS&#8208;LGPS&#8208;LPS sandwich electrolyte was developed, demonstrating enhanced ionic conductivity and improved interfacial stability with less SSE decomposition (25&#8201;%). Using in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, Li&#8208;ion behavior at interface between different SSEs was effectively visualized, uncovering distribution of Li ions at LGPS|LPS interface under different potentials.

This study unveils novel intramolecular HAT reactions that produce azetidine, oxetane, and indoline derivatives. Facilitated by excited triplet&#8208;state carbon&#8208;centered biradicals, this process enables the 1,5&#8208;HAT reaction by suppressing the Norrish Type II cleavage reaction. It also pioneers unprecedented 1,6&#8208;HAT reactions initiated by excited triplet&#8208;state alkenes. Comprehensive experiments and DFT calculations support all findings.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction that efficiently yields azetidine, oxetane, and indoline derivatives through a mechanism resembling the carbon analogue of the Norrish&#8208;Yang reaction. This process is facilitated by excited triplet&#8208;state carbon&#8208;centered biradicals, enabling the 1,5&#8208;HAT reaction by suppressing the critical 1,4&#8208;biradical intermediates from undergoing the Norrish Type II cleavage reaction, and pioneering unprecedented 1,6&#8208;HAT reactions initiated by excited triplet&#8208;state alkenes. We demonstrate the synthetic utility and compatibility of this method across various functional groups, validated through scope evaluation, large&#8208;scale synthesis, and derivatization. Our findings are supported by control experiments, deuterium labeling, kinetic studies, cyclic voltammetry, Stern&#8211;Volmer experiments, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>The Use of Photocycloaddition Reactions to Drive Mechanical Motions Resembling Humanoid Movements</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline molecular material with olefinic groups has been used to achieve photomechanical motion in both single crystals and single&#8208;crystal composite films. This dimerization of dipyridyl ligands by [2+2] photocycloaddition introduces strain within the crystal, resulting in a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical including reversible bending and curling, movements that resemble a human performing various gymnastic exercises.

With the aim of producing a photomechanical material for incorporation in soft microrobots, a one&#8208;dimensional diene coordination polymer (CP) [Cd(F&#8208;bpeb)(3&#8208;CBA)2]n (CP1, F&#8208;bpeb=4,4&#8242;&#8208;((1E,1&#8242;E)&#8208;(2,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene)bis(ethene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl))dipyridine, 3&#8208;HCBA=3&#8208;chlorobenzoic acid) was synthesized and characterized. Irradiation of CP1 with ultraviolet (UV) or visible light causes [2+2] photocycloaddition reactions resulting in the introduction of crystal strain which triggers various types of crystal movements. Composite films of CP1&#8208;PVA (SC) fabricated by dispersing CP1 crystals into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution allow amplification of the crystal movement so that the film strips exhibit fast and flexible curling upon photoirradiation. The composite films may be cut into long rectangular strips and folded to simulate soft microrobots which exhibit a variety of fast, flexible and continuous photomechanical movements resembling a human performing various gymnastic exercises.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Diamond: A Diamondoid Superstructure Driven by &#960;&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We created a 3D diamondoid superstructure called &#960;&#8208;Diamond using a strained Z&#8208;shaped building block with a porphyrin unit and two m&#8208;xylylene units. It resembles diamond's structure and is driven purely by &#960;&#8208;interactions. Hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking assembles four building blocks into an extendable double&#8208;walled tetrahedron, forming an adamantane unit and the diamondoid superstructure.







Abstract
Modulating the arrangement of superstructures through noncovalent interactions has a significant impact on macroscopic shape and the expression of unique properties. Constructing &#960;&#8208;interaction&#8208;driven hierarchical three&#8208;dimensional (3D) superstructures poses challenges on account of limited directional control and weak intermolecular interactions. Here we report the construction of a 3D diamondoid superstructure, named &#960;&#8208;Diamond, employing a ditopic strained Z&#8208;shaped building block comprising a porphyrin unit as bow&#8208;limb double&#8208;strapped with two m&#8208;xylylene units as bowstrings. This superstructure, reminiscent of diamond's tetrahedral carbon composition, is composed of double&#8208;walled tetrahedron (DWT) driven solely by &#960;&#8208;interactions. Hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking interactions between porphyrin and m&#8208;xylylene panels drive the assembly of four building blocks predominantly into a DWT, which undergoes extension to create an adamantane unit and eventually a diamondoid superstructure wherein each porphyrin panel is shared by two neighboring tetrahedra through hetero&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking. &#960;&#8208;Diamond exhibits a solid&#8208;state fluorescent quantum yield 44 times higher than that of tetraphenylporphyrin along with excellent photocatalytic performance. The precise 3D directionality of &#960;&#8208;interactions, achieved through strained multipanel building blocks, revolutionizes the assembly of hierarchical 3D superstructures driven by &#960;&#8208;interactions.

         <title>Lattice Strain Engineering Boosts CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>

A strategy for preparing Cu catalyst with varying lattice tensile strain but without introducing additional components was proposed and confirmed to be effectively for inhibiting the dipole&#8211;dipole repulsion between *CO species and enhancing the adsorption of the *OH species, simultaneously. The CuTPA catalyst with large tensile strain achieves a high FEC2+ of 90.9&#8201;% and a partial current density of 486.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in CO2RR with excellent stability.







Abstract
Regulating the binding effect between the surface of an electrode material and reaction intermediates is essential in highly efficient CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to produce high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) compounds. Theoretical study reveals that lattice tensile strain in single&#8208;component Cu catalysts can reduce the dipole&#8211;dipole repulsion between *CO intermediates and promotes *OH adsorption, and the high *CO and *OH coverage decreases the energy barrier for C&#8722;C coupling. In this work, Cu catalysts with varying lattice tensile strain were fabricated by electro&#8208;reducing CuO precursors with different crystallinity, without adding any extra components. The as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;component Cu catalysts were used for CO2 electro&#8208;reduction, and it is discovered that the lattice tensile strain in Cu could enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products effectively. Especially, the as&#8208;prepared CuTPA catalyst with high lattice tensile strain achieves a FEC2+ of 90.9&#8201;% at &#8722;1.25&#8197;V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 486.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

The regional functionalization molecular design strategy that enables independent control of distinct pivotal parameters through distinct segments of the molecule. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecule A&#8208;DBN has not only attained a minimal FWHM of 14&#8197;nm but has also realized nearly 100&#8201;% photoluminescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Herein, we propose a regional functionalization molecular design strategy that enables independent control of distinct pivotal parameters through different molecule segments. Three novel multiple resonances thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN, have been successfully synthesized by integrating highly rigid and three&#8208;dimensional adamantane&#8208;containing spirofluorene units into the MR framework. These molecules form two distinctive functional parts: part&#8197;1 comprises a boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN)&#8208;MR framework with adjacent benzene and fluorene units forming a central luminescent core characterized by an exceptionally rigid planar geometry, allowing for narrow FWHM values; part&#8197;2 includes peripheral mesitylene, benzene, and adamantyl groups, creating a unique three&#8208;dimensional &#8220;umbrella&#8208;like&#8221; conformation to mitigate intermolecular interactions and suppress exciton annihilation. The resulting A&#8208;BN, DA&#8208;BN, and A&#8208;DBN exhibit remarkably narrow FWHM values ranging from 18 to 14&#8197;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields. Particularly, OLEDs based on DA&#8208;BN and A&#8208;DBN demonstrate outstanding efficiencies of 35.0&#8201;% and 34.3&#8201;%, with FWHM values as low as 22&#8197;nm and 25&#8197;nm, respectively, effectively accomplishing the integration of high color purity and high device performance.

         <title>Ribosome&#8208;Free Translation up to Pentapeptides via Template Walk on RNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ribosome&#8208;free translation of an RNA sequence to a pentapeptide has been achieved in the absence of any enzyme or ribozyme. Fidelity was demonstrated for each translation step. Our results show how efficient an early, primitive form of encoded synthesis can be.







Abstract
The origin of translation is one of the most difficult problems of molecular evolution. Identifying molecular systems that translate an RNA sequence into a peptide sequence in the absence of ribosomes and enzymes is a challenge. Recently, single&#8208;nucleotide translation via coupling of 5&#8242; phosphoramidate&#8208;linked amino acids to 2&#8242;/3&#8242;&#8208;aminoacyl transfer&#8208;NMPs, as directed by the sequence of an RNA template, was demonstrated for three of the four canonical nucleotides. How single&#8208;nucleotide translation could be expanded to include all four bases and to produce longer peptides without translocation along the template strand remained unclear. Using transfer strands of increasing length containing any of the four bases that interrogate adjacent positions along the template, we now show that pentapeptides can be produced in coupling reactions and subsequent hydrolytic release in situ.

     alt="Ribosome-Free Translation up to Pentapeptides via Template Walk on RNA Sequences"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribosome-free translation of an RNA sequence to a pentapeptide has been achieved in the absence of any enzyme or ribozyme. Fidelity was demonstrated for each translation step. Our results show how efficient an early, primitive form of encoded synthesis can be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of translation is one of the most difficult problems of molecular evolution. Identifying molecular systems that translate an RNA sequence into a peptide sequence in the absence of ribosomes and enzymes is a challenge. Recently, single-nucleotide translation via coupling of 5&#8242; phosphoramidate-linked amino acids to 2&#8242;/3&#8242;-aminoacyl transfer-NMPs, as directed by the sequence of an RNA template, was demonstrated for three of the four canonical nucleotides. How single-nucleotide translation could be expanded to include all four bases and to produce longer peptides without translocation along the template strand remained unclear. Using transfer strands of increasing length containing any of the four bases that interrogate adjacent positions along the template, we now show that pentapeptides can be produced in coupling reactions and subsequent hydrolytic release in situ. With 2&#8242;/3&#8242;-aminoacylated mono-, di-, tri- and tetranucleotides we thus show how efficient translation can be without biomacromolecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insights Into the Mechanochemical Glass Formation of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ball milling is applied for the direct vitrification of a variety of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) at room temperature, highlighted by the preparation of the first Cu2+&#8208;based ZIF glass. This research significantly contributes to expanding the currently limited compositional range of MOF glasses.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) glasses, known for their potential in gas separation, optics, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, benefit from the processability of their (supercooled) liquid state. Traditionally, MOF glasses are produced by heating MOF crystals to their melting point and then cooling the liquid MOF to room temperature under an inert atmosphere. While effective, this melt&#8208;quenching technique requires high energy due to the high temperatures involved. It also limits the scope of new material development by restricting the compositional range to only those combinations of metal ions and linkers that are highly thermally stable. An alternative, mechanical milling at room temperature, has demonstrated its capability to transform MOF crystals into amorphous phases. However, the specific conditions under which these amorphous phases exhibit glass&#8208;like behavior remain uncharted. In this study, we explore the mechanochemical amorphization and vitrification of a variety of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) with diverse linkers and different metal ions (Zn2+, Co2+ and Cu2+) at room temperature. Our findings demonstrate that ZIFs capable of melting can be successfully converted into glasses through ball&#8208;milling. Remarkably, some non&#8208;meltable ZIFs can also be vitrified using the ball&#8208;milling technique, as highlighted by the preparation of the first Cu2+&#8208;based ZIF glass.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Diastereoselective Synthesis of Polysubstituted Piperidines Enabled by Boronyl Radical&#8208;Catalyzed (4+2) Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular (4+2) cycloaddition reaction of azetidines with alkenes has been developed for efficient synthesis of 3,4,5&#8208;polysubstituted piperidines, which contain the medicinally relevant key heterocyclic motif and are not readily accessible by other methods. The reaction features high modularity, atom economy, simple operation, inexpensive non&#8208;metallic catalysts and broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Piperidines are widely present in small molecule drugs and natural products. Despite many methods have been developed for their synthesis, new approaches to polysubstituted piperidines are highly desirable. This work presents a radical (4+2) cycloaddition reaction for synthesis of piperidines featuring dense substituents at 3,4,5&#8208;positions that are not readily accessible by known methods. Using commercially available diboron(4) compounds and 4&#8208;phenylpyridine as the catalyst precursors, the boronyl radical&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition between 3&#8208;aroyl azetidines and various alkenes, including previously unreactive 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and tetrasubstituted alkenes, has delivered the polysubstituted piperidines in generally high yield and diastereoselectivity. The reaction also features high modularity, atom economy, broad substrate scope, metal&#8208;free conditions, simple catalysts and operation. The utilization of the products has been demonstrated by selective transformations. A plausible mechanism, with the ring&#8208;opening of azetidine as the rate&#8208;limiting step, has been proposed based on the experimental and computational results.

         <title>Reconstructing Helmholtz Plane Enables Robust F&#8208;Rich Interface for Long&#8208;Life and High&#8208;Safe Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

TFEP reconstructs the Helmholtz plane on HC anode and boosts a robust F&#8208;rich SEI film by strongly adsorbing on the surface of HC and dragging the outer PF6&#8722; anions, thus greatly enhances the mechanical stability and the Na+ ion diffusion kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interface.







Abstract
Hard carbon (HC) is the most commonly used anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface (SEI) layer formed in carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes has an imperceptible dissolution tendency and a sluggish Na+ diffusion kinetics, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance of HC anode. Given that electrode/electrolyte interface property is highly dependent on the configuration of Helmholtz plane, we filtrated proper solvents by PFBE (PF6&#8722; anion binding energy) and CAE (carbon absorption energy) and disclosed the function of chosen TFEP to reconstruct the Helmholtz plane and regulate the SEI film on HC anode. Benefiting from the preferential adsorption tendency on HC surface and strong anion&#8208;dragging interaction of TFEP, a robust and thin anion&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich SEI film is established, which greatly enhances the mechanical stability and the Na+ ion diffusion kinetics of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The rationally designed TFEP&#8208;based electrolyte endows Na||HC half&#8208;cell and 2.8&#8197;Ah HC||Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 pouch cell with excellent rate capability, long cycle life, high safety and low&#8208;temperature adaptability. It is believed that this insightful recognition of tuning interface properties will pave a new avenue in the design of compatible electrolyte for low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;life, and high&#8208;safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Hydrogen Spillover Mechanism at the Metal&#8211;Metal Interface in Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
At the metal&#8211;metal interface, the minimized difference in the d&#8208;band center between these metals (&#916;&#1013;d) reduces the free energy difference between hydrogen adsorption on metal(i) and metal(ii) and lower the kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover between them. As a result, it can achieve a record high electrocatalytic nitrate hydrogenation efficiency at low energy consumption.







Abstract
Hydrogen spillover in metal&#8208;supported catalysts can largely enhance electrocatalytic hydrogenation performance and reduce energy consumption. However, its fundamental mechanism, especially at the metal&#8211;metal interface, remains further explored, impeding relevant catalyst design. Here, we theoretically profile that a large free energy difference in hydrogen adsorption on two different metals (|&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i)&#8722;&#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|) induces a high kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover between the metals. Minimizing the difference in their d&#8208;band centers (&#916;&#1013;d) should reduce |&#916;GH&#8208;metal(i)&#8722;&#916;GH&#8208;metal(ii)|, lowering the kinetic barrier to hydrogen spillover for improved electrocatalytic hydrogenation. We demonstrated this concept using copper&#8208;supported ruthenium&#8211;platinum alloys with the smallest &#916;&#1013;d, which delivered record high electrocatalytic nitrate hydrogenation performance, with ammonia production rate of 3.45&#177;0.12&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and Faraday efficiency of 99.8&#177;0.2&#8201;%, at low energy consumption of 21.4&#8197;kWh&#8201;kgamm&#8722;1. Using these catalysts, we further achieve continuous ammonia and formic acid production with a record high&#8208;profit space.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Using these catalysts, we further achieve continuous ammonia and formic acid production with a record high-profit space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Functional Switch Between Asperfumene and Fusicoccadiene Synthase and Entrance to Asperfumene Biosynthesis through a Vicinal Deprotonation&#8208;Reprotonation Process</title>

         <dc:description>
The diterpene synthase AfAS from Aspergillus fumigatiaffinis produces asperfumene with a novel 6&#8211;5&#8211;5&#8211;5 tetracyclic skeleton. Its cyclisation mechanism was investigated by isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments uncovered residue&#8197;65 as a critical switch for the formation of either asperfumene or structurally simpler diterpenes with a 5&#8211;8&#8211;5 tricyclic skeleton.







Abstract
The diterpene synthase AfAS was identified from Aspergillus fumigatiaffinis. Its amino acid sequence and&#8212;according to a structural model&#8212;active site architecture are highly similar to those of the fusicocca&#8208;2,10(14)&#8208;diene synthase PaFS, but AfAS produces a structurally much more complex diterpene with a novel 6&#8211;5&#8211;5&#8211;5 tetracyclic skeleton called asperfumene. The cyclisation mechanism of AfAS was elucidated through isotopic labelling experiments and DFT calculations. The reaction cascade proceeds in its initial steps through similar intermediates as for the PaFS cascade, but then diverges through an unusual vicinal deprotonation&#8208;reprotonation process that triggers a skeletal rearrangement at the entrance to the steps leading to the unique asperfumene skeleton. The structural model revealed only one major difference between the active sites: The PaFS residue&#8197;F65 is substituted by I65 in AfAS. Intriguingly, site&#8208;directed mutagenesis experiments with both diterpene synthases revealed that position 65 serves as a bidirectional functional switch for the biosynthesis of tetracyclic asperfumene versus structurally less complex diterpenes.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One: Plasmonic Janus Heterostructures for Efficient Cooperative Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>

We report the design of a reduction co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;tipped and oxidation co&#8208;catalyst&#8208;capped Janus heterostructure, which reveals the benefits of efficient interfacial charge separation via transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes, respectively, to Au and RuN5 sites for selective organic synthesis and H2 production via photoredox paired reaction coupling.







Abstract
Janus heterostructures consisting of multiple jointed components with distinct properties have gained growing interest in the photoredox catalytic field. Herein, we have developed a facile low&#8208;temperature method to gain anisotropic one&#8208;dimensional Au&#8208;tipped CdS (Au&#8722;CdS) nanorods (NRs), followed by assembling Ru molecular co&#8208;catalyst (RuN5) onto the surface of the NRs. The CdS NRs decorated with plasmonic Au nanoparticles and RuN5 complex harness the virtues of metal&#8208;semiconductor and inorganic&#8208;organic interface, giving directional charge transfer channels, spatially separated reaction sites, and enhanced local electric field distribution. As a result, the Au&#8722;CdS&#8722;RuN5 can act as an efficient dual&#8208;function photocatalyst for simultaneous H2 evolution and valorization of biomass&#8208;derived alcohols. Benefiting from the interfacial charge decoupling and selective chemical bond activation, the optimal all&#8208;in&#8208;one Au&#8722;CdS&#8722;RuN5 heterostructure shows greatly enhanced photoactivity and selectivity as compared to bare CdS NRs, along with a remarkable apparent quantum yield of 40.2&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm. The structural evolution and working mechanism of the heterostructures are systematically analyzed based on experimental and computational results.

         <title>Piezofluorochromism in Covalent Organic Frameworks: Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission Enhancement and Blue&#8208;Shifted Emission</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A range of 2D and 3D bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs with varying dimensions, topologies, and linkages were employed to systematically investigate their piezochromic behavior, revealing significant pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement with an increase of 16&#8208;fold, as well as rare instances of blue&#8208;shifted emission.







Abstract
Achieving enhanced or blue&#8208;shifted emission from piezochromic materials remains a major challenge. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising candidates for the development of piezochromic materials owing to their dynamic structures and adjustable optical properties, where the emission behaviors are not solely determined by the functional groups, but are also greatly influenced by the specific geometric arrangement. Nevertheless, this area remains relatively understudied. In this study, a successful synthesis of a series of bicarbazole&#8208;based COFs with varying topologies, dimensions, and linkages was conducted, followed by an investigation of their structural and emission properties under hydrostatic pressure generated by a diamond anvil cell. Consequently, these COFs exhibited distinct piezochromic behaviors, particularly a remarkable pressure&#8208;induced emission enhancement (PIEE) phenomenon with a 16&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence intensity from three&#8208;dimensional COFs, surpassing the performance of CPMs and most organic small molecules with PIEE behavior. On the contrary, three two&#8208;dimensional COFs with flexible structures exhibited rare blue&#8208;shifted emission, whereas the variants with rigid and conjugated structures showed common red&#8208;shifted and reduced emission. Mechanism research further revealed that these different piezochromic behaviors were primarily determined by interlayer distance and interaction. This study represents the first systematic exploration of the structures and emission properties of COFs through pressure&#8208;treated engineering and provides a new perspective on the design of piezochromic materials.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics of S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Photocatalysts: A Nanohouse Design Improves Photocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Performance</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanohouse&#8208;like S&#8208;scheme heterjunction photocatalyst is designed via a nanoarchitectonics strategy, exhibiting high photocatalytic nitrite reduction performance with an ammonia production rate of 2454.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.02&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm in pure water.







Abstract
Photocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NitRR) is a promising route for environment remediation and sustainable ammonia synthesis. To design efficient photocatalysts, the recently emerged nanoarchitectonics approach holds great promise. Here, we report a nanohouse&#8208;like S&#8208;scheme heterjunction photocatalyst with high photocatalytic NitRR performance. The nano&#8208;house has a floor of plate&#8208;like metal organic framework&#8208;based photocatalyst (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125), on which another photocatalyst Co(OH)2 nanosheet is grown while ZIF&#8208;8 hollow cages are also constructed as the surrounding wall/roof. Experimental and simulation results indicate that the positively charged, highly porous and hydrophobic ZIF&#8208;8 wall can modulate the environment in the nanohouse by (i) NO3&#8722; enrichment/NH4+ discharge and (ii) suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. In combination with the enhanced electron&#8208;hole separation and strong redox capability in the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125@Co(OH)2 S&#8208;scheme heterjunction confined in the nano&#8208;house, the designed photocatalyst delivers an ammonia yield of 2454.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum yield of 8.02&#8201;% at 400&#8197;nm in pure water. Our work provides new insights into the design principles of advanced photocatalytic NitRR photocatalyst.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable Poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s for Potential Alternatives to Engineering Plastic</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a representative case study of tough, chemical resistant and closed&#8208;loop recyclable dynamic poly(ester&#8208;disulfide)s of which their highly crosslinking nature was contributed by a synergetic effect of covalent ester&#8208;bond linkages and non&#8208;covalent hydrogen bonding, metal&#8208;ligand coordinations, subsequently endowing the fabricated optical&#8208;transparent materials with excellent mechanical properties, decent chemical resistance and facile closed&#8208;loop recycling capabilities, comparable with engineering polymers.







Abstract
Facile fabrication, low material complexity and closed&#8208;loop recycling are essential for polymer plastics to alter their linear product economy towards a cradle&#8208;to&#8208;cradle one. Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are one way to achieve that, which intrinsically exhibit decent mechanical properties like the thermosets but could also be easily recycled like the thermoplastics. In this work, we introduce rigid ester structural motifs into dynamic poly(disulfide)s to form a series of dual polymer networks. Owning to the coherence of soft/rigid segments and the reversible sacrificial crosslinking, they exhibit tailorable mechanical properties and good resistance towards different chemicals. Their closed&#8208;loop recycling is achieved via mild solvolysis, maintaining materials&#8217; mechanical integrities. It offers a solution as a sustainable replacement for engineering plastics which are massively under production but hard to be recycled.

         <title>Axial Ligand Enables Synthesis of Allenylsilane through Dirhodium(II) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ON&#8208;OFF effect of amine ligand enabled Rh2(II)&#8208;catalyzed SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of propargyl ester bearing a terminal alkyne moiety using hydrosilane was achieved. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the improvement of reactivity. The tertiary amine plays a significant role in assisting the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.







Abstract
Described herein is a dirhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed silylation of propargyl esters with hydrosilanes, using tertiary amines as axial ligands. By adopting this strategy, a range of versatile and useful allenylsilanes can be achieved with good yields. This reaction not only represents a SN2&#8242;&#8208;type silylation of the propargyl derivatives bearing a terminal alkyne moiety to synthesize allenylsilanes from simple hydrosilanes, but also represents a new application of dirhodium(II) complexes in catalytic transformation of carbon&#8208;carbon triple bond. The highly functionalized allenylsilanes that are produced can be transformed into a series of synthetically useful organic molecules. In this reaction, an intriguing ON&#8208;OFF effect of the amine ligand was observed. The reaction almost did not occur (OFF) without addition of Lewis base amine ligand. However, the reaction took place smoothly (ON) after addition of only catalytic amount of amine ligand. Detailed mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the reactivity can be delicately improved by the use of tertiary amine. The fine&#8208;tuning effect of the tertiary amine is crucial in the formation of the Rh&#8722;Si species via a concerted metalation deprotonation (CMD) mechanism and facilitating &#946;&#8208;oxygen elimination.

         <title>From Coordination to &#960;&#8208;Hole Chemistry of Transition Metals: Metalloporphyrins as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this combined experimental (X&#8208;ray structure analysis) and computational (DFT&#8208;D3 calculations) study we have systematically evaluated the &#960;&#8208;hole donor ability of elements across Groups 9 to 12 using metalated porphyrins (ppys) as model systems. The results obtained will make impact in the fields supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and catalysis, where noncovalent Lewis Base&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Metal interactions play a crucial role.







Abstract
Herein we have evidenced the formation of favorable &#960;&#8208;hole Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;metal noncovalent interactions (NCIs) involving elements from groups 9, 11 and 12. More in detail, M (M=Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) containing porphyrins have been synthesized and their supramolecular assemblies structurally characterized by means of single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hirshfeld surface analyses, revealing the formation of directional Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M contacts in addition to ancillary hydrogen bond and lone pair&#8208;&#960; bonds. Computations at the PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level of theory revealed the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of the Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interaction. In addition, the physical nature of these NCIs was studied using Quantum Chemistry methodologies, providing evidence of &#960;&#8208;hole Spodium and Regium bonds in Zn2+ and Cu2+ porphyrins, in addition to unveiling the presence of a &#960;&#8208;hole for group 9 (Co2+). On the other hand, group 10 (Ni2+) acted as both electron donor and acceptor moiety without showing an electropositive &#960;&#8208;hole. Owing to the underexplored potential of &#960;&#8208;hole interactions in transition metal chemistry, we believe the results reported herein will be useful in supramolecular chemistry, organometallics, and solid&#8208;state chemistry by i) putting under the spotlight the &#960;&#8208;hole chemistry involving first row transition metals and ii) unlocking a new tool to direct the self&#8208;assembly of metalloporphyrins.

In the outer space , the &#960;&#8208;hole nature of several metalated porphyrins is exploited to form noncovalent Br&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;M interactions (M = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+). In the cover image, a dragon uses its nest as a template to assemble the metal ion into the porphyrin's core, interacting with it using the orbs located on the head and tail. In their Research Article (e202409963), Antonio Bauz&#225;, Ranjan Patra et&#8197;al. report novel metalated porphyrins, including a computational analysis of the interactions undertaken in the solid state.

In the cover image, a dragon uses its nest as a template to assemble the metal ion into the porphyrin's core, interacting with it using the orbs located on the head and tail. In their Research Article &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202409963"&gt;(e202409963)&lt;/a&gt;, Antonio Bauz&#225;, Ranjan Patra et&#8197;al. report novel metalated porphyrins, including a computational analysis of the interactions undertaken in the solid state.

Novel pocket&#8208;independent STING&#8208;activating agonists (piSTINGs), which act through multivalency&#8208;driven oligomerization to activate downstream signalling pathways, were developed by Yan&#8208;Mei Li et&#8197;al. in their Research Article (e202407037). piSTINGs could serve as novel STING agonists for vaccines and combination therapies. STING oligomerization is a useful strategy for the development of a new generation of STING agonists.

Incorporating Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion into a Mott&#8211;Hubbard system emerges as an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance nonlinear optical materials. In their Research Article (e202406941), Chi Zhang, Zhipeng Huang employ lattice distortion to provide two distinct transition pathways with varying probabilities, while the Mott&#8211;Hubbard configuration ensures the transition sequence. This synergistic design unveils the excited&#8208;state absorption in (MA)2CuX4, enabling these materials to simultaneously exhibit a large nonlinear absorption coefficient and substantial modulation depth.

         <title>Breakthrough in CO2 Electroreduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Products at Ampere&#8208;Level Enabled by Active Sites Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst with three finely&#8208;tuned active sites was created by doping Pd atoms to Cu2O followed by a in situ electroreduction treatment, which can speed up the complex reactions of CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products in high FE and yield of C2+ products at ampere level current density.







Abstract
Efficient production of value&#8208;added chemicals with high selectivity from CO2 electroreduction at industrial&#8208;level current density is highly demanded, yet remains a big challenge. In a recent issue of Angewandte Chemie, Han and colleagues have elegantly increased the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products to over 70&#8201;% at amperes level (1.4&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) by engineering the active sites for the key reactions involved in the CO2 electroreduction. In this study, the highly dispersed Pd atoms have two unique functions: active sites for water dissociation and to induce the electron rearrangement of the surrounding Cu atoms to form new active sites for CO conversion, while the Cu far from Pd are the active sites for efficient CO2 conversion to CO, the synergistic functions of these three active sites result in high FE and yields of C2+ products at industrial&#8208;level current density. This research is a remarkable step forward in the methodology for developing efficient and durable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;A novel electrocatalyst with three finely-tuned active sites was created by doping Pd atoms to Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O followed by a in situ electroreduction treatment, which can speed up the complex reactions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products in high FE and yield of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products at ampere level current density.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient production of value-added chemicals with high selectivity from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction at industrial-level current density is highly demanded, yet remains a big challenge. In a recent issue of Angewandte Chemie, Han and colleagues have elegantly increased the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of multi-carbon (C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt;) products to over 70&#8201;% at amperes level (1.4&#8197;A&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) by engineering the active sites for the key reactions involved in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. In this study, the highly dispersed Pd atoms have two unique functions: active sites for water dissociation and to induce the electron rearrangement of the surrounding Cu atoms to form new active sites for CO conversion, while the Cu far from Pd are the active sites for efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to CO, the synergistic functions of these three active sites result in high FE and yields of C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products at industrial-level current density. This research is a remarkable step forward in the methodology for developing efficient and durable catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organolanthanide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets with Heterocyclic Ligands</title>

Recent progressive development of single&#8208;molecule magnets has advanced to the realm of heterocyclic organolanthanide chemistry. This minireview aims to highlight this progress and gives perspectives for further development of such single&#8208;molecule magnets.







Abstract
Lanthanide (Ln) based mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) provide probably the finest ligand regulation model for magnetic property. Recently, the development of such SMMs has witnessed a fast transition from coordination to organometallic complexes because the latter provides a fertile, yet not fully excavated soil for the development of SMMs. Especially those SMMs with heterocyclic ligands have shown the potential to reach higher blocking temperature. In this minireview, we give an overview of the design principle of SMMs and highlight those &#8220;shining stars&#8221; of heterocyclic organolanthanide SMMs based on the ring sizes of ligands, analysing how the electronic structures of those ligands and the stiffness of subsequently formed molecules affect the dynamic magnetism of SMMs. Finally, we envisaged the future development of heterocyclic Ln&#8208;SMMs.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Derived Carbon&#8208;Supported Metal Electrocatalysts for Energy&#8208;Related Reduction Reactions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances on the different electroreduction applications of metal&#8211;organic framework derived carbon&#8208;supported metal electrocatalysts with customized structure, component, and electron structure are depicted. Thereout, morphology control, component/construction modulation and controlled metal loading strategies are systematically sorted out based on three key components of metal&#8211;organic frameworks, namely metal nodes, ligands and modifiers.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction reactions, as cathodic processes in many energy&#8208;related devices, significantly impact the overall efficiency determined mainly by the performance of electrocatalysts. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) derived carbon&#8208;supported metal materials have become one of star electrocatalysts due to their tunable structure and composition through ligand design and metal screening. However, for different electroreduction reactions, the required active metal species vary in phase component, electronic state, and catalytic center configuration, hence requiring effective customization. From this perspective, this review comprehensively analyzes the structural design principles, metal loading strategies, practical electroreduction performance, and complex catalytic mechanisms, thereby providing insights and guidance for the future rational design of such electroreduction catalysts.

         <title>Aggregation of One&#8208;Dimensional Wires: The Case of Long Oligoynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible aggregation of an oligoyne with 16 triple bonds is described. The association phenomenon occurs in spite of the flexibility and the minimal &#960; surface of the oligoyne.







Abstract
We show an unexpected aggregation phenomenon of a long oligoyne (Py[16]) with 16 contiguous triple bonds and endcapped with bulky 3,5&#8208;bi(3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)pyridine groups. Aggregation of 1D &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligoyne chains is rare given the minimal &#960;&#8211;&#960; intermolecular interactions as well as its flexibility that works against self&#8208;assembly. In dilute solutions, the reversible aggregation of Py[16] initiates at low temperature in the range of 140&#8211;180&#8197;K, and is not observed for shorter oligoynes in this series. Cryogenic UV/Vis electronic absorption spectra and vibrational Raman spectra with different laser wavelength lines tuning from in&#8208;resonance to off&#8208;resonance conditions have been used to extract the vibrational features characterizing the monomer and aggregate species. Theoretical calculations complement the spectroscopic findings.

         <title>Enantioselective Construction of Tetrahydroindole Skeletons by Rh&#8208;Catalyzed [2+2+2] Cycloaddition of Homopropargyl Enamides with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex catalyzes the [2+2+2] cycloaddition of homopropargyl enamides with alkynes at room temperature to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals with high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. In this cycloaddition, the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the ee values of the cycloadducts.







Abstract
We have developed the Rh&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective [2+2+2] cycloaddition of homopropargyl enamides (tosylamide&#8208;tethered 1,6&#8208;enynes) with alkynes to construct tetrahydroindole skeletons found in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals. This cycloaddition proceeds at room temperature in high yields and regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity with a broad substrate scope. The preparative scale reaction followed by substituent conversion on the nitrogen atom and the diastereoselective [4+2] cycloaddition with singlet O2 affords hexahydroindole&#8208;diols bearing three stereogenic centers and variable substituents on the nitrogen. Mechanistic studies have revealed that the substituents of the enynes change the ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular rhodacycle formation when using terminal alkynes, varying the ee values of the cycloadducts.

         <title>Structural Elucidation of a Metagenomic Urethanase and Its Engineering Towards Enhanced Hydrolysis Profiles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1. Subsequent engineering yielded variants with up to 8&#8208;fold enhanced activity on various urethanes and amides. UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1 variants partially degraded a model thermoplastic polyester&#8208;PU and nylon&#8197;6, highlighting its applicability for the biodegradation and recycling of PU and PA.







Abstract
While plastics like polyethylene terephthalate can already be degraded efficiently by the activity of hydrolases, other synthetic polymers like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. In this study, we solved the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1, identified highly flexible loop regions to comprise active site residues, and targeted a total of 20 potential hot spots by site&#8208;saturation mutagenesis. Engineering campaigns yielded variants with single mutations, exhibiting almost 3&#8208; and 8&#8208;fold improved activity against highly stable N&#8208;aryl urethane and amide bonds, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the release of the corresponding monomers from a thermoplastic polyester&#8208;PU and a PA (nylon&#8197;6) by the activity of a single, metagenome&#8208;derived urethanase after short incubation times. Thereby, we expanded the hydrolysis profile of UMG&#8208;SP&#8208;1 beyond the reported low&#8208;molecular weight carbamates.

&lt;p&gt;Plastics like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG-SP-1. Subsequent engineering yielded variants with up to 8-fold enhanced activity on various urethanes and amides. UMG-SP-1 variants partially degraded a model thermoplastic polyester-PU and nylon&#8197;6, highlighting its applicability for the biodegradation and recycling of PU and PA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While plastics like polyethylene terephthalate can already be degraded efficiently by the activity of hydrolases, other synthetic polymers like polyurethanes (PUs) and polyamides (PAs) largely resist biodegradation. In this study, we solved the first crystal structure of the metagenomic urethanase UMG-SP-1, identified highly flexible loop regions to comprise active site residues, and targeted a total of 20 potential hot spots by site-saturation mutagenesis. Engineering campaigns yielded variants with single mutations, exhibiting almost 3- and 8-fold improved activity against highly stable &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl urethane and amide bonds, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated the release of the corresponding monomers from a thermoplastic polyester-PU and a PA (nylon&#8197;6) by the activity of a single, metagenome-derived urethanase after short incubation times. Thereby, we expanded the hydrolysis profile of UMG-SP-1 beyond the reported low-molecular weight carbamates. Together, these findings promise advanced strategies for the bio-based degradation and recycling of plastic materials and waste, aiding efforts to establish a circular economy for synthetic polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Copper Dinitrogen Complex Supported by a Weakly Coordinating Anion</title>

Cascade Synthesis: The copper dinitrogen complex [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] (RF=C(CF3)3) with an unprecedentedly high N&#8801;N stretching frequency of 2314&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and a positive charge of +0.10 residing on the terminal N atom is reported. Synthesis proceeded from Ag[Al(ORF)4] in a triple consecutive cascade reaction with CuI excess to obtain pure product without Ag+ contamination. [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] was fully characterized by NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, EDX, XRD and quantum chemical analyses.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and full characterization of the copper dinitrogen complex [(&#951;1&#8208;N2)Cu{Al(ORF)4}] 2 (RF=C(CF3)3) prepared by a cascade metathesis reaction of Ag[Al(ORF)4] with CuI&#8208;excess in iso&#8208;perfluorohexane (i&#8208;pfh) under N2 atmosphere. Title compound 2 features an extraordinarily high N2 stretching frequency at 2313/2314&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (IR/Raman) and was characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry. Quantum chemical charge displacement analysis based on natural orbitals of chemical valence (CD&#8208;NOCV) indicates that the copper&#8208;dinitrogen interaction is still governed by weak &#960;&#8208;backdonation, but is significantly reduced compared to all literature&#8208;known transition metal dinitrogen complexes.

         <title>Streamlining the Synthesis of Pyridones through Oxidative Amination of Cyclopentenones</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxidative amination process enables the streamlined synthesis of pyridones. Cyclopentenone building blocks undergo silyl enol ether formation, followed by nitrogen atom insertion and aromatisation to yield pyridones. The developed one&#8208;pot reaction is mild, operationally simple, exhibits broad functional group tolerance and complete regioselectivity, and provides facile access to 15N&#8208;labelled targets.







Abstract
Herein we report the development of an oxidative amination process for the streamlined synthesis of pyridones from cyclopentenones. Cyclopentenone building blocks can undergo in situ silyl enol ether formation, followed by the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the carbon skeleton with successive aromatisation to yield pyridones. The reaction sequence is operationally simple, rapid, and carried out in one pot. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, exhibits broad functional group tolerance, complete regioselectivity, and is well scalable. The developed method provides facile access to the synthesis of 15N&#8208;labelled targets, industrially relevant pyridone products and their derivatives in a fast and efficient way.

         <title>Asymmetric Paired Electrolysis: Enantioselective Alkylation of Sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8722;H Functionalization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric paired electrolysis strategy for alkylation of sulfonylimines is reported. Anodic oxidation for benzylic radical formation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylimine reduction on the cathode are seamlessly cross&#8208;coupled using this protocol, providing enantio&#8208;enriched chiral amines containing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter with high enantioselectivity under mild conditions.







Abstract
Enantioselective transformation of ubiquitous C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds into three&#8208;dimensional chiral scaffolds is of longstanding interest to synthetic chemists. Herein, an asymmetric paired electrolysis enables a highly efficient and sustainable approach to the enantioselective alkylation of sulfonylimines via C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. In this protocol, anodic oxidation for benzylic radical formation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed sulfonylimine reduction on the cathode were seamlessly cross&#8208;coupled (up to 88&#8201;% yield). Enantioenriched chiral amines containing a tetrasubstituted carbon stereocenter are accessed with high enantioselectivity (up to 96&#8201;% ee). Mechanistic studies suggest that the amine generated in situ could serve as a base to deprotonate phenols and decrease the oxidation potential of the reaction, allowing phenols with lower potentials to be preferentially oxidized.

         <title>The Modular Synthesis of Sulfondiimidoyl Fluorides and their Application to Sulfondiimidamide and Sulfondiimine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining organometallic reagents with sulfurdiimide reagents, simple electrophiles, and then an electrophilic fluorine reagent provides a modular and scalable synthesis of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides. For the first time it is possible to prepare these unique functional groups with broad flexibility at the carbon and both imidic nitrogen atoms. SuFEx reactivity using amines and organolithium reagents is demonstrated, leading to sulfondiimidamide and sulfondiimine products.







Abstract
A modular synthesis of sulfondiimidoyl fluorides&#8212;the double aza&#8208;analogues of sulfonyl fluorides&#8212;allowing variation of the carbon and both nitrogen&#8208;substituents is reported. The chemistry uses readily available organometallic reagents, commercial sulfinylamines, simple electrophiles, and N&#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI), as the starting materials. The reactions are broad in scope, efficient, and scalable. We show that the sulfondiimidoyl fluoride products can be combined with amines to provide sulfondiimidamides, and with organolithium reagents to provide sulfondiimines, and that reactivity in these transformations can be modulated by variation of the N&#8208;substituents.

         <title>Breaking Boundaries: Giant Ultraviolet Birefringence in Dimension&#8208;Reduced Zn&#8208;Based Crystals</title>

By using the dimension&#8208;reduction strategy, &#960;&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) was introduced into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2, resulting in the design of zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(4HP)2ZnCl2], with birefringence reaching 160&#8197;times the original value (0.482@546&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Birefringent crystals have essential applications in optical communication areas. Low&#8208;dimensional structures with inherited structural anisotropy are potential systems for investigating birefringent materials with large birefringence. In this work, the zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) [(p&#8208;C5H5NO)2ZnCl2] (1) and [p&#8208;C5H6NO]2[ZnCl4] (2) were obtained by introducing the &#960;&#8208;conjugated p&#8208;C5H5NO (4HP) into the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ZnCl2. Remarkably, 1 exhibits a giant birefringence of 0.482@546&#8197;nm, which is the largest among Zn&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) compounds and 160&#8197;times that of ZnCl2. According to structural and theoretical calculation analyses, the large optical polarizability, high spatial density, ideal distribution of the [(4HP)2ZnCl2]0 cluster, and the low dimension of 1 result in the dramatically increased birefringence compared to ZnCl2. This work will provide a valid route for accelerating the design and synthesis of compounds with excellent birefringence in low&#8208;dimensional systems.

         <title>5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin: a Stable Antiaromatic [20]Pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0) Displaying Remarkable Oxidative Self&#8208;Coupling Reactions</title>

5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin and its BF2 complex were synthesized as the first example of meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted orangarins by double SNAr reaction of 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;BODIPY with 2&#8208;pyrrolydipyrrin. These orangarins are antiaromatic but stable. Remarkable oxidative self&#8208;coupling reactivities of the orangarin and its oligomers were demonstrated up to triply&#8208;COT&#8208;centered orangarin tetramers. COT&#8208;centered 3H&#8208;orangarin oligomers are oxidized to the corresponding 2H&#8208;orangarin oligomers, which show effective conjugation across the COT bridge. These directly linked orangarin oligomers show many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interaction.







Abstract
5,18&#8208;Dimesitylorangarin and its BF2 complex were synthesized by double SNAr reaction of 3,5&#8208;dibromo&#8208;BODIPY with 2&#8208;pyrrolydipyrrin as the first examples of meso&#8208;aryl&#8208;substituted orangarin. These orangarins, delineated as [20]pentaphyrin(1.0.1.0.0), are strongly antiaromatic but rather stable. The free base orangarin was coupled by oxidation with MnO2 to give a 11,11&#8242;&#8208;linked dimer, a cyclooctatetraene(COT)&#8208;centered trimer, and a spiro&#8208;trimer. Fused COT&#8208;centered 3H&#8208;orangarin dimer was oxidized to the corresponding 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer, which was further coupled to give a triply COT&#8208;centered 2H&#8208;orangarin tetramer. 3H&#8208;Orangarin oligomers are all antiaromatic as evinced by extremely low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted 1H&#8197;NMR signals of the inner NH and ill&#8208;defined absorption spectra with broad tails. In contrast, COT&#8208;centered 2H&#8208;orangarin dimer and tetramer show moderately low&#8208;field&#8208;shifted NH signals and intense NIR absorbance over 900&#8197;nm, suggesting effective &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the COT bridge and almost non&#8208;antiaromatic character. These orangarin oligomers exhibit many reversible redox potentials owing to the intramolecular electronic interactions. Regardless of the different aromatic characters, all the orangarin monomers and oligomers exhibit very rapid excited&#8208;state decays.

         <title>Structural Fine&#8208;Tuning to Achieve Highly Fluorescent Organic and Water&#8208;Soluble Thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsymmetrical donor&#8208;thiazolothiazole&#8208;acceptor systems exhibit high solution state fluorescence quantum yield in polar organic solvents and water via intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT). Computational studies reveal that; i) thiazolothiazole bridge is non&#8208;innocent and can act as a donor or acceptor, and ii) the ICT is best captured by a fragment&#8208;based approach in which the change in charges between the excited and ground state is examined.







Abstract
Fluorescent molecular systems are important for various applications such as sensing of analytes, probes for biologically relevant processes and as optoelectronic materials. Achieving high fluorescence quantum yield across the spectrum of solvent polarity and in solid&#8208;state is challenging in molecular materials. Herein, we present a strategy to achieve strongly fluorescent molecular materials based on weak intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) in a family of unsymmetrical donor&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole&#8208;acceptor systems (both neutral and cationic). Detailed photophysical studies reveal that the delicate balance between the donor and acceptor result in high solution&#8208;state fluorescence quantum yield (&gt;80&#8201;%) in both polar protic and apolar solvents. Quantum chemical computations uncover a hitherto unappreciated insight that the extent of ICT is aptly represented by the change in Mulliken charges between the ground and excited state for different fragments rather than the classical approach of monitoring the change in dipole moment for the entire molecule. This insight rationalizes the observed photophysical properties and can have implications in the design of tuneable donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor systems.

Wet spinning methods are used to 3D&#8208;print gel patterns based on low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs), with the chemical structure of the LMWG and its ability to generate AuNPs programming the conductivity of the printed pattern.







Abstract
We report the use of wet&#8208;spinning to 3D&#8208;print gels from low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on the 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidenesorbitol (DBS) scaffold. Gel stripes assembled from DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 and DBS&#8208;COOH are printed, and their conductivities assessed. Printed gels based on DBS&#8208;CONHNH2 can be loaded with Au(III), which is reduced in situ to form embedded gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The conductivity of these gels increases because of electron transport mediated by the AuNPs, whereas the conductivity of DBS&#8208;COOH, which does not promote AuNP formation, remains lower. We then fabricate multi&#8208;component gel patterns comprised of spatially well&#8208;defined domains of printed DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/AuNP (higher conductivity) and DBS&#8208;COOH (lower conductivity) resulting in soft multi&#8208;domain materials with differential conductivity. Such materials have future prospects in applications such as soft nanoelectronics or tissue engineering.

         <title>Realization of Long&#8208;Life Proton Battery by Layer Intercalatable Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new layer intercalatable electrolyte with effective water molecules bound was designed for proton batteries, achieving the low hydrogen production reaction potential and the promoted transfer kinetics of protons. An ultra&#8208;long stability for 2&#8197;months at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C of full proton batteries was therefore delivered.







Abstract
Proton batteries have attracted increasing interests because of their potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage with high safety and great low&#8208;temperature performances. However, their development is significantly retarded by electrolyte design due to free water corrosion. Herein, we report a layer intercalatable electrolyte (LIE) by introducing trimethyl phosphate (TMP) into traditional acidic electrolyte. Different from conventional role in batteries, the presence of TMP intriguingly achieves co&#8208;intercalation of solvent molecules into the interlayer of anode materials, enabling a new working mechanism for proton reactions. The electrode corrosion was also strongly retarded with expanded electrochemical stability window. The half&#8208;cell therefore showed an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability with 91.0&#8201;% capacity retention at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 5000&#8197;cycles. Furthermore, the assembled full batteries can even deliver an ultra&#8208;long lifetime with a capacity retention of 74.9&#8201;% for 2&#8197;months running at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. This work provides new opportunities for electrolyte design of aqueous batteries.

         <title>Fully Optical Control of Polarization Current Direction in a Cyanide&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Complex</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polarization switching of the [Fe2Co] with photocurrent output was realized via reversible light&#8208;induced ETCST. Routing the photocurrent through an integrator yields a stable square wave signal, effectively mimicking the switching of a ferroelectric memory from &#8220;0&#8221; to &#8220;1&#8221;. Specific crystal cells are exposed to 532&#8197;nm light for writing process, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
As a remote and non&#8208;contact stimulus, light offers the potential for manipulating the polarization of ferroelectric materials without physical contact. However, in current research, the non&#8208;contact write&#8208;read (erase) process lacks direct observation through the stable current as output signal. To address this limitation, we investigated the photoinduced polarization switching capabilities of the cyanide&#8208;bridged compound [Fe2Co] using visible light, leading to the achievement of rewritable polarization. By subjecting [Fe2Co] crystals to alternating irradiation with 785&#8197;nm and 532&#8197;nm light, the polarization changes exhibited a distinct square wave pattern, confirming the reliability of the writing and erasing processes. Initialization involved exposing specific crystal units to 532&#8197;nm light for storing &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;0&#8221; information, while reading was accomplished by scanning the units with 785&#8197;nm light, resulting in brief current pulses for &#8220;1&#8221; states and no current signal for &#8220;0&#8221; states. This research unveils new possibilities for optical storage systems, paving the way for efficient and rewritable data storage and retrieval technologies, such as the next&#8208;generation memories.

         <title>Exploring Macroscopic Dipoles of Designed Cyclic Peptide Ordered Assemblies to Harvest Piezoelectric Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric properties of self&#8208;assembled cyclic peptides derived from &#948;&#8208;amino acids have been investigated by exploring their macrodipole. The packing of the cyclic peptides, which show unidirectional hydrogen bonds was found to determine the piezoelectric properties.







Abstract
Crystalline materials exhibiting non&#8208;centrosymmetry and possessing substantial surface dipole moments play a critical role in piezoelectricity. Designing biocompatible self&#8208;assembled materials with these attributes is particularly challenging when compared to inorganic materials and ceramics. In this study, we elucidate the crystal conformations of novel cyclic peptides that exhibit self&#8208;assembly into tubular structures characterized by unidirectional hydrogen bonding and piezoelectric properties. Unlike cyclic peptides derived from alternating L&#8208; and D&#8208;amino acids, those derived from new &#948;&#8208;amino acids demonstrate the formation of self&#8208;assembled tubes with unidirectional hydrogen bonds. Further, the tightly packed tubular assemblies and higher macrodipole moments result in superior piezoelectric coefficients compared to peptides with lower macrodipole moments. Our findings underscore the potential for designing cyclic peptides with unidirectional hydrogen bonds, thereby paving the way for their application in design of biocompatible piezo&#8208; and ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Cycloadditions of Diazoalkenes with P4 and tBuCP: Access to Diazaphospholes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of stable diazoalkenes with phosphaalkynes (P1) and white phosphorus (P4) give access to diazamono&#8208; and diazadiphospholes. These new organophosphorus compounds can be utilized as ligands in main group and transition metal chemistry.







Abstract
Diazoalkenes readily react with tert&#8208;butylphosphaalkyne (tBuCP) and white phosphorus (P4) to afford novel phosphorus heterocycles, 3H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;diazamonophospholes and 1,2,3,4&#8208;diazadiphospholes. Both species represent rare examples of neutral heterophospholes. The mechanism of formation and the electronic structures of these formal (3+2) cycloaddition products were analyzed computationally. The new phospholes form structurally diverse coordination compounds with transition metal and main group elements. Given the growing number of stable diazoalkenes, this work offers a straightforward route to neutral aza(di&#8208;)phospholes as a new ligand class.

         <title>Artificial Mitochondria Nanoarchitectonics via a Supramolecular Assembled Microreactor Covered by ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 63, Issue 38, September 16, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP synthesis against abiotic stress is achieved by biomimetic assembly microreactor based on phosphatase/Au clusters and ATP Synthase. Phosphatase is harnessed to generate both protons and Pi to support the synthesis of ATP under phosphorus&#8208;deficiency stress. Au clusters in the microreactor help proteins resist the destruction from ROS, and concurrently facilitate the photothermal&#8208;enhanced ATP synthesis.







Abstract
Abiotic stress tends to induce oxidative damage to enzymes and organelles that in turns hampers the phosphorylation process and decreases the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) productivity. Artificial assemblies can alleviate abiotic stress and simultaneously provide nutrients to diminish the oxidative damage. Here, we have integrated natural acid phosphatase (ACP) and ATP synthase with plasmonic Au clusters in a biomimetic microreactor. ACP immobilized on the Au clusters is harnessed to generate proton influx to drive ATP synthase and concurrently supply phosphate to improve phosphorus availability to combat phosphorus&#8208;deficiency stress. In tandem with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and the photothermal functionality of Au clusters, such an assembled microreactor exhibits an improved abiotic stress tolerance and achieves plasmon&#8208;accelerated ATP synthesis. This innovative approach offers an effective route to enhance the stress resistance of ATP synthase&#8208;based energy&#8208;generating systems, opening an exciting potential of these systems for biomimicking applications.

         <title>Non&#8208;Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Overall 99&#8201;% (002) Plane Achieves Extreme and Direct Utilization of 95&#8201;% Zn Anode and By&#8208;Product as Cathode</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;sized (002) Zn anodes with an ultra&#8208;high RTC of 99&#8201;% are fabricated on non&#8208;textured substrates by the synergistic action of Mn3+ and H+ via a constant voltage electrodeposition strategy. The anode is capable of stable operation at ultra&#8208;high current densities &amp; areal capacities. Additionally, MnO2, a by&#8208;product of the 99&#8201;% RTC Zn (002) electrodeposition, can be used directly as a high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life cathode.







Abstract
Zn anode protection in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) face great challenges of high Zn utilization rate (i.e., depth of discharge, DOD) and high current density due to the large difficulty in obtaining an extreme overall RTC (relative texture coefficient) of Zn (002) plane. Through the potent interaction of Mn(III)aq and H+ with distinct Zn crystal planes under an electric field, large&#8208;size Zn foils with a breakthrough (002) plane RTC of 99&#8201;% (i.e., close to Zn single crystal) are electrodeposited on texture&#8208;less substrates, which is also applicable from recycled Zn. The ultra&#8208;high (002) plane RTC remarkably enhances cyclic performance of the Zn anode (70&#8201;% DOD @ 45.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and the DOD is even up to 95&#8201;% (@ 28.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) with an electrolyte additive of polyaniline. Furthermore, MnO2, the by&#8208;product of electrodeposition, is directly used as cathode of both coin cell and pouch battery, surpassing the cyclic performance exhibited by the majority of Zn||MnO2 batteries in previous instances. These results demonstrate the great potential of our strategy for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale ZIBs.

         <title>Regulating Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphasial Reactions by Zwitterionic Binder Chemistry in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with High&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes and Silicon&#8208;Graphite Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic binder is designed to achieve an anion&#8208;enriched solvation environment on Si&#8208;based anodes with weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions, facilitating the formation of a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Such binder&#8208;regulated SEI is effective in minimizing the catalytic decomposition of the electrolyte and Si devitalization, thus enabling long&#8208;life full cells with Si&#8208;graphite anodes and LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathodes.







Abstract
The practical application of silicon (Si)&#8208;based anodes faces challenges due to severe structural and interphasial degradations. These challenges are exacerbated in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) employing Si&#8208;based anodes with high&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes, as significant transition&#8208;metal crossover catalyzes serious parasitic side reactions, leading to faster cell failure. While enhancing the mechanical properties of polymer binders has been acknowledged as an effective means of improving solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) stability on Si&#8208;based anodes, an in&#8208;depth understanding of how the binder chemistry influences the SEI is lacking. Herein, a zwitterionic binder with an ability to manipulate the chemical composition and spatial distribution of the SEI layer is designed for Si&#8208;based anodes. It is evidenced that the electrically charged microenvironment created by the zwitterionic species alters the solvation environment on the Si&#8208;based anode, featuring rich anions and weakened Li+&#8208;solvent interactions. Such a binder&#8208;regulated solvation environment induces a thin, uniform, robust SEI on Si&#8208;based anodes, which is found to be the key to withstanding transition&#8208;metal deposition and minimizing their detrimental impact on catalyzing electrolyte decomposition and devitalizing bulk Si. As a result, albeit possessing comparable mechanical properties to those of commercial binders, the zwitterionic binder enables superior cycling performances in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs under demanding operating conditions.

         <title>Strengthening an Intramolecular Non&#8208;Classical Hydrogen Bond to Get in Shape for Binding</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) are not considered strong interactions, they can profoundly affect molecular interactions. One prominent example is the E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx. When the CH3 group of l&#8208;fucose is replaced by CF3, the intramolecular non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond approaches the strength of a classical H&#8208;bond. Thus, although currently underestimated, non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bonds should find a place in the toolbox for structural design.







Abstract
In this research article, we report on the strengthening of a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) by introducing electron withdrawing groups at the carbon atom. The approach is demonstrated on the example of derivatives of the physiological E&#8208;selectin ligand sialyl Lewisx (1, sLex). Its affinity is mainly due to a beneficial entropy term, which is predominantly caused by the pre&#8208;organization of sLex in its binding conformation. We have shown, that among the elements responsible for the pre&#8208;organization, the stabilization by a non&#8208;classical hydrogen bond between the H&#8722;C5 of l&#8208;fucose and the ring oxygen O5 of the neighboring d&#8208;galactose moiety is essential and yields 7.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. This effect could be further strengthened by replacing l&#8208;fucose by 6,6,6&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;l&#8208;fucose leading to an improved non&#8208;classical H&#8208;bond of 14.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1, i.e., an improved pre&#8208;organization in the bioactive conformation. For a series of glycomimetics of sLex (1), this outcome could be confirmed by high field NMR&#8208;shifts of the H&#8722;C5Fuc, by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of glycomimetics co&#8208;crystallized with E&#8208;selectin as well as by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of the CF3&#8208;group beneficially influences the pharmacokinetic properties of sLex mimetics. Thus, acid&#8208;stability, a prerequisite for gastrointestinal stability, could be substantially improved.

     alt="Strengthening an Intramolecular Non-Classical Hydrogen Bond to Get in Shape for Binding"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although non-classical H-bonds (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) are not considered strong interactions, they can profoundly affect molecular interactions. One prominent example is the E-selectin ligand sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;. When the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-fucose is replaced by CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the intramolecular non-classical H-bond approaches the strength of a classical H-bond. Thus, although currently underestimated, non-classical H-bonds should find a place in the toolbox for structural design.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this research article, we report on the strengthening of a non-classical hydrogen bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) by introducing electron withdrawing groups at the carbon atom. The approach is demonstrated on the example of derivatives of the physiological E-selectin ligand sialyl Lewis&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, sLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;). Its affinity is mainly due to a beneficial entropy term, which is predominantly caused by the pre-organization of sLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; in its binding conformation. We have shown, that among the elements responsible for the pre-organization, the stabilization by a non-classical hydrogen bond between the H&#8722;C5 of &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-fucose and the ring oxygen O5 of the neighboring &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-galactose moiety is essential and yields 7.4&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This effect could be further strengthened by replacing &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-fucose by 6,6,6-trifluoro-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-fucose leading to an improved non-classical H-bond of 14.9&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e., an improved pre-organization in the bioactive conformation. For a series of glycomimetics of sLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), this outcome could be confirmed by high field NMR-shifts of the H&#8722;C5&lt;sup&gt;Fuc&lt;/sup&gt;, by X-ray diffraction analysis of glycomimetics co-crystallized with E-selectin as well as by isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, the electron-withdrawing character of the CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-group beneficially influences the pharmacokinetic properties of sLe&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; mimetics. Thus, acid-stability, a prerequisite for gastrointestinal stability, could be substantially improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optimizing Upconversion Quantum Yield via Structural Tuning of Dipyrrolonaphthyridinedione Annihilators</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) were explored as annihilators for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) &#8208;tovisible upconversion. Unlike most annihilators, DPNDs can be easily functionalized. This allows us to uncover which structural changes increase annihilator performance. Combining beneficial motifs, we synthesize an optimized annihilator with an upconversion quantum yield almost double that of rubrene, the most commonly used NIR&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is a photophysical process in which two low&#8208;energy photons are converted into one higher&#8208;energy photon. This type of upconversion requires two species: a sensitizer that absorbs low&#8208;energy light and transfers its energy to an annihilator, which emits higher&#8208;energy light after TTA. In spite of the multitude of applications of TTA&#8208;UC, few families of annihilators have been explored. In this work, we show dipyrrolonaphthyridinediones (DPNDs) can act as annihilators in TTA&#8208;UC. We found that structural changes to DPND dramatically increase its upconversion quantum yield (UCQY). Our optimized DPND annihilator demonstrates a high maximum internal UCQY of 9.4&#8201;%, outperforming the UCQY of commonly used near&#8208;infrared&#8208;to&#8208;visible annihilator rubrene by almost double.

         <title>Enantioselective Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sequential Hydrosilylation of Arylmethylenecyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu&#8208;catalyzed sequential asymmetric hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs has been developed, providing a robust approach to chiral silacyclopentane featuring consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent stereocontrol. Mechanistic studies disclosed that this reaction undergoes a sequential intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant homoallylic silanes.







Abstract
Despite impressive advances in the construction of enantioenriched silacarbocycles featuring silicon&#8208;stereogenic centers via a selection of well&#8208;defined sila&#8208;synthons, the development of a more convenient and economic method with readily available starting materials is significantly less explored and remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we report the first example of copper&#8208;catalyzed sequential hydrosilylation of readily accessible methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs) and primary silanes, affording an efficient and convenient route to a wide range of chiral silacyclopentanes bearing consecutive silicon&#8208; and carbon&#8208;stereogenic centers with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivities (generally &#8805;98&#8201;% ee, &gt;25&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Mechanistic studies reveal that these reactions combine copper&#8208;catalyzed intermolecular ring&#8208;opening hydrosilylation of aryl MCPs and intramolecular asymmetric hydrosilylation of the resultant Z/E mixture of homoallylic silanes.

         <title>Directional Electron Flow in a Selenoviologen&#8208;Based Tetracationic Cyclophane for Enhanced Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of photocatalytic hydrogen production is constrained by the rate of electron transfer. This Article reports a novel selenoviologen&#8208;based tetracationic cyclophanes incorporating bipyridine Pt(II), which achieves directional electron flow from selenoviologen units to Pt unit for efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen production. This provides a new approach to enhancing the efficiency of electron transfer in photocatalysis.







Abstract
Directional electron flow in the photocatalyst enables efficient charge separation, which is essential for efficient photocatalysis of H2 production. Here, we report a novel class of tetracationic cyclophanes (7) incorporating bipyridine Pt(II) and selenoviologen. X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal structures reveal that 7 not only fixes the distances and spatial positions between its individual units but also exhibits a box&#8208;like rigid electron&#8208;deficient cavity. Moreover, host&#8211;guest recognition phenomena are observed between 7 and ferrocene, forming host&#8211;guest complexes with a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry. 7 exhibits good redox properties, narrow energy gaps, and strong absorption in the visible range (370&#8211;500&#8197;nm) due to containing two selenoviologen (SeV2+) units. Meanwhile, the femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) reveals that 7 has stabilized dicationic biradical, efficient charge separation, and facilitates directional electron flow to achieve efficient electron transfer due to the formation of rigid cyclophane and electronic architecture. Then, 7 is applied to visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution with high hydrogen production (132&#8197;&#956;mol), generation rate (11&#8197;&#956;mol/h), turnover number (221), and apparent quantum yield (1.7&#8201;%), which provides a simplified and efficient photocatalytic strategy for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Helix&#8208;Sense&#8208;Selective Memory Polymerization of Biphenylylacetylenes Bearing Carboxy and Amino Groups in Water</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization of achiral monomers with carboxy and amino groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively, was developed for the rapid synthesis of one&#8208;handed helicity&#8208;memorized polymers. The carboxy&#8208;bound polymer forms a cholesteric liquid crystal in water, in which basic achiral dyes further co&#8208;assemble to form helical aggregates showing induced circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
We report the helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective memory polymerization (HSMP) of achiral biphenylylacetylenes bearing carboxy and amino pendant groups in the presence of basic and acidic chiral guests in water, respectively. The HSMP proceeds in a highly helix&#8208;sense&#8208;selective manner driven by noncovalent chiral ionic interactions between the monomers and guests under kinetic control, producing the one&#8208;handed helical polymers with a static memory of helicity in one&#8208;pot during the polymerization in a very short time, accompanied by amplification of asymmetry. The carboxy&#8208;bound helicity&#8208;memorized polymer self&#8208;assembles into a cholesteric liquid crystal in concentrated water, in which a variety of basic achiral fluorophores further co&#8208;assembles to form supramolecular helical aggregates that exhibit an induced circularly polarized luminescence in a color tunable manner.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;canonical Tryptophan Variants via Rh&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H Functionalization of Anilines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tryptophan and its non&#8208;canonical variants play critical roles in pharmaceutical molecules and enzymes. Facile access to this privileged class of amino acids from readily available building blocks remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, we report a regioselective synthesis of non&#8208;canonical tryptophans bearing C4&#8208;C7 substituents via Rh&#8208;catalyzed annulation between structurally diverse tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)&#8208;protected anilines and alkynyl chlorides readily prepared from amino acid building blocks. This transformation harnesses Boc&#8208;directed C&#8211;H metalation and demetalation to afford a wide range of C2&#8208;unsubstituted indole products in a redox&#8208;neutral fashion. This umpolung approach compared to the classic Larock indole synthesis offers a novel mechanism for heteroarene annulation and will be useful for the synthesis of natural products and drug molecules containing non&#8208;canonical tryptophan residues in a highly regioselective manner.</dc:description>

         <title>A Tandem Catalysis for Isoindolinone Synthesis over Single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing an efficient strategy to replace the conventional synthesis method for producing isoindolinone (IIO) scaffold, a crucial structural motif for constructing pharmaceutical molecules, remains to be a great challenge. Herein, a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 tandem catalysis has been developed for the IIO scaffold synthesis by using readily available phthalic anhydride (PA), ammonia, and H2. The single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates superior catalytic performance, achieving a PA conversion of 99%, an IIO selectivity of 91%, and a turnover frequency (TOF) up to 4807 h&#8208;1. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the tandem catalysis between TiO2 support and single&#8208;atom Pd. The TiO2 efficiently catalyzes the conversion of PA with ammonia to form phthalimide (PAM), subsequently transformed into IIO over TiO2 through the reaction of PAM with NH3 and the spillover hydrogen species derived from single&#8208;atom Pd. Notably, NH3 functions not only as a reactant but also as a promoter to accelerate the reduction of amides combined with the Pd/TiO2 catalyst. This tandem catalysis of a single&#8208;atom Pd/TiO2 catalyst provides a promising strategy for the synthesis of the crucial IIO platform molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction Polymerization of CO2 with Phenylene Silanes Cata&#8208;lyzed by Single Component B(C6F5)3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO2 is an abundant C1 resource but a green&#8208;house gas and chemically inert. Thus, its utilization has been a promising but challenging project. Herein, we report the unprecedented polymerization of CO2 and C6H4(SiMe2H)2 using B(C6F5)3 alone under mild conditions to give poly(silphenylene siloxane) accompanied by releasing CH4. The copolymerization can be extended to comonomers of phenylene silanes bearing functional groups. Moreover, it combines with Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction to establish a tandem polymerization system to achieve super thermal resistant poly(siloxane&#8208;co&#8208;silphenylene siloxane)s. Density functional theory reveals that B(C6F5)3 is activated by silanes to form free HB(C6F5)2, which is the true active species for CO2 reducing to borylformate, the rate controlling step of the polymerization procedure. The subsequent multiple reductions of borylformate to CH4 and the step&#8208;growth to poly(silphenylene siloxane)s can be fulfilled by both B(C6F5)3 and HB(C6F5)2, and the former shows a slightly higher activity. This work opens a new avenue of utilizing CO2 to fabricate polysiloxanes that is unable to access using current manners.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Structural Phase Transitions in Zero&#8208;dimensional Cu(I)&#8208;Based Metal Halides for Dynamically Tunable Emissions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploring structural phase transitions and luminescence mechanisms in Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) metal halides poses significant challenges, that are crucial for unlocking the full potential of tunable optical properties and diversifying their functional capabilities. Herein, we have designed two inter&#8208;transformable 0D Cu(I)&#8208;based metal halides, namely (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6, through distinct synthesis conditions utilizing identical reactants. Their optical properties and luminescence mechanisms were systematically elucidated by experiments combined with density functional theory calculations. The bright cyan&#8208;fluorescent (C19H18P)2CuI3 with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 77% is attributed to the self&#8208;trapped exciton emission. Differently, the broad yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence of (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 displays a remarkable PLQY of 83%. Its luminescence mechanism is mainly attributed to the combined effects of metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer and cluster&#8208;centered charge transfer, which effects stem from the strong Cu&#8208;Cu bonding interactions in the (Cu4I6)2&#8208; clusters. Moreover, (C19H18P)2CuI3 and (C19H18P)2Cu4I6 exhibit reversible structural phase transitions. The elucidation of the phase transitions mechanism has paved the way for an unforgeable anti&#8208;counterfeiting system. This system dynamically shifts between cyan and yellow&#8208;orange fluorescence, triggered by the phase transitions, bolstering security and authenticity. This work enriches the luminescence theory of 0D metal halides, offering novel strategies for optical property modulation and fostering optical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Release&#8208;Driven Electrochemical Skeletal Rearrangement of Non&#8208;Biased Alkyl Cyclopropanes/butanes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Capitalizing the inherent strain energy within molecules, strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven reactions have been widely employed in organic synthesis. Small cycloalkanes like cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes, with their moderate ring strain, typically require dense functionalization to induce bias or distal activation of (hetero)aromatic rings via single&#8208;electron oxidation for relieving the tension. In this study, we present a pioneering direct activation of alkyl cyclopropanes/butanes through electrochemical oxidation. This approach not only showcases the potential for ring&#8208;opening of cyclopropane/butane under electrochemical conditions but also streamlines the synthesis of diverse oxazolines and oxazines. The applicability of our method is exemplified by its broad substrate scopes. Notably, the products derived from cyclobutanes undergo a formal ring contraction to cyclopropanes, introducing an intriguing aspect to our discoveries. These discoveries mark a significant advancement in strain&#8208;release&#8208;driven skeletal rearrangement reactions of moderately strained rings, offering sustainable and efficient synthetic pathways for future endeavours.</dc:description>

         <title>A urease&#8208;based pH photoswitch: a general route to light&#8208;to&#8208;pH transduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New approaches for the integration of chemical and physical stimuli to control the dynamics of artificial enzymatic reaction networks (ERNs) are needed. Here, we present a general approach to convert a light stimulus into a time&#8208;programmed pH response. We developed and characterized a panel of photoswitchable inhibitors of&#160; urease. Urease activity, now regulated by light via the photoinhibitors, leads to an increase in pH upon hydrolysis of urea into ammonia. Careful choice of characteristics of light, and concentrations of enzyme, substrate, and photoinhibitor, allowed us to control the timing of the pH transition. Furthermore, as all enzymes have an activity&#8211;pH profile, the urease photoinhibitor system can be used to regulate the activities of other enzymes in small reaction networks.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) has obtained widespread concern for photovoltaic applications as a light absorber due to superior photoelectric features. Accordingly, various deposition technologies have been developed in recent years, especially hydrothermal deposition method, which has achieved a great success. However, device performances are limited with severe carrier recombination, relating to the quality of absorber and interfaces. Herein, bulk and interface defects are simultaneously suppressed by regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics with barium dibromide (BaBr2) introduction. In details, the Br adsorbs and dopes on the polar planes of cadmium sulfide (CdS) buffer layer, promoting the exposure of nonpolar planes of CdS, which facilitates the favorable growth of [hk1]&#8208;Sb2(S,Se)3 films possessing superior crystallinity and small interface defects. Additionally, the Se/S ratio is increased due to the replacement of S/Se by Br, causing a downshift of the Fermi levels with a benign band alignment and a shallow&#8208;level defect. Moreover, Ba2+ is located at grain boundaries by coordination with S and Se ions, passivating grain boundary defects. Consequently, the efficiency is increased from 7.70% to 10.12%. This work opens an avenue towards regulating the heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of Sb2(S,Se)3 film deposited via hydrothermal deposition approach to optimize its crystalline orientation and defect features.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrow Alkane Product Distribution in Polyethylene Waste Hydrocracking by Zeolite Micropore Diffusion Optimization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastic pollution poses a pressing environmental challenge in modern society. Chemical catalytic conversion offers a promising solution for upgrading waste plastics into valuable liquid alkanes and other high value products. However, the current methods yield mixed products with a broad carbon distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce a tandem catalytic system that features matched acidic sites and confined metals for the conversion of low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE) into liquid alkanes. This system achieves a liquid alkane yield of 94.0%, with 84.8% of C5&#8208;C7 light alkanes. Combined with in situ FTIR and molecular dynamics simulation, the shape&#8208;selective mechanisms is elucidated, which ensures that only olefins of the appropriate size can diffuse to the encapsulated Pt sites within the zeolite for hydrogenation, resulting in an ultra&#8208;narrow product distribution. Furthermore, due to the rapid diffusion of olefins within the hierarchical zeolite, the catalyst exhibits higher catalytic efficiency and resistance to coking tendency. Our findings contribute to the design of efficient catalysts for plastic waste valorization.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Chiral Calix[4]arenes with Both Inherent and Axial Chirality via Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Intermolecular C&#8211;H Annulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inherently chiral calixarenes have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties, yet the development of efficient catalytic asymmetric synthesis methods remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report the asymmetric synthesis of calix[4]arenes featuring inherent or both inherent and axial chirality via a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation/annulation strategy in high yield with excellent enantio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity (up to &gt; 99% ee and &gt; 20:1 dr). Electrooxidation was also suitable for this transformation to obviate the sacrificial metal oxidants, underscoring the environmentally friendly potential of this approach. A key octahedral cobaltacycle intermediate was synthesized and characterized, providing valuable insights into the mode of enantio&#8208; and diastereocontrol of this protocol. Noteworthy photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 0.94 were measured, underscoring the potential of these compounds in the domain of organic fluorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Propylene/Propane Separation via Aniline&#8208;Decorated ZIF&#8208;8 Membrane: Lattice Rigidity Adjustment and Adsorption Site Introduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes excel in molecular separation, attracting significant research interest. The crystallographic microstructure and selective adsorption capacity of MOFs closely correlate with their gas separation performance. Here, aniline was added to the ZIF&#8208;8 synthesis in varying concentrations. Aniline, encapsulated within ZIF&#8208;8 cavities, interacts strongly with the 2&#8208;methylimidazole linker, resulting in both a shift in crystallographic phase from I_43m to Cm in Rietveld refinement of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and the selective adsorption behavior between propylene and propane. Consequently, an aniline decorative ZIF&#8208;8 (Anix&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8) membrane was prepared using a fast current&#8208;driven synthesis method, which exhibits good propylene/propane separation selectivity of up to 85. Calculation of the interaction energy between aniline and the various crystallographic phases of ZIF&#8208;8 using density functional theory (DFT) further verifies that aniline not only promotes the formation of crystallographic Cm phase, but also enhances the adsorption selectivity of propylene over propane.&#160;Aniline modification effectively tunes the crystallographic microstructure of ZIF&#8208;8, thereby, improving molecular sieving capabilities.</dc:description>

         <title>Intrinsic Activity Identification of Noble Metal Single&#8208;Sites for Electrocatalytic Chlorine Evolution</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;atom catalysts with maximal atom&#8208;utilization have emerged as promising alternatives for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) toward valuable Cl2 production. However, understanding their intrinsic CER activity have so far been plagued due to the lack of well&#8208;defined atomic structure controlling. Herein, we prepare and identify a series of atomically dispersed noble metals (e.g., Pt, Ir, Ru) in nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M1&#8211;N&#8211;C) with an identical M&#8211;N4 moiety, which allows objective activity evaluation. Electrochemical experiments, operando Raman spectroscopy, and quasi&#8208;in situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses collectively reveal that all the three M1&#8211;N&#8211;C proceed the CER via a direct Cl&#8208;mediated Vomer&#8208;Heyrovsk&#253; mechanism with reactivity following the trend of Pt1&#8211;N&#8211;C &gt; Ir1&#8211;N&#8211;C &gt; Ru1&#8211;N&#8211;C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that this activity trend is governed by the binding strength of Cl*&#8211;Cl intermediate (&#916;GCl*&#8211;Cl) on M&#8211;N4 sites (Pt &lt; Ir &lt; Ru) featuring distinct d&#8208;band centers, providing a reliable thermodynamic descriptor for rational design of single metal sites toward Cl2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Efficiency and Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells through Solution&#8208;Processed and Structurally Ordered Fullerene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron transporting layer (ETL) used in high performance inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is typically composed of C60, which requires time&#8208;consuming and costly thermal evaporation deposition, posing a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale production. To address this challenge, herein, we present a novel design of solution&#8208;processible electron transporting material (ETM) by grafting a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor fragment onto C60. The synthesized BTPC60 exhibits an exceptional solution processability and well&#8208;organized molecular stacking pattern, enabling the formation of uniform and structurally ordered film with high electron mobility. When applied as ETL in inverted PSCs, BTPC60 not only exhibits excellent interfacial contact with the perovskite layer, resulting in enhanced electron extraction and transfer efficiency, but also effectively passivates the interfacial defects to suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. Resultant BTPC60&#8208;based inverted PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.3% and retain almost 90% of the initial values after aging at 85&#176;C for 1500 hours in N2. More encouragingly, the solution&#8208;processed BTPC60 ETL demonstrates remarkable film thickness tolerance, and enables a high PCE up to 24.8% with the ETL thickness of 200 nm. Our results highlight BTPC60 as a promising solution&#8208;processed fullerene&#8208;based ETM, opening an avenue for improving the scalability of efficient and stable inverted PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of Methyl Glycolide with Bifunctional Organocatalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A bifunctional thiourea&#8208;amine&#8208;based organocatalyst (Takemoto&#8217;s catalyst), employing a metal&#8208;free approach, is presented for the regioselective ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of optically active (D and L) methyl glycolide (MG). In this study, a chiral version of Takemoto&#8217;s catalyst efficiently promotes the ROP of MG at room temperature, yielding poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acids) (PLGAs) with predicted molecular weights and narrow polydispersity indices (PDI&#8804;1.2). These PLGAs exhibit highly alternating structures without transesterification, as confirmed by 1H NMR, SEC, and MALDI&#8208;TOF analyses. Additionally, various macromolecular architectures, including linear and star&#8208;shaped PLGAs, were successfully synthesized using corresponding multi&#8208;functional alcohol initiators while maintaining the same alternating structures and regioselectivity with PLGA obtained from benzyl alcohol as initiator. Computational studies were conducted to elucidate the mechanism of alternating PLGA formation, revealing two key transition states (TSs): TS&#8208;1, which implicates the nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the initiator or propagating chain on the carbonyl carbon of MG, and TS&#8208;2, which involves the subsequent ring&#8208;opening of the cyclic ester. The results indicate that ring&#8208;opening occurs at both the glycolyl and lactyl sites, with a preference for the glycolyl site, as supported by experimental results. The resulting atactic PLGAs are amorphous, rendering them suitable for drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Multi&#8208;exciton Zero&#8208;dimensional Antimony&#8208;based Metal Halides for White&#8208;light Emission and &#946;&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emission, typified by antimony (Sb), with broadband characteristics, represents the next generation of materials for solid&#8208;state lighting and radiation detection. However, little is known about the multiexciton behavior of the Sb emission center. Here, we proposed a general approach for designing antimony&#8208;centered multi&#8208;exciton emitting materials through self&#8208;assembly. Benefitting from controllable multiexciton behavior, dual&#8208;band white light emission spanning the entire visible spectrum was achieved. Relying on the reduction of an effective atomic number brought by self&#8208;assembly, excellent scintillation response to &#946;&#8208;rays was attained. This study offers unprecedented insight into hybrid single/triple STE emission and unveils new avenues for single&#8208;emitter white&#8208;light emission, as well as radiographic testing using low&#8208;risk &#946;&#8208;rays as sources.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Coordinate Gold(I) Complex with Rotational Freedom: A Platform Integrating Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence, Polymorphism, and Linearly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;coordinate coinage metal complexes have been exploited for various applications. Herein, a new donor&#8208;metal&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;M&#8208;A) complex PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT, using bulky pyrazine&#8208;fused N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (PZI) and trioxytriphenylamine (TOT) ligands, was synthesized. PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT displays decent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with a quantum yield of 93% in doped film. The crystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT show simultaneous TADF, polymorphism, and linearly polarized luminescence (LPL). The polymorph&#8208;dependent emission properties with widely varied peaks from 560 to 655 nm are attributed to different packing modes in terms of isolated monomers, discrete &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked dimers or dimer PLUS. Two well&#8208;defined microcrystals of PZI&#8208;Au&#8208;TOT exhibit linearly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence with a degree of polarization up to 0.64. This work demonstrates that the molecular rotational flexibility of D&#8208;M&#8208;A type complexes endows an integration of multiple functions into one complex through manipulation of supramolecular aggregation. This type of complexes is expected to serve as a versatile platform for the fabrication of crystal materialsfor advanced photonic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Clar's Aromatic &#960;&#8208;Sextet Rule for the Construction of Red Multiple Resonance Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the proliferation of multiple resonance (MR) materials in the blue to green spectral ranges, red MR emitters remain scarce in the literature, an area that certainly warrants attention for future applications. Here, through a clever application of classic Clar's aromatic &#960;&#8208;sextet rule, we triumphantly constructed the first red MR emitter by substituting the conventional benzene ring core with anthracene (fewer &#960;&#8208;sextets). Theoretical studies indicate that the quantity of &#960;&#8208;sextets ultimately determines the optical bandgap of a molecule, rather than the number of fused benzene rings. Benefiting from the high photoluminescence quantum yield of ~94% and horizontal dipole ratio of ~90%, the corresponding narrowband red (luminescence wavelength: 608 nm) organic light&#8208;emitting diode shows a high external quantum efficiency of 27.3%, with only a slight decrease of 3.7% at an elevated luminance level of 100,000 cd/m2.</dc:description>

         <title>Zincophilic Sites Enriched Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Organic Framework as Multifunctional Regulating Interfacial Layers for Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To construct an efficient regulating layer for Zn anodes that can simultaneously address the issues of dendritic growth and side reactions is highly demanded for stable zinc metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, we fabricate a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) enriched with zincophilic sites as a multifunctional layer to regulate Zn anodes with controlled spatial ion flux and stable interfacial chemistry (MA&#8208;BTA@Zn). The framework with abundant H&#8208;bonds helps capture H2O and remove the solvated shells on [Zn(H2O)6]2+, leading to suppressed side reactions. The HOF layer also helps form electrolyte&#8208;philic surfaces and expose Zn (002) crystal planes which benefit for rapid conduction and uniform deposition of Zn2+, and weakened sides reactions. Additionally, the electrochemically active zincophilic sites (C=O, &#8208;NH2 and triazine groups) favor the targeted guidance and penetration of Zn2+ and provide advantageous sites for uniform Zn deposition. High Young&#8217;s modulus of the HOF layer further contributes to a high interfacial flexibility and stability against Zn plating&#8208;associated stress. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn symmetric cells thereby obtain a substantially extended battery life over 1000 h at 4 mA cm&#8208;2. The MA&#8208;BTA@Zn||Cu half&#8208;cell demonstrates a highly reversible Zn stripping/plating process over 1500 cycles with impressive average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 10 mA cm&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Enantioselective Synthesis of Planar Chiral Pillar[5]arenes via Asymmetric Sonogashira Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a novel type of macrocycles with attractive planar chirality, pillar[5]arenes have gained increasing research interest over the past decades, enabling their widespread applications in diverse fields such as porous materials, molecular machines, and chiral luminescence materials. However, the catalytic methodology towards the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes remains elusive. Here we report a novel method for the enantioselective synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes via asymmetric Sonogashira coupling, giving access to a wide range of highly functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, including both homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;rimmed ones, with excellent enantioselectivities. Attractively, the resultant planar chiral pillar[5]arenes show great potential for widespread use in many areas such as chiral luminescent materials. This work not only enables the successful synthesis of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes with abundant structural and functional diversity as key building blocks for practical applications but also enriches the asymmetric cross&#8208;coupling methodologies in organic synthetic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>An n&#8208;doping cross&#8208;linkable quinoidal compound as a new type of electron transport material for fully stretchable inverted organic solar cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photocatalytic activity and inherent brittleness of ZnO, which is commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), have impeded advancements in device stability and the development of fully stretchable OSCs. In this study, we have developed an intrinsically stretchable ETL for inverted OSCs through a side&#8208;chain cross&#8208;linking strategy. Specifically, cross&#8208;linking between bromine atoms on the side chains of a quinoidal compound and the amino groups in polyethylenimine resulted in a film, designated QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50, with high electrical conductivity (0.049 S/m) and excellent stretchability (crack&#8208;onset strain &gt;45%). When used as the ETL in inverted OSCs, QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 was markedly superior to ZnO in terms of device performance and stability, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27% and a T80 lifetime exceeding 10000 h. Moreover, incorporation of QBr&#8208;PEI&#8208;50 in fully stretchable inverted OSCs yielded a PCE of 14.01%, and 80% of the initial PCE was maintained after 21% strain, showcasing its potential for wearable electronics.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The photocatalytic activity and inherent brittleness of ZnO, which is commonly used as an electron transport layer (ETL) in inverted organic solar cells (OSCs), have impeded advancements in device stability and the development of fully stretchable OSCs. In this study, we have developed an intrinsically stretchable ETL for inverted OSCs through a side-chain cross-linking strategy. Specifically, cross-linking between bromine atoms on the side chains of a quinoidal compound and the amino groups in polyethylenimine resulted in a film, designated QBr-PEI-50, with high electrical conductivity (0.049 S/m) and excellent stretchability (crack-onset strain &amp;gt;45%). When used as the ETL in inverted OSCs, QBr-PEI-50 was markedly superior to ZnO in terms of device performance and stability, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.27% and a T80 lifetime exceeding 10000 h.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Ferrocene&#8208;Based Chiral Overcrowded Alkene Twisting Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reversible modulation of chirality has gained significant attention not only for fundamental stereochemical studies but also for numerous applications ranging from liquid crystals (LCs) to molecular motors and machines. This requires the construction of switchable molecules with (multiple) chiral elements in a highly enantioselective manner, which is often a significant synthetic challenge. Here, we show that the dimerization of an easily accessible enantiopure planar chiral ferrocene&#8208;indanone building block affords a multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive dimer (FcD) with pre&#8208;determined double bond geometry, helical chirality, and relative orientation of the two ferrocene motifs in high yield. This intrinsically planar chiral switch can not only undergo thermal or photochemical E/Z isomerization but can also be reversibly and quantitatively oxidized to both a monocationic and a dicationic state which is associated with significant changes in its (chir)optical properties. Specifically, FcD acts as a chiral dopant for cholesteric LCs with a helical twisting power (HTP) of 13 &#181;m&#8722;1 which, upon oxidation, drops to near zero, resulting in an unprecedently large redox&#8208;tuning of the LC reflection color by up to 84 nm. Due to the straightforward stereoselective synthesis, FcD, and related chiral switches, are envisioned to be powerful building blocks for multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular machines and in LC&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Landscape of Phosphorous&#8208;Based Open Shell Species: Stable Mono&#8208;, Di&#8208;, and Trianionic Radicals Based on a Contorted Triphosphaalkene</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stepwise reduction of the highly contorted truxene&#8208;based triphosphaalkene 1 using KC8 led to the isolation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;and tri&#8208;anionic species. The solid&#8208;state molecular structures of mono&#8208; and diradical anionic species were elucidated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions, revealing elongated P&#8208;C bonds and a pronounced &#8220;indene&#8221; aromatization compared to the parent system. All three radical species displayed distinct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra, providing compelling evidence for the open&#8208;shell electronic configuration of both the diradical and triradical species&#8212;an observation unprecedented in any previously reported phosphorous&#8208;based anionic polyradicals. Mulliken spin density calculations revealed a dominant localization of radical spin on a single phosphorous atom in the monoanion. In the dianion, spin localization is observed on two phosphorous atoms (~34% each), with a minor contribution from the third phosphorous (0.13%), while the trianion demonstrates a uniform distribution of spin density (~30%) across each phosphorous atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Cycloadditions in the Solid State via Supramolecular Assembly</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical reactions conducted in the solid phase (specifically, crystalline) are much less numerous than solution reactions, primarily due to reduced motion, flexibility, and reactivity. The main advantage of crystalline&#8208;state transformations is that reactant molecules can be designed to self&#8208;assemble into specific spatial arrangements, often leading to high control over product regiochemistry and/or stereochemistry. In crystalline&#8208;phase transformations, typically only one type of reaction occurs, and a sacrificial template molecule is frequently used to facilitate self&#8208;assembly, similar to a catalyst or enzyme. Here, we demonstrate the first system designed to undergo two chemically unique and orthogonal cycloaddition reactions simultaneously within a single crystalline solid. Well&#8208;controlled supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of two molecules containing different reactive moieties affords orthogonal reactivity without use of a sacrificial template. Using only UV light, the simultaneous [2+2] and [4+4] cycloadditions are achieved regiospecifically, stereospecifically, and products are obtained in high yield, whereas a simultaneous solution&#8208;state reaction affords a mixture of isomers in low yield. Application of dually&#8208;reactive systems toward (supra)molecular solar thermal storage materials is also discussed. This work demonstrates fundamental chemical approaches for orthogonal reactivity in the crystalline state and highlights the complexity and reversibility that can be achieved with supramolecular design.</dc:description>

         <title>Accelerated Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer via Engineering Palladium Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters for Scalable Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrosynthesis of H2O2 from oxygen reduction reaction via a two&#8208;electron pathway is vital as an alternative for the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, this process is largely hindered in neutral and alkaline conditions due to sluggish kinetics associated with the transformation of intermediate O2* into OOH* via proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer sourced from slow water dissociation. Herein, we developed Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters on the nickel ditelluride nanosheets (Pd SNCs/NiTe2) to enhance the performance of H2O2 electrosynthesis. The newly&#8208;developed Pd SNCs/NiTe2 exhibited a H2O2 selectivity of as high as 99% and a positive shift of onset potential up to 0.81 V. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental studies (e.g., X&#8208;ray absorption and attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared spectra measurements) revealed that the Pd sub&#8208;nanoclusters supported by NiTe2 nanosheets efficiently reduced the energy barrier of water dissociation to generate more protons, facilitating the proton feeding kinetics. When used in a flow cell, Pd SNCs/NiTe2 cathode efficiently produced H2O2 with a maximum yield rate of 1.75 mmol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and current efficiency of 95% at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. Further, an accumulated H2O2 concentration of 1.43 mol L&#8208;1 was reached after 10 hours of continuous electrolysis, showing the potential for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimeric metal sites (DiMSs) in carbon&#8208;based single atom catalysts (SACs) offer distinct advantages in optimizing the adsorption energies of the catalytic intermediates and reaction pathways over single atom sites, and thus inspires the investigations on the rational design of DiMSs&#8208;based SACs and the accurate discernment of catalytic mechanisms. Here, dimeric Fe sites on carbon blacks (DiFe&#8208;N/CBs) are prepared using the precursor of metal&#8208;organic complex with a controlled structure, and the rigid ligand confinement secures the preservation of dimeric Fe sites during the thermal treatment. DiFe&#8208;N/CBs shows excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.917 V, and excellent durability with negligible activity decay. Theoretical studies reveal that the dimeric Fe sites have an optimal adsorption of OOH* with the Yeager&#8208;type binding, illustrating the advantages of DiMSs over SAs in catalyzing ORR. The rechargeable aqueous and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air battery assembled using DiFe&#8208;N/CBs&#8208;based air cathodes achieve small voltage gaps after long term charge/discharge test, showing great promises for practical applications.

         <title>Anilines Formation via Molybdenum&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Reaction of Ynones with Allylic Amines</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multi&#8208;substituted anilines are widely found in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science. The quest for robust and efficient methods to construct a diverse array of these compounds using readily accessible starting materials under simple reaction conditions is of utmost importance. Here, we report an unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of 2,4&#8208;di and 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted anilines.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The multi-substituted anilines are widely found in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science. The quest for robust and efficient methods to construct a diverse array of these compounds using readily accessible starting materials under simple reaction conditions is of utmost importance. Here, we report an unprecedented and efficient approach for the synthesis of 2,4-di and 2,4,6-trisubstituted anilines. With a simple molybdenum(VI) catalyst, a wide range of 2,4-di and 2,4,6-trisubstituted anilines were efficiently prepared in generally good to excellent yields from readily accessible ynones and allylic amines. The synthetic potential of this methodology was further underscored by its applications in several synthetic transformations, gram-scale reactions, and derivatization of bioactive molecules. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggested that this aniline formation might involve a cascade of aza-Michael addition, [1, 6]-proton shift, cyclization, dehydration, 6&#960;-electrocyclization, and aromatization. This novel strategy provided a robust, simple, and modular approach for the syntheses of various valuable di- or trisubstituted anilines, some of which were otherwise challenging to access.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Amine Complex&#8208;Mediated Intramolecular Coupling of Gallates: A Bioinspired Solution to the Atroposelective Synthesis of Ellagitannins.</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total syntheses of the C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannins (&#8722;)&#8208;punicacortein A, (&#8722;)&#8208;epipunicacortein A and (+)&#8208;castalin were accomplished for the first time, and those of the glucopyranosic ellagitannins (+)&#8208;tellimagrandin I and (+)&#8208;pedunculagin were revisited. The atroposelective construction of their characteristic hexahydroxydiphenoyl (HHDP) and nonahydroxyterphenoyl (NHTP) units relied on the use of different cupric&#8208;amine complexes under different reaction conditions to mediate the intramolecular dehydrogenative coupling of galloyl groups at different positions of glucose cores. In particular, the monodentate n&#8208;butylamine and the bidentate (&#8211;)&#8208;sparteine were found to be complementary in their capacity to promote the regio&#8208; and atroposelective coupling of galloyl groups on a 4C1&#8208;glucopyranosic core into 2,3&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208; and/or 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HHDP units. Furthermore, replacing (&#8211;)&#8208;sparteine by its optical antipode not only counteracted the substrate&#8208;controlled induction of atroposelectivity to forge a 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP unit, but it also enabled a 4C1 to 1C4 ring flip of the glucopyranosic core and hence the formation of 2,4&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208; and 3,6&#8208;O&#8208;(R)&#8208;HHDP units, such as those featured in the glucopyranosic ellagitannins phyllanemblinin B and geraniin.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective and Enantioselective Hydrophosphinylations of Conjugated Enynes, Allenes and Dienes via Synergistic Pd/Co Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different from the reported work focusing on the construction of single P&#8208; or C&#8208;stereocenter via hydrophosphinylation of unsaturated carbon bonds, the highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation reaction of allenes, conjugated enynes and 1,3&#8208;dienes is achieved via a designed Pd/Co dual catalysis and newly modified masked phosphinylating reagent. A series of allyl motifs bearing both a tertiary C&#8208; and P&#8208;stereocenter are prepared in generally good yields, &gt;20:1 dr, &gt;20:1 rr and 99% ee. The unprecedented diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective hydrophosphinylation of 1,3&#8208;enynes is established to generate skeletons containing both a P&#8208;stereocenter and a nonadjacent chiral axis. The first stereodivergent hydrophosphinylation reaction is also developed to achieve all four P&#8208;containing stereoisomers. The present protocol features the use of only 3&#8208;minutes reaction time and 0.1% catalyst, and with the observation of up to 730 TON. A set of mechanistic studies reveal the necessity and roles of two metal catalysts and corroborate the designed synergistic process.</dc:description>

         <title>Evaluation of Active Oxygen Species Derived from&#160;Water Splitting for Electrocatalytic&#160;Organic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Active oxygen species (OH*/O*) derived from water electrolysis are essential for the electrooxidation of organic compounds into high&#8208;value chemicals, which can determine activity and selectivity, whereas the relationship between them remains unclear. Herein, using glycerol (GLY) electrooxidation as a model reaction, we systematically investigated the relationship between GLY oxidation activity and the formation energy of OH* (&#916;GOH*). We first identified that OH* on Au demonstrates the highest activity for GLY electrooxidation among various pure metals, based on experiments and density functional theory, and revealed that &#916;GOH* on Au&#8208;based alloys is influenced by the metallic composition of OH* coordination sites. Moreover, we observed a linear correlation between the adsorption energy of GLY (Eads) and the d&#8208;band center of Au&#8208;based alloys. Comprehensive microkinetic analysis further reveals a volcano relationship between GLY oxidation activity, the &#916;GOH* and the adsorption free energy of GLY (&#916;Gads). Notably, Au3Pd and Au3Ag alloys, positioned near the peak of the volcano plot, show excellent activity, attributed to their moderate &#916;GOH* and &#916;Gads, striking a balance that is neither too high nor too low. This research provides theoretical insights into modulating active oxygen species from water electrolysis to enhance organic electrooxidation reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A high&#8208;efficiency PtZnCd nanozyme was screened with density functional theory (DFT) and unique d&#8208;orbital coupling features for sensitive enrichment and real&#8208;time analysis of CO&#8208;releasing molecule&#8208;3 (CORM&#8208;3). Multi&#8208;catalytic sites in the nanozyme showed a high reactivity of up to 72.89 min&#8208;1 for peroxidase&#8208;like enzymes (POD) reaction, which was 2.2, 4.07, and 14.67 times higher than that of PtZn (32.67 min&#8208;1), PtCd (17.89 min&#8208;1), and Pt (4.97 min&#8208;1), respectively. Normalization of the catalytic sites showed that the catalytic capacity of the active site in PtZnCd was 2.962 U &#956;mol&#8208;1, which was four times higher than that of pure Pt site (0.733 U &#956;mol&#8208;1). DFT calculations showed that improved d&#8208;orbital coupling between different metals reduces the position of the center of the shifted whole d&#8208;band relative to the Fermi energy level, thereby increasing the contribution of the sites to the electron transfer from the active center, accompanied with enhanced substrate adsorption and intermediate conversion in the catalytic process. The potential adsorption principle and color development mechanism of CORM&#8208;3 on PtZnCd were determined, and the practical application in drug metabolism was validated in vitro, in zebrafish and mice as a model, demonstrating that transition metal doping effectively engineers high&#8208;performance nanozymes and optimizes artificial enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;performance Complementary Electrochromic Batteries using Nb18W16O93 by the Synergistic Effects of Aqueous Al3+/K+ Dual&#8208;ion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multivalent ions, especially Al3+ in aqueous electrolyte contributes to higher capacity and color contrast for more sustainable post&#8208;lithium electrochromism and energy storages. However, the lack of suitable cathodic and anodic electrochromic materials is a major challenge for Al&#8208;ion electrochromic batteries, which limits their optical contrast and lifespan. Herein, we report that Wadsley&#8208;Roth phase Nb18W16O93 with open structure achieves Al3+ intercalation/extraction reversibly. The complementary electrochromic energy storage devices based on Nb18W16O93 coupled with Prussian blue using hybrid Al3+/K+ aqueous electrolytes show a fast response, a high capacity and a large coloring efficiency. The superior performances are due to the cations of Al3+ and K+ selectively insert/extract in the electrode of Nb18W16O93 and Prussian blue, respectively. This work provides an effective strategy for high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrochromic batteries with higher sustainability.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Molecular crystals capable of colossal thermal expansion (TE) are fascinating owing to their substantial and continuous volume changes and reasonably linear responses to temperature. This makes them promising candidates for micromachine applications. Macroscopic motion is driven by subtle yet cooperative movements of molecules that respond to the thermal motions of dynamic functional units. The study of p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB presented here offers a compelling case highlighting the relationship between the degree of dynamicity of functional units and TE behavior. In its &#945;&#8208;phase, the p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB crystal undergoes an irreversible martensitic transition to the &#946;&#8208;phase, accompanied by significant cooperative interlayer shear. This process substantially enhances the mobility of the side&#8208;chains driven by the increased free volume surrounding them. This nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient from 255.3 (10) to 444.9 (32) MK&#8208;1, particularly in the actuation direction from 175.0 (7) to 291.7 (20) MK&#8208;1, enabling about 4.5% elongation/contraction. As demonstrated here, p&#8208;TIPS&#8208;DSB exhibits a decent force density (&gt; 1.4 &#215; 107 N m&#8208;3) and precise motion control capabilities due to its hysteresis&#8208;free and non&#8208;abrupt TE nature. Furthermore, we demonstrated the limited operating distance of colossal TE materials can be amplified by utilizing levers, highlighting the high potential of these materials for use in micromachines.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular crystals capable of colossal thermal expansion (TE) are fascinating owing to their substantial and continuous volume changes and reasonably linear responses to temperature. This makes them promising candidates for micromachine applications. Macroscopic motion is driven by subtle yet cooperative movements of molecules that respond to the thermal motions of dynamic functional units. The study of p-TIPS-DSB presented here offers a compelling case highlighting the relationship between the degree of dynamicity of functional units and TE behavior. In its &#945;-phase, the p-TIPS-DSB crystal undergoes an irreversible martensitic transition to the &#946;-phase, accompanied by significant cooperative interlayer shear. This process substantially enhances the mobility of the side-chains driven by the increased free volume surrounding them. This nearly doubles the volumetric TE coefficient from 255.3 (10) to 444.9 (32) MK-1, particularly in the actuation direction from 175.0 (7) to 291.7 (20) MK-1, enabling about 4.5% elongation/contraction. As demonstrated here, p-TIPS-DSB exhibits a decent force density (&amp;gt; 1.4 &#215; 107 N m-3) and precise motion control capabilities due to its hysteresis-free and non-abrupt TE nature. Furthermore, we demonstrated the limited operating distance of colossal TE materials can be amplified by utilizing levers, highlighting the high potential of these materials for use in micromachines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anodic Commodity Polymer Recycling: The Merger of Iron&#8208;Electrocatalysis with Scalable Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are omnipresent in our everyday life, and accumulation of post&#8208;consumer plastic waste in our environment represents a major societal challenge. Hence, methods for plastic waste recycling are in high demand for a future circular economy. Specifically, the degradation of post&#8208;consumer polymers towards value&#8208;added small molecules constitutes a sustainable strategy for a carbon circular economy. Despite of recent advances, chemical polymer degradation continues to be largely limited to chemical redox agents or low energy efficiency in photochemical processes. We herein report a powerful iron&#8208;catalyzed degradation of high molecular weight polystyrenes through electrochemistry to efficiently deliver monomeric benzoyl products. The robustness of the ferraelectrocatalysis was mirrored by the degradation of various real&#8208;life post&#8208;consumer plastics, also on gram scale. The cathodic half reaction was largely represented by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The scalable electro&#8208;polymer degradation could be solely fueled by solar energy through a commercially available solar panel, indicating an outstanding potential for a decentralized green hydrogen economy.</dc:description>
