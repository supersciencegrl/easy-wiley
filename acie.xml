         <title>Somalactams A&#8211;D: Anti&#8208;inflammatory Macrolide Lactams with Unique Ring Systems from an Arctic Actinomycete Strain</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four new PKS&#8208;NRPS&#8208;derived macrolide lactams (1&#8211;4) with three unique ring fusion types were discovered from the Arctic sponge&#8208;associated actinomycete Streptomyces somaliensis 1107 using a genome mining strategy. Their structures were elucidated by a combination of HRESIMS, NMR spectroscopic analyses, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. Biosynthetically, a novel gene cluster sml consisting of three polyketide synthases and one hybrid polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase together with cytochrome P450s and flavin&#8208;containing monooxygenases and oxidoreductases was demonstrated to assemble the unique skeleton. Pharmacological studies revealed that compound 1 displayed a potent anti&#8208;inflammatory effect without cytotoxicity. It inhibited IL&#8208;6 and TNF&#8208;&#945; release in the serum of LPS&#8208;stimulated RAW264.7 macrophage cells with IC50 values of 5.76 and 0.18 &#181;M, respectively, and modulated the MAPK pathway. Moreover, compound 1 alleviated LPS&#8208;induced systemic inflammation in our transgenic fluorescent zebrafish model.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Norbornene as a Novel Hydrophobic Tag Applied in Protein Degradation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrophobic tagging (HyT) is a potential therapeutic strategy for targeted protein degradation (TPD). Norbornene was discovered as an unprecedented hydrophobic tag in this study and was used to degrade the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein by linking it to ALK inhibitors. The most promising degrader, Hyt&#8208;9, potently reduced ALK levels through Hsp70 and the ubiquitin&#8210;proteasome system (UPS) in vitro without compensatory upregulation of ALK. Furthermore, Hyt&#8208;9 exhibited a significant tumor&#8208;inhibiting effect in vivo with moderate oral bioavailability. More importantly, norbornene can also be used to degrade the intractable enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) when tagged with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat. Thus, the discovery of novel hydrophobic norbornene tags shows promise for the future development of TPD technology.</dc:description>

         <title>A Biocompatible Probe for the Detection of Neutrophil Elastase Free from the Interference of Structural Changes and Its Application to Ratiometric Photoacoustic Imaging In Vivo</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible molecular probe, NEP3, for the detection of neutrophil elastase (NE), free from the interference of structural changes of NE, was developed. NEP3 was applied to the ratiometric photoacoustic (PA) and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of NE levels in vivo, providing a method for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.







Abstract
Neutrophil elastase (NE) plays a key role in chronic inflammation and acute responses to infection and injury. Effective disease interventions thus call for precise identification of NE to aid the clinical treatment of such diseases. However, the detection process suffers from the interference of structural changes of NE. Herein, we introduce a molecular probe with high biocompatibility to overcome the interference, which was achieved by combining theoretical calculations and experimental studies, that permits highly specific and sensitive detection of NE in cells and in vivo. The upregulated NE accumulation was specifically measured in inflammation by ratiometric photoacoustic and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence imaging, providing a new method for developing more specific fluorogenic probes for other enzymes.

         <title>Isoindolium&#8208;Based Allenes: Reactivity Studies and Applications in Fluorescence Temperature Sensing and Cysteine Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of a series of&#160;electron&#8208;deficient isoindolium&#8208;based allenes with sulfhydryl compounds has been studied, leading to the formation of isoindolium&#8208;based vinyl sulfides. The vinyl sulfides generated&#160;could be readily converted into the corresponding indanones and amines upon heating at 30 &#8208; 70 &#176;C with good yields up to 61%. The thermal cleavage reaction of vinyl sulfides was further studied for developing temperature&#8208;sensitive systems. Notably, a novel FRET&#8208;based fluorescent temperature sensor was designed and synthesized for temperature sensing at 50 &#176;C, giving a 6.5&#8208;fold blue fluorescence enhancement. Moreover, chemoselective bioconjugation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides with the isoindolium&#8208;based allenes for the construction of multifunctional peptide bioconjugates was investigated. Thermal cleavage of isoindoliums on the modified peptides at 35 &#8208; 70 &#176;C gave indanone bioconjugates with up to &gt;99% conversion. These results indicated the biocompatibility of this novel temperature&#8208;sensitive reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Switchable Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Absorbing Dye Based on Redox&#8208;Bistable Benzitetraazaporphyrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Activatable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes responsive to external stimuli are used in medical and other applications. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of bench&#8208;stable 18&#960;&#8208; and 20&#960;&#8208;electron benzitetraazaporphyrins (BzTAPs) possessing redox&#8208;switchable NIR properties. X&#8208;Ray, NMR, and UV&#8208;visible&#8208;NIR analyses revealed that 20&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 1 exhibits NIR absorption and antiaromaticity with a paratropic ring&#8208;current, while 18&#960;&#8208;electron BzTAP 2 shows weakly aromatic character with NIR inertness. Notably, the NIR&#8208;silent BzTAP 2 was readily converted to the NIR&#8208;active BzTAP 1 in the presence of mild reducing agents such as amine. The intense NIR absorption band of BzTAP 1 is in sharp contrast to the very weak absorption bands of previously reported antiaromatic porphyrinoids. Molecular orbital analysis revealed that symmetry&#8208;lowering perturbation of the 20&#960;&#8208;electron porphyrinoid skeleton enables the HOMO&#8211;LUMO transition of 1 to be electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed. BzTAPs are expected to be useful for constructing activatable NIR probes working in reductive environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Micro Space Electrostatic Field in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery: Scalable Electrospray Fabrication of Porous Crystalline Anode Coating</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inhomogeneous consumption of anions and direct contact between electrolyte and anode during the Zn&#8208;deposition process generate Zn&#8208;dendrites and side reactions that can aggravate the space&#8208;charge effect to hinder the practical implementation of zinc&#8208;metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, electrospray has been applied for the scalable fabrication (&gt;10000 cm2 in a batch&#8208;experiment) of hetero&#8208;metallic cluster covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;frameworks (MCOF&#8208;Ti6Cu3) nanosheet&#8208;coating (MNC) with integrated micro space electrostatic field for ZMBs anode protection. The MNC@Zn symmetric cell presents ultralow overpotential (~72.8 mV) over 10000 cycles at 1 mAh cm&#8208;2 with 20 mA cm&#8208;2, which is superior to bare Zn and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art porous crystalline materials. Theoretical calculations reveal that MNC with integrated micro space electrostatic field can facilitate the deposition&#8208;kinetic and homogenize the electric field of anode to significantly promote the lifespan of ZMBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Bioactive Proteins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature has developed a plethora of protein machinery to operate and maintain nearly every task of cellular life. These processes are tightly regulated via post&#8208;expression modifications &#8211; transformations that modulate intracellular protein synthesis, folding, and activation. Methods to prepare homogeneously and precisely modified proteins are essential to probe their function and design new bioactive modalities. Synthetic chemistry has contributed remarkably to protein science by allowing the preparation of novel biomacromolecules that are often challenging or impractical to prepare via common biological means. The ability to chemically build and precisely modify proteins has enabled the production of new molecules with novel physicochemical properties and programmed activity for biomedical research, diagnostic, and therapeutic applications. This minireview summarizes recent developments in chemical protein synthesis to produce bioactive proteins, with emphasis on novel analogs with promising in vitro and in vivo activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Cytochrome P450BM3 Enzymes for Direct Nitration of Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Applications of peroxidase activities of cytochrome P450 enzymes in synthetic chemistry remain largely unexplored. We present here a protein engineering strategy to increase cytochrome P450BM3 peroxidase activity for direct nitration of unsaturated aromatic and terminal aryl olefin compounds in the presence of a dual&#8208;functional small molecule (DFSM). Site&#8208;directed mutations of key active site residues allowed an efficient regulation of steric effects to limit substrate access and, thus, a significant decrease and increase in the monooxygenation and peroxidase activities, respectively. Nitration of several phenol and aniline compounds also yielded ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;nitration products with moderate&#8208;to&#8208;high total turnover numbers. This is the first report of direct aromatic nitration by P450 variants using nitrite as a nitrating agent. We also demonstrated the use of the DFSM&#8208;facilitated P450 peroxidase system for the nitration of the vinyl group of styrene and its derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Molecular Conformations and Simulated &#8220;Self&#8208;Doping&#8221; in Phenothiazine Derivatives on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied. A stimulated self&#8208;doping system was constructed with the ax&#8208;conformer as host and the eq&#8208;conformer as guest, thus achieving highly promoted RTP performance.







Abstract
The research of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials has drawn great attention for their wide potential applications. Besides single&#8208;component and host&#8211;guest doping systems, the self&#8208;doping with same molecule but different conformations in one state is also a possible way to construct RTP materials, regardless of its rare investigation. In this work, twenty&#8208;four phenothiazine derivatives with two distinct molecular conformations were designed and their RTP behaviors in different states were systematically studied, with the aim to deeply understand the self&#8208;doping effect on the corresponding RTP property. While the phenothiazine derivatives with quasi&#8208;axial (ax) conformation presented better RTP performance in aggregated state, the quasi&#8208;equatorial (eq) ones were better in isolated state. Accordingly, the much promoted RTP performance was achieved in the stimulated self&#8208;doping state with ax&#8208;conformer as host and eq&#8208;one as guest, demonstrating the significant influence of self&#8208;doping on RTP effect.

         <title>NMR and DFT Studies with a Doubly Labelled 15N/6Li S&#8208;Trifluoromethyl Sulfoximine Reveal Why a Directed ortho&#8208;Lithiation Requires an Excess of n&#8208;BuLi</title>

         <dc:description>
An NMR study was able to clearly explain why an excess of base is needed to deprotonate the aromatic ring of a S&#8208;trifluoromethylsulfoximine, thanks in particular to the identification and characterization of all the aggregates present in the medium.







Abstract
This work shows why it is imperious to use an excess of butyllithium for a directed ortho&#8208;lithiation of a trifluoromethyl sulfoximine. The analysis of mixtures of n&#8208;BuLi and sulfoximine 1 in THF&#8208;d8 using {1H, 6Li, 13C, 15N, 19F} NMR experiments at low temperatures reveal that a first deprotonation occurs that leads to dimeric and tetrameric N&#8208;lithiated sulfoximine (93&#8201;:&#8201;7). Using an excess n&#8208;BuLi (5&#8197;equivalents), the second deprotonation on the ortho&#8208;position of the aromatic occurs. Six species were observed and characterized on the way. It includes three aggregates involving a sulfoximine: i)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)] dimer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg2, 39&#8201;%); ii)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuLi)3] tetramer solvated by six molecules of THF (Agg3, 39&#8201;%); iii)&#8197;a [dilithiated sulfoximine/(n&#8208;BuOLi)3] tetramer solvated by four molecules of THF (Agg1, 22&#8201;%). A DFT study afforded optimized solvated structures for all these aggregates, fully consistent with the NMR data.

         <title>Mapping the Complete Photocycle that Powers a Large Stokes Shift Red Fluorescent Protein</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the working mechanisms of red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) in aqueous solution is essential for bioimaging. We implemented a synergistic toolset (steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved electronic and vibrational spectroscopies) and elucidated the complete photocycle that powers a large&#8208;Stokes&#8208;shift RFP, tracking the ultrafast excited&#8208;state proton transfer and chromophore twists in action and also providing protein rational design principles.







Abstract
Large Stokes shift (LSS) red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) are highly desirable for bioimaging advances. The RFP mKeima, with coexisting cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;isomers, holds significance as an archetypal system for LSS emission due to excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT), yet the mechanisms remain elusive. We implemented femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) and various time&#8208;resolved electronic spectroscopies, aided by quantum calculations, to dissect the cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;mKeima photocycle from ESPT, isomerization, to ground&#8208;state proton transfer in solution. This work manifests the power of FSRS with global analysis to resolve Raman fingerprints of intermediate states. Importantly, the deprotonated trans&#8208;isomer governs LSS emission at 620&#8197;nm, while the deprotonated cis&#8208;isomer's 520&#8197;nm emission is weak due to an ultrafast cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization. Complementary spectroscopic techniques as a table&#8208;top toolset are thus essential to study photochemistry in physiological environments.

         <title>Multifunctional Helicene&#8208;Based Ytterbium Coordination Polymer Displaying Circularly Polarized Luminescence, Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Room Temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism

Enantiopure 1D YbIII coordination polymers involving helicene&#8208;based ligands were designed. Their physical investigations revealed an unprecedented combination of field&#8208;induced Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet behavior, Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence and room temperature Magneto&#8208;Chiral Dichroism (MChD). The magnetic anisotropy was determined as the preponderant criterion for the observation of a strong MChD.







Abstract
The combination of physical properties sensitive to molecular chirality in a single system allows the observation of fascinating phenomena such as magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism (MChD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) having potential applications for optical data readout and display technology. Homochiral monodimensional coordination polymers of YbIII were designed from a 2,15&#8208;bis&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;hexahelicenic scaffold decorated with two terminal 4&#8208;pyridyl units. Thanks to the coordination of the chiral organic chromophore to Yb(hfac)3 units (hfac&#8722;=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylaconate), efficient NIR&#8208;CPL activity is observed. Moreover, the specific crystal field around the YbIII induces a strong magnetic anisotropy which leads to a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour and a remarkable room temperature MChD. The MChD&#8208;structural correlation is supported by computational investigations.

         <title>Negligible Ion Migration in Tin&#8208;Based and Tin&#8208;Doped Perovskites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion migration in tin&#8208;halide perovskites is investigated with a full range of bromide ratios under light illumination or electric field. The migration in these systems is negligible compared to lead&#8208;halide perovskites owing to a higher ion migration activation energy (Ea). Using mixed lead&#8208;tin perovskites with different Ea, the threshold Ea for observation of ion migration in perovskite devices is determined to be around 0.65&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Ion migration is a notorious phenomenon observed in ionic perovskite materials. It causes several severe issues in perovskite optoelectronic devices such as instability, current hysteresis, and phase segregation. Here, we report that, in contrast to lead halide perovskites (LHPs), no ion migration or phase segregation was observed in tin halide perovskites (THPs) under illumination or an electric field. The origin is attributed to a much stronger Sn&#8208;halide bond and higher ion migration activation energy (Ea) in THPs, which remain nearly constant under illumination. We further figured out the threshold Ea for the absence of ion migration to be around 0.65&#8197;eV using the CsSnyPb1&#8208;y(I0.6Br0.4)3 system whose Ea varies with Sn ratios. Our work shows that ion migration does not necessarily exist in all perovskites and suggests metallic doping to be a promising way of stopping ion migration and improving the intrinsic stability of perovskites.

         <title>How Crystal Symmetry Dictates Non&#8208;Local Vibrational Circular Dichroism in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) is intimately linked to crystal symmetry and therefore has the capability to distinguish between polymorphic forms. In this article, we classify the non&#8208;local terms due to crystal chirality versus the local terms due to molecular chirality. We find that already an achiral screw axis leads to significant changes in the VCD spectrum that are intrinsic to the crystal structure.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;State Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) can be used to determine the absolute structure of chiral crystals, but its interpretation remains a challenge in modern spectroscopy. In this work, we investigate the effect of a twofold screw axis on the solid&#8208;state VCD spectrum in a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of P21 crystals of (S)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1&#8208;indanol. Even though the space group is achiral, a single proper symmetry operation has an important impact on the VCD spectrum, which reflects the supramolecular chirality of the crystal. Distinguishing between contributions originating from molecular chirality and from chiral crystal packing, we find that while IR absorption hardly depends on the symmetry of the space group, the situation is different for VCD, where completely new non&#8208;local patterns emerge. Understanding the two underlying mechanisms, namely gauge transport and direct coupling, will help to use VCD to distinguish polymorphic forms.

         <title>Tunable Latency of Hydrosilylation Catalyst by Ligand Density on Nanoparticle Supports</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of norbornene ligands on silica nanoparticles alters the activity of a Pt hydrosilylation catalyst. Latency of hydrosilylation at high ligand density occurs despite the non&#8208;inhibitory behavior of the free ligand and establishes the non&#8208;innocent role of functionalized inorganic supports.







Abstract
Functionalizing inorganic particles with organic ligands is a common technique for heterogenizing organometallic catalysts. We describe how coordinating molecular platinum to silica nanoparticles functionalized with a high density of norbornene ligands causes unexpected latency of the catalytic activity in hydrosilylation reactions when compared to an identical reaction in which the norbornene is not tethered (2&#8201;% vs 97&#8201;% conversion in 1&#8197;h). Performing the hydrosilylation at elevated temperature (70&#8201;&#176;C) suppresses this activity delay, suggesting the usefulness of this technique towards temperature&#8208;triggered catalysis. We demonstrate that this latency is related to ligand density on the particle surface, chemical structure of the norbornene, and silica nanoparticle topology. We also establish the benefit of this latency for triggered curing of silicone elastomers. Overall, our work establishes the non&#8208;innocent role of inorganic supports when functionalized with organometallic complexes.

         <title>Reshaping the 2&#8208;Pyrone Synthase Active Site for Chemoselective Biosynthesis of Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Implementation of novel synthetic pathways into metabolic network is challenging. Empowered by protein engineering and synthetic biology, a whole&#8208;cell transformation process is reported to utilize engineered 2&#8208;pyrone synthase with novel reactivity in metabolic networks to convert carboxylic acids and intracellular malonyl&#8208;CoA directly into the pyrone products with high yields, catalytic efficiency and good selectivity.







Abstract
Engineering enzymes with novel reactivity and applying them in metabolic pathways to produce valuable products are quite challenging due to the intrinsic complexity of metabolic networks and the need for high in vivo catalytic efficiency. Triacetic acid lactone (TAL), naturally generated by 2&#8208;pyrone synthase (2PS), is a platform molecule that can be produced via microbial fermentation and further converted into value&#8208;added products. However, these conversions require extra synthetic steps under harsh conditions. We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of E.&#8197;coli to produce high&#8208;value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17&#8197;mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen&#8208;bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.

We herein report a biocatalytic system for direct generation of TAL derivatives under mild conditions with controlled chemoselectivity by rationally engineering the 2PS active site and then rewiring the biocatalytic pathway in the metabolic network of &lt;i&gt;E.&#8197;coli&lt;/i&gt; to produce high-value products, such as kavalactone precursors, with yields up to 17&#8197;mg/L culture. Computer modeling indicates sterics and hydrogen-bond interactions play key roles in tuning the selectivity, efficiency and yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization has been used to prepare a series of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthracene&#8208;fused oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. The size and shape of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton determines the unique features of the compounds&#8212;such as their face&#8208;to&#8208;face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character.







Abstract
Large &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are key in the area of molecular materials. Herein, we prepare via AuI&#8208;catalyzed cyclization a series of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated anthracene&#8208;fused oligo&#8208;BODIPYs. Their structural and optoelectronic properties were studied by several techniques, ranging from X&#8208;ray, UV/Vis, and cyclic voltammetry to transient absorption spectroscopy. As a complement, their electronic structures were explored by means of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Depending on the size and shape of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated skeleton, unique features&#8212;such as face&#8208;to&#8208;face supramolecular organization, NIR absorption and fluorescence as well as strong electron accepting character&#8212;were noted. All in all, the aforementioned features render them valuable for technological applications.

         <title>Halogen&#8208;Bonding Heteroditopic [2]Catenanes for Recognition of Alkali Metal/Halide Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of halogen bonding heteroditopic [2]catenanes exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, which has been exploited for the extraction of solid sodium or potassium halide salts into organic media. Changing the size of the component macrocycles dramatically influences the ion&#8208;binding affinity, stoichiometry, and ion&#8208;pair complexation mode of the [2]catenanes.







Abstract
The first examples of halogen bonding (XB) heteroditopic homo[2]catenanes were prepared by discrete Na+ template&#8208;directed assembly of oligo(ethylene glycol) units derived from XB donor&#8208;containing macrocycles and acyclic bis&#8208;azide precursors, followed by a CuI&#8208;mediated azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition macrocyclisation reaction. Extensive 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies show the [2]catenane hosts exhibit positive cooperative ion&#8208;pair recognition behaviour, wherein XB&#8208;mediated halide recognition is enhanced by alkali metal cation pre&#8208;complexation. Notably, subtle changes in the catenanes&#8217; oligo(ethylene glycol) chain length dramatically alters their ion&#8208;binding affinity, stoichiometry, complexation mode, and conformational dynamics. Solution&#8208;phase and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies provide evidence for competing host&#8208;separated and direct&#8208;contact ion&#8208;pair binding modes. We further demonstrate the [2]catenanes are capable of extracting solid alkali&#8208;metal halide salts into organic media.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Supported Cobalt Catalyst for Low&#8208;Temperature Methanation at Low Partial Pressures of CO2</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co/CeO2 is an efficient low&#8208;temperature methanation catalyst at CO2 partial pressures down to atmospheric concentrations. Advanced spectroscopic investigations unveiled that the combination of a higher concentration and higher intrinsic activity of active intermediates (formates and carbonyls) explains the high activity, emphasizing the role of the metal&#8208;ceria interface.







Abstract
The direct catalytic conversion of atmospheric CO2 to valuable chemicals is a promising solution to avert negative consequences of rising CO2 concentration. However, heterogeneous catalysts efficient at low partial pressures of CO2 still need to be developed. Here, we explore Co/CeO2 as a catalyst for the methanation of diluted CO2 streams. This material displays an excellent performance at reaction temperatures as low as 175&#8201;&#176;C and CO2 partial pressures as low as 0.4&#8197;mbar (the atmospheric CO2 concentration). To gain mechanistic understanding of this unusual activity, we employed in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and operando infrared spectroscopy. The higher surface concentration and reactivity of formates and carbonyls&#8212;key reaction intermediates&#8212;explain the superior activity of Co/CeO2 as compared to a conventional Co/SiO2 catalyst. This work emphasizes the catalytic role of the cobalt&#8208;ceria interface and will aid in developing more efficient CO2 hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Porosity and Charge Effects in a Supramolecular Porphyrin Cage Promote Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a supramolecular strategy to enhance photochemical reduction of CO2 to CO leveraging synergy between multiple second&#8208;sphere interactions. Post&#8208;synthetic click chemistry enables modular synthesis of porous porphyrin organic cages bearing 24 cationic groups. The coordinated use of both porosity and charge to augment CO2 reduction activity beyond additive effects results in fast and selective catalysis under low CO2 concentrations.







Abstract
We present a supramolecular approach to catalyzing photochemical CO2 reduction through second&#8208;sphere porosity and charge effects. An iron porphyrin box (PB) bearing 24 cationic groups, FePB&#8208;2(P), was made via post&#8208;synthetic modification of an alkyne&#8208;functionalized supramolecular synthon. FePB&#8208;2(P) promotes the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with 97&#8201;% selectivity for CO product, achieving turnover numbers (TON) exceeding 7000 and initial turnover frequencies (TOFmax) reaching 1400&#8197;min&#8722;1. The cooperativity between porosity and charge results in a 41&#8208;fold increase in activity relative to the parent Fe tetraphenylporphyrin (FeTPP) catalyst, which is far greater than analogs that augment catalysis through porosity (FePB&#8208;3(N), 4&#8208;fold increase) or charge (Fe p&#8208;tetramethylanilinium porphyrin (Fe&#8208;p&#8208;TMA), 6&#8208;fold increase) alone. This work establishes that synergistic pendants in the secondary coordination sphere can be leveraged as a design element to augment catalysis at primary active sites within confined spaces.

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) system led to macrocyclic peptide ligands of O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). The most potent of these ligands bind to the tetratricopeptide repeat region of OGT and inhibit this enzyme in an allosteric manner, making them promising tool compounds for studying OGT.







Abstract
Glycosyltransferases are a superfamily of enzymes that are notoriously difficult to inhibit. Here we apply an mRNA display technology integrated with genetic code reprogramming, referred to as the RaPID (random non&#8208;standard peptides integrated discovery) system, to identify macrocyclic peptides with high binding affinities for O&#8208;GlcNAc transferase (OGT). These macrocycles inhibit OGT activity through an allosteric mechanism that is driven by their binding to the tetratricopeptide repeats of OGT. Saturation mutagenesis in a maturation screen using 39 amino acids, including 22 non&#8208;canonical residues, led to an improved unnatural macrocycle that is &#8776;40&#8197;times more potent than the parent compound (Kiapp=1.5&#8197;nM). Subsequent derivatization delivered a biotinylated derivative that enabled one&#8208;step affinity purification of OGT from complex samples. The high potency and novel mechanism of action of these OGT ligands should enable new approaches to elucidate the specificity and regulation of OGT.

         <title>Co&#8208;Intercalation of Dual Charge Carriers in Metal&#8208;Ion&#8208;Confining Layered Vanadium Oxide Nanobelts for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized a series of metal confined nanomaterials by a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The metal ions confined nanobelts can stabilize the layered structure, effectively control the interlayer spacing, and provide a more significant diffusion channel for the intercalation and deintercalation of Zn2+ without changing the oxide morphology.







Abstract
Vanadium&#8208;based oxides with high theoretical specific capacities and open crystal structures are promising cathodes for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this work, the confined synthesis can insert metal ions into the interlayer spacing of layered vanadium oxide nanobelts without changing the original morphology. Furthermore, we obtain a series of nanomaterials based on metal&#8208;confined nanobelts, and describe the effect of interlayer spacing on the electrochemical performance. The electrochemical properties of the obtained Al2.65V6O13&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.07H2O as cathodes for AZIBs are remarkably improved with a high initial capacity of 571.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Even at a high current density of 5.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial capacity can still reach 205.7&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a high capacity retention of 89.2&#8201;% after 2000&#8197;cycles. This study demonstrates that nanobelts confined with metal ions can significantly improve energy storage applications, revealing new avenues for enhancing the electrochemical performance of AZIBs.

         <title>Autonomous Non&#8208;Equilibrium Self&#8208;Assembly and Molecular Movements Powered by Electrical Energy
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling the potential of two electrodes simultaneously, a strategy has been implemented that uses electrical energy to drive self&#8208;assembling systems away from equilibrium. The proposed approach has been demonstrated by modulating the self&#8208;assembly of a calix[6]arene host with a viologen guest, using a scanning electrochemical microscope setup. High thermodynamic efficiencies are obtained.







Abstract
The ability to exploit energy autonomously is one of the hallmarks of life. Mastering such processes in artificial nanosystems can open technological opportunities. In the last decades, light&#8208; and chemically driven autonomous systems have been developed in relation to conformational motion and self&#8208;assembly, mostly in relation to molecular motors. In contrast, despite electrical energy being an attractive energy source to power nanosystems, its autonomous harnessing has received little attention. Herein we consider an operation mode that allows the autonomous exploitation of electrical energy by a self&#8208;assembling system. Threading and dethreading motions of a pseudorotaxane take place autonomously in solution, powered by the current flowing between the electrodes of a scanning electrochemical microscope. The underlying autonomous energy ratchet mechanism drives the self&#8208;assembly steps away from equilibrium with a higher energy efficiency compared to other autonomous systems. The strategy is general and might be extended to other redox&#8208;driven systems.

         <title>Ru3(CO)12&#8208;Catalyzed Modular Assembly of Hemilabile Ligands by C&#8722;H Activation of Phosphines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphorus(III)&#8208;directed C&#8722;H aminocarbonylation of monodentate phosphines has been developed for modular assembly of bidentate hemilabile ligands. The use of mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid (MPAA) ligands is crucial for the inhibition of catalyst poisoning.







Abstract
Hemilabile ligands have been applied extensively in transition metal catalysis, but preparations of these molecules typically require multistep synthesis. Here, modular assembly of diverse phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, including related axially chiral compounds, is first reported through ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation of phosphines with isocyanate directed by phosphorus(III) atoms. High reactivity and regioselectivity can be obtained by using a Ru3(CO)12 catalyst with a mono&#8208;N&#8208;protected amino acid ligand. This transformation significantly expands the pool of phosphine&#8208;amide ligands, some of which have shown excellent efficiency for asymmetric catalysis. More broadly, the discovery constitutes a proof of principle for facile construction of hemilabile ligands directly from the parent monodentate phosphines by C&#8722;H activation with ideal atom, step and redox economy. Several dinuclear ruthenium complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealing the key mechanistic features of this transformation.

         <title>Stabilizing Cobalt&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich Layered Oxide Cathodes through Oxygen Lattice Regulation by Two&#8208;phase Ru Doping</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping on voltage decay using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. A mechanistic transition from a C2/c phase to a R
m phase is reported for the first time. The best voltage retention for Co&#8208;free LNMO to date (decay rate &lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle) has been achieved.







Abstract
The application of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides is hindered by their dramatic capacity and voltage decay on cycling. This work comprehensively studies the mechanistic behaviour of cobalt&#8208;free Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 and demonstrates the positive impact of two&#8208;phase Ru doping. A mechanistic transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal behaviour is found for the structural evolution of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2, and the improvement mechanism of Ru doping is understood using the combination of in operando and post&#8208;mortem synchrotron analyses. The two&#8208;phase Ru doping improves the structural reversibility in the first cycle and restrains structural degradation during cycling by stabilizing oxygen (O2&#8722;) redox and reducing Mn reduction, thus enabling high structural stability, an extraordinarily stable voltage (decay rate &lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle), and a high capacity&#8208;retention rate during long&#8208;term cycling. The understanding of the structure&#8208;function relationship of Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2 sheds light on the selective doping strategy and rational materials design for better&#8208;performance Li&#8208;rich layered oxides.

A mechanistic transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal behaviour is found for the structural evolution of Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt; and the improvement mechanism of Ru doping is understood using the combination of in operando and post-mortem synchrotron analyses. The two-phase Ru doping improves the structural reversibility in the first cycle and restrains structural degradation during cycling by stabilizing oxygen (O&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) redox and reducing Mn reduction, thus enabling high structural stability, an extraordinarily stable voltage (decay rate &amp;lt;0.45&#8197;mV per cycle), and a high capacity-retention rate during long-term cycling. The understanding of the structure-function relationship of Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sheds light on the selective doping strategy and rational materials design for better-performance Li-rich layered oxides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unsymmetrically Chlorinated Non&#8208;Fused Electron Acceptor Leads to High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs) have been developed. The halogen substituents on the aromatic side chains, as the new structure design tools, not only facilitate the construction of 3D stacks in solid, but also optimize the optoelectronic properties of the NFREAs, leading to organic solar cells with 16.2&#8201;% efficiency and excellent operational stability.







Abstract
Searching the cost&#8208;effective organic semiconductors is strongly needed in order to facilitate the practice of organic solar cells (OSCs), yet to be fulfilled. Herein, we have succeeded in developing two non&#8208;fused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), leading to the highest efficiency of 16.2&#8201;% for the NFREA derived OSCs. These OSCs exhibit the superior operational stabilities under one sun equivalent illumination without ultraviolet (UV) filtration. It is revealed that the modulation of halogen substituents on aromatic side chains, as the new structural tool to tune the intermolecular interaction and optoelectronic properties of acceptors, not only promotes the interlocked tic&#8208;tac&#8208;toe frame of three&#8208;dimensional stacks in solid, but also improves charge dynamics of acceptors to enable high&#8208;performance and stable OSCs.

         <title>Furan&#8208;Extended Helical Rylenes with Fjord Edge Topology and Tunable Optoelectronic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise synthetic strategy is reported for preparing lateral furan&#8208;extended rylenes bearing multifold O&#8208;doping and fjord edge topology. The resultant rylenes display fjord edge length dependent electronic structures and properties. The higher congener witnesses an open&#8208;shell structure and remarkable optoelectronic characteristics such as red&#8208;shifting and NIR&#8208;absorbing capacities, as well as pronounced mirror&#8208;image circular dichroism of chiral diradicaloids.







Abstract
Lateral furan&#8208;expansion of polycyclic aromatics, which enables multiple O&#8208;doping and peripheral edge evolution of rylenes, is developed for the first time. Tetrafuranylperylene TPF&#8208;4CN and octafuranylquaterrylene OFQ&#8208;8CN were prepared as model compounds bearing unique fjord edge topology and helical conformations. Compared to TPF&#8208;4CN, the higher congener OFQ&#8208;8CN displays a largely red&#8208;shifted (&#8776;333&#8197;nm) and intensified absorption band (&#955;max=829&#8197;nm) as well as a narrowed electrochemical band gap (&#8776;1.08&#8197;eV) due to its pronounced &#960;&#8208;delocalization and emerging of open&#8208;shell diradicaloid upon the increase of fjord edge length. Moreover, strong circular dichroism signals in a broad range until 900&#8197;nm are observed for open&#8208;shell chiral OFQ&#8208;8CN, owing to the excellent conformational stability of its central bis(tetraoxa[5]helicene) fragments. Our studies provide insights into the relationships between edge topologies and (chir)optoelectronic properties for this novel type of O&#8208;doped PAHs.

         <title>Charge Density Overcomes Steric Hindrance of Ferrocene Surfactant in Switchable Oil&#8208;in&#8208;Dispersion Emulsions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double head ferrocene surfactant (Fc+N+C12) can stabilize switchable oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions in combination with positively charged alumina nanoparticles. Not only can reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions be achieved by redox reactions, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be achieved by pH trigger.







Abstract
A ferrocene surfactant can be switched between single and double head form (FcN+C12/Fc+N+C12) triggered by redox reaction. FcN+C12 can neither stabilize an O/W emulsion alone nor an oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsion in combination with alumina nanoparticles due to the steric hindrance of the ferrocene group. However, such steric hindrance can be overcome by increasing the charge density in Fc+N+C12, so that oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions can be co&#8208;stabilized by Fc+N+C12 and alumina nanoparticles at very low concentrations (1&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M (&#8776;50&#8197;ppb) and 0.001&#8197;wt&#8201;%, respectively). Not only can reversible formation/destabilization of oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions be achieved by redox reaction, but also reversible transformation between oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions and Pickering emulsions can be obtained through reversing the charge of alumina particles by adjusting the pH. The results provide a new protocol for the design of surfactants for stabilization of smart oil&#8208;in&#8208;dispersion emulsions.

         <title>(BO)2&#8208;Doped Tetrathia[7]helicene: A Configurationally Stable Blue Emitter</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BO&#8208;doped thiahelicene has been synthesized by a four&#8208;step procedure and its optoelectronic and chiroptical properties investigated. The incorporation of two B&#8722;O bonds into the tetrathia[7]helicene framework has resulted in a configurationally stable (&#916;Genant&#8800;=27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) blue emitter (&#934;PL=6&#8201;%).







Abstract
Helicenes combine two central themes in chemistry: extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and chirality. Hetero&#8208;atom doping preserves both characteristics and allows modulation of the electronic structure of a helicene. Herein, we report the (BO)2&#8208;doped tetrathia[7]helicene 1, which was prepared from 2&#8208;methoxy&#8208;3,3&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene in four steps. 1 is formally derived by substituting two (Mes)B&#8722;O moieties in place of (H)C=C(H) fragments in two benzene rings of the parent tetrathia[7]helicene. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed a dihedral angle of 50.26(9)&#176; between the two terminal thiophene rings. The (P)&#8208;/(M)&#8208;1 enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and are configurationally stable at room temperature. The experimentally determined enantiomerization barrier of 27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 is lower than that of tetrathia[7]helicene (39.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The circular dichroism spectra of (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;1 show a perfect mirror&#8208;image relationship. 1 is a blue emitter (&#955;em=411&#8197;nm) with a photoluminescence quantum efficiency of &#934;PL=6&#8201;% (cf. tetrathia[7]helicene: &#955;em&#8776;405&#8197;nm, &#934;PL=5&#8201;%).

The (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)-/(&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; enantiomers were separated by chiral HPLC and are configurationally stable at room temperature. The experimentally determined enantiomerization barrier of 27.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is lower than that of tetrathia[7]helicene (39.4&#177;0.1&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The circular dichroism spectra of (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;)- and (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; show a perfect mirror-image relationship. &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is a blue emitter (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Interbacterial Chemical Communication&#8208;Triggered Nascent Proteomics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>

The CAPPEX strategy enables communication&#8208;triggered nascent proteomic analysis in complex bacterial populations. Applying CAPPEX, a tryptophan&#8208;indole axis that contributes to the colonization resistance of commensal E. coli to Salmonella was discovered.







Abstract
Metabolic labeling with clickable noncanonical amino acids has enabled nascent proteome profiling, which can be performed in a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific manner. However, nascent proteomics in an intercellular communication&#8208;dependent manner remains challenging. Here we develop communication&#8208;activated profiling of protein expression (CAPPEX), which integrates the LuxI/LuxR quorum sensing circuit with the cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific nascent proteomics method to enable selective click&#8208;labeling of newly synthesized proteins in a specific bacterium upon receiving chemical signals from another reporter bacterium. CAPPEX reveals that E. coli competes with Salmonella for tryptophan as the precursor for indole, and the resulting indole suppressed the expression of virulence factors in Salmonella. This tryptophan&#8208;indole axis confers attenuation of Salmonella invasion in host cells and living mice. The CAPPEX strategy should be widely applicable for investigating various interbacterial communication processes.

         <dc:description>
Pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 nanofiber with oxygen vacancies is proposed as an efficient electrocatalyst for reducing nitrate to ammonia, which achieves a large NH3 yield of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and a high Faradaic efficiency of 87.6&#8201;%. It also shows excellent electrochemical durability and structural stability. Theoretical calculations reveal its high electrical conductivity and extremely low free energy for nitrate adsorption.







Abstract
We propose the pseudobrookite Fe2TiO5 nanofiber with abundant oxygen vacancies as a new electrocatalyst to ambiently reduce nitrate to ammonia. Such catalyst achieves a large NH3 yield of 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and a high Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of 87.6&#8201;% in phosphate buffer saline solution with 0.1&#8197;M NaNO3, which is lifted to 1.36&#8197;mmol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;mg&#8722;1cat. and 96.06&#8201;% at &#8722;0.9&#8197;V vs. RHE for nitrite conversion to ammonia in 0.1&#8197;M NaNO2. It also shows excellent electrochemical durability and structural stability. Theoretical calculation reveals the enhanced conductivity of this catalyst and an extremely low free energy of &#8722;0.28&#8197;eV for nitrate adsorption at the presence of vacant oxygen.

         <title>Manipulating OH&#8722;&#8208;Mediated Anode&#8208;Cathode Cross&#8208;Communication Toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Vanadium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative concept of manipulating anode&#8208;cathode interplay for cycling durability improvement is demonstrated by employing Al2(SO4)3 as electrolyte additive. The suppression of OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;communication between Zn and NVO by Al2(SO4)3 simultaneously stabilize the two electrodes, even under ultra&#8208;acidic environment (pH&#8776;0.9). The as&#8208;assembled Zn||NVO batteries exhibit satisfactory lifespan at both low and high scan rates.







Abstract
The anode&#8208;cathode interplay is an important but rarely considered factor that initiates the degradation of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, to address the limited cyclability issue of V&#8208;based AZIBs, Al2(SO4)3 is proposed as decent electrolyte additive to manipulate OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;communication between Zn anode and NaV3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.5H2O (NVO) cathode. The hydrolysis of Al3+ creates a pH&#8776;0.9 strong acidic environment, which unexpectedly prolongs the anode lifespan from 200 to 1000&#8197;h. Such impressive improvement is assigned to the alleviation of interfacial OH&#8722; accumulation by Al3+ adsorption and solid electrolyte interphase formation. Accordingly, the strongly acidified electrolyte, associated with the sedated crossover of anodic OH&#8722; toward NVO, remarkably mitigate its undesired dissolution and phase transition. The interrupted OH&#8722;&#8208;mediated communication between the two electrodes endows Zn||NVO batteries with superb cycling stability, at both low and high scan rates.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Syntheses of Preussomerins: Control of Spiroacetal Stereogenicity by Photochemical Reaction of a Naphthoquinone through 1,6&#8208;Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical reactions of naphthoquinones triggered by 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer have been developed. This reaction proceeds in stereospecific manner without loss of the stereochemical information of the substrate, enabling the enantioselective total synthesis of preussomerin EGs. The constructed spiroacetal center is the sole stereogenic center in the product, which had been previously impossible to set by exploiting conventional methods.







Abstract
We report the enantioselective total syntheses of preussomerins EG1, EG2, and EG3. The key transformation is a stereospecific photochemical reaction involving 1,6&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer to achieve retentive replacement of a C&#8722;H with a C&#8722;O bond, enabling otherwise&#8208;difficult control of the spiroacetal stereogenic center.

         <title>Boosting the Activity of Pd Single Atoms by Tuning Their Local Environment on Ceria for Methane Combustion</title>

For Pd/ceria single atom catalysts, a thermal treatment to the ceria support prior to Pd deposition induces the formation of Pd&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) single sites that are highly active for CH4 oxidation.







Abstract
Supported Pd single atom catalysts (SACs) have triggered great research interest in methane combustion yet with contradicting views on their activity and stability. Here, we show that the Pd SAs can take different electronic structure and atomic geometry on ceria support, resulting in different catalytic properties. By a simple thermal pretreatment to ceria prior to Pd deposition, a unique anchoring site is created. The Pd SA, taking this site, can be activated to Pd&#948;+ (0&lt;&#948;&lt;2) that has greatly enhanced activity for methane oxidation: T50 lowered by up to 130&#8201;&#176;C and almost 10 times higher turnover frequency compared to the untreated catalyst. The enhanced activity of Pd&#948;+ site is related to its oxygen&#8208;deficient local structure and elongated interacting distance with ceria, leading to enhanced capability in delivering reactive oxygen species and decomposing reaction intermediates. This work provides insights into designing highly efficient Pd SACs for oxidation reactions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Switchable Tellurium&#8208;Based Chalcogen Bonding: Photocontrolled Anion Binding and Anion Abstraction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding receptor has been constructed in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The receptor shows photocontrolled halide anion binding and acts as a photocontrolled organocatalyst for chalcogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;assisted halide anion abstraction in a Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction.







Abstract
Exploring new noncovalent bonding motifs with reversibly tunable binding affinity is of fundamental importance in manipulating the properties and functions of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly systems and materials. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrate a unique visible&#8208;light&#8208;switchable telluro&#8208;triazole/triazolium&#8208;based chalcogen bonding (ChB) system in which the Te moieties are connected by azobenzene cores. The binding strengths between these azo&#8208;derived ChB receptors and the halide anions (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) could be reversibly regulated upon irradiation by visible light of different wavelengths. The cis&#8208;bidentate ChB receptors exhibit enhanced halide anion binding ability compared to the trans&#8208;monodentate receptors. In particular, the telluro&#8208;triazolium&#8208;based ChB receptor can achieve both high and significantly photoswitchable binding affinities for halide anions, which enable it to serve as an efficient photocontrolled organocatalyst for ChB&#8208;assisted halide abstraction in a Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation benchmark reaction.

         <title>Single Atom Ring Contraction of Peptide Macrocycles Using Cornforth Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The notion of late&#8208;stage, site&#8208;selective chemistry to modify chemical structures is of growing interest and utility. Here, we perform a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in macrocyclic backbones using the Cornforth rearrangement. This chemistry could be used to rapidly access unique chemical space which would be difficult to achieve using a standard building block approach.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective transformations of densely functionalized scaffolds have been a topic of intense interest in chemical synthesis. Herein we have repurposed the rarely used Cornforth rearrangement as a tool to effect a single&#8208;atom ring contraction in cyclic peptide backbones. Investigations into the kinetics of the rearrangement were carried out to understand the impact of electronic factors, ring size, and linker type on the reaction efficiency. Conformational analysis was undertaken and showed how subtle differences in the peptide backbone result in substrate&#8208;dependent reaction profiles. This methodology can now be used to perform conformation&#8208;activity studies. The chemistry also offers an opportunity to install building blocks that are not compatible with traditional C&#8208;to&#8208;N iterative synthesis of macrocycle precursors.

         <title>Surface Curvature Dominated Guest&#8208;Induced Nonequilibrium Deformations of Single Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;300 Particles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach allows the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual covalent organic framework COF&#8208;300 crystals to be monitored in situ in real time. The spatiotemporal resolution of DFM allows transient and nonequilibrium intermediate states to be investigated, revealing the diverse surface&#8208;curvature&#8208;driven adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane.







Abstract
Understanding the guest&#8208;induced dynamic deformation process of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is vitally important to further increase their stimulus&#8208;response performances. Here we report on the dark&#8208;field microscopic (DFM) imaging approach to in situ monitor the guest&#8208;induced deformation evolution of individual COF&#8208;300 crystals in real time. We observe not only transient and nonequilibrium intermediate deformation states but also local surface curvature&#8208;driven diverse adsorption behaviours of single COF&#8208;300 particles for dichloromethane (DCM), undergoing one, two, and multiple expansion&#8208;contraction deformations as well as contraction&#8208;to&#8208;expansion transition. The surface curvature&#8208;dominated deformations are ascribed to the significant differences in the adsorption capacity for DCM at the curved tip and flat side regions, in which DCM can be adsorbed preferentially by curved tip regions of COF&#8208;300.

         <title>Blending to Make Nonhealable Polymers Healable: Nanophase Separation Observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR Analysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending with only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;% of PTUEG3 resulted in making PTUC8 to be self&#8208;healable at ambient temperatures without spoiling its non&#8208;hygroscopic properties. A nanophase&#8208;separated structure as observed by CP/MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy is responsible: PTUEG3&#8208;rich domains certainly contribute to the self&#8208;healing properties, while PTUC8&#8208;rich non&#8208;hygroscopic domains likely prevent the polymer blend from humidity&#8208;induced plasticization.







Abstract
Can commodity polymers are made to be healable just by blending with self&#8208;healable polymers? Here we report the first study on the fundamental aspect of this practically challenging issue. Poly(ether thiourea) (PTUEG3; Tg=27&#8201;&#176;C) reported in 2018 is extraordinary in that it is mechanically robust but can self&#8208;heal even at 12&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast, poly(octamethylene thiourea) (PTUC8; Tg=50&#8201;&#176;C), an analogue of PTUEG3, cannot heal below 92&#8201;&#176;C. We found that their polymer blend self&#8208;healed in a temperature range above 32&#8201;&#176;C even when its PTUEG3 content was only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Unlike PTUEG3 alone, this polymer blend, upon exposure to high humidity, barely plasticized, keeping its excellent mechanical properties due to the non&#8208;hygroscopic nature of the PTUC8 component. CP/MAS 13C NMR analysis revealed that the polymer blend was nanophase&#8208;separated, which possibly accounts for why such a small amount of PTUEG3 provided the polymer blend with humidity&#8208;tolerant self&#8208;healable properties.

&lt;p&gt;Can commodity polymers are made to be healable just by blending with self-healable polymers? Here we report the first study on the fundamental aspect of this practically challenging issue. Poly(ether thiourea) (PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=27&#8201;&#176;C) reported in 2018 is extraordinary in that it is mechanically robust but can self-heal even at 12&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast, poly(octamethylene thiourea) (PTUC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;; &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=50&#8201;&#176;C), an analogue of PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, cannot heal below 92&#8201;&#176;C. We found that their polymer blend self-healed in a temperature range above 32&#8201;&#176;C even when its PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; content was only 20&#8197;mol&#8201;%. Unlike PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; alone, this polymer blend, upon exposure to high humidity, barely plasticized, keeping its excellent mechanical properties due to the non-hygroscopic nature of the PTUC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; component. CP/MAS &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR analysis revealed that the polymer blend was nanophase-separated, which possibly accounts for why such a small amount of PTUEG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; provided the polymer blend with humidity-tolerant self-healable properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Remote Borylation of Alkynes and Vinylboronates</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective remote borylation of internal alkynes and sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates enabled by rhodium catalysis is reported. The 1,n&#8208;diboronate products can be converted to a variety of useful building blocks, biologically active molecules, and drugs via the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products including the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.







Abstract
Remote functionalization involving a fascinating chain&#8208;walking process has emerged as a powerful strategy for the rapid access to value&#8208;added functional molecules from readily available feedstocks. However, the scope of current methods is predominantly limited to mono&#8208; and di&#8208;substituted alkenes. The remote functionalization of multi&#8208; and heteroatom&#8208;substituted alkenes is challenging, and the use of alkynes in the chain walking is unexplored. We herein report a rhodium catalyzed remote borylation of internal alkynes, offering an unprecedented reaction mode of alkynes for the preparation of synthetically valuable 1,n&#8208;diboronates. The regioselective distal migratory hydroboration of sterically hindered tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted vinylboronates is also demonstrated to furnish various multi&#8208;boronic esters. Synthetic utilities are highlighted through the selective manipulation of the two boryl groups in products such as the regioselective cross coupling, oxidation, and amination.

         <title>Actinorhodin Biosynthesis Terminates with an Unprecedented Biaryl Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The last dimerization step of actinorhodin (ACT) biosynthesis was established through biochemical studies. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the biaryl&#8208;coupling reaction using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. ActVA&#8208;ORF3 is a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that forms DHK&#8208;OH and ACT. The present results complete the functional assignment of essential enzymes for ACT biosynthesis.







Abstract
A plethora of dimeric natural products exist with diverse chemical structures and biological activities. A major strategy for dimerization is aryl coupling catalyzed by cytochrome P450 or laccase. Actinorhodin (ACT) from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has a dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone structure connected by a C&#8722;C bond. In this study, we identified an NmrA&#8208;family dimerizing enzyme, ActVA&#8208;ORF4, and a cofactor&#8208;independent oxidase, ActVA&#8208;ORF3, both involved in the last step of ACT biosynthesis. ActVA&#8208;ORF4 is a unique NAD(P)H&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes the intermolecular C&#8722;C bond formation using 8&#8208;hydroxydihydrokalafungin (DHK&#8208;OH) as the sole substrate. On the other hand, ActVA&#8208;ORF3 was found to be a quinone&#8208;forming enzyme that produces the coupling substrate, DHK&#8208;OH and the final product, ACT. Consequently, the functional assignment of all essential enzymes in the biosynthesis of ACT, one of the best&#8208;known model natural products, has been completed.

         <title>A Photoinduced, Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Reaction for the Stereoselective Assembly of C&#8208;Linked Glycosides and Glycopeptides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel catalyst mediated the union of glycosyl halides and redox&#8208;active derivatives of carboxylic acids and amines to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides diastereoselectively under photoinduced conditions. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction of glycosyl nickel species with alkyl radicals generated by visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted fragmentation of EDA complexes is amenable to the late&#8208;stage glycosylation of complex bioactive molecules and oligopeptides.







Abstract
C&#8208;Alkyl glycosides and glycoproteins exist in natural products and are prized for their role as carbohydrate mimics in drug design. However, a practical strategy that merges glycosyl donors with readily accessible reagents, derived from abundant carboxylic acid and amine feedstocks, is yet to be conceived. Herein, we show that a nickel catalyst promotes C&#8722;C coupling between glycosyl halides and aliphatic acids or primary amines (converted into redox&#8208;active electrophiles in one step), in the presence of Hantzsch ester and LiI (or Et3N) under blue LED illumination to deliver C&#8208;alkyl glycosides with high diastereoselectivity. Mechanistic studies support the photoinduced formation of alkyl radicals that react with a glycosyl nickel species generated in situ to facilitate cross&#8208;coupling. Through this manifold, innate CO2H and NH2 motifs embedded within amino acids and oligopeptides are selectively capped and functionalized to afford glycopeptide conjugates through late&#8208;stage glycosylation.

         <title>f&#8208;block MOFs: A Pathway to Heterometallic Transuranics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Like baking cookies to personal taste, preparation of a library of heterometallic actinide&#8208;MOFs allows for tailoring of the &#8220;flavor&#8221; of material properties. Mixing the radionuclide ingredients in proper ratios reveals structure&#8211;property relationships and unique design principles for new classes of actinide&#8208;based materials. In addition, the prepared frameworks provide a recipe for novel, pre&#8208;designed transuranic MOFs.







Abstract
A novel series of heterometallic f&#8208;block&#8208;frameworks including the first examples of transuranic heterometallic 238U/239Pu&#8208;metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and a novel monometallic 239Pu&#8208;analog are reported. In combination with theoretical calculations, we probed the kinetics and thermodynamics of heterometallic actinide(An)&#8208;MOF formation and reported the first value of a U&#8208;to&#8208;Th transmetallation rate. We concluded that formation of uranyl species could be a driving force for solid&#8208;state metathesis. Density of states near the Fermi edge, enthalpy of formation, band gap, proton affinity, and thermal/chemical stability were probed as a function of metal ratios. Furthermore, we achieved 97&#8201;% of the theoretical maximum capacity for An&#8208;integration. These studies shed light on fundamental aspects of actinide chemistry and also foreshadow avenues for the development of emerging classes of An&#8208;containing materials, including radioisotope thermoelectric generators or metalloradiopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Assisted Coupling Manipulation for Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface reconfiguration methodology (SRM) is reported for the first time as a general approach to tune the coupling between hybrid FAPbI3 perovskite QDs, which is exploited for improved charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and PV devices, leading to a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15&#8201;% for FAPbI3 perovskite QD solar cell.







Abstract
For emerging perovskite quantum dots (QDs), understanding the surface features and their impact on the materials and devices is becoming increasingly urgent. In this family, hybrid FAPbI3 QDs (FA: formamidium) exhibit higher ambient stability, near&#8208;infrared absorption and sufficient carrier lifetime. However, hybrid QDs suffer from difficulty in modulating surface ligand, which is essential for constructing conductive QD arrays for photovoltaics. Herein, assisted by an ionic liquid formamidine thiocyanate, we report a facile surface reconfiguration methodology to modulate surface and manipulate electronic coupling of FAPbI3 QDs, which is exploited to enhance charge transport for fabricating high&#8208;quality QD arrays and photovoltaic devices. Finally, a record&#8208;high efficiency approaching 15&#8201;% is achieved for FAPbI3 QD solar cells, and they retain over 80&#8201;% of the initial efficiency after aging in ambient environment (20&#8211;30&#8201;% humidity, 25&#8201;&#176;C) for over 600&#8197;h.

         <title>An Organic Molecular Nanobarrel that Hosts and Solubilizes C60</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows and a diameter of 12.7&#8197;&#197; has been synthesized that is optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, and results in stable solutions of C60.







Abstract
Organic cages have gained increasing attention in recent years as molecular hosts and porous materials. Among these, barrel&#8208;shaped cages or molecular nanobarrels are promising systems to encapsulate large hosts as they possess windows of the same size as their internal cavity. However, these systems have received little attention and remain practically unexplored despite their potential. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new trigonal prismatic organic nanobarrel with two large triangular windows with a diameter of 12.7&#8197;&#197; optimal for the encapsulation of C60. Remarkably, this organic nanobarrel shows a high affinity for C60 in solvents in which C60 is virtually insoluble, providing stable solutions of C60.

         <title>Design of a Fully Non&#8208;Fused Bulk Heterojunction toward Efficient and Low&#8208;Cost Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a strong polar substituent on a non&#8208;fused acceptor core can help to reduce donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8201;:&#8201;A) miscibility, leading to optimized D&#8201;:&#8201;A morphology and domain purity in fully non&#8208;fused organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Using this approach, high&#8208;efficient and stable OPV cells are achieved.







Abstract
To modulate the miscibility between donor and acceptor materials both possessing fully non&#8208;fused ring structures, a series of electron acceptors (A4T&#8208;16, A4T&#8208;31 and A4T&#8208;32) with different polar functional substituents were synthesized and investigated. The three acceptors show good planarity, high conformational stability, complementary absorption and energy levels with the non&#8208;fused polymer donor (PTVT&#8208;BT). Among them, A4T&#8208;32 possesses the strongest polar functional group and shows the highest surface energy, which facilitates morphological modulation in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend. Benefiting from the proper morphology control method, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approaching 16.0&#8201;% and a superior fill factor over 0.795 are achieved in the PTVT&#8208;BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based organic photovoltaic cells with superior photoactive materials price advantage, which represent the highest value for the cells based on the non&#8208;fused blend films. Notably, this cell maintains &#8776;84&#8201;% of its initial PCE after nearly 2000&#8197;h under the continuous simulated 1&#8208;sun&#8208;illumination. In addition, the flexible PTVT&#8208;BT&#8201;:&#8201;A4T&#8208;32&#8208;based cells were fabricated and delivered a decent PCE of 14.6&#8201;%. This work provides an effective molecular design strategy for the non&#8208;fused non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) from the aspect of bulk morphology control in fully non&#8208;fused BHJ layers, which is crucial for their practical applications.

         <title>Benchmark Dynamics of Dipolar Molecular Rotors in Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al&#8208;MOF, constructed with a wheelshaped ligand containing geminal rotating fluorine atoms shows a fluid configuration landscape in crystals, even at 2&#8197;K. The multiple configurational interchanges that arise from a correlated cascade mechanism propagating through the structure, as shown by Molecular Dynamics, phonon calculations and NMR relaxation, occur even at temperatures that usually prohibit any dipole rotation.







Abstract
Fluorinated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), comprising a wheel&#8208;shaped ligand with geminal rotating fluorine atoms, produced benchmark mobility of correlated dipolar rotors at 2&#8197;K, with practically null activation energy (Ea=17&#8197;cal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). 1H T1 NMR revealed multiple relaxation phenomena due to the exchange among correlated dipole&#8208;rotor configurations. Synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction at 4&#8197;K, Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics and phonon calculations showed the fluid landscape and pointed out a cascade mechanism converting dipole configurations into each other. Gas accessibility, shown by hyperpolarized&#8208;Xe NMR, allowed for chemical stimuli intervention: CO2 triggered dipole reorientation, reducing their collective dynamics and stimulating a dipole configuration change in the crystal. Dynamic materials under limited thermal noise and high responsiveness enable the fabrication of molecular machines with low energy dissipation and controllable dynamics.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Translation of Different mRNAs in Cells via Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Photouncaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coumarin&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable 5&#8242; cap analog (CouCap) was synthesized and incorporated into mRNA. In combination with a nitropiperonyl&#8208;protected 5&#8242; cap analog, translation of multiple mRNAs can now be activated by light of different wavelengths. No mRNA sequence nor chemical modifications remain after photo&#8208;cleavage.







Abstract
The 5&#8242; cap is a hallmark of eukaryotic mRNA involved in the initiation of translation. Its modification with a single photo&#8208;cleavable group can bring translation of mRNA under the control of light. However, UV irradiation causes cell stress and downregulation of translation. Furthermore, complex processes often involve timed expression of more than one gene. The approach would thus greatly benefit from the ability to photo&#8208;cleave by blue light and to control more than one mRNA at a time. We report the synthesis of a 5&#8242; cap modified with a 7&#8208;(diethylamino)coumarin (CouCap) and adapted conditions for in vitro transcription. Translation of the resulting CouCap&#8208;mRNA is muted in vitro and in mammalian cells, and can be initiated by irradiation with 450&#8197;nm. The native cap is restored and no non&#8208;natural residues nor sequence alterations remain in the mRNA. Multiplexing for two different mRNAs was achieved by combining cap analogs with coumarin&#8208; and ortho&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;based photo&#8208;cleavable groups.

&lt;p&gt;The 5&#8242; cap is a hallmark of eukaryotic mRNA involved in the initiation of translation. Its modification with a single photo-cleavable group can bring translation of mRNA under the control of light. However, UV irradiation causes cell stress and downregulation of translation. Furthermore, complex processes often involve timed expression of more than one gene. The approach would thus greatly benefit from the ability to photo-cleave by blue light and to control more than one mRNA at a time. We report the synthesis of a 5&#8242; cap modified with a 7-(diethylamino)coumarin (CouCap) and adapted conditions for in vitro transcription. Translation of the resulting CouCap-mRNA is muted in vitro and in mammalian cells, and can be initiated by irradiation with 450&#8197;nm. The native cap is restored and no non-natural residues nor sequence alterations remain in the mRNA. Multiplexing for two different mRNAs was achieved by combining cap analogs with coumarin- and &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-nitrobenzyl-based photo-cleavable groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron Nanoparticles Protected by Chainmail&#8208;structured Graphene for Durable Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin graphene nanosheet layers were created as chainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticles (Fe@Gnc) using a simple hydrothermal method and in situ thermal reduction strategy, which can achieve nitrate reduction to nitrogen. The designed graphene nanochainmail protects the internal iron active sites and has excellent stability and durability over 40 cycles.







Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is an appealing technology for regulating the nitrogen cycle. Metallic iron is one of the well&#8208;known electrocatalysts for NO3RR, but it suffers from poor durability due to leaching and oxidation of iron during the electrocatalytic process. In this work, a graphene&#8208;nanochainmail&#8208;protected iron nanoparticle (Fe@Gnc) electrocatalyst is reported. It displays superior nitrate removal efficiency and high nitrogen selectivity. Notably, the catalyst delivers exceptional stability and durability, with the nitrate removal rate and nitrogen selectivity remained &#8776;96&#8201;% of that of the first time after up to 40 cycles (24&#8197;h for one cycle). As expected, the conductive graphene nanochainmail provides robust protection for the internal iron active sites, allowing Fe@Gnc to maintain its long&#8208;lasting electrochemical nitrate catalytic activity. This research proposes a workable solution for the scientific challenge of poor lasting ability of iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts in large&#8208;scale industrialization.

         <title>Preparative&#8208;Scale Biocatalytic Oxygenation of N&#8208;Heterocycles with a Lyophilized Peroxygenase Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lyophilized preparation of an unspecific peroxygenase variant from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO&#8208;PaDa&#8208;I&#8208;H) is a highly effective catalyst for the oxygenation of a diverse range of N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds. Scalable, high yielding and enantioselective biocatalytic oxygenations have been developed, including 27 preparative examples (ca. 100&#8197;mg scale) across a wide range of substrates, including alkyl pyridines, bicyclic N&#8208;heterocycles and indoles.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Upgrading to Triethanolamine by Bromine&#8208;Assisted C2H4 Oxidation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CO2 upgrading strategy was developed by using Br&#8208;assisted C2H4 oxidation, which exploits the preferential adsorption of *Br over *OH on metal phthalocyanine electrocatalysts. The C2H4 oxidation was further coupled with the nitrite reduction to form triethanolamine. Using two electrolysis cells in tandem, the capability of electrochemical fixation of CO2 and nitrite ions into triethanolamine at ambient conditions was demonstrated.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is a promising approach for converting this greenhouse gas into value&#8208;added chemicals, while the capability of producing products with longer carbon chains (Cn&gt;3) is limited. Herein, we demonstrate the Br&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene (C2H4), a major CO2 electroreduction product, into 2&#8208;bromoethanol by electro&#8208;generated bromine on metal phthalocyanine catalysts. Due to the preferential formation of Br2 over *O or Cl2 to activate the C=C bond, a high partial current density of producing 2&#8208;bromoethanol (46.6&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2) was obtained with 87.2&#8201;% Faradaic efficiency. Further coupling with the electrocatalytic nitrite reduction to ammonia at the cathode allowed the production of triethanolamine with six carbon atoms. Moreover, by coupling a CO2 electrolysis cell for in situ C2H4 generation and a C2H4 oxidation/nitrite reduction cell, the capability of upgrading of CO2 and nitrite into triethanolamine was demonstrated.

         <title>A Conformational Restriction Strategy for the Control of CRISPR/Cas Gene Editing with Photoactivatable Guide RNAs
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on the discovery and development of conformationally restricted guide RNA, a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclized molecule that can be easily prepared with only two or three modification sites. This is a superior approach for the spatiotemporal control of CRISPR/Cas editing, which has enabled the precise cleavage of exogenous genes at a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakages in live cells and in embryos.







Abstract
The CRISPR/Cas system is one of the most powerful tools for gene editing. However, approaches for precise control of genome editing and regulatory events are still desirable. Here, we report the spatiotemporal and efficient control of CRISPR/Cas9&#8208; and Cas12a&#8208;mediated editing with conformationally restricted guide RNAs (gRNAs). This approach relied on only two or three pre&#8208;installed photo&#8208;labile substituents followed by an intramolecular cyclization, representing a robust synthetic method in comparison to the heavily modified linear gRNAs that often require extensive screening and time&#8208;consuming optimization. This tactic could direct the precise cleavage of the genes encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) protein within a predefined cutting region without notable editing leakage in live cells. We also achieved light&#8208;mediated myostatin (MSTN) gene editing in embryos, wherein a new bow&#8208;knot&#8208;type gRNA was constructed with excellent OFF/ON switch efficiency. Overall, our work provides a significant new strategy in CRISPR/Cas editing with modified circular gRNAs to precisely manipulate where and when genes are edited.

         <title>Continuous Modulation of Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Activities of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts through p&#8208;n Junction Rectification</title>

A p&#8208;n junction single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) was designed by exploiting the p&#8208;type semiconducting character of the SAC having a metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors. Simply changing the n&#8208;type support material for ones with a different work function allows continuous, controllable modification of the electronic structure and intrinsic activity of catalytically active single&#8208;atom site.







Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) to surpass their activity limit remains challenging at their atomic scale. Herein, we exploit p&#8208;type semiconducting character of SACs having a metal center coordinated to nitrogen donors (MeNx) and rectify their local charge density by an n&#8208;type semiconductor support. With iron phthalocyanine (FePc) as a model SAC, introducing an n&#8208;type gallium monosulfide that features a low work function generates a space&#8208;charged region across the junction interface, and causes distortion of the FeN4 moiety and spin&#8208;state transition in the FeII center. This catalyst shows an over two&#8208;fold higher specific oxygen&#8208;reduction activity than that of pristine FePc. We further employ three other n&#8208;type metal chalcogenides of varying work function as supports, and discover a linear correlation between the activities of the supported FeN4 and the rectification degrees, which clearly indicates that SACs can be continuously tuned by this rectification strategy.

         <title>Catalytic DNA&#8208;Assisted Mass Production of Arbitrary Single&#8208;Stranded DNA</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on two newly identified classes of DNAzymes, we developed paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (PECAN) for mass production of scar&#8208;free single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA). We demonstrated the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for in situ RNA detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage, and highlighted the advantages of using high&#8208;quality PECAN ssDNA in cutting&#8208;edge biotechnology.







Abstract
Synthetic single&#8208;stranded (ss) DNA is a cornerstone for life and materials science, yet the purity, quantity, length, and customizability of synthetic DNA are still limiting in various applications. Here, we present PECAN, paired&#8208;end cutting assisted by DNAzymes (DNA enzymes or deoxyribozymes), which enables mass production of ssDNA of arbitrary sequence (up to 7000 nucleotides, or nt) with single&#8208;base precision. At the core of PECAN technique are two newly identified classes of DNAzymes, each robustly self&#8208;hydrolyzing with minimal sequence requirement up&#8208; or down&#8208;stream of its cleavage site. Flanking the target ssDNA with a pair of such DNAzymes generates a precursor ssDNA amplifiable by pseudogene&#8208;recombinant bacteriophage, which subsequently releases the target ssDNA in large quantities after efficient auto&#8208;processing. PECAN produces ssDNA of virtually any terminal bases and compositions with &gt;98.5&#8201;% purity at the milligram&#8208;to&#8208;gram scale. We demonstrate the feasibility of using PECAN ssDNA for RNA in situ detection, homology&#8208;directed genome editing, and DNA&#8208;based data storage.

         <title>Zincophilic Electrode Interphase with Appended Proton Reservoir Ability Stabilizes Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile protective coating is constructed on the Zn anodes (ZP@Zn), where the anionic group with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric characteristics achieves the reversible proton storage and accelerates the desolvation kinetics on the anode surface, thereby mitigating the parasitic side reactions derived from water, and facilitating homogeneous Zn nucleation and growth concomitantly.







Abstract
The rampant dendrites and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) resulting from the turbulent interfacial evolution at the anode/electrolyte are the main culprits of short lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency of Zn metal batteries. In this work, a versatile protective coating with excellent zincophilic and amphoteric features is constructed on the surface of Zn metal (ZP@Zn) as dendrite&#8208;free anodes. This kind of protective coating possesses the advantages of reversible proton storage and rapid desolvation kinetics, thereby mitigating the HER and facilitating homogeneous nucleation concomitantly. Furthermore, the space charge polarization effect promotes charge redistribution to achieve uniform Zn deposition. Accordingly, the ZP@Zn symmetric cell manifests excellent reversibility at an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 4700&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling at 80&#8201;% depth of discharge (DOD). The ZP@Zn//V6O13 pouch cell also reveals superior cycling stability with a high capacity of 326.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode in a Dilute Aqueous Electrolyte Enabled by a pH Buffer Additive</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional additive, NH4H2PO4, is proposed to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions in a dilute aqueous electrolyte. Due to the pH buffer chemistry of NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; and the &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; of NH4+, promoted Coulombic efficiencies and lifespans of Zn based symmetric/asymmetric cells can be achieved.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries have drawn increasing attention due to the intrinsic safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness and high energy density. However, parasitic reactions and non&#8208;uniform dendrite growth on the Zn anode side impede their application. Herein, a multifunctional additive, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NHP), is introduced to regulate uniform zinc deposition and to suppress side reactions. The results show that the NH4+ tends to be preferably absorbed on the Zn surface to form a &#8220;shielding effect&#8221; and blocks the direct contact of water with Zn. Moreover, NH4+ and (H2PO4)&#8722; jointly maintain pH values of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Consequently, the NHP additive enables highly reversible Zn plating/stripping behaviors in Zn//Zn and Zn//Cu cells. Furthermore, the electrochemical performances of Zn//MnO2 full cells and Zn//active carbon (AC) capacitors are improved. This work provides an efficient and general strategy for modifying Zn plating/stripping behaviors and suppressing side reactions in mild aqueous electrolyte.

One&#8208;electron reduction of the C2&#8208;biphenylated 1,3&#8208;imidazolinium cation (2&#8201;a+) affords the radical 3&#8201;a, which undergoes further 1e&#8208;reduction to yield the anion 4&#8201;a&#8722;. In the solid&#8208;state, 3&#8201;a is monomeric while 4&#8201;a&#8208;K has a hexameric tubular structure. In addition to 3&#8201;a and 4&#8201;a&#8208;K, synthesis, structures, and reactivity of stable radicals and anions based on unsaturated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene frameworks have been presented.







Abstract
Herein, the first stable anions K[SIPrBp] (4&#8201;a&#8208;K) and K[IPrBp] (4&#8201;b&#8208;K) (SIPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CH2}2, IPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CH}2; Bp=4&#8208;PhC6H4; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) derived from classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) (i.e. SIPr and IPr) have been isolated as violet crystalline solids. 4&#8201;a&#8208;K and 4&#8201;b&#8208;K are prepared by KC8 reduction of the neutral radicals [SIPrBp] (3&#8201;a) and [IPrBp] (3&#8201;b), respectively. The radicals 3&#8201;a and 3&#8201;b as well as [Me&#8208;IPrBp] 3&#8201;c (Me&#8208;IPrBp=BpC{N(Dipp)CMe}2) are accessible as crystalline solids on treatment of the respective 1,3&#8208;imidazoli(ni)um bromides (SIPrBp)Br (2&#8201;a), (IPrBp)Br (2&#8201;b), and (Me&#8722;IPrBp)Br (2&#8201;c) with KC8. The cyclic voltammograms of 2&#8201;a&#8211;2&#8201;c exhibit two one&#8208;electron reversible redox processes in &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;2.5&#8197;V region that correspond to the radicals 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c and the anions (4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;c)&#8722;. Computational calculations suggest a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state for (4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;c)&#8722; with the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of 17&#8211;24&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.

         <title>PD&#8208;L1 Aptamer&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticles for Robust Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Cancer with Enhanced Safety</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
PD&#8208;L1 aptamer&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework (M@O&#8208;A) nanoparticles for synergetic cancer chemotherapy, PDT, and immune checkpoint blockade with reduced immunotoxicity are reported. M@O&#8208;A selectively targets and blocks the highly PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing tumor cells and decomposes under laser irradiation to release reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxaliplatin (OXA), eliciting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and therefore an enhanced immunotherapy and simultaneously attenuated irAEs.







Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade has become a paradigm&#8208;shifting treatment modality to combat cancer, while conventional administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1), often shows unsatisfactory immune responses and lead to severe immune&#8208;related adverse effects (irAEs). Herein, we develop a PD&#8208;L1 aptamer&#8208;based spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), which consists of oxaliplatin (OXA) encapsulated in a metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle core and a dense shell of aptPD&#8208;L1 (denoted as M@O&#8208;A). Upon light irradiation, this nanosystem enables concurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT), chemotherapy, and enhanced immunotherapy in one shot to inhibit both primary colorectal tumors and untreated distant tumors in mice. Notably, M@O&#8208;A shows scarcely any systemic immunotoxicity in a clinical irAEs&#8208;mimic transgenic mouse model. Collectively, this study presents a novel strategy for priming robust photo&#8208;immunotherapy against cancer with enhanced safety.

         <title>Cu/SaBox&#8208;Catalyzed Photoinduced Coupling of Acylsilanes with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of alkynes with the Fischer&#8208;type copper carbene species has been achieved, by harnessing &#945;&#8208;siloxyl carbene intermediates that were in situ generated from acylsilanes. Mechanistic studies suggested that the side&#8208;arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands are crucial for this coupling reaction.







Abstract
The transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction with Fischer metal carbene intermediates bearing an electron&#8208;rich alkoxyl or siloxyl group remains a big challenge due to the lack of readily available corresponding carbene precursors. Herein, we report the coupling of alkynes with the Fischer&#8208;type copper carbene species bearing a &#945;&#8208;siloxyl group, which could be in situ generated from acylsilanes catalytically under photoirradiation and redox&#8208;neutral conditions. The side&#8208;arm modified bisoxazoline (SaBox) ligands prove to be crucial for this coupling reaction, which provides the corresponding alkynyl alcohol in high yields with remarkable heterocycle tolerance and broad substrate scope.

         <title>Grain Boundary Electronic Insulation for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary electronic insulation strategy is proposed to tolerate the electronic conductivity of sulfide electrodes at the grain boundaries, which realizes dendrite&#8208; and self&#8208;discharge&#8208;free and humidity&#8208;stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.







Abstract
Sulfide electrolytes with high ionic conductivities are one of the most highly sought for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, the non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivities of sulfide electrolytes (&#8776;10&#8722;8&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) lead to electron smooth transport through the sulfide electrolyte pellets, resulting in Li dendrite directly depositing at the grain boundaries (GBs) and serious self&#8208;discharge. Here, a grain&#8208;boundary electronic insulation (GBEI) strategy is proposed to block electron transport across the GBs, enabling Li&#8722;Li symmetric cells with 30&#8197;times longer cycling life and Li&#8722;LiCoO2 full cells with three times lower self&#8208;discharging rate than pristine sulfide electrolytes. The Li&#8722;LiCoO2 ASSLBs deliver high capacity retention of 80&#8201;% at 650&#8197;cycles and stable cycling performance for over 2600&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The innovation of the GBEI strategy provides a new direction to pursue high&#8208;performance ASSLBs via tailoring the electronic conductivity.

&#8220;Fungal tree&#8221;&#8208;like hetero&#8208;structured AgNWs@BNNS fillers and thermally conductive AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite films with integrated capabilities of superior Joule heating, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties for next&#8208;generation versatile applications of energy conversion, 5G electronic devices and artificial intelligence have been developed.







Abstract
Thermal conduction for electronic equipment has grown in importance in light of the burgeoning of 5G communication. It is imperatively desired to design highly thermally conductive fillers and polymer composite films with prominent Joule heating characteristics and extensive mechanical properties. In this work, &#8220;solvothermal &amp; in situ growth&#8221; method is carried out to prepare &#8220;Fungal tree&#8221;&#8208;like hetero&#8208;structured silver nanowires@boron nitride nanosheet (AgNWs@BNNS) thermally conductive fillers. The thermally conductive AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite films are obtained by the method of &#8220;suction filtration self&#8208;assembly and hot&#8208;pressing&#8221;. When the mass fraction of AgNWs@BNNS is 50&#8197;wt%, AgNWs@BNNS/ANF composite film presents the optimal thermal conductivity coefficient of 9.44&#8197;W/(m&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K) and excellent tensile strength of 136.6&#8197;MPa, good temperature&#8208;voltage response characteristics, superior electrical stability and reliability, which promise a wide application potential in 5G electronic devices.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C(13)/C(13&#8242;) bis&#8208;desmethyl analogue of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z has been prepared by cyclodimerization through double Stille cross&#8208;coupling as the key enabling step. C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;Bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z binds to tubulin in a very similar mode as the natural product and inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro with low nanomolar potency, thus retaining the potent growth inhibitory capacity of disorazole&#8197;Z.







Abstract
We describe the total synthesis of the macrodiolide C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z through double inter&#8208;/intramolecular Stille cross&#8208;coupling of a monomeric vinyl stannane/vinyl iodide precursor to form the macrocycle. The key step in the synthesis of this precursor was a stereoselective aldol reaction of a formal Evans acetate aldol product with crotonaldehyde. As demonstrated by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the binding mode of C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z to tubulin is virtually identical with that of the natural product disorazole&#8197;Z. Likewise, C(13)/C(13&#8242;)&#8208;bis(desmethyl)disorazole&#8197;Z inhibits tubulin assembly with at least the same potency as disorazole&#8197;Z and it appears to be a more potent cell growth inhibitor.

         <title>Inside Back Cover: Crystalline Anions Based on Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 5/2023)</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable anions based on classical N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) can be prepared by KC8 reduction of the corresponding NHC radicals as reported by Diego&#8197;M. Andrada, Rajendra&#8197;S. Ghadwal, and co&#8208;workers in their Research Article (e202215244). The key to the stability of these anions is the delocalization of the electron lone pair over the C2&#8208;biphenyl substituent. In the solid state, the anions form a hexameric tubular structure with biphenyl substituents pointing inwards, as a result of intriguing cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. The spider weaves its web.

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing, and catalysis. In their Communication (e202212459), Petra&#8197;S. Dittrich et&#8197;al. demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need for additional capping agents. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles.

Carbon&#8208;13 radiofrequency amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate, as reported by Thomas Theis, Eduard&#8197;Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. in their Communication (e202215678). Spontaneous RASER signal emissions were detected using a 1.4&#8197;T NMR spectrometer equipped with a standard radiofrequency detection coil for over three minutes. RASER detection enables new detection schemes for 13C&#8208;hyperpolarized contrast agents and particular new opportunities for next&#8208;generation molecular imaging on clinical MRI scanners.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Techniques in Environmental Remediation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Review provides a summary of recent developments in piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation. The application of the piezoelectric effect, classification of piezoelectric materials, and piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation are discussed. Urgent problems and prospects of piezocatalytic techniques are also presented.







Abstract
As a consequence of rapid industrialization throughout the world, various environmental pollutants have begun to accumulate in water, air, and soil. This endangers the ecological environment of the earth, and environmental remediation has become an immediate priority. Among various environmental remediation techniques, piezocatalytic techniques, which uniquely take advantage of the piezoelectric effect, have attracted much attention. Piezoelectric effects allow pollutant degradation directly, while also enhancing photocatalysis by reducing the recombination of photogenerated carriers. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive summary of recent developments in piezocatalytic techniques for environmental remediation. The origin of the piezoelectric effect as well as classification of piezoelectric materials and their application in environmental remediation are systematically summarized. We also analyze the potential underlying mechanisms. Finally, urgent problems and the future development of piezocatalytic techniques are discussed.

         <title>Modelling Development in Radical (Co)Polymerization of Multivinyl Monomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major developments of modelling approaches in radical polymerization of multivinyl monomers (MVM) are summarized and their applications on FRP and RDRP are highlighted. This Minireview hopes to show that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer scientists. It aims to serve as a concise introduction to push the boundary of using modelling techniques to understand the mechanism and product structure in MVM polymerization.







Abstract
Radical polymerization (RP) of multivinyl monomers (MVMs) provides a facile solution for manipulating polymer topology and has received increasing attention due to their industrial and academic significance. Continuous efforts have been made to understand their mechanism, which is the key to regulating materials structure. Modelling techniques have become a powerful tool that can provide detailed information on polymerization kinetics which is inaccessible by experiments. Many publications have reported the combination of experiments and modelling for free radical polymerization (FRP) and reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRP) of MVMs. Herein, a minireview is presented for the most important modelling techniques and their applications in FRP/RDRP of MVMs. This review hopes to illustrate that the combination of modelling and wet experiments can be a great asset to polymer researchers and inspire new thinking for the future MVMs experiment optimization and product design.

         <title>Sustainable and Selective Modern Methods of Noble Metal Recycling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently developed solvometallurgical methods with the emphasis on green reagents, solvents and strategies are discussed in recycling noble metals Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Ag and Au. Sustainable and separative techniques including selective dissolution, precipitation and coordination for processing of multi&#8208;metal substrates like end of life catalysts and WEEE are highlighted.







Abstract
Noble metals exhibit broad arrange of applications in industry and several aspects of human life which are becoming more and more prevalent in modern times. Due to their limited sources and constantly and consistently expanding demand, recycling of secondary and waste materials must accompany the traditional mineral extractions. This Minireview covers the most recent solvometallurgical developments in regeneration of Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ir, Os, Ag and Au with emphasis on sustainability and selectivity. Processing&#8212;by selective oxidative dissolution, reductive precipitation, solvent extraction, co&#8208;precipitation, membrane transfer and trapping to solid media&#8212;of eligible multi&#8208;metal substrates for recycling from waste printed circuit boards to end&#8208;of&#8208;life automotive catalysts are discussed. Outlook for possible future direction for noble metal recycling is proposed with emphasis on sustainable approaches.

         <title>Achieving Control in Micro&#8208;/Nanomotor Mobility</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Minireview highlights the advancements in the area of micro&#8208; and nanomotors and discusses current methods and mechanisms to control their movement. We review motors&#8217; design, modes of propulsion and incorporation of different modes in one motor chassis so that control can be achieved.







Abstract
Unprecedented opportunities exist for the generation of advanced nanotechnologies based on synthetic micro/nanomotors (MNMs), such as active transport of medical agents or the removal of pollutants. In this regard, great efforts have been dedicated toward controlling MNM motion (e.g., speed, directionality). This was generally performed by precise engineering and optimizing of the motors&#8242; chassis, engine, powering mode (i.e., chemical or physical), and mechanism of motion. Recently, new insights have emerged to control motors mobility, mainly by the inclusion of different modes that drive propulsion. With high degree of synchronization, these modes work providing the required level of control. In this Minireview, we discuss the diverse factors that impact motion; these include MNM morphology, modes of mobility, and how control over motion was achieved.

     alt="Achieving Control in Micro-/Nanomotor Mobility"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Minireview highlights the advancements in the area of micro- and nanomotors and discusses current methods and mechanisms to control their movement. We review motors&#8217; design, modes of propulsion and incorporation of different modes in one motor chassis so that control can be achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented opportunities exist for the generation of advanced nanotechnologies based on synthetic micro/nanomotors (MNMs), such as active transport of medical agents or the removal of pollutants. In this regard, great efforts have been dedicated toward controlling MNM motion (e.g., speed, directionality). This was generally performed by precise engineering and optimizing of the motors&#8242; chassis, engine, powering mode (i.e., chemical or physical), and mechanism of motion. Recently, new insights have emerged to control motors mobility, mainly by the inclusion of different modes that drive propulsion. With high degree of synchronization, these modes work providing the required level of control. In this Minireview, we discuss the diverse factors that impact motion; these include MNM morphology, modes of mobility, and how control over motion was achieved. Moreover, we highlight the main limitations that need to be overcome so that such motion control can be translated into real applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cytochrome&#8197;P450 Catalyzes Benzene Ring Formation in the Biosynthesis of Trialkyl&#8208;Substituted Aromatic Polyketides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small group of P450 enzymes were identified to form a benzene ring from an acyclic polyene substrate in the biosynthesis of lorneic acid and other trialkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the mechanism of this unique P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation.







Abstract
Lorneic acid and related natural products are characterized by a trialkyl&#8208;substituted benzene ring. The formation of the aromatic core in the middle of the polyketide chain is unusual. We characterized a cytochrome&#8197;P450 enzyme that can catalyze the hallmark benzene ring formation from an acyclic polyene substrate through genetic and biochemical analysis. Using this P450 as a beacon for genome mining, we obtained 12 homologous type I polyketide synthase (PKS) gene clusters, among which two gene clusters are activated and able to produce trialkyl&#8208;substituted aromatic polyketides. Quantum chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the plausible mechanism for P450&#8208;catalyzed benzene ring formation. Our work expands our knowledge of the catalytic diversity of cytochrome&#8197;P450.

Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate. Spontaneous RASER signal emissions were detected using a non&#8208;cryogenic 1.4T&#8197;NMR spectrometer equipped with a radio&#8208;frequency detection coil with a quality factor of 32 without any modifications for over 3&#8197;minutes, paving the way to new frontiers for HP 13C contrast agents.







Abstract
The feasibility of Carbon&#8208;13 Radiofrequency (RF) Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (C&#8208;13 RASER) is demonstrated on a bolus of liquid hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate. Hyperpolarized ethyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate was prepared via pairwise addition of parahydrogen to vinyl [1&#8208;13C]acetate and polarization transfer from nascent parahydrogen&#8208;derived protons to the carbon&#8208;13 nucleus via magnetic field cycling yielding C&#8208;13 nuclear spin polarization of approximately 6&#8201;%. RASER signals were detected from samples with concentration ranging from 0.12 to 1&#8197;M concentration using a non&#8208;cryogenic 1.4T&#8197;NMR spectrometer equipped with a radio&#8208;frequency detection coil with a quality factor (Q) of 32 without any modifications. C&#8208;13 RASER signals were observed for several minutes on a single bolus of hyperpolarized substrate to achieve 21&#8197;mHz NMR linewidths. The feasibility of creating long&#8208;lasting C&#8208;13 RASER on biomolecular carriers opens a wide range of new opportunities for the rapidly expanding field of C&#8208;13 magnetic resonance hyperpolarization.

         <title>A Dynamic Thermodynamic Resolution Strategy for the Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Streptonigrin</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;standing challenge of preparing P&#8208;streptonigrin with high levels of enantioenrichment has been addressed by the use of an atroposelective dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. The strategy highlights the versatility of organoboron chemistry, as it plays a central role in ring synthesis, atropisomer resolution and functional group installation.







Abstract
We report that axially chiral biaryl boronic esters can be generated with control of atroposelectivity by a Binol&#8208;mediated dynamic thermodynamic resolution process. These intermediates can be progressed to enantioenriched products through stereoretentive functionalization of the carbon&#8211;boron bond. Finally, we have exploited this method in the first highly stereoselective total synthesis of P&#8208;streptonigrin.

         <title>Coordination of Polyketide Release and Multiple Detoxification Pathways for Tolerable Production of Fungal Mycotoxins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthesis of aurovertins involves a coordinated strategy for the tolerable production of fungal mycotoxins. A cyclase promotes the release of the polyketide backbone, while enzymatic acetylation functions as the major detoxification pathway, and non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways function as salvage routes to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites.







Abstract
Efficient biosynthesis of microbial bioactive natural products (NPs) is beneficial for the survival of producers, while self&#8208;protection is necessary to avoid self&#8208;harm resulting from over&#8208;accumulation of NPs. The underlying mechanisms for the effective but tolerable production of bioactive NPs are not well understood. Herein, in the biosynthesis of two fungal polyketide mycotoxins aurovertin&#8197;E (1) and asteltoxin, we show that the cyclases in the gene clusters promote the release of the polyketide backbone, and reveal that a signal peptide is crucial for their subcellular localization and full activity. Meanwhile, the fungus adopts enzymatic acetylation as the major detoxification pathway of 1. If intermediates are over&#8208;produced, the non&#8208;enzymatic shunt pathways work as salvage pathways to avoid excessive accumulation of the toxic metabolites for self&#8208;protection. These findings provided new insight into the interplay of efficient backbone release and multiple detoxification strategies for the production of fungal bioactive NPs.

         <title>A Photoenzymatic Strategy for Radical&#8208;Mediated Stereoselective Hydroalkylation with Diazo Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds has been developed. By this method, a series of &#947;&#8208;chiral carbonyl compounds were synthesized in high yields and stereoselectivities.







Abstract
Carbene insertion reactions initiated with diazo compounds have been widely used to develop unnatural enzymatic reactions. However, alternative functionalization of diazo compounds in enzymatic processes has been unexploited. Herein, we describe a photoenzymatic strategy for radical&#8208;mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds. This method generates carbon&#8208;centered radicals through an ene reductase catalyzed photoinduced electron transfer process from diazo compounds, enabling the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;stereogenic carbonyl compounds in good yields and stereoselectivities. This study further expands the possible reaction patterns in photo&#8208;biocatalysis and offers a new approach to solving the selectivity challenges of radical&#8208;mediated reactions.

     alt="A Photoenzymatic Strategy for Radical-Mediated Stereoselective Hydroalkylation with Diazo Compounds"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photoenzymatic strategy for radical-mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds has been developed. By this method, a series of &#947;-chiral carbonyl compounds were synthesized in high yields and stereoselectivities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbene insertion reactions initiated with diazo compounds have been widely used to develop unnatural enzymatic reactions. However, alternative functionalization of diazo compounds in enzymatic processes has been unexploited. Herein, we describe a photoenzymatic strategy for radical-mediated stereoselective hydroalkylation with diazo compounds. This method generates carbon-centered radicals through an ene reductase catalyzed photoinduced electron transfer process from diazo compounds, enabling the synthesis of &#947;-stereogenic carbonyl compounds in good yields and stereoselectivities. This study further expands the possible reaction patterns in photo-biocatalysis and offers a new approach to solving the selectivity challenges of radical-mediated reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Intermolecular C&#8722;H Borylation of N&#8208;Heterocycles at B&#8722;B Multiple Bonds</title>

Carbene&#8208;stabilized diborynes of the form LBBL (L=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene or cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene) induce rapid, high yielding, intermolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation at N&#8208;heterocycles at room temperature. The reaction initially provides the simple hydroarylated diborene, but in some cases proceeds further, providing unusual 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinine and base&#8208;stabilized alkylidene products.







Abstract
Carbene&#8208;stabilized diborynes of the form LBBL (L=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)) induce rapid, high yielding, intermolecular ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H borylation at N&#8208;heterocycles at room temperature. A simple pyridyldiborene is formed when an NHC&#8208;stabilized diboryne is combined with pyridine, while a CAAC&#8208;stabilized diboryne leads to activation of two pyridine molecules to give a tricyclic alkylideneborane, which can be forced to undergo a further H&#8208;shift resulting in a zwitterionic, doubly benzo&#8208;fused 1,3,2,5&#8208;diazadiborinine by heating. Use of the extended N&#8208;heteroaromatic quinoline leads to a borylmethyleneborane under mild conditions via an unprecedented boron&#8208;carbon exchange process.

         <title>Regulating the Mechanical and Optical Properties of Polymer&#8208;based Nanocomposites by Sub&#8208;Nanowires</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simple mixing of hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and polyimide (PI), hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels displayed high viscosity and modulus. HSP films showed high transparency, regulable haze, and enhanced Young's modulus.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanowires (SNWs) exhibit great potential applications in nanocomposites owing to their high specific surface area, high flexibility, and similarity to polymer chains in dimension, which are a good entry point to bridge inorganic materials and polymer materials. Herein, we synthesized hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires (HAP SNWs) and engineered hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires/polyimide (HSP) gels and films by simple mixing of HAP SNWs and polyimide (PI). Benefiting from the interactions between HAP SNWs and PI, these nanocomposites were a continuous hybrid network. As the increase of HAP SNWs contents, the viscosity and modulus of HSP gels were greatly improved by one or two orders of magnitude compared with PI gel. HSP films not only maintained high transparency but also gained high haze, as well as exhibited enhanced Young's modulus. Thus, both HSP gels and films developed in this work are promising for various applications in coatings and high&#8208;performance films.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Modification of Drugs via Alkene Formal Insertion into Benzylic C&#8722;F Bond</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, we describe a new strategy of alkene&#8208;selective formal insertion into a benzylic C&#8722;F bond, which enables late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules. This transformation breaks a strong C&#8722;F bond and forms a somewhat weaker C&#8722;F bond at the same time, under mild conditions, thus providing an opportunity for straightforward access to partially fluorinated organic molecules via difunctionalization of alkenes.







Abstract
C&#8722;F insertion of carbon&#8208;atom units is underdeveloped although it poses significant potential applications in both drug discovery and development. Herein, we report a photocatalytic protocol for late&#8208;stage modification of trifluoromethyl aromatic drugs involving formal insertion of abundant alkene feedstocks into a benzylic C&#8722;F bond selectively. This redox&#8208;neutral transformation features mild conditions and extraordinary functional group tolerance. Preliminary studies are consistent with this transformation involving a radical&#8208;polar crossover pathway. Additionally, it offers an alternative strategy for difunctionalization of alkenes via quenching of the carbocation intermediate with nucleophiles other than external fluoride.

         <title>Isomeric Oligo(Phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Different Orientation of Imine Bonds and Distinct Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isomeric imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different orientations of their imine bonds were prepared by the introduction of oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties through a Schiff&#8208;base condensation reaction. The effects of the different orientation of imine bonds on the photoelectric properties of the COFs were evaluated through photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions.







Abstract
Imine&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been extensively studied in photocatalysis because of their easy synthesis and excellent crystallinity. The effect of imine&#8208;bond orientation on the photocatalytic properties of COFs, however, is still rarely studied. Herein, we report two novel COFs with different orientations of imine bonds using oligo(phenylenevinylene) moieties. The COFs showed similar structures but great differences in their photoelectric properties. COF&#8208;932 demonstrated a superior hydrogen evolution performance compared to COF&#8208;923 when triethanolamine was used as the sacrificial agent. Interestingly, the use of ascorbic acid led to the protonation of the COFs, further altering the direction of electron transfer. The photocatalytic performances were increased to 23.4 and 0.73&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for protonated COF&#8208;923 and COF&#8208;932, respectively. This study provides a clear strategy for the design of imine&#8208;linked COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and advances the development of COFs.

         <title>A Petrochemical&#8208;Free Route to Superelastic Hierarchical Cellulose Aerogel</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of cellulose aerogels with anisotropic and hierarchical porous architecture are developed via a petrochemical&#8208;free method. The aerogels display temperature&#8208;invariant elasticity (&#8764;5&#8201;% plastic deformation after 105 compressive cycles at 50&#8201;% strain), large&#8208;strain recoverability (folding and twisting), angular recovery speed high up to 1475.4&#176;&#8201;s&#8722;1, and exceptional fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Cellulose aerogels are plagued by intermolecular hydrogen bond&#8208;induced structural plasticity, otherwise rely on chemicals modification to extend service life. Here, we demonstrate a petrochemical&#8208;free strategy to fabricate superelastic cellulose aerogels by designing hierarchical structures at multi scales.

&lt;p&gt;A new type of cellulose aerogels with anisotropic and hierarchical porous architecture are developed via a petrochemical-free method. The aerogels display temperature-invariant elasticity (&#8764;5&#8201;% plastic deformation after 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; compressive cycles at 50&#8201;% strain), large-strain recoverability (folding and twisting), angular recovery speed high up to 1475.4&#176;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and exceptional fatigue resistance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellulose aerogels are plagued by intermolecular hydrogen bond-induced structural plasticity, otherwise rely on chemicals modification to extend service life. Here, we demonstrate a petrochemical-free strategy to fabricate superelastic cellulose aerogels by designing hierarchical structures at multi scales. Oriented channels consolidate the whole architecture. Porous walls of dehydrated cellulose derived from thermal etching not only exhibit decreased rigidity and stickiness, but also guide the microscopic deformation and mitigate localized large strain, preventing structural collapse. The aerogels show exceptional stability, including temperature-invariant elasticity, fatigue resistance (&#8764;5&#8201;% plastic deformation after 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;cycles), high angular recovery speed (1475.4&#176;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), outperforming most cellulose-based aerogels.

         <title>Electrochemically&#8208;Switched 2nd Order Non&#8208;Linear Optical Response in an Arylimido&#8208;Polyoxometalate with High Contrast and Cyclability</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transfer transitions in a new arylimido&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) are turned off by reduction, enabling a high contrast (94&#8201;%) electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical (NLO) response. The overall combination of on/off contrast, high visible transparency and multicycle stability is leading in switchable 2nd order NLO chromophores, and shows for the first time the strong potential of POM hybrids as redox&#8208;driven optical switches.







Abstract
Electrochemically switched 2nd order non&#8208;linear optical responses have been demonstrated for the first time in polyoxometalates (POMs), with an arylimido&#8208;derivative showing a leading combination of high on/off contrast (94&#8201;%), high visible transparency, and cyclability. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical and TD&#8208;DFT studies indicate that the switch&#8208;off results from weakened charge transfer (CT) character of the electronic transitions in the reduced state. This represents the first study of an imido&#8208;POM reduced state, and demonstrates the potential of POM hybrids as electrochemically activated molecular switches.

         <title>Approaching Dianionic Tetraoxadiborecine Macrocycles: 10&#8208;Membered Bora&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating Borafluorenate Units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first examples of dianionic tetraoxadiborecines are isolated via the reaction between 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion and non&#8208;benzenoid quinones. Remarkably, the bora&#8208;crown ether ring is able to capture a sodium ion from sodium tetrakis[3.5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate. Additionally, the position and/or binding of the metal ions to the bora&#8208;crown are easily observable via specific color changes.







Abstract
The addition of non&#8208;benzenoid quinones, acenapthenequinone or aceanthrenequinone, to the 9&#8208;carbene&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene monoanion (1) affords the first examples of dianionic 10&#8208;membered bora&#8208;crown ethers (2&#8211;5), which are characterized by multi&#8208;nuclear NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 11B), X&#8208;ray crystallography, elemental analysis, and UV/Vis spectroscopy. These tetraoxadiborecines have distinct absorption profiles based on the positioning of the alkali metal cations. When compound 4, which has a vacant C4B2O4 cavity, is reacted with sodium tetrakis[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate, a color change from purple to orange serves as a visual indicator of metal binding to the central ring, whereby the Na+ ion coordinates to four oxygen atoms. A detailed theoretical analysis of the calculated reaction energetics is provided to gain insight into the reaction mechanism for the formation of 2&#8211;5. These data, and the electronic structures of proposed intermediates, indicate that the reaction proceeds via a boron enolate intermediate.

         <title>Unveiling the High&#8208;valence Oxygen Degradation Across the Delithiated Cathode Surface</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining synchrotron&#8208;based mRAS and APXPS, an integrated high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation scenario is established at the cathode surface. Compared with mRIXS, mRAS verified oxygen valence decrease from bulk to surface. APXPS further proves the CEI layer oxidized and deteriorated by O2. The high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation involving valence, chemical, and mechanical change can be general surface fading behavior in ARR active cathodes.







Abstract
Charge compensation on anionic redox reaction (ARR) has been promising to realize extra capacity beyond transition metal redox in battery cathodes. The practical development of ARR capacity has been hindered by high&#8208;valence oxygen instability, particularly at cathode surfaces. However, the direct probe of surface oxygen behavior has been challenging. Here, the electronic states of surface oxygen are investigated by combining mapping of resonant Auger electronic spectroscopy (mRAS) and ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) on a model LiCoO2 cathode. The mRAS verified that no high&#8208;valence oxygen can sustain at cathode surfaces, while APXPS proves that cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer evolves and oxidizes upon oxygen gas contact. This work provides valuable insights into the high&#8208;valence oxygen degradation mode across the interface. Oxygen stabilization from surface architecture is proven a prerequisite to the practical development of ARR active cathodes.

         <title>Continuous Electroformation of Gold Nanoparticles in Nanoliter Droplet Reactors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are generated on a microfluidic device. The droplets are then guided through a pair of parallel electrodes, where they are exposed to an electrical current, and gold nanoparticles are created.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are employed in numerous applications, including optics, biosensing and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate the stabilizer&#8208;free electrochemical synthesis of AuNPs inside nanoliter&#8208;sized reactors. Droplets encapsulating a gold precursor are formed on a microfluidic device and exposed to an electrical current by guiding them through a pair of electrodes. We exploit the naturally occurring recirculation flows inside confined droplets (moving in rectangular microchannels) to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles after nucleation. Therefore, AuNPs with sizes in the range of 30 to 100&#8197;nm were produced without the need of additional capping agents. The average particle size is defined by the precursor concentration and droplet velocity, while the charge dose given by the electric field strength has a minor effect. This method opens the way to fine&#8208;tune the electrochemical production of gold nanoparticles, and we believe it is a versatile method for the formation of other metal nanoparticles.

         <title>C&#8722;H Fluoromethoxylation of Arenes by Photoredox Catalysis</title>

A new class of [N&#8722;OCH2F] redox&#8208;active reagents were synthetized via electrodecarboxylative C(sp3)&#8722;O coupling of N&#8208;hydroxybenzotriazoles with fluoroacetic acid and subsequent alkylation. By irradiation with blue LEDs in the presence of a photosensitizer, these bench stable reagents allow the synthesis of monofluoromethyl aryl ethers via functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active N&#8208;(fluoromethoxy)benzotriazoles were made accessible from fluoroacetic acid and hydroxybenzotriazoles via electrodecarboxylative coupling. After alkylation, they become effective monofluoromethoxylation reagents, enabling the photocatalytic C&#8722;H functionalization of arenes. Thus, irradiation of 1&#8208;(OCH2F)&#8208;3&#8208;Me&#8208;6&#8208;(CF3)benzotriazolium triflate with blue LED light in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2] promotes the synthesis of diversely functionalized aryl monofluoromethyl ethers. This method allows the late&#8208;stage functionalization of biologically relevant structures without relying on ecologically problematic halofluorocarbons.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Solar&#8208;Driven Syngas Production: A Fe2O3 Photoanode Featuring Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt Integrated with a Silver&#8208;Palladium Cathode</title>

Photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 using a Ag/Pd cathode, integrated with a Fe2O3 photoanode decorated with single&#8208;atom cobalt, achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion efficiency of 2.69&#8201;%.







Abstract
Photoelectrochemical syngas production from aqueous CO2 is a promising technique for carbon capture and utilization. Herein, we demonstrate the efficient and tunable syngas production by integrating a single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;catalyst&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 photoanode with a bimetallic Ag/Pd alloy cathode. A record syngas production activity of 81.9&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;cm&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1 (CO/H2 ratio: &#8776;1&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved under artificial sunlight (AM 1.5 G) with an excellent durability. Systematic studies reveal that the Co single atoms effectively extract the holes from Fe2O3 photoanodes and serve as active sites for promoting oxygen evolution. Simultaneously, the Pd and Ag atoms in bimetallic cathodes selectively adsorb CO2 and protons for facilitating CO production. Further incorporation with a photovoltaic, to allow solar light (&gt;600&#8197;nm) to be utilized, yields a bias&#8208;free CO2 reduction device with solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO and solar&#8208;to&#8208;H2 conversion efficiencies up to 1.33 and 1.36 %, respectively.

         <title>Intramolecular Interception of the Remote Position of Vinylcarbene Silver Complex Intermediates by C(sp3)&#8722;H Bond Insertion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The vinylogous position of a donor&#8208;donor silver vinyl carbene is trapped with an aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond for the first time to afford 1&#8208;benzoazepine scaffolds. The overall transformation entails a carbene alkyne metathesis of a donor&#8208;acceptor silver carbene to furnish the key donor&#8208;donor silver vinyl carbene whose vinylogous position is selectively intercepted in a stepwise C&#8722;H bond insertion.







Abstract
The trapping of the elusive vinylogous position of a vinyl carbene with an aliphatic C(sp3)&#8722;H bond has been achieved for the first time during a silver&#8208;catalyzed carbene/alkyne metathesis (CAM) process. A Tpx&#8208;containing silver complex first promotes the generation of a donor&#8208;acceptor silver carbene which triggers CAM, generating a subsequent donor&#8208;donor vinyl silver carbene species, which then undergoes a selective vinylogous C(sp3)&#8722;H bond insertion, leading to the synthesis of a new family of benzoazepines. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations unveil the reaction mechanism, which allows proposing that the C&#8722;H bond insertion reaction takes place in a stepwise manner, with the hydrogen shift being the rate determining step.

         <title>Azaarenes: 13 Rings in a Row by Cyclopentannulation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Volume 62, Issue 5, January 26, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large, stable cyclopentannulated azaarenes, consisting of up to 13 six&#8208;membered rings in a row, were prepared. Cyclopentannulation complements benzannulation strategies for the preparation of the higher (aza)arenes.







Abstract
Cyclopentannulation was explored as a strategy to access large, stable azaarenes. Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling of previously reported di&#8208; and tetrabrominated cyclopentannulated N,N&#8242;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacenes furnished stable azaarenes with up to 13 six&#8208;membered rings in a row and a length of 3.1&#8197;nm. Their optoelectronic and semi&#8208;conducting properties as well as their aromaticity were investigated.

         <title>Electrochemical Reactivation of Dead Li2S for Li&#8722;S Batteries in Non&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated the fast capacity decay of Li&#8722;S batteries in non&#8208;solvating electrolytes is due to the formation and accumulation of dead Li2S aggregate. An electrochemical approach is proposed to reactivate the dead Li2S and strengthen the cyclability.







Abstract
The use of non&#8208;solvating, or as&#8208;called sparingly&#8208;solvating, electrolytes (NSEs), is regarded as one of the most promising solutions to the obstacles to the practical applications of Li&#8722;S batteries. However, it remains a puzzle that long&#8208;life Li&#8722;S batteries have rarely, if not never, been reported with NSEs, despite their good compatibility with Li anode. Here, we find the capacity decay of Li&#8722;S batteries in NSEs is mainly due to the accumulation of the dead Li2S at the cathode side, rather than the degradation of the anodes or electrolytes. Based on this understanding, we propose an electrochemical strategy to reactivate the accumulated Li2S and revive the dead Li&#8722;S batteries in NSEs. With such a facile approach, Li&#8722;S batteries with significantly improved cycling stability and accelerated dynamics are achieved with diglyme&#8208;, acetonitrile&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane&#8208;based NSEs. Our finding may rebuild the confidence in exploiting non&#8208;solvating Li&#8722;S batteries with practical competitiveness.

         <title>Diradical B/N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension of a B/N&#8208;heterocycle has led to the generation of B/N&#8208;type organic diradicaloids. Theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the two quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic hydrocarbons synthesized have enhanced open&#8208;shell diradical structures, modulated (anti)aromaticity, as well as intriguing properties, such as magnetic activities, narrow energy gaps, and highly red&#8208;shifted absorptions.







Abstract
Heterocyclic diradicaloids with atom&#8208;precise control over open&#8208;shell nature are promising materials for organic electronics and spintronics. Herein, we disclose quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension of a B/N&#8208;heterocycle for generating B/N&#8208;type organic diradicaloids. Two quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic hydrocarbons that feature fusion of the B/N&#8208;heterocycle motif with the antiaromatic s&#8208;indacene or dicyclopenta[b,g]naphthalene core were synthesized. This quinoidal &#960;&#8208;extension and B/N&#8208;heterocycle leads to their open&#8208;shell electronic nature, which stands in contrast to the multiple&#8208;resonance effect of conventional B/N&#8208;type emitters. These B/N&#8208;type diradicaloids have modulated (anti)aromaticity and enhanced diradical characters comparing with the all&#8208;carbon analogues, as well as intriguing properties, such as magnetic activities, narrow energy gaps and highly red&#8208;shifted absorptions. This study thus opens the new space for both of B/N&#8208;doped polycyclic &#960;&#8208;systems and heterocyclic diradicaloids.

         <title>Optimizing Acetylene Sorption through Induced&#8208;fit Transformations in a Chemically Stable Microporous Framework</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimizing acetylene (C2H2) sorption through induced&#8208;fit transformations of a metal&#8211;organic framework has been achieved. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/anie.202215253), Qihui Chen, Daqiang Yuan, Maochun Hong et&#8197;al. prepared an adaptive ultramicroporous framework, which could effectively capture C2H2 with a record&#8208;high storage density but a very low adsorption enthalpy. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the excellent adsorption performance originates from the synergism of active sites, flexible framework, and matched pores.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Transformations of a Dynamic Cage&#8208;Based Molecular System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of a photoswitchable imine cage has been altered by irradiation with light. This facilitates the transformation of the cage upon application of external stimuli. A four&#8208;step opening/closing cycle has been achieved by controlling the rates of nuchleophile/imine exchange with an amine, which drives the system out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium. Furthermore, a light&#8208;induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation has been demonstrated using the same principle.







Abstract
In a chemical equilibrium, the formation of high&#8208;energy species&#8212;in a closed system&#8212;is inefficient due to microscopic reversibility. Here, we demonstrate how this restriction can be circumvented by coupling a dynamic equilibrium to a light&#8208;induced E/Z isomerization of an azobenzene imine cage. The stable E&#8208;cage resists intermolecular imine exchange reactions that would &#8220;open&#8221; it. Upon switching, the strained Z&#8208;cage isomers undergo imine exchange spontaneously, thus opening the cage. Subsequent isomerization of the Z&#8208;open compounds yields a high&#8208;energy, kinetically trapped E&#8208;open species, which cannot be efficiently obtained from the initial E&#8208;cage, thus shifting an imine equilibrium energetically uphill in a closed system. Upon heating, the nucleophile is displaced back into solution and an opening/closing cycle is completed by regenerating the stable all&#8208;E&#8208;cage. Using this principle, a light&#8208;induced cage&#8208;to&#8208;cage transformation is performed by the addition of a ditopic aldehyde.

Upon switching, the strained &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-cage isomers undergo imine exchange spontaneously, thus opening the cage. Subsequent isomerization of the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;-open compounds yields a high-energy, kinetically trapped &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-open species, which cannot be efficiently obtained from the initial &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-cage, thus shifting an imine equilibrium energetically uphill in a closed system. Upon heating, the nucleophile is displaced back into solution and an opening/closing cycle is completed by regenerating the stable all-&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-cage. Using this principle, a light-induced cage-to-cage transformation is performed by the addition of a ditopic aldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Crystalline Porous Organic Salt for Ultrarapid Adsorption/Desorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting by Dual Hydrogen Bond System&#8221;</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Correspondence, we show that the rapid and cyclable atmospheric water harvesting processes in a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) recently reported by Ben and co&#8208;workers involve massive structural rearrangement. Adsorption and desorption of water causes motion of the entire framework in a crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal manner.







Abstract
In a recent Research Article, Ben and co&#8208;workers reported a hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework prepared from a 4+ tetra&#8208;amidinium component and a 4&#8722; tetra&#8208;sulfonate component, termed CPOS&#8208;6. They showed that CPOS&#8208;6 could reversibly adsorb and desorb water over a narrow humidity window, and that this material offered potential for applications in atmospheric water harvesting. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed the material was stable over 50 adsorption/desorption cycles and that the kinetics of these cycles were very rapid. In this Correspondence we present additional structural data regarding this framework in both its hydrated and dehydrated states and thus discern the mechanism of water binding. These data do not disagree with Ben and co&#8208;workers&#8217; findings: rather they emphasise how remarkable the cyclability and rapid kinetics of adsorption/desorption are, as these processes involve a complete crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal rearrangement of the framework.

         <title>Gaseous Nitrogen Oxides Catholyte for Rechargeable Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high potential (0.5&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+) catholyte for redox flow batteries was developed. Both the charged and discharged species are gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx), allowing the redox active components to be liberated from the liquid electrolyte and stored in a separate gas container.







Abstract
There is a strong interest in finding highly soluble redox compounds to improve the energy density of redox flow batteries (RFBs). However, the performance of electrolytes is often negatively influenced by high solute concentration. Herein, we designed a high&#8208;potential (0.5&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+) catholyte for RFBs, where the charged and discharged species are both gaseous nitrogen oxides (NOx). These species can be liberated from the liquid electrolyte and stored in a separate gas container, allowing scale&#8208;up of storage capacity without increasing the concentration and volume of the electrolyte. The oxidation of NO in the presence of NO3&#8722; affords N2O3, and the reduction of N2O3 regenerates NO and NO3&#8722;, together affording the electrochemical reaction: NO3&#8722;+3&#8201;NO&#8652;2&#8201;N2O3+e&#8722; with a low mass/charge ratio of 152&#8197;grams per mole of stored electron. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept NOx symmetric H&#8208;cell shows 200 stable cycles over 400&#8197;hours with &gt;97&#8201;% Coulombic efficiency and negligible capacity decay.

         <title>Discrete Molecular Copper(II) Complex for Efficient Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Above Room&#8208;Temperature</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the discrete molecular ferroelectric complex [Cu(L&#8208;phe)(bpy)(H2O)]PF6&#8901;H2O (1) (Tc=350&#8197;K) with a large piezoelectric co&#8208;efficient (d33=10&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1), is exploited for piezoelectric energy harvesting. Among the devices prepared with the composite films of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and various weight % composition of 1, the 10&#8197;wt&#8201;% composite shows an output current of 5&#8197;&#956;A is which is the highest for any discrete inorganic complex reported so far.







Abstract
Developing robust, wearable, and biocompatible energy harvesting devices with bulk oxides (ceramics and perovskites) is extremely hard to achieve due to their zero mechanical flexibility, heavy metal toxicity, and tunability of properties. Alternatively, discrete inorganic complexes can be an excellent choice to overcome the above&#8208;stated issues, thanks to appropriate molecular engineering. Herein, we report an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric discrete molecular complex [Cu(L&#8208;phe)(bpy)(H2O)]PF6&#8901;H2O (1) which is suitable for piezoelectric energy harvesting due to its large values of piezoelectric co&#8208;efficient (d33=10&#8197;pm&#8201;V&#8722;1) and spontaneous polarization (Ps=1.3&#8197;&#956;C&#8201;cm&#8722;2). Among the devices prepared with the composite films of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and various weight % composition of 1, the 10&#8197;Wt&#8201;% composite shows the highest output voltage of 8&#8197;V, a power density of 0.85&#8197;&#956;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and output current of 5&#8197;&#956;A, which is highest for any discrete inorganic complex reported to date.

A rapid water adsorption/desorption process with low energy consumption was achieved in the nano&#8208;confined channels of CPOS&#8208;6. The confined water can be regarded as a molecular superfluid.







Abstract
White et&#8197;al., in a recent Correspondence, provided additional structural data to illustrate that CPOS&#8208;6 undergoes a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation during water adsorption/desorption. This finding gave a better understanding of the relevant experimental phenomena from the perspective of structural transformation and is a good complement to our previous results. However, we wish to emphasize that our research focuses on the kinetic behavior of water during ultrafast adsorption/desorption in nano&#8208;confined channels. Herein, we further interpret the rapid transport of water molecules in the nano&#8208;confined channels from the perspective of superfluidity.

         <title>Identifying the Interfacial Polarization in Non&#8208;stoichiometric Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites by Defect Engineering</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For perovskites, it is challenging to quantitatively study the concentration of defects. A theoretical relationship between defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure.







Abstract
Recent advances in perovskite ferroelectrics have fostered a host of exciting sensors and actuators. Defect engineering provides critical control of the performance of ferroelectric materials, especially lead&#8208;free ones. However, it remains a challenge to quantitatively study the concentration of defects due to the complexity of measurement techniques. Here, a feasible approach to analyzing the A&#8208;site defect and electron in alkali metal niobate is demonstrated. The theoretical relationships among defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure. As a result, the variation of defect concentration gives rise to defect&#8208;driven interfacial polarization, which further leads to distinct properties of the ceramics. e.g., abnormal dielectric behavior.

     alt="Identifying the Interfacial Polarization in Non-stoichiometric Lead-Free Perovskites by Defect Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For perovskites, it is challenging to quantitatively study the concentration of defects. A theoretical relationship between defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in perovskite ferroelectrics have fostered a host of exciting sensors and actuators. Defect engineering provides critical control of the performance of ferroelectric materials, especially lead-free ones. However, it remains a challenge to quantitatively study the concentration of defects due to the complexity of measurement techniques. Here, a feasible approach to analyzing the A-site defect and electron in alkali metal niobate is demonstrated. The theoretical relationships among defect concentration, conductivity, and oxygen partial pressure can be established based on the defect chemistry equilibria. The type and concentration of defects are reflected through the conductivity variation with oxygen partial pressure. As a result, the variation of defect concentration gives rise to defect-driven interfacial polarization, which further leads to distinct properties of the ceramics. e.g., abnormal dielectric behavior. Furthermore, this study also suggests a strategy to manipulate defects and charges in perovskite oxides for performance optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Reprogramming of Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages with Internally and Externally Engineered Exosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reprogramming of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) has emerged as an efficient strategy for immunotherapy. However, most of the approaches did not allow the in situ reprogramming of TAM because their low efficiency, non&#8208;specificity, or potential side effects. Herein, we produced exosomes with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats interference (CRISPRi) internally engineered and the TAM specific peptide externally engineered onto the exosome membrane. The  internally and  externally  engineered  exosomes (IEEE, also named as I3E) allowed the selective homing to tumor tissue and targeted to M2&#8208;like TAMs, which nearly repressed the expression of PI&#8208;3 kinase gamma (PI3K&#947;) completely, and induced the TAMs polarizing to M1 both in vitro and in vivo. The polarized M1 macrophages awakened the &#8220;hot&#8221; tumor&#8208;immunity, causing the increase of T lymphocyte infiltration and the decrease of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and inhibiting the tumor growth significantly. I3E reprogramed TAMs in situ precisely and efficiently.</dc:description>

         <title>Substantial Improvement of an Epimerase for the Synthesis of D&#8208;Allulose by&#160;Biosensor&#8208;Based High&#8208;Throughput Microdroplet Screening</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biosynthesis of D&#8208;allulose has been achieved using ketose 3&#8208;epimerases (KEases), but its application is limited by poor catalytic performance. Here, we redesigned a genetically encoded biosensor based on a D&#8208;allulose&#8208;responsive transcriptional regulator for real&#8208;time monitoring of D&#8208;allulose. An ultrahigh&#8208;throughput droplet&#8208;based microfluidic screening platform was further constructed by coupling with this D&#8208;allulose&#8208;detecting biosensor for the directed evolution of the KEases. Structural analysis of Sinorhizobium fredii D&#8208;allulose 3&#8208;epimerase (SfDAE) revealed that a highly flexible helix/loop region exposes or occludes the catalytic center as an essential lid conformation regulating substrate recognition. We reprogrammed SfDAE using structure&#8208;guided rational design and directed evolution, in which a mutant M3&#8208;2 was identified with 17&#8208;fold enhanced catalytic efficiency. Our research offers a paradigm for the design and optimization of a biosensor&#8208;based microdroplet screening platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Regioselective Electrooxidative Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H/N&#8211;H Annulation with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, the merging of electrosynthesis with 3d metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H activation has emerged as a sustainable and powerful technique in organic synthesis. Despite the impressive advantages, the development of an enantioselective version remains elusive and pose a daunting challenge. Herein, we reported the first electrooxidative cobalt&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8722;H/N&#8722;H annulation with olefins in a simple undivided cell at room temperature&#160;(up to 99% ee).  t Bu&#8208;Salox, a rationally designed Salox ligand bearing a bulky tert&#8208;butyl group at the ortho&#8208;position of phenol based on the mechanistic understanding, was found to be crucial for this asymmetric annulation reaction. A strong cooperative effect of  t Bu&#8208;Salox and 3,4,5&#8208;trichloropyridine enabled the highly enantio&#8208; and regioselective C&#8208;H annulation with the more challenging &#945;&#8208;olefins without secondary bond interaction (up to 96% ee and 97:3 rr). Cyclovoltametric studies, the preparation, characterization, and transformation of cobaltacycle intermediates shed light on the mechanism of this reaction.</dc:description>

In this work, we report a facile in situ polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane electrolytes to fabricate integrated solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The in situ polymerization and formation of solid&#8208;state dioxolane electrolytes on interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and active materials is the key to realizing a high&#8208;performance battery with excellent interfacial contact among CNTs, active materials and electrolytes. Therefore, the electrodes could be tightly integrated into batteries through the CNTs and electrolyte. Electrons/ions enable full access to active materials in the whole electrode. Electrodes with a low resistance of 4.5 &#937; &#9633;&#8208;1 and high lithium&#8208;ion diffusion efficiency of 2.5&#215;10&#8208;11 cm2 s&#8208;1 can significantly improve the electrochemical kinetics.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Bi Nanosheets Promotes CO2&#8226;&#8722; Formation for High&#8208;Performance and pH&#8208;Universal Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to chemical fuels such as formate offers a promising pathway to carbon&#8208;neutral future, but its practical application is largely inhibited by the lack of effective activation of CO2 molecules and pH&#8208;universal feasibility. Here, we report an electronic structure manipulation strategy to electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets, where electrons transfer from Cu donor to Bi acceptor in bimetallic Cu&#8208;Bi, enabling CO2RR towards formate with concurrent high activity, selectivity and stability in pH&#8208;universal (acidic, neutral and alkaline) electrolytes. Combined in situ Raman spectra and computational calculations unravel that electron&#8208;rich Bi promote CO2&#8226;&#8722; formation to activate CO2 molecules, and enhance the adsorption strength of *OCHO intermediate with an up&#8208;shifted p&#8208;band center, thus leading to its superior activity and selectivity of formate. Further integration of the robust electron&#8208;rich Bi nanosheets into III&#8208;V&#8208;based photovoltaic solar cell results in an unassisted artificial leaf with a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate (STF) efficiency of 13.7%.</dc:description>

         <title>Porous and Water Stable 2D Hybrid Metal Halide with Broad Light Emission and Selective H2O Vapor Sorption</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we report a strategy for generating porosity in hybrid metal halide materials by using molecular cages serving as both structure&#8208;directing agents and counter&#8208;cations. Reaction of the [2,2,2] cryptand (DHS) linker with Pb(II) in acidic media gave rise to the first porous and water stable 2D metal halide semiconductor (DHS)2Pb5Br14. The corresponding material is stable in liquid water for a year, while gas and vapor sorption studies revealed that it can selectively and reversibly adsorb H2O and D2O at room temperature (RT). Solid state NMR measurements and DFT calculations verified the incorporation of H2O and D2O in the organic linker cavities, and shed light on their molecular configuration. In addition to porosity, the material exhibits broad light emission centered at 617 nm with a full width at half&#8208;maximum (fwhm) of 284 nm (0.96 eV). The recorded water stability is unparalleled for hybrid metal halide and perovskite materials, while the generation of porosity opens up new pathways towards unexplored applications (e.g. solid&#8208;state batteries) for this class of hybrid semiconductors.</dc:description>

The recorded water stability is unparalleled for hybrid metal halide and perovskite materials, while the generation of porosity opens up new pathways towards unexplored applications (e.g. solid-state batteries) for this class of hybrid semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Tuned Multicolor Emission of 2D Lead Halide Perovskites with Ultrahigh Color Purity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical diversity and structural flexibility of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) offer tremendous opportunities to tune their optical properties through internal molecular engineering and external stimuli. Herein, we report the wide&#8208;range and ultrapure photoluminescence emissions in a family of homologous 2D LHPs, [MeOPEA]2PbBr4&#8722;4xI4x (MeOPEA = 4&#8208;methoxyphenethylammonium; x = 0, 0.2, 0.425, 0.575, 1) enabled through internal chemical pressure and external hydrostatic pressure. The chemical pressure, induced by the C&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions and halogen doping/substitution strengthens the structural rigidity to give sustained narrow emissions, and regulates the emission energy, respectively. Further manipulation of physical pressure leads to wide&#8208;range emission tuning from 412 to 647 nm in a continuous and reversible manner. This work could open up new pathways for developing 2D LHP emitters with ultra&#8208;wide color gamut and high color purity which are highly useful for pressure sensing.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Oligomerization Reactions of the Cyaphide Anion</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyaphide anion, CP&#8722;, is shown to undergo three distinct oligomerization reactions in the coordination sphere of metals. Reductive coupling of Au(IDipp)(CP) (IDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) by Sm(Cp*)2(OEt2) (Cp* = 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethylcyclopentadienyl), was found to afford a tetra&#8208;metallic complex containing a 2,3&#8208;diphospha&#8208;butadiene&#8208;1,1,4,4&#8208;tetraide fragment. By contrast, non&#8208;reductive dimerization of Ni(SIDipp)(Cp)(CP) (SIDipp = 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;imidazoleidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; Cp = cyclopentadienyl), gives rise to an asymmetric bimetallic complex containing a 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobuta&#8208;diene&#8208;2,4&#8208;diide moiety. Spontaneous trimerization of Sc(Cp*)2(CP) results in the formation of a trimetallic complex&#160;&#160;containing a 1,3,5&#8208;triphosphabenzene&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;triide fragment. These transformations show that while cyaphido transition metal complexes can be readily accessed using metathesis reactions, many such species are unstable to further oligomerization processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Additive&#8208;derived Films on Cu Electrodes Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products Under Strongly Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) at low pH is desired for high CO2 utilization; the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a challenge. High alkali cation concentration at a high operating current density has recently been used to promote electrochemical CO2R at low pH. Herein we report an alternative approach to selective CO2R (&gt;70% Faradaic efficiency for C2+ products, FEC2+) at low pH (pH = 2; H3PO4/KH2PO4) and low potassium concentration ([K+] = 0.1 M) using organic film&#8208;modified polycrystalline copper (Modified&#8208;Cu). Such an electrode effectively mitigates HER due to attenuated proton transport. Modified&#8208;Cu still achieves high FEC2+ (45% with Cu foil /55% with Cu GDE) even under 1.0 M H3PO4 (pH ~ 1) at low [K+] (0.1 M) even at low operating current, conditions where HER can otherwise dominate.</dc:description>

         <title>Concerted and Selective Electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived Alcohol to Glycolic Acid at an Industry&#8208;level Current Density over a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electro&#8208;reforming of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into fine chemicals and H2 is an ideal solution to address severe plastic pollution. Here we report the electrooxidation of EG to glycolic acid (GA) with a high Faraday efficiency and selectivity (&gt; 85%) even at an industry&#8208;level current density (600 mA cm&#8208;2 at 1.15 V vs. RHE) over a Pd&#8208;Ni(OH)2 catalyst. Notably, stable electrolysis over 200 h can be achieved, outperforming all available Pd&#8208;based catalysts. Combined experimental and theoretical results reveal that 1) the OH* generation promoted by Ni(OH)2 plays a critical role in facilitating EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA oxidation and removing poisonous carbonyl species, thereby achieving high activity and stability; 2) Pd with a downshifted d&#8208;band center and the oxophilic Ni can synergistically facilitate the rapid desorption and transfer of GA from the active Pd sites to the inactive Ni sites, avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and thus achieving high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly&#8208;Hydride [Au(I)7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 cluster complex: Structure, Transformation, and CO2 Electrocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Hydride Au(I) bonds are labile due to the mismatch in electric potential of an oxidizing metal and reducing ligand, and therefore the structure and structure&#8208;activity relationships of nanoclusters that contain them are seldom studied. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of [Au7(PPh3)7H5](SbF6)2 (abbrev. Au7H52+), an Au cluster complex containing five hydride ligands, which decomposed to give [Au8(PPh3)7]2+ (abbrev. Au82+) upon exposure to light (300 to 450 nm). The valence state of Au(I) and H&#8208; was verified by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and XPS. The two nanoclusters behaved differently in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR): Au7H52+ exhibited 98.2% selectivity for H2, whereas Au82+ was selective for CO (73.5%). Further DFT calculations showed that the H&#8208; ligand inhibited the CO2RR process compared with the electron&#8208;donor H.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlating Experimentally Determined CO Adsorption Enthalpy with Electrochemical CO Reduction Performance on Cu Surfaces</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CO binding energy has been widely employed as a descriptor for effective catalysts in the electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction reactions (CO(2)RR), however, it has yet to be determined experimentally at electrochemical interfaces due to the lack of suitable techniques. In this work, we developed a method to determine the standard adsorption enthalpy of CO on Cu surfaces with quantitative surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy. On dendritic Cu at &#8208;0.75 V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5 &#177; 0.5 kJ/mol, ~37.9 &#177; 13.4 J/(mol&#215;K), and ~&#8208;9.8 &#177; 4.0 kJ/mol, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide&#8208;derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products. The method developed in this work will help establish the correlation between the CO binding energy and the CO(2)RR activity.</dc:description>

On dendritic Cu at -0.75 V vs. SHE, the standard adsorption enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy were determined to 1.5 &#177; 0.5 kJ/mol, ~37.9 &#177; 13.4 J/(mol&#215;K), and ~-9.8 &#177; 4.0 kJ/mol, respectively. Comparison of the standard adsorption enthalpy of oxide-derived Cu and dendritic Cu, as well as their CORR activities, suggests the presence of stronger binding sites on OD Cu, which could favor multicarbon products.

         <title>One Dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks for 2e&#8208; Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have been well employed for electrocatalytic systems because of their structural diversities. However, the atomic utilization efficiency was still under improved, because of the catalytic centers located in the basal layers, which is difficult to access the electrolytes. Herein, we have first demonstrated 1D COFs for 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). With using different four&#8208;connectivity blocks, the prepared 1D COFs display good crystallinity, high surface areas, and excellent chemical stability. The more exposed catalytic sites made the 1D COFs showed higher electrochemically active surface areas, 4.8&#8208;fold of that of controlled 2D COF, and thus enable to catalyze ORR with higher H2O2 selectivity of 85.8% and activity with TOF value of 0.051 s&#8208;1 at 0.2 V, than those of 2D COF (72.9% and 0.032 s&#8208;1). This work paves the way to developing COFs with low dimension for electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreduction of CO2 on Au(310)@Cu High&#8208;index Facets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical selectivity and faradaic efficiency of high&#8208;index Cu facets for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is investigated. More specifically, shape&#8208;controlled nanoparticles enclosed by Cu {hk0} facets are fabricated using Cu multilayer deposition at three distinct layer thicknesses on the surface facets of Au truncated ditetragonal nanoprisms (Au DTPs). Au DTPs are shapes enclosed by 12 high&#8208;index {310} facets. Facet angle analysis confirms DTP geometry. Elemental mapping analysis shows Cu surface layers are uniformly distributed on the Au {310} facets of the DTPs. The 7 nm Au@Cu DTPs high&#8208;index {hk0} facets exhibit a CH4:CO product ratio of almost 10:1 compared to a 1:1 ratio for the reference 7 nm Au@Cu spherical nanoparticles (NPs). Operando Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra disclose reactive adsorbed *CO as the main intermediate, whereas CO stripping experiments reveal the high&#8208;index facets enhance the *CO formation followed by rapid desorption or hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Biased Borate Esterification during Nucleoside Phosphorylase&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions: Apparent Equilibrium Shifts and Kinetic Implications</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalytic nucleoside (trans&#8208;)glycosylations catalyzed by nucleoside phosphorylases have graduated to a practical and convenient approach to the preparation of modified nucleosides, which are important pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various cancers and viral infections. However, the obtained yields in these reactions are generally determined exclusively by the innate thermodynamic properties of the nucleosides involved, hampering the biocatalytic access to many sought&#8208;after target nucleosides. We herein report an additional means for reaction engineering of these systems. We show how apparent equilibrium shifts in phosphorolysis and glycosylation reactions can be effected through entropically driven, biased esterification of nucleosides and ribosyl phosphates with inorganic borate. Our multifaceted analysis further describes the kinetic implications of this in situ reactant esterification for a model phosphorylase.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High voltage can cost&#8208;effectively boost energy density of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes based Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but compromises their mechanical, electrochemical and thermal&#8208;driven stability. Herein, a collaborative strategy (i.e., small single&#8208;crystal design and hetero&#8208;atom doping) is devised to construct a chemomechanically reliable small single&#8208;crystal Mo&#8208;doped LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (SS&#8208;MN6) operating stably under high voltage (&#8805;4.5 V vs. Li/Li+). The substantially reduced particle size combined with Mo6+ doping absorbs accumulated localized stress to eradicate cracks formation, subdues the surface side reactions and lattice oxygen missing meanwhile, and improves thermal tolerance at highly delithiated state. Consequently, the SS&#8208;MN6 based pouch cells are endowed with striking deep cycling stability and wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;tolerance capability. The contribution here provides a promising way to construct advanced cathodes with superb chemomechanical stability for next&#8208;generation LIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Crystalline and Amorphous States of a Metal&#8208;Organic Complex for Transformation of the Photosalient Effect and Positive&#8208;Negative Photochromism</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to leverage crystalline and amorphous states of a zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic complex in order to tune negative and positive photochromism was proposed, which could be assigned to the competitive chemical routes between photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals. Furthermore, polymorphs (1 and 2) both exhibit mechanochromic photoemission, and lead to the on/off toggling of the light&#8208;driven motion of bulky molecular crystals.







Abstract
Uncovering differences between crystalline and amorphous states in molecular solids would both promote the understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships, as well as inform development of multi&#8208;functional materials based on the same compound. Herein, for the first time, we report an approach to leverage crystalline and amorphous states of a zero&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic complex, which exhibited negative and positive photochromism, due to the competitive chemical routes between photocycloaddition and photogenerated radicals. Furthermore, different polymorphs lead to the on/off toggling of photo&#8208;burst movement (photosalient effect), indicating the controllable light&#8208;mechanical conversion. Three demos were further constructed to support their application in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work provides the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of a state&#8208; and polymorph&#8208;dependent photochemical route, paving an effective way for the design of new dynamically responsive systems.

         <title>Structurally Diverse Bench&#8208;Stable Nickel(0) Pre&#8208;Catalysts: A Practical Toolkit for In Situ Ligation Protocols
</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of air&#8208;stable Ni0 pre&#8208;catalysts of the general type Ni(COD)(L) are described, where L=thiophene oxide, quinone, cyclopentadienone, or fulvene. The properties of the complexes are analyzed through computational and experimental techniques. The precatalysts are competent in a variety of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions and together constitute a toolkit that overcomes the limitations of both Ni(COD)2 and Ni(COD)(DQ).







Abstract
A flurry of recent research has centered on harnessing the power of nickel catalysis in organic synthesis. These efforts have been bolstered by contemporaneous development of well&#8208;defined nickel (pre)catalysts with diverse structure and reactivity.

Our investigation includes preparations of novel, bench&#8208;stable Ni(COD)(L) complexes (COD=1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), in which L=quinone, cyclopentadienone, thiophene&#8208;S&#8208;oxide, and fulvene. Characterization by NMR, IR, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and natural bond orbital analysis sheds light on the structure, bonding, and properties of these complexes. Applications in an assortment of nickel&#8208;catalyzed reactions underscore the complementary nature of the different pre&#8208;catalysts within this toolkit.

&lt;p&gt;A series of air-stable Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; pre-catalysts of the general type Ni(COD)(L) are described, where L=thiophene oxide, quinone, cyclopentadienone, or fulvene. The properties of the complexes are analyzed through computational and experimental techniques. The precatalysts are competent in a variety of nickel-catalyzed reactions and together constitute a toolkit that overcomes the limitations of both Ni(COD)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni(COD)(DQ).

         <title>Sustainable Design of Structural and Functional Polymers for a Circular Economy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and functional polymers provide functions, sustainability benefits, and CO2 savings during their use phase, but present challenges at end of life. Polymer science and adjacent disciplines can enable a circular economy of polymers via biodegradation or recycling through the application of strategies for molecular and system design that leverage the latest advances in the field.







Abstract
To achieve a sustainable circular economy, polymer production must start transitioning to recycled and biobased feedstock and accomplish CO2 emission neutrality. This is not only true for structural polymers, such as in packaging or engineering applications, but also for functional polymers in liquid formulations, such as adhesives, lubricants, thickeners or dispersants. At their end of life, polymers must be either collected and recycled via a technical pathway, or be biodegradable if they are not collectable. Advances in polymer chemistry and applications, aided by computational material science, open the way to addressing these issues comprehensively by designing for recyclability and biodegradability. This Review explores how scientific progress, together with emerging regulatory frameworks, societal expectations and economic boundary conditions, paint pathways for the transformation towards a circular economy of polymers.

         <title>Highly Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes for Cancer Imaging and Laparotomy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophores with high chemiluminescence quantum yields were synthesized and developed into an activatable chemiluminescence probe for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminescence imaging holds potential for sensitive imaging of cancer due to its low background; however, few NIR chemiluminophores are available, which share the drawback of low chemiluminescence quantum yields (&#934;CL). Herein, we report the synthesis of NIR chemiluminophores for cancer imaging and laparotomy. Molecular engineering of the electron&#8208;withdrawing group at the para&#8208;position of the phenol&#8208;dioxetane leads to a highly bright NIR chemiluminophore (DPT), showing the &#934;CL (4.6&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;Einstein&#8201;mol&#8722;1) that is 3 to 5&#8208;fold higher than existing NIR chemiluminophores. By caging the phenol group of DPT with a cathepsin&#8197;B (CatB) responsive moiety, an activatable chemiluminescence probe (DPTCB) is developed for real&#8208;time turn&#8208;on detection of deeply buried tumor tissues in living mice. Due to its high brightness, DPTCB permits accurate chemiluminescence&#8208;guided laparotomy.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Pyrazolines and Pyrazoles via [3+2] Dipolar Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically initiated [3+2] cycloaddition reactions of readily available and less toxic starting materials enable a facile synthesis of pyrazolines and pyrazoles. Application of a biphasic system and sodium iodide in a dual role as mediator and electrolyte allows for selective reactions with outstanding robustness towards scalability.







Abstract
Pyrazolines and pyrazoles are common and important motifs of pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals. Herein, the first electrochemical approach for their direct synthesis from easily accessible hydrazones and dipolarophiles up to decagram scale is presented. The application of a biphasic system (aqueous/organic) even allows for the conversion of highly sensitive alkenes, wherein inexpensive sodium iodide is employed in a dual role as supporting electrolyte and mediator. In addition, mechanistic insight into the reaction is given by the isolation of key step intermediates. The relevance of the presented reaction is underlined by the synthesis of commercial herbicide safener mefenpyr&#8208;diethyl in good yields.

         <title>Non&#8208;Flammable Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Fast Charging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;flammable electrolyte that endows Li&#8208;ion battery with high voltage, wide temperature, and fast charging is developed. Moreover, a new solvation chemistry&#8208;derived dynamic interfacial model, involving the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of electrolyte components on the cathode and anode simultaneously, was presented for the first time to interpret such excellent performance and guide the electrolyte design at a molecular scale.







Abstract
Electrolyte design has become ever more important to enhance the performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the flammability issue and high reactivity of the conventional electrolytes remain a major problem, especially when the LIBs are operated at high voltage and extreme temperatures. Herein, we design a novel non&#8208;flammable fluorinated ester electrolyte that enables high cycling stability in wide&#8208;temperature variations (e.g., &#8722;50&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;60&#8201;&#176;C) and superior power capability (fast charge rates up to 5.0&#8197;C) for the graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) battery at high voltage (i.e., &gt;4.3&#8197;V vs. Li/Li+). Moreover, this work sheds new light on the dynamic evolution and interaction among the Li+, solvent, and anion at the molecular level. By elucidating the fundamental relationship between the Li+ solvation structure and electrochemical performance, we can facilitate the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries operating in harsh conditions.

         <title>SASSY NMR: Simultaneous Solid and Solution Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SASSY NMR is a novel 2&#8208;in&#8208;1 technique capable of observing solid and solution phases simultaneously. Gel&#8208;like material appears in both fractions with a distribution proportional to the rigidity of the C&#8722;H dipoles. SASSY is advantageous when monitoring processes involving multiphase changes, as traditional sequential solid and solution NMR can miss rapid fluctuations. SASSY is easy to use, time efficient and can be applied universally.







Abstract
Synergism between different phases gives rise to chemical, biological or environmental reactivity, thus it is increasingly important to study samples intact. Here, SASSY (SimultAneous Solid and Solution spectroscopY) is introduced to simultaneously observe (and differentiate) all phases in multiphase samples using standard, solid&#8208;state NMR equipment. When monitoring processes, the traditional approach of studying solids and liquids sequentially, can lead to information in the non&#8208;observed phase being missed. SASSY solves this by observing the full range of materials, from crystalline solids, through gels, to pure liquids, at full sensitivity in every scan. Results are identical to running separate 13C CP&#8208;MAS solid&#8208;state and 13C solution&#8208;state experiments back&#8208;to&#8208;back but requires only a fraction of the spectrometer time. After its introduction, SASSY is applied to process monitoring and finally to detect all phases in a living freshwater shrimp. SASSY is simple to implement and thus should find application across all areas of research.

SASSY is advantageous when monitoring processes involving multiphase changes, as traditional sequential solid and solution NMR can miss rapid fluctuations. SASSY is easy to use, time efficient and can be applied universally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergism between different phases gives rise to chemical, biological or environmental reactivity, thus it is increasingly important to study samples intact. Here, SASSY (SimultAneous Solid and Solution spectroscopY) is introduced to simultaneously observe (and differentiate) all phases in multiphase samples using standard, solid-state NMR equipment. When monitoring processes, the traditional approach of studying solids and liquids sequentially, can lead to information in the non-observed phase being missed. SASSY solves this by observing the full range of materials, from crystalline solids, through gels, to pure liquids, at full sensitivity in every scan. Results are identical to running separate &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C CP-MAS solid-state and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C solution-state experiments back-to-back but requires only a fraction of the spectrometer time. After its introduction, SASSY is applied to process monitoring and finally to detect all phases in a living freshwater shrimp. SASSY is simple to implement and thus should find application across all areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expediting Oxygen Evolution by Optimizing Cation and Anion Complexity in Electrocatalysts Based on Metal Phosphorous Trichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increases with the cation/anion complexity of the employed electrocatalysts based on metal phosphorous trichalcogenides. The most complex catalyst has a nearly optimum OER activity descriptor value and a different rate&#8208;determining step with respect to its sibling catalysts, making it the most active catalyst in the family.







Abstract
Purposely changing the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major challenge for enhancing the energy efficiency of electrochemical splitting of water. Here we show that the OER RDS can be regulated by simply varying the cation and anion complexity in a family of the metal phosphorous trichalcogenide electrocatalysts (MPT3, where M=Fe, Ni; T=S, Se), achieving an exceptionally high OER activity in (Ni,Fe)P(S,Se)3, as demonstrated by its ultra&#8208;low Tafel slope (34&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and a very low overpotential compared to many relevant OER catalysts. This is strongly supported by density functional theory calculations, which showed that this catalyst has a nearly optimal OER activity descriptor value of &#916;G(O*)&#8722;&#916;G(OH*)=1.5&#8197;eV. We also found that the activity descriptor is proportional to a newly proposed cation/anion complexity index that consists of pairwise contributions from cation&#8208;anion bonds in a catalyst compound, revealing the pivotal role of the cation&#8208;anion interactions in determining the catalyst performance and providing a simple way for predicting catalytic activities.

         <title>Dynamics and Proton Conduction of Heterogeneously Confined Imidazole in Porous Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazole confined in porous coordination polymers&#8217; channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of typical core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model, in which the core&#8208;layer possess faster rotating dynamics contributing to enhanced proton conductivity.







Abstract
The nanoconfinement of proton carrier molecules may contribute to the lowing of their proton dissociation energy. However, the free proton transportation does not occur as easily as in liquid due to the restricted molecular motion from surface attraction. To resolve the puzzle, herein, imidazole is confined in the channels of porous coordination polymers with tunable geometries, and their electric/structural relaxations are quantified. Imidazole confined in a square&#8208;shape channels exhibits dynamics heterogeneity of core&#8208;shell&#8208;cylinder model. The core and shell layer possess faster and slower structural dynamics, respectively, when compared to the bulk imidazole. The dimensions and geometry of the nanochannels play an important role in both the shielding of the blocking effect from attractive surfaces and the frustration filling of the internal proton carrier molecules, ultimately contributing to the fast dynamics and enhanced proton conductivity.

         <title>Engineering p&#8208;Band Center of Oxygen Boosting H+ Intercalation in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tuning the &#1013;p of O in &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode can effectively increase H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability for aqueous zinc ion batteries. The &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation contribution that describes a volcano curve as a function of &#1013;p, and the best cathode is optimized to be the Cu&#8722;MnO2 among Cu&#8722;, Ni&#8722;, Co&#8722;, Zn&#8722;MnO2.







Abstract
In aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), the H+ intercalation possesses superior electrochemical kinetics with excellent rate capability, however, precisely modulating H+ intercalation has been still challenging. Herein, a critical modification of pre&#8208;intercalating metal ions in the MnO2 interlayer (M&#8722;MnO2) with controllable p&#8208;band center (&#1013;p) of O is reported to modulate the H+ intercalation. The modulation of metal&#8208;O bond type and covalency degree on the average charge of O atom results in optimized &#1013;p and H+ adsorption energy for M&#8722;MnO2, thus promoting the balance between H+ adsorption and desorption, which plays a determinant role on H+ intercalation. The optimized Cu&#8722;MnO2 delivers superior rate capability with the capacity of 153&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a high rate of 3&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000&#8197;cycles. This work demonstrates that &#1013;p could be a significant descriptor for H+ intercalation, and tuning &#1013;p effectively increases H+ intercalation contribution with excellent rate capability in ZIBs.

         <title>Metalloallostery and Transition Metal Signaling: Bioinorganic Copper Chemistry Beyond Active Sites</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalloallostery, where metals regulate protein function through binding to a remote allosteric exosite rather than an active site, expands the roles of metals in biological chemistry. Using copper as a canonical example, we summarize advances in the field through imaging tools for labile metal pools, positive and negative allosteric transition metal signaling, and copper&#8208;dependent regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.







Abstract
Transition metal chemistry is essential to life, where metal binding to DNA, RNA, and proteins underpins all facets of the central dogma of biology. In this context, metals in proteins are typically studied as static active site cofactors. However, the emergence of transition metal signaling, where mobile metal pools can transiently bind to biological targets beyond active sites, is expanding this conventional view of bioinorganic chemistry. This Minireview focuses on the concept of metalloallostery, using copper as a canonical example of how metals can regulate protein function by binding to remote allosteric sites (e.g., exosites). We summarize advances in and prospects for the field, including imaging dynamic transition metal signaling pools, allosteric inhibition or activation of protein targets by metal binding, and metal&#8208;dependent signaling pathways that underlie nutrient vulnerabilities in diseases spanning obesity, fatty liver disease, cancer, and neurodegeneration.

         <title>Single&#8208;entity Electrochemistry Unveils Dynamic Transformation during Tandem Catalysis of Cu2O and Co3O4 for Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational catalyst design strategy is vital for a highly efficient conversion of NO3&#8722; to NH3. Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst exhibit a much higher NH3 yield rate than the single component alone. More importantly, we confirmed tandem catalysis by placing individual single Cu2O and Co3O4 on carbon nanoelectrode. Using single&#8208;entity electrochemistry and identical&#8208;location TEM we unveiled the dynamic transformation caused by tandem catalysis.







Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate to ammonia is an essential and sustainable approach to restoring the globally perturbed nitrogen cycle. The rational design of catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) based on a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is of high significance. We report a Cu2O+Co3O4 tandem catalyst which enhances the NH3 production rate by &#8776;2.7&#8208;fold compared to Co3O4 and &#8776;7.5&#8208;fold compared with Cu2O, respectively, however, most importantly, we precisely place single Cu2O and Co3O4 cube&#8208;shaped nanoparticles individually and together on carbon nanoelectrodes provide insight into the mechanism of the tandem catalysis. The structural and phase evolution of the individual Cu2O+Co3O4 nanocubes during NO3RR is unveiled using identical location transmission electron microscopy.

&lt;p&gt;A rational catalyst design strategy is vital for a highly efficient conversion of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O+Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tandem catalyst exhibit a much higher NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate than the single component alone. More importantly, we confirmed tandem catalysis by placing individual single Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on carbon nanoelectrode. Using single-entity electrochemistry and identical-location TEM we unveiled the dynamic transformation caused by tandem catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically converting nitrate to ammonia is an essential and sustainable approach to restoring the globally perturbed nitrogen cycle. The rational design of catalysts for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) based on a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism is of high significance. We report a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O+Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tandem catalyst which enhances the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production rate by &#8776;2.7-fold compared to Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &#8776;7.5-fold compared with Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, respectively, however, most importantly, we precisely place single Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cube-shaped nanoparticles individually and together on carbon nanoelectrodes provide insight into the mechanism of the tandem catalysis. The structural and phase evolution of the individual Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O+Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanocubes during NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR is unveiled using identical location transmission electron microscopy.

         <title>Bonding and Reactivity in Terminal versus Bridging Arenide Complexes of Thorium Acting as ThII Synthons</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mononuclear arenide complex and an inverse&#8208;sandwich complex of thorium can perform multielectron reductive chemistry with a range of substrates acting as ThII synthons. The mononuclear complex shows higher reactivity towards an diazoolefine yielding a ThIV amidoacetylido complex via a vinylidene intermediate suggesting that the Th reactivity is tuned by the arenide binding mode.







Abstract
Thorium redox chemistry is extremely scarce due to the high stability of ThIV. Here we report two unique examples of thorium arenide complexes prepared by reduction of a ThIV&#8208;siloxide complex in presence of naphthalene, the mononuclear arenide complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th(&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (1) and the inverse&#8208;sandwich complex [K(OSi(OtBu)3)3Th]2(&#956;&#8208;&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;C10H8)] (2). The electrons stored in these complexes allow the reduction of a broad range of substrates (N2O, AdN3, CO2, HBBN). Higher reactivity was found for the complex 1 which reacts with the diazoolefin IDipp=CN2 to yield the unexpected ThIV amidoalkynyl complex 5 via a terminal N&#8208;heterocyclic vinylidene intermediate. This work showed that arenides can act as convenient redox&#8208;active ligands for implementing thorium&#8208;ligand cooperative multielectron transfer and that the reactivity can be tuned by the arenide binding mode.

         <title>Characterization and Application of Supramolecular Junctions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of supramolecular electronics, an emerging and rapidly growing field that converges supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics. Intensive attention is paid to depicting the electrical properties of various individual supramolecular assemblies and the unique quantum effects during intermolecular charge transport. Moreover, the dynamic monitoring of the supramolecular assembly processes at the single&#8208;molecule scale and the application of supramolecular electronics are also discussed.







Abstract
The convergence of supramolecular chemistry and single&#8208;molecule electronics offers a new perspective on supramolecular electronics, and provides a new avenue toward understanding and application of intermolecular charge transport at the molecular level. In this review, we will provide an overview of the advances in the characterization technique for the investigation of intermolecular charge transport, and summarize the experimental investigation of several non&#8208;covalent interactions, including &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, hydrogen bonding, host&#8208;guest interactions and &#963;&#8208;&#963; interactions at the single&#8208;molecule level. We will also provide a perspective on supramolecular electronics and discuss the potential applications and future challenges.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals as Bioinspired Hair&#8208;Like Sensors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;aspect ratio, elastically bendable organic single crystal is presented as a hair air&#8208;flow sensor. The crystal acts as a passive light&#8208;transducing medium that is stamped with a fluorescent dye to track its deformation upon exposure to nitrogen gas. Furthermore, the modelling analysis of the air&#8208;flow&#8208;induced crystal deformation, and the response to flow dynamics around the crystal body are presented.







Abstract
One of the typical haptic elements are natural hairy structures that animals and plants rely on for feedback. Although these hair sensors are an admirable inspiration, the development of active flow sensing components having low elastic moduli and high aspect ratios remains a challenge. Here, we report a new sensing approach based on a flexible, thin and optically transmissive organic crystal of high aspect ratio, which is stamped with fluorescent dye for tracking. When subjected to gas flow and exposed to laser, the crystal bends due to exerted pressure and acts as an optical flow (hair) sensor with low detection limit (&#8776;1.578&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1) and fast response time (&#8776;2.70&#8197;s). The air&#8208;flow&#8208;induced crystal deformation and flow dynamics response are modelled by finite element analysis. Due to having a simple design and being lightweight and mechanically robust this prototypical crystal hair&#8208;like sensor opens prospects for a new class of sensing devices ranging from wearable electronics to aeronautics.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Hydrogenation of Phenol with Earth&#8208;abundant Ni&#8722;MoO2 Heterostructured Catalysts: Effect of Oxygen Vacancy on Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of MoO2 enhances the catalytic efficiency of Ni in selective electrochemical hydrogenation of phenol in aqueous 0.1&#8197;M H2SO4 solutions. The origin of the superior performance is revealed by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
Herein, we report highly efficient carbon supported Ni&#8722;MoO2 heterostructured catalysts for the electrochemical hydrogenation (ECH) of phenol in 0.10&#8197;M aqueous sulfuric acid (pH&#8197;0.7) at 60&#8201;&#176;C. Highest yields for cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone of 95&#8201;% and 86&#8201;% with faradaic efficiencies of &#8764;50&#8201;% are obtained with catalysts bearing high and low densities of oxygen vacancy (Ov) sites, respectively. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the enhanced phenol adsorption strength is responsible for the superior catalytic efficiency. Furthermore, 1&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1&#8208;ol is an important intermediate. Its hydrogenation route and hence the final product are affected by the Ov density. This work opens a promising avenue to the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for the upgrading of phenolic compounds.

         <title>Tandem Mass Spectrometry Imaging Enables High Definition for Mapping Lipids in Tissues</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiplexed MS/MS imaging method is developed that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid species or more for each sampling spot on tissue samples. Coupling with on&#8208;tissue photochemical derivatization, this method enables sensitive imaging of multiple phospholipid C=C location isomers in cancerous tissue sections.







Abstract
Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids in biological tissues is useful for correlating molecular distribution with pathological results, which could provide useful information for both biological research and disease diagnosis. It is well understood that the lipidome could not be clearly deciphered without tandem mass spectrometry analysis, but this is challenging to achieve in MSI due to the limitation in sample amount at each image spot. Here we develop a multiplexed MS2 imaging (MS2I) method that can provide MS2 images for 10 lipid species or more for each sampling spot, providing spatial structural lipidomic information. Coupling with on&#8208;tissue photochemical derivatization, imaging of 20 phospholipid C=C location isomers is also realized, showing enhanced molecular images with high definition in structure for mouse brain and human liver cancer tissue sections. Spatially mapped t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding has also been adopted to visualize the tumor margin with enhancement by structural lipidomic information.

         <title>A Homochiral Poly(2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based Membrane for Efficient Enantioselective Separation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;based membranes (S&#8208;PdMeOx/GO) are prepared via a simple solution&#8208;based method on porous substrates for chiral separation. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based network within the graphene oxide scaffold induced homochirality in the membrane. The resulting S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane displays excellent enantioselectivity in separating racemic limonene mixtures.







Abstract
Chiral separation membranes have shown great potential for the efficient separation of racemic mixtures into enantiopure components for many applications, such as in the food and pharmaceutical industries; however, scalable fabrication of membranes with both high enantioselectivity and flux remains a challenge. Herein, enantiopure S&#8208;poly(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (S&#8208;PdMeOx) macromonomers were synthesized and used to prepare a new type of enantioselective membrane consisting of a chiral S&#8208;PdMeOx network scaffolded by graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The S&#8208;PdMeOx&#8208;based membrane showed a near&#8208;quantitative enantiomeric excess (ee) (98.3&#177;1.7&#8201;%) of S&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;limonene over R&#8208;(+)&#8208;limonene and a flux of 0.32&#8197;mmol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the potential of homochiral poly(2,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)s in chiral discrimination and provides a new route to the development of highly efficient enantioselective membranes using synthetic homochiral polymer networks.

         <title>Regulating Spin States in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. Regulating spin state of active centers could influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. This minireview summarizes approaches for the characterization and regulation of spin states as a basis for the design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Developing efficient and stable transition metal oxides catalysts for energy conversion processes such as oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction is one of the key measures to solve the problem of energy shortage. The spin state of transition metal oxides is strongly correlated with their catalytic activities. In an octahedral structure of transition metal oxides, the spin state of active centers could be regulated by adjusting the splitting energy and the electron pairing energy. Regulating spin state of active centers could directly modulate the d orbitals occupancy, which influence the strength of metal&#8208;ligand bonds and the adsorption behavior of the intermediates. In this review, we clarified the significance of regulating spin state of the active centers. Subsequently, we discussed several characterization technologies for spin state and some recent strategies to regulate the spin state of the active centers. Finally, we put forward some views on the future research direction of this vital field.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Fluorinated Cyclic Ether with a Low Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cosolvents, MFSI and TFF, were synthesized and investigated for lithium metal batteries. Among the four different electrolytes, the TFF&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibited the highest coulombic efficiency of 99.59&#8201;%, which is due to the low redox potential of TFF promoting the anion reduction, leading to an inorganic SEI formation.







Abstract
Electrolyte engineering is crucial for developing high&#8208;performance lithium metal batteries (LMB). Here, we synthesized two cosolvents methyl bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (MFSI) and 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorotetrahydrofuran (TFF) with significantly different reduction potentials and add them into LiFSI&#8208;DME electrolytes. The LiFSI/TFF&#8208;DME electrolyte gave an average Li Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.41&#8201;% over 200 cycles, while the average Li CEs for MFSI&#8208;based electrolyte is only 98.62&#8201;%. Additionally, the TFF&#8208;based electrolytes exhibited a more reversible performance than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fluorinated 1,4&#8208;dimethoxylbutane electrolyte in both Li||Cu half&#8208;cell and anode&#8208;free Cu||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell. More importantly, the decomposition product from bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion could react with ether solvent, which destroyed the SEI, thus decreasing cell performance. These key discoveries provide new insights into the rational design of electrolyte solvents and cosolvents for LMB.

         <title>Phenoxazine Polymer&#8208;based p&#8208;type Positive Electrode for Aluminum&#8208;ion Batteries with Ultra&#8208;long Cycle Life</title>

         <dc:description>
A p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode is developed for Al&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). The N and O dual active sites in the PVBPX perform a reversible two&#8208;step redox reaction with AlCl4&#8722;, contributing to a high specific capacity. The expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000&#8197;cycles.







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, good safety, and high theoretical capacity of Al. However, AIBs with inorganic positive electrodes still suffer from sluggish kinetics and structural collapse upon cycling. Herein, we propose a novel p&#8208;type poly(vinylbenzyl&#8208;N&#8208;phenoxazine) (PVBPX) positive electrode for AIBs. The dual active sites enable PVBPX to deliver a high capacity of 133&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. More impressively, the expanded &#960;&#8208;conjugated construction, insolubility, and anionic redox chemistry without bond rearrangement of PVBPX for AIBs contribute to an amazing ultra&#8208;long lifetime of 50000&#8197;cycles. The charge storage mechanism is that the AlCl4&#8722; ions can reversibly coordinate/dissociate with the N and O sites in PVBPX sequentially, which is evidenced by both experimental and theoretical results. These findings establish a foundation to advance organic AIBs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Directed Symmetry Breaking and Spin Filtering of Supramolecular Assemblies from only Achiral Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical nanofibers have been prepared from exclusively achiral building blocks upon ultrasonication&#8208;induced morphology transformation. The as&#8208;made helical nanofibers show a more robust and repeatable control of the helical handedness compared with those generated using common chiral solvents. It was further verified that the helical nanofibers can act as a spin filter with a comparable spin polarization (45&#8201;%) at room temperature.







Abstract
Herein we describe the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral molecule into macroscopic helicity as well as the emergent chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect. It was found that a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) motif with an aminopyridine group in each arm could coordinate with AgI and self&#8208;assemble into nanospheres. Upon sonication, symmetry breaking occurred and the nanospheres transferred into helical nanofibers with strong CD signals. Although the sign of the CD signals appeared randomly, it could be controlled by using the as&#8208;made chiral assemblies as a seed. Furthermore, it was found that the charge transport of the helical nanofibers was highly selective with a spin&#8208;polarization transport of up to 45&#8201;%, although the chiral nanofibers are composed exclusively from achiral building blocks. This work demonstrates symmetry breaking under sonication and the chiral&#8208;selective spin&#8208;filtering effect.

         <title>A Substituted&#8208;Rhodamine&#8208;Based Reversible Fluorescent Probe for In Vivo Quantification of Glutathione</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms by bioimaging is achieved by using ZpSiP, a substituted&#8208;rhodamine&#8208;based ratiometric probe with reliable reactivity with GSH. The probe succeeded in monitoring the dynamics of GSH in the organisms bearing tumor tissues, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis, and thus unveiling the related pathological processes and mechanisms.







Abstract
Quantifying glutathione (GSH) in cells and organisms is of great significance for understanding the mechanism of oxidative stress in various physiological and pathological processes. However, the quantification by fluorescence bioimaging in living tissues has much stricter requirements than the &#8220;Petri dish&#8221;&#8208;cultured cells in flat plates. Based on the evaluation of the electronic structure and steric hindrance&#8208;tuned reactivity of phospha&#8208;substituted rhodamine with GSH, a reversible F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe ZpSiP with a distinct performance (Kd=4.9&#8197;mM, t1/2=0.57&#8197;s, k=81&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) is developed for real time quantifying GSH in living cells. Furthermore, the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) probe succeeded in sensitively tracking the dynamics of GSH in the real organisms bearing tumors, chronic renal failure, and liver fibrosis for unveiling the related pathological processes. We believe that the advance in chemistry with quantitative analysis methods will initiate more promising progress and broad applications.

         <title>Wurtzite CuGaS2 with an In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed CuO Layer Photocatalyzes CO2 Conversion to Ethylene with High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates strain&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction in wurtzite CuGaS2, leading to heterojunction formation under basic conditions. The oxidation state of Cu was finetuned to modulate the pathway of the CO2 reduction reaction to the formation of ethylene with high selectivity. Detailed mechanistic insight was obtained from DFT calculations and in situ DRIFTS, which reveal a new pathway for C&#8722;C coupling and ethylene production.







Abstract
We present surface reconstruction&#8208;induced C&#8722;C coupling whereby CO2 is converted into ethylene. The wurtzite phase of CuGaS2. undergoes in situ surface reconstruction, leading to the formation of a thin CuO layer over the pristine catalyst, which facilitates selective conversion of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4). Upon illumination, the catalyst efficiently converts CO2 to C2H4 with 75.1&#8201;% selectivity (92.7&#8201;% selectivity in terms of Relectron) and a 20.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 evolution rate. Subsequent spectroscopic and microscopic studies supported by theoretical analysis revealed operando&#8208;generated Cu2+, with the assistance of existing Cu+, functioning as an anchor for the generated *CO and thereby facilitating C&#8722;C coupling. This study demonstrates strain&#8208;induced in situ surface reconstruction leading to heterojunction formation, which finetunes the oxidation state of Cu and modulates the CO2 reduction reaction pathway to selective formation of ethylene.

         <title>Step by Step Induced Growth of Zinc&#8208;Metal Interface on Graphdiyne for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradual induced increase on size from atom to nanoflat are showing the great power of the conjugated, multi&#8208;pore structure of graphdiyne (GDY). An electrode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries obtained by anchoring Zn atoms on graphdiyne shows excellent electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities.







Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) promise high energy density, low redox potential, low cost and safety; however, their cycle performances are seriously insufficient to restrict the progress in this field. We propose a new concept of atomic electrode formed on the graphdiyne (GDY). This new idea electrode was synthesized by selectively, uniformly, and stably anchoring Zn atoms on GDY at the beginning of plating. The Zn atoms are induced to grow into larger size Zn clusters, which continue to grow into nanoflat. Finally, a new heterojunction interface is formed on GDY without any Zn dendrites and side reactions, even at high current densities. Such stepwise induction of growth greatly suppresses the formation of Zn dendrites, resulting in high electroplating/stripping reversibility and lifespan of AZIBs.

         <title>Twisting of Porphyrin by Assembly in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework yielding Chiral Photoconducting Films for Circularly&#8208;Polarized&#8208;Light Detection</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating functionalized porphyrin in a crystalline lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework thin film, the porphyrin core twists and becomes chiral. The chiral porphyrin thin film shows excellent optoelectronic properties with different photocurrents for right&#8208; and left&#8208;circularly polarized light.







Abstract
While materials based on organic molecules usually have either superior optoelectronic or superior chiral properties, the combination of both is scarce. Here, a crystalline chiroptical film based on porphyrin with homochiral side groups is presented. While the dissolved molecule has a planar, thus, achiral porphyrin core, upon assembly in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) film, the porphyrin core is twisted and chiral. The close packing and the crystalline order of the porphyrin cores in the MOF film also results in excellent optoelectronic properties. By exciting the Soret band of porphyrin, efficient photoconduction with a high On&#8208;Off&#8208;ratio is realized. More important, handedness&#8208;dependent circularly&#8208;polarized&#8208;light photoconduction with a dissymmetry factor g of 4.3&#215;10&#8722;4 is obtained. We foresee the combination of such assembly&#8208;induced chirality with the rich porphyrin chemistry will enable a plethora of organic materials with exceptional chiral and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Heterogeneous Hydrogenation with Hydrogen Spillover Enabled by Nitrogen Vacancies on Boron Nitride&#8208;Supported Pd Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
h&#8208;BN containing abundant nitrogen vacancies is demonstrated as an effective support for Pd nanocatalysts to develop the capability for the hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones to alcohols with hydrogen spillover. While nitrogen vacancies play a crucial role in the spillover of H atoms from Pd onto h&#8208;BN, high selectivity to alcohols by hydrogen spillover is ascribed to the weak adsorption of alcohols to the hydrogenation sites (nitrogen vacancies).







Abstract
Heterogeneous hydrogenation with hydrogen spillover has been demonstrated as an effective route to achieve high selectivity towards target products. More effort should be paid to understand the complicated correlation between the nature of supports and hydrogenation involving hydrogen spillover. Herein, we report the development of the hydrogenation system of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN)&#8208;supported Pd nanoparticles for the hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones to alcohols with hydrogen spillover. Nitrogen vacancies in h&#8208;BN determine the feasibility of hydrogen spillover from Pd to h&#8208;BN. The hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones with hydrogen spillover from Pd proceeds on nitrogen vacancies on h&#8208;BN. The weak adsorption of alcohols to h&#8208;BN inhibits the deep hydrogenation of aldehydes/ketones, thus leading to high catalytic selectivity to alcohols. Moreover, the hydrogen spillover&#8208;based hydrogenation mechanism makes the catalyst system exhibit a high tolerance to CO poisoning.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), their synthesis, their advantages in photocatalysis, and the strategies for boosting their photocatalytic performance are summarized in this review. Currently problems and their solutions are presented.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), a rising star in the post&#8208;graphene era, are fundamentally and technologically intriguing for photocatalysis. Their extraordinary electronic, optical, and chemical properties endow them as promising materials for effectively harvesting light and catalyzing the redox reaction in photocatalysis. Here, we present a tutorial&#8208;style review of the field of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis to educate researchers (especially the new&#8208;comers), which begins with a brief introduction of the fundamentals of 2D TMDs and photocatalysis along with the synthesis of this type of material, then look deeply into the merits of 2D TMDs as co&#8208;catalysts and active photocatalysts, followed by an overview of the challenges and corresponding strategies of 2D TMDs for photocatalysis, and finally look ahead this topic.

         <title>Elucidating Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Kinetics via Intermediates by Time&#8208;Dependent Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond electron transfer number and rate constant for oxygen reduction reaction, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species in the diffusion layer was successfully revealed from time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence decay curves. Such uncovered information would guide electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.







Abstract
Facile evaluation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics for electrocatalysts is critical for sustainable fuel&#8208;cell development and industrial H2O2 production. Despite great success in ORR studies using mainstream strategies, such as the membrane electrode assembly, rotation electrodes, and advanced surface&#8208;sensitive spectroscopy, the time and spatial distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) intermediates in the diffusion layer remain unknown. Using time&#8208;dependent electrochemiluminescence (Td&#8208;ECL), we report an intermediate&#8208;oriented method for ORR kinetics analysis. Owing to multiple ultrasensitive stoichiometric reactions between ROS and the ECL emitter, except for electron transfer numbers and rate constants, the potential&#8208;dependent time and spatial distribution of ROS were successfully obtained for the first time. Such exclusively uncovered information would guide the development of electrocatalysts for fuel cells and H2O2 production with maximized activity and durability.

Herein, we describe the development of a copper&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8208;amination of proaromatic dihydroquinazolinones derived from ketone building blocks. The reaction is enabled by the intermediacy of open&#8208;shell species arising from homolytic C&#8722;C bond&#8208;cleavage driven by aromatization. The protocol is characterized by its operational simplicity and generality, including chemical diversification of advanced intermediates.

         <title>Benzotrithiophene&#8208;based Covalent Organic Framework Photocatalysts with Controlled Conjugation of Building Blocks for Charge Stabilization</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzotrithiophene (BTT) based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were prepared with different electron accepting units, which could be attributable to the photocatalytic reduction reaction. Based on both experimental results and theoretical calculations, the photocatalytic performance of BTT&#8208;COFs closely depended on the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks have recently shown high potential for photocatalytic hydrogen production. However, their structure&#8208;property&#8208;activity relationship has not been sufficiently explored to identify a research direction for structural design. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of four benzotrithiophene (BTT)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with different conjugations of building units, and their photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production. All four BTT&#8208;COFs had slipped parallel stacking patterns with high crystallinity and specific surface areas. The change in the degree of conjugation was found to rationally tune the rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Based on the experimental and calculation results, the tunable photocatalytic performance could be mainly attributed to the electron affinity and charge trapping of the electron accepting units. This study provides important insights for designing covalent organic frameworks for efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>Influence of Side Chain Conformation on the Activity of Glycosidase Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first experimental demonstration that preorganization of inhibitor side chain conformation can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition is reported. By strategic installation of a methyl group at C6, a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche side chain conformation was found to be a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin.







Abstract
Substrate side chain conformation impacts reactivity during glycosylation and glycoside hydrolysis and is restricted by many glycosidases and glycosyltransferases during catalysis. We show that the side chains of gluco and manno iminosugars can be restricted to predominant conformations by strategic installation of a methyl group. Glycosidase inhibition studies reveal that iminosugars with the gauche,gauche side chain conformations are 6&#8208; to 10&#8208;fold more potent than isosteric compounds with the gauche,trans conformation; a manno&#8208;configured iminosugar with the gauche,gauche conformation is a 27&#8208;fold better inhibitor than 1&#8208;deoxymannojirimycin. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic benefits of preorganization, particularly when in synergy with favorable hydrophobic interactions. The demonstration that inhibitor side chain preorganization can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition paves the way for improved inhibitor design through conformational preorganization.

&lt;p&gt;Substrate side chain conformation impacts reactivity during glycosylation and glycoside hydrolysis and is restricted by many glycosidases and glycosyltransferases during catalysis. We show that the side chains of &lt;i&gt;gluco&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;manno&lt;/i&gt; iminosugars can be restricted to predominant conformations by strategic installation of a methyl group. Glycosidase inhibition studies reveal that iminosugars with the &lt;i&gt;gauche,gauche&lt;/i&gt; side chain conformations are 6- to 10-fold more potent than isosteric compounds with the &lt;i&gt;gauche,trans&lt;/i&gt; conformation; a &lt;i&gt;manno&lt;/i&gt;-configured iminosugar with the &lt;i&gt;gauche,gauche&lt;/i&gt; conformation is a 27-fold better inhibitor than 1-deoxymannojirimycin. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic benefits of preorganization, particularly when in synergy with favorable hydrophobic interactions. The demonstration that inhibitor side chain preorganization can favorably impact glycosidase inhibition paves the way for improved inhibitor design through conformational preorganization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circular Upcycling of Bottlebrush Thermosets</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Built&#8208;in circularity by integrating closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling in brush&#8208;like thermosets with dynamic crosslinks.







Abstract
The inability to re&#8208;process thermosets hinders their utility and sustainability. An ideal material should combine closed&#8208;loop recycling and upcycling capabilities. This trait is realized in polydimethylsiloxane bottlebrush networks using thermoreversible Diels&#8211;Alder cycloadditions to enable both reversible disassembly into a polymer melt and on&#8208;demand reconfiguration to an elastomer of either lower or higher stiffness. The crosslink density was tuned by loading the functionalized networks with a controlled fraction of dormant crosslinkers and crosslinker scavengers, such as furan&#8208;capped bis&#8208;maleimide and anthracene, respectively. The resulting modulus variations precisely followed the stoichiometry of activated furan and maleimide moieties, demonstrating the lack of side reactions during reprocessing. The presented circularity concept is independent from the backbone or side chain chemistry, making it potentially applicable to a wide range of brush&#8208;like polymers.

         <title>Synthetic K+ Channels Constructed by Rebuilding the Core Modules of Natural K+ Channels in an Artificial System</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in an artificial system has led to a biomimetic K+ channel. This channel possesses similar structural features as the natural version, which enables it to replicate the transport behavior and biological function of natural K+ channels.







Abstract
Different types of natural K+ channels share similar core modules and cation permeability characteristics. In this study, we have developed novel artificial K+ channels by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems. All the channels displayed high selectivity for K+ over Na+ and exhibited a selectivity sequence of K+&#8776;Rb+ during the transport process, which is highly consistent with the cation permeability characteristics of natural K+ channels. More importantly, these artificial channels could be efficiently inserted into cell membranes and mediate the transmembrane transport of K+, disrupting the cellular K+ homeostasis and eventually triggering the apoptosis of cells. These findings demonstrate that, by rebuilding the core modules of natural K+ channels in artificial systems, the structures, transport behaviors, and physiological functions of natural K+ channels can be mimicked in synthetic channels.

         <title>Thermodynamic Control of Intramolecular Singlet Fission and Exciton Transport in Linear Tetracene Oligomers</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of newly synthesized homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers are presented. The molecular design strategy achieves efficient exciton transport in linear tetracene oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling a sequential exciton trapping process by intramolecular singlet fission.







Abstract
We newly synthesized a series of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tetracene (Tc) oligomers to propose a molecular design strategy for the efficient exciton transport in linear oligomers by promoting correlated triplet pair (TT) dissociation and controlling sequential exciton trapping process of individual doubled triplet excitons (T+T) by intramolecular singlet fission. First, entropic gain effects on the number of Tc units are examined by comparing Tc&#8208;homo&#8208;oligomers [(Tc)n: n=2, 4, 6]. Then, a comparison of (Tc)n and Tc&#8208;hetero&#8208;oligomer [TcF3&#8208;(Tc)4&#8208;TcF3] reveals the vibronic coupling effect for entropic gain. Observed entropic effects on the T+T formation indicated that the exciton migration is rationalized by number of possible TT states increased both by increasing the number of Tc units and by the vibronic levels at the terminal TcF3 units. Finally, we successfully observed high&#8208;yield exciton trapping process (trapped triplet yield: &#934;TrT=176&#8201;%).

         <title>Rational Design of Ferroelectric 2D Perovskite for Improving the Efficiency of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells Over 23&#8201;%</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite has been designed based on a pyridine ring as the organic interlayer. Incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field and optimized perovskite crystallization, delivering an exceptional efficiency over 23&#8201;% for flexible perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Despite the great progress of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs), it still faces several challenges during the homogeneous fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films, and overcoming the insufficient exciton dissociation. To the ends, we rationally design the ferroelectric two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite based on pyridine heterocyclic ring as the organic interlayer. We uncover that incorporation of the ferroelectric 2D material into 3D perovskite induces an increased built&#8208;in electric field (BEF), which enhances the exciton dissociation efficiency in the device. Moreover, the 2D seeds could assist the 3D crystallization by forming more homogeneous and highly&#8208;oriented perovskite crystals. As a result, an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 23&#8201;% has been achieved by the f&#8208;PSCs with outstanding ambient stability. Moreover, the piezo/ferroelectric 2D perovskite intrigues a decreased hole transport barriers at the ITO/perovskite interface under tensile stress, which opens new possibilities for developing highly&#8208;efficient f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Chiral Bimetallic Ag22Cu7 Superatom with Multiple Chirality Origins</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alkynyl&#8208;protected chiral bimetallic AgCu superatomic nanocluster [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6]&#8722; with a high free valence electron count is reported. This cluster exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, metal&#8208;ligand interface and ligand layer.







Abstract
Understanding the origin of chirality in the nanostructured materials is essential for chiroptical and catalytic applications. Here we report a chiral AgCu superatomic cluster, [Ag22Cu7(C&#8801;CR)16(PPh3)5Cl6](PPh4), Ag22Cu7, protected by an achiral alkynyl ligand (HC&#8801;CR: 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetylene). Its crystal structure comprises a rare interpenetrating biicosahedral Ag17Cu2 core, which is stabilized by four different types of motifs: one Cu(C&#8801;CR)2, four &#8722;C&#8801;CR, two chlorides and one helical Ag5Cu4(C&#8801;CR)10(PPh3)5Cl4. Structural analysis reveals that Ag22Cu7 exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, the metal&#8208;ligand interface and the ligand layer. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of R/S&#8208;Ag22Cu7 are obtained by employing appropriate chiral molecules as optical enrichment agents. DFT calculations show that Ag22Cu7 is an eight&#8208;electron superatom, confirm that the cluster is chirally active, and help to analyze the origins of the circular dichroism.

Here we report a chiral AgCu superatomic cluster, [Ag&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;](PPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, protected by an achiral alkynyl ligand (HC&#8801;CR: 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetylene). Its crystal structure comprises a rare interpenetrating biicosahedral Ag&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core, which is stabilized by four different types of motifs: one Cu(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, four &#8722;C&#8801;CR, two chlorides and one helical Ag&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(C&#8801;CR)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Structural analysis reveals that &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; exhibits multiple chirality origins, including the metal core, the metal-ligand interface and the ligand layer. Furthermore, the circular dichroism spectra of &lt;b&gt;R/S-Ag&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; are obtained by employing appropriate chiral molecules as optical enrichment agents. DFT calculations show that &lt;b&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; is an eight-electron superatom, confirm that the cluster is chirally active, and help to analyze the origins of the circular dichroism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Robust Microporous Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Ethylene Purification under Dry and Humid Conditions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly robust microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks with high ethane uptake and selectivity, ultrahigh water stability, High chemical stability, and low ethane/ethene adsorption enthalpy were designed and synthesized, which could realize one&#8208;step C2H4 purification from binary C2H6/C2H4 mixtures under both dry and humid conditions.







Abstract
Two C2H6&#8208;selective metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) adsorbents with ultrahigh stability, high surface areas, and suitable pore size have been designed and synthesized for one&#8208;step separation of ethane/ethylene (C2H6/C2H4) under humid conditions to produce polymer&#8208;grade pure C2H4. Experimental results reveal that these two MOFs not only adsorb a high amount of C2H6 but also display good C2H6/C2H4 selectivity verified by fixed bed column breakthrough experiments. Most importantly, the good water stability and hydrophobic pore environments make these two MOFs capable of efficiently separating C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions, exhibiting the benchmark performance among all reported adsorbents for separation of C2H6/C2H4 under humid conditions. Moreover, the affinity sites and their static adsorption energies were successfully revealed by single crystal data and computation studies. Adsorbents described in this work can be used to address major chemical industrial challenges.

         <title>Precise Assembly of Polyoxometalates at Single&#8208;cluster Levels</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This mini&#8208;review focuses on the precise synthesis of POM&#8208;based nanomaterials with well&#8208;defined structures, including amphiphilic POM assemblies, cluster&#8208;nuclei co&#8208;assemblies, POM&#8208;POSS co&#8208;cluster assemblies and POM&#8208;polymer co&#8208;assemblies. In particular, POM based sub&#8208;1&#8197;nm nanowires exhibit extraordinary mechanical properties due to the multiscale assembly and topological interactions between nanowires.







Abstract
Polyoxometalate (POM) clusters with atomic precision structures are promising candidates construct functional nanomaterials via self&#8208;assembly. Non&#8208;covalent interactions at molecular levels can govern the self&#8208;assembly of POM clusters, for which the precise control of POM&#8208;based assemblies can be realized at single&#8208;cluster levels. This mini&#8208;review focuses on the synthesis and properties of POM&#8208;based nanostructures, including amphiphilic POM assemblies and co&#8208;assemblies of POM clusters and other subnanometer building blocks. Several synthetic strategies have been developed for rational control of POM&#8208;based assemblies in terms of morphologies, compositions and properties. 1D subnanometer POM assemblies demonstrate remarkable enhanced mechanical properties due to the topological interactions between nanowires and surroundings. The in&#8208;depth understanding of POM&#8208;based assemblies may help in the design of functional nanomaterials in fundamental perspectives and applications.

         <title>A Triply Negatively Charged Nanographene Bilayer with Spin Frustration</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triply negatively charged radical species based on a bilayer of a C96 nanographene was synthesized and characterized. It is stabilized as an open&#8208;shell doublet ground state with an excited quartet state. It is the largest well&#8208;defined open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of a triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Spin frustration is observed in this species.







Abstract
We report on the largest open&#8208;shell graphenic bilayer and also the first example of triply negatively charged radical &#960;&#8208;dimer. Upon three&#8208;electron reduction, bilayer nanographene fragment molecule (C96H24Ar6)2 (Ar=2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl) (12) was transformed to a triply negatively charged species 123&#8901;&#8722;, which has been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic properties on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). 123&#8901;&#8722; features a 96&#8208;center&#8208;3&#8208;electron (96c/3e) pancake bond with a doublet ground state, which can be thermally excited to a quartet state. It consists of 34 &#960;&#8208;fused rings with 96 conjugated sp2 carbon atoms. Spin frustration is observed with the frustration parameter f&gt;31.8 at low temperatures in 123&#8901;&#8722;, which indicates graphene upon reduction doping may behave as a quantum spin liquid.

         <title>Diethylzinc&#8208;Mediated Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions between Dibromoketones and Monobromo Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes and subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reactions between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds.







Abstract
A novel route to synthesize 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds is described. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dibromoketones generate zinc enolates through a diethylzinc&#8208;mediated halogen&#8208;metal exchange and react with &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds to furnish 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via a second generation of zinc enolates. This cross&#8208;coupling reaction is enabled by the chemoselective formation of zinc enolates from &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoketones in the presence of &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds. Chiral 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds can be obtained via the enantioselective bromination of aldehydes using a chiral secondary amine catalyst and a subsequent cross&#8208;coupling reaction between the resulting chiral &#945;&#8208;bromoaldehydes and &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dibromoacetophenones.

         <title>Host&#8211;Guest Doping in Flexible Organic Crystals for Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of flexibility and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence in an organic single crystal is achieved by the host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The centimeter&#8208;scale crystals can be repeatedly bent and emit deep&#8208;red afterglow. This phenomenon occurs because the guest molecules, as trace impurities, greatly affect the emission properties of the materials, whereas the effect on the molecular packing of the host molecules is negligible.







Abstract
Organic single crystals (OSCs) with excellent flexibility and unique optical properties are of great importance due to their broad applicability in optical/optoelectronic devices and sensors. Nevertheless, fabricating flexible OSCs with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains a great challenge. Herein, we propose a host&#8211;guest doping strategy to achieve both RTP and flexibility of OSCs. The single&#8208;stranded crystal is highly bendable upon external force application and can immediately return to its original straight shape after removal of the stress, impressively emitting bright deep&#8208;red phosphorescence. The theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the bright RTP arises from F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the triphenylene molecules to the dopants. This strategy is both conceptually and synthetically simple and offers a universal approach for the preparation of flexible OSCs with RTP.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Mapping of Membrane Proteins on Synaptic Vesicles using Spectrally Encoded Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We used the intensity ratio of the first and second vibronic peaks of semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) to correlate photoswitching events. Multi&#8208;fold localization precision enhancement was achieved by averaging over switching events from the same Pdot. This method was used to count and map two membrane proteins on synaptic vesicles.







Abstract
The spatial resolution of single&#8208;molecule localization microscopy is limited by the photon number of a single switching event because of the difficulty of correlating switching events dispersed in time. Here we overcome this limitation by developing a new class of photoswitching semiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) with structured and highly dispersed single&#8208;particle spectra. We imaged the Pdots at the first and the second vibronic emission peaks and used the ratio of peak intensities as a spectral coding. By correlating switching events using the spectral coding and performing 4&#8211;9 frame binning, we achieved a 2&#8211;3 fold experimental resolution improvement versus conventional superresolution imaging. We applied this method to count and map SV2 and proton ATPase proteins on synaptic vesicles (SVs). The results reveal that these proteins are trafficked and organized with high precision, showing unprecedented level of detail about the composition and structure of SVs.

         <title>An Atomically Precise Pyrazolate&#8208;Protected Copper Nanocluster Exhibiting Exceptional Stability and Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically precise pyrazolate&#8208;protected copper nanocluster exhibits extraordinary chemical stability toward oxygen, heat, oxidant (8&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2), acid (1&#8197;M HCl) and base (20&#8197;M KOH). It has been used as stable homogeneous catalysts for synthesis of indolizine with exceptional catalytic activity, delivering superior TOF (3380&#8197;h&#8722;1) compared to other reported catalysts.







Abstract
The synthesis of atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu&#8208;NCs) with high chemical stability is a prerequisite for practical applications, yet still remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we have prepared a pyrazolate&#8208;protected Cu&#8208;NC (Cu8), which exhibited exceptional chemical stability either in solid&#8208;state or in solution. The crystals of Cu8 are still suitable for single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis even after being treated with boiling water, 8&#8197;wt&#8201;% H2O2, high concentrated acid (1&#8197;M HCl) or saturated base (&#8776;20&#8197;M KOH), respectively. More importantly, the structure of Cu8 in solution also remained intact toward oxygen, organic acid (100&#8197;eq. HOAc) or base (400&#8197;eq. dibutylamine) confirmed by 1H&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis analysis. Taking advantage of high alkali&#8208;resistant, Cu8 illustrates excellent catalytic activity for the synthesis of indolizines, and it can be reused for at least 10 cycles without losing catalytic performance.

         <title>Constructing 2D Sandwich&#8208;like MOF/MXene Heterostructures for Durable and Fast Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF/MXene heterostructure, which exhibits a molecular&#8208;scale hybridized MOF (Cu&#8208;HHTP) and MX (V2CTx MXene) nanosheets, is successfully synthesized. The results show that the Zn2+ storage capability of such a 2D heterostructure is boosted by enhancing the structural stability, electrical conductivity, and the utilization of active sites.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) can be used as the cathodes for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion battery due to their large one&#8208;dimensional channels. However, the conventionally poor electrical conductivity and low structural stability hinder their advances. Herein, we report an alternately stacked MOF/MX heterostructure, exhibiting the 2D sandwich&#8208;like structure with abundant active sites, improved electrical conductivity and exceptional structural stability. Ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal a reversible intercalation mechanism of zinc ions and high electrical conductivity in the 2D heterostructure. Electrochemical tests confirm excellent Zn2+ migration kinetics and ideal pseudocapacitive behaviors. As a consequence, Cu&#8208;HHTP/MX shows a superior rate performance (260.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 173.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term cycling stability of 92.5&#8201;% capacity retention over 1000&#8197;cycles at 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Mechanistic Elucidations of Highly Dispersed Metalloporphyrin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PCN&#8208;222(Fe), a metalloporphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), was used for the CO2 electroreduction reaction. The proposed reaction mechanism necessitated catalyst weight loadings of 1&#8197;wt.% to mitigate obfuscations from mass transfer and in situ Raman spectroscopy to confirm the structural and reactive stability of the MOF under operating conditions.







Abstract
Immobilization of porphyrin complexes into crystalline metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) enables high exposure of porphyrin active sites for CO2 electroreduction. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed iron&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (PCN&#8208;222(Fe)) on carbon&#8208;based electrodes revealed optimal turnover frequencies for CO2 electroreduction to CO at 1&#8197;wt.% catalyst loading, beyond which the intrinsic catalyst activity declined due to CO2 mass transport limitations. In situ Raman suggested that PCN&#8208;222(Fe) maintained its structure under electrochemical bias, permitting mechanistic investigations. These revealed a stepwise electron transfer&#8208;proton transfer mechanism for CO2 electroreduction on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) electrodes, which followed a shift from a rate&#8208;limiting electron transfer to CO2 mass transfer as the potential increased from &#8722;0.6&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V vs. RHE. Our results demonstrate how intrinsic catalytic investigations and in situ spectroscopy are needed to elucidate CO2 electroreduction mechanisms on PCN&#8208;222(Fe) MOFs.

         <title>Helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;Based Chromophores with B&#8722;O&#8722;B Bridge: Facile Synthesis and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B&#8208;bridged chromophores has shown that the bridge leads to distorted conformations. This results in the chromophores having excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties, such as tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL) of 11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in the near&#8208;infrared region observed for one of the compounds.







Abstract
It is essential to create organic compounds that exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range. Helicene&#8208;type emitters possess appealing chiroptical features, however, such NIR molecules are scarce due to a paucity of synthetic strategies. Herein, we developed a series of helical &#946;&#8208;isoindigo&#8208;based B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridged aza&#8208;BODIPY analogs that were synthesized conveniently. The reaction of diimino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;isoindigo with a heteroaromatic amine produced a restricted ligand cavity, which triggered off the generation of a B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge. The B&#8722;O&#8722;B bridge led to distorted conformations that satisfy the helical requirements, resulting in excellent spectroscopic and chiroptical properties. Tunable CPL with the highest luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.3&#215;10&#8722;3 and a CPL brightness (BCPL=11.5&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1) in the NIR region was achieved. This synthetic approach is expected to offer a new opportunity to chiral chemistry and increase flexibility for chiroptical tuning.

         <title>Liquid Metal as Bioinspired and Unusual Modulator in Bioorthogonal Catalysis for Tumor Inhibition Therapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a heterogeneous LM&#8208;Pd catalyst with liquid metal as a bioinspired and unusual modulator to realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for potent tumor inhibition. This appealing strategy will not only broaden the application of liquid metals but also provide new insight into the design and construction of novel bioorthogonal catalysts.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal catalysis mediated by Pd&#8208;based transition metal catalysts has sparked increasing interest in combating diseases. However, the catalytic and therapeutic efficiency of current Pd0 catalysts is unsatisfactory. Herein, inspired by the concept that ligands around metal sites could enable enzymes to catalyze astonishing reactions by changing their electronic environment, a LM&#8208;Pd catalyst with liquid metal (LM) as an unusual modulator has been designed to realize efficient bioorthogonal catalysis for tumor inhibition. The LM matrix can serve as a &#8220;ligand&#8221; to afford an electron&#8208;rich environment to stabilize the active Pd0 and promote nucleophilic turnover of the &#960;&#8208;allylpalladium species to accelerate the uncaging process. Besides, the photothermal properties of LM can lead to the enhanced removal of tumor cells by photo&#8208;enhanced catalysis and photothermal effect. We believe that our work will broaden the application of LM and motivate the design of bioinspired bioorthogonal catalysts.

         <title>Supramolecular Shish Kebabs: Higher Order Dimeric Structures from Ring&#8208;in&#8208;Rings Complexes with Conformational Adaptivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Use of abiotic chemical systems for understanding higher order superstructures is challenging. Here we report a ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system comprising a hydrogen&#8208;bonded macrocycle and cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene) tetracation ( o&#8208;Box) or cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) tetracation (CBPQT4+,  p&#8208;Box) that fulfills the construction of discrete higher order structures with adaptive conformation. As indicated by mass spectrometry, computational modeling, NMR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, this ring&#8208;in&#8208;ring(s) system features the box&#8208;directed aggregation of multiple macrocycles, leading to generation of several stable species such as H4G (1a/ o&#8208;Box) and H5G (1a/ o&#8208;Box). Remarkably, a dimeric shish&#8208;kebab&#8208;like ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings superstructure H7G2 (1a/ o&#8208;Box) or H8G2 (1a/ p&#8208;Box) is formed from the coaxial stacking of two ring&#8208;in&#8208;rings units. The formation of such unique dimeric superstructures is attributed to the large &#960;&#8208;surface of this 2D planar macrocycle and the conformational variation of both host and guest.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the fluorescence performance of AIE polymers by controlling the polymer microstructure</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) polymers with expected emission wavelength/color and fluorescence efficiency are valuable in applications. However, most AIE polymers exhibit irregular emission wavelength/color changes compared to the original AIE monomers. Here, we report the synthesis of AIE polymers with unchanged emission wavelength by ring&#8208;opening (co)polymerizations of triphenylethylenephenolmethyl)oxirane (TPEO) and other epoxides or phthalic anhydride. The chemical structures/physical properties of all (co)polymers were characterized by NMR, SEC, MALDI&#8208;TOF, and DSC. The co&#8208;polyether microstructures were revealed by calculating the reactivity ratios and visualized by Monte Carlo simulation. The photoluminescence quantum yields of all the (co)polymers were determined in the solid state. We systematically correlated the fluorescence performance with molecular weights, crystallinity, monomer compositions, glass transition temperatures, side lengths, and flexibility/rigidity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A precise understanding of nano&#8208;bio interactions in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime is necessary for advancements in nanomedicine. However, this is currently hindered by the control of the nanoparticle size in the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. Herein, we report a facile in situ Mn2+&#8208;guided centrifugation strategy for the synthesis of large&#8208;scale ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a precisely controlled size gradient at the sub&#8208;nanometer regime. With the discovery that [Mn(OH)]+, especially metallic manganese (Mn(0)@[Mn(OH)]+) nanoparticles, could selectively interact with larger AuNPs through synergistic coordination and hydrogen bonding to form aggregates, we also realized the fast (&lt;1 h) synthesis of water&#8208;soluble atomically precise Au25 with high yields (&gt;56%). We further demonstrated that sub&#8208;nanometer size differences (approximately 0.5 nm) significantly alter non&#8208;specific phagocytosis of AuNPs in the reticuloendothelial system macrophages, elimination rate, and nanotoxicology.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Catalyzed &#945;&#8208;Oxidative Coupling of Enals with Carboxylic Acids Using an Iodine(III) Reagent</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The enantioselective &#945;&#8208;oxidative coupling of enals with carboxylic acids was developed via the umpolung of NHC&#8208;bound enolate with iodine(III) reagent.

         <title>Second Sphere Effects Promote Formic Acid Dehydrogenation by a Single&#8208;Atom Gold Catalyst Supported on Amino&#8208;Substituted Graphdiyne</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Regulating the second sphere of homogeneous molecular catalysts is a common and effective method to boost their catalytic activities, while the second sphere effects have rarely been investigated for heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts primarily due to the synthetic challenge for installing functional groups in their second spheres. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined and readily tailorable structure of graphdiyne (GDY), an Au single&#8208;atom catalyst on amino&#8208;substituted GDY is constructed, where the amino group is located in the second sphere of the Au center. The Au atoms on amino&#8208;decorated GDY displayed superior activity for formic acid dehydrogenation compared with those on unfunctionalized GDY. The experimental studies, particularly the proton inventory studies, and theoretical calculations revealed that the amino groups adjacent to an Au atom could serve as proton relays and thus facilitate the protonation of an intermediate Au&#8210;H to generate H2. Our study paves the way to precisely constructing the functional second sphere on single&#8208;atom catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;Disubstituted Allenes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we report the first example of Ni&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrosilylation of 1,1&#8208;disubstituted allenes with high level of regioselectivities and enantioselectivities. The key to achieve this stereoselective hydrosilylation reaction was the development of the SPSiOL&#8208;derived bisphosphite ligands (SPSiPO). This protocol features broad substrate scope, excellent functional group, and heterocycle tolerance, thus provides a versatile method for the construction of enantioenriched tertiary allylsilanes in a straightforward and atom&#8208;economic manner. DFT calculations were performed to reveal the reaction mechanism and the origins of the enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic macrocycles have worked as the principal tools for supramolecular chemistry, and also greatly extended the scope of organic charge transfer (CT) complexes as well as their practical value in solid state during the past few years. In this Minireview, we summarize the research progress on the macrocycles&#8208;based crystalline supramolecular assemblies primarily driven by intermolecular CT interactions (a.k.a. macrocycles&#8208;based crystalline CT assemblies, MCCAs for short), which are classified by their different types of donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) constituent elements, including simplex macrocyclic hosts, heterogeneous macrocyclic hosts and host&#8211;guest D&#8208;A pairs. Particular attention will be focused on their diversiform functions and applications, as well as underlying CT mechanisms from the perspective of crystal engineering. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are outlined.</dc:description>

Due to the severe distortion of the ligand sphere upon solvation, these species act as switchable luminophores and single&#8208;molecule magnets. The desolvation of the coordinated solvents can be triggered by applying a dynamic vacuum, as well as a temperature gradient stimulus. Raman spectroscopic investigations revealed fast and fully reversible solvation and desolvation processes. Moreover, we also show that a Nd:YAG laser can induce the necessary temperature gradient for a self&#8208;sufficient switching process of the Ce analogue in a spatially resolved manner.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA nanotechnology relies on the structural and functional information encoded in nucleic acids. Specifically, the sequence&#8208;guided reconfiguration of nucleic acids by auxiliary triggers provided means to develop DNA switches, machines and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. The present review article addresses recent advances in the constructions and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures, networks and materials. Dynamic transformations proceeding within engineered origami frames or between origami tiles, and the triggered dynamic reconfiguration of scaled supramolecular origami structures are addressed. The use of origami frameworks as playground to assemble dynamic chiroplasmonic optical devices and to operate switchable chemical processes are discussed. Also, the dynamic operation of DNA networks are addressed, and the design of &#8220;smart&#8221; stimuli&#8208;responsive all&#8208;DNA materials and their applications are introduced. Future perspectives and applications of dynamic reconfigurable DNA nanostructures are presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Energy Transfer in A &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework Facilitates Excited&#8208;State Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received broad interest owing to their permanent porosity, high stability, and tunable functionalities. COFs with long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;conjugation and photosensitizing building blocks have been explored for sustainable photocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of COF&#8208;based energy transfer Ni catalysis. A pyrene&#8208;based COF with sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugation was synthesized and used to coordinate Ni(II) centers through bipyridine moieties. Under light irradiation, enhanced energy transfer in the COF facilitated the excitation of Ni centers to catalyze borylation and trifluoromethylation reactions of aryl halides. The COF showed two orders of magnitude higher efficiency in these reactions than its homogeneous control and could be recovered and reused without significant loss of catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Adsorption of Epoxy&#8208;Functional Nanoparticles onto Stainless Steel Significantly Reduces Friction in Tribological Studies</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Epoxy&#8208;functional sterically&#8208;stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (~27 nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil. Nanoparticle adsorption onto stainless steel is examined using a quartz crystal microbalance.&#160;Incorporating epoxy groups within the steric stabilizer chains results in a near two&#8208;fold increase in the adsorbed amount, &#915;, at 20 &#176;C (7.6 mg m&#8208;2) compared to epoxy&#8208;core functional nanoparticles (3.7 mg m&#8208;2) or non&#8208;functional nanoparticles (3.8 mg m&#8208;2).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epoxy-functional sterically-stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles (~27 nm) are prepared via RAFT dispersion polymerization in mineral oil. Nanoparticle adsorption onto stainless steel is examined using a quartz crystal microbalance.&#160;Incorporating epoxy groups within the steric stabilizer chains results in a near two-fold increase in the adsorbed amount, &#915;, at 20 &#176;C (7.6 mg m-2) compared to epoxy-core functional nanoparticles (3.7 mg m-2) or non-functional nanoparticles (3.8 mg m-2).

         <title>A Practical and Robust Zwitterionic Cooperative Lewis Acid / Acetate / Benzimidazolium Catalyst for Direct 1,4&#8208;Additions</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A catalyst type is disclosed allowing for exceptional efficiency in direct 1,4&#8208;additions. The catalyst is a zwitterionic entity, in which acetate binds to Cu(II), which is formally negatively charged and serving as counterion for benzimidazolium. All 3 functionalities are involved in the catalytic activation. For maleimides productivity was increased by a factor &gt;300 compared to literature (TONs up to 6700). High stereoselectivity and productivity was attained for a broad range of other Michael acceptors as well. The polyfunctional catalyst is accessible in only 4 steps from N&#8208;Ph&#8208;benzimidazole with an overall yield of 96% and robust during catalysis. This allowed to reuse the same catalyst multiple times with nearly constant efficiency. Mechanistic studies, in particular by DFT, give a detailed picture how the catalyst operates. The benzimidazolium unit stabilizes the coordinated enolate nucleophile and prevents that acetate / acetic acid dissociate from the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Near Quantitative Preparation of Short, Single&#8208;Stranded DNA Circles</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small, single&#8208;stranded DNA (ssDNA) circles have many applications, such as templating rolling circle amplification (RCA), capturing microRNAs, scaffolding DNA nanostructures. However, it is challenging to prepare such ssDNA circles, particularly, when the DNA size becomes very small, e.g. 20 nucleotide (nt) long ssDNA circle. Often, such short ssDNAs dominantly form concatemers (either linear or circular) due to inter&#8208;molecular ligation, instead of forming monomeric ssDNA circles by intramolecular ligation. Herein, we report a simple method to overcome this problem by designing the complementary linker molecules. We have demonstrated that ssDNAs, as short as 16 nts long, can be enzymatically ligated (by the commonly used T4 DNA ligase) into monomeric ssDNA circles at high concentration (100 mM) with high yield (97 %). This method doesn&#8217;t require any special sequence, thus, it is expected to be generally applicable. The experimental protocol is identical to the regular DNA ligation, thus, is expected to be friendly to general chemists and biologists.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly as a Tool to Preserve Electronic Purity of Perylene Diimide Chromophores</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic semiconductors are promising for efficient, printable optoelectronics. Yet, strong excited&#8208;state quenching due to uncontrolled aggregation limits their use in devices. We report on the self&#8208;assembly of a supramolecular pseudo&#8208;cube formed from six perylene diimides (PDIs). The rigid, shape&#8208;persistent cage sets the distance and orientation of the PDIs and suppresses intramolecular rotations and vibrations, leading to non&#8208;aggregated, monomer&#8208;like properties in solution and the solid state, in contrast to the fast fluorescence quenching in the free ligand. The stabilized excited state and electronic purity in the cage enables the observation of delayed fluorescence due to a bright excited multimer, acting as excited&#8208;state reservoir in a rare case of benign inter&#8208;chromophore interactions in the cage. We show that self&#8208;assembly provides a powerful tool for retaining and controlling the electronic properties of chromophores, and to bring molecular electronics devices within reach.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of new n&#8208;type semiconductors with tunable bandgap and dielectric constant has significant implication in dissociating bound charge carrier relevant for demonstrating high performance optoelectronic devices. Boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thioketonates (MTDKB), analogues to boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates containing a sulfur atom in the framework of &#946;&#8208;diketones were synthesized. Bulk transport measurement exhibited an outstanding bulk electron mobility of ~ 0.003 cm2/Vs, which is among the best values reported till date in these class of semiconducting materials and correspondingly a single junction photo responsivity of upto 6 mA/W was obtained. This new family of O,S&#8208;chelated boron compounds exhibited luminescence in the far red/near&#8208;infrared region. The remarkable red shift of 89 nm (fluorescence) observed for 4a in comparison with analogues boron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonate signifies the importance of sulfur in these molecules. MTDKBs with amine functionality have also been investigated as an ON/OFF fluorescent sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct monitoring of Li2S2 evolution and its influence on the reversible capacities of lithium&#8208;sulfur battery</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dissolution of polysulfides and the low conductivity of lithium sulfides (Li2S) are generally considered the main reasons for limiting the reversible capacity of the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) system. Nevertheless, as the inevitable intermediate between polysulfides and Li2S, lithium disulfide (Li2S2) evolutions are always overlooked. Herein, the Li2S2 evolutions are monitored based on operando spectra on the pouch cell level for the first time. Experimental results indicate that the Li2S2 undergoes sluggish electrochemical reduction and chemical disproportionation simultaneously during the discharging process, leading to further polysulfide dissolution and Li2S generation without capacity distribution. Besides, compared with the fully oxidized Li2S, Li2S2 still residues at the end of the charging state. As a result, instead of the generally considered Li2S and polysulfides, the sluggish electrochemical conversions and side chemical reactions of Li2S2 are the determining factors in limiting the actual sulfur utilization, corresponding to the poor reversible capacity of a Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Green&#8208;solvent Processable Dopant&#8208;free Hole Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) urgently requires the development of green&#8208;solvent processable dopant&#8208;free hole transporting materials (HTMs). However, strong intermolecular interactions that ensure high hole mobility always compromise the solubility and film&#8208;forming ability in green solvents. Herein, we show a simple but effective design strategy to solve this trade&#8208;off, that is, constructing star&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A&#8208;D structure. The resulting HTMs (BTP1&#8208;2) can be processed by green solvent of 2&#8208;methylanisole (2MA), a kind of food additive, and show high hole mobility and multiple defect passivation effects. An impressive efficiency of 24.34% has been achieved for 2MA&#8208;processed BTP1 based inverted PVSCs, the highest value for green&#8208;solvent processable HTMs so far. Moreover, it is manifested that the charge separation of D&#8208;A type HTMs at the photoinduced excited state can help to passivate the defects of perovskites, indicating a new HTM design insight.</dc:description>

         <title>Stress&#8208;Induced Inversion of Linear Dichroism by 4,4'&#8208;Bipyridine Rotation in a Superelastic Organic Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecular crystals that manifest unusual mechanical properties have attracted growing attention. Herein, we prepared an organic single crystal that shows bidirectional superelastic transformation in response to shear stress. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractions revealed this crystal&#8208;twinning related shape change is owed to a stress&#8208;controlled 90&#176; rotation of 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine around the hydrogen bonds of a chiral organic trimer. As a consequence of the 90&#176; shift in the aromatic plane, an interconversion of crystallographic a&#8208;, b&#8208;axes (a&#8594;b&#8217; and b&#8594;a&#8217;) was detected. The molecular rotations changed the anisotropic absorption of linearly polarized light. Therefore, a stress&#8208;induced inversion of linear dichroism spectra was demonstrated for the first time. This study reveals the superior mechanical flexibilities of single crystals can be realized by harnessing the molecular rotations and this superelastic crystal may find applications in optical switching and communications.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Degradation of PD&#8208;L1 and Activation of the STING Pathway by Carbon&#8208;Dot&#8208;Based PROTACs for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is an emerging approach to degrade disease&#8208;associated proteins. Here, we report a carbon&#8208;dot (CD)&#8208;based PROTAC (CDTAC) that degrade membrane proteins via ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. CDTACs can bind to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), recruit cereblon (CRBN) to induce PD&#8208;L1 ubiquitination, and degrade them with proteasomes. Fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) is also used to enhance the cellular uptake and proteasome activity. More than 99% or 90% of PD&#8208;L1 in CT26 or B16&#8208;F10 tumor cells can be degraded by CDTACs, respectively. Furthermore, CDTACs can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to trigger immune responses. Thus, CDTACs with FMD treatment effectively inhibit the growth of CT26 and B16&#8208;F10 tumors. Compared with small molecule&#8208;based PROTACs, CDTACs offer several advantages, such as efficient membrane protein degradation, targeted tumor accumulation, immune system activation, and in vivo detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Effective Hybrid Copper(I) Iodide Cluster Emitter with Negative Thermal Quenched Phosphorescence for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The low efficiency triplet emission of hybrid copper(I) iodine clusters is a critical obstacle to their further practical optoelectronic application. Herein, we present an efficient hybrid copper(I) iodide cluster emitter (DBA)4Cu4I4, where the cooperation of excited state structure recombination and the metallophilicity interaction enables ultra&#8208;bright triplet yellow&#8208;orange emission with a photoluminescence quantum yield over 94.9%, and the phonon&#8208;assisted de&#8208;trapping process of exciton induces the negative thermal quenching effect at 80&#8208;300 K. We also investigate the potential of this emitter for X&#8208;ray imaging. The (DBA)4Cu4I4 wafer demonstrates a light yield higher than 104 photons MeV&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of ~5.0 lp mm&#8722;1, showing great potential in practical X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Our new copper(I) iodide cluster emitter can serve as a model for investigating the thermodynamic mechanism of photoluminescence in hybrid copper(I) halide phosphorescence materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds Strengthened Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite for Degradable X&#8208;ray Detector with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility and Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) with flexible and degradable properties have been adopted in flexible X&#8208;ray detection. For now, figuring out the key factors between structure and device performance are critical to guide the design of MFPs. Herein, MPAZE&#8208;NH4I3&#8226;H2O was first designed and synthesized with improved structural stability and device performance. Through theoretical calculations, the introducing methyl group benefits modulating tolerance factor, increases dipole moment and strengthens hydrogen bonds. Meanwhile, H2O increases the hydrogen bond formation sites and synergistically realizes the band nature modulation, ionic migration inhibition and structural stiffness optimization. Spectra analysis also proves that the improved electron&#8208;phonon coupling and carrier recombination lifetime contribute to enhanced performance. Finally, a flexible and degradable X&#8208;ray detector was fabricated with the highest sensitivity of 740.8 &#956;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and low detection limit (0.14 nGyair s&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Organic Framework Cubosomes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate a general strategy for the synthesis of ordered bicontinuous&#8208;structured metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by using polymer cubosomes (PCs) with a double primitive structure (Im m symmetry) as the template. The filling of MOF precursors in the open channel of PCs, followed by their coordination and removal of the template, generates MOF cubosomes with a single primitive topology (Pm&#8208;3m) and average mesopore diameters of 60&#8211;65 nm. Mechanism study reveals that the formation of ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes undergoes a new MOF growth process, which involves the formation of individual MOF seeds in the template, their growth and eventual fusion into the cubosomes. Their growth kinetics follows the Avrami equation with an Avrami exponent of n = 3 and a growth rate of k = 1.33*10&#8208;4, indicating their fast 3D heterogeneous growth mode. Serving as a bioreactor, the ZIF&#8208;8 cubosomes show high loading of trypsin enzyme, leading to a high catalytic activity in the proteolysis of bovine serum albumin.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Cation Migration and Deposition with Xylitol Additive and Oriented Reconstruction of Hydrogen Bonds for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly reversible plating/stripping in aqueous electrolytes is one of the critical processes determining the performance of Zn&#8208;ion batteries, but it is severely impeded by the parasitic side reaction and dendrite growth. Herein, a novel electrolyte engineering strategy is first proposed based on the usage of 100 mM xylitol additive, which inhibits hydrogen evolution reaction and accelerates cations migration by expelling active H2O molecules and weakening electrostatic interaction through oriented reconstruction of hydrogen bonds. Concomitantly, xylitol molecules are preferentially adsorbed by Zn surface, which provides a shielding buffer layer to retard the sedimentation and suppress the planar diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Zn2+ transference number and cycling lifespan of Zn||Zn cells have been significantly elevated, overwhelmingly larger than bare ZnSO4. The cell coupled with a NaV3O8 cathode still behaves much better than the additive&#8208;free device in terms of capacity retention.</dc:description>

         <title>Passivating Lithiated Graphite via Targeted Repair of SEI to Inhibit Exothermic Reactions in Early&#8722;stage of Thermal Runaway</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The self&#8208;exothermic in early stage of thermal runaway is blasting&#8208;fuse for Li&#8208;ion battery safety issues. The exothermic reaction between lithiated graphite (LiCx) and electrolyte accounts for onset of this behavior. However, prevent the deleterious reaction still encounters hurdles. Here, we manage to inhibit this reaction by passivating LiCx in real time via targeted repair of SEI. It is shown that 1,3,5&#8722;trimethyl&#8722;1,3,5&#8722;tris(3,3,3&#8722;trifluoropropyl)cyclotrisiloxane (D3F) can be triggered by LiCx to undergo ring&#8722;opening polymerization at elevated temperature, so as to targeted repair of fractured SEI. Due to the high thermal stability of polymerized D3F, exothermic reaction between LiCx and electrolyte is inhibited. As a result, the self&#8208;exothermic and TR trigger temperatures of pouch cell are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#176;C. This work opens up a new avenue for designing functional additives to block initial exothermal reaction and inhibit TR in early stage.</dc:description>

As a result, the self-exothermic and TR trigger temperatures of pouch cell are increased from 159.6 and 194.2&#176;C to 300.5 and 329.7&#176;C. This work opens up a new avenue for designing functional additives to block initial exothermal reaction and inhibit TR in early stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Interfacial Electron Transfer by Asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In Sites on In2O3 for Efficient Peroxymonosulfate Activation</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enhancing the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation efficiency to generate more radicals is vital to promote the Fenton&#8208;like reaction activity, however, how to promote the PMS adsorption and accelerate the interfacial electron transfer to boost its activation kinetics remain a great challenge. Herein, we prepared Cu&#8208;doped defect&#8208;rich In2O3 (Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov) catalysts containing asymmetric Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites for PMS activation in water purification. The intrinsic catalytic activity is that the side&#8208;on adsorption configuration of the O&#8208;O bond (Cu&#8208;O&#8208;O&#8208;In) at the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites significantly stretches the O&#8208;O bond length. Meanwhile, the Cu&#8208;Ov&#8208;In sites increases the electron density near the Fermi energy level, promoting more and faster electron transfer to the O&#8208;O bond for generating more SO4&#8226;&#8208; and &#8226;OH. The degradation rate constant of tetracycline achieved by Cu&#8208;In2O3/Ov is 31.8 times faster than In2O3/Ov, and it shows the possibility of membrane reactor for practical wastewater treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Polar Phosphorus Chalcogenide Cage Molecules: Enhancement of Nonlinear Optical Properties in Adducts</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The inorganic adduct is an emergent class of infrared nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. However, although the reported NLO adducts have sufficient birefringences and significant laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs), they commonly suffer from weak second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. In this work, a series of polar phosphorus chalcogenide cage molecules with strong hyperpolarizabilities were theoretically screened out to enhance the SHG responses of adducts. Accordingly, (CuI)3(P4S4), (CuI)3(P4Se4), (CuBr)7(P4S3)3 and (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 with target polar cage molecules were successfully synthesized. As expected, they exhibit enhanced SHG responses while keeping moderate birefringences and high LIDTs. Notably, (CuBr)7(P4Se3)3 possesses the largest SHG response (3.5&#215;AGS@2.05 &#956;m) among the known inorganic NLO adducts. Our study confirms that introducing NLO&#8208;active cage molecules into adducts is an efficient strategy for high&#8208;performance NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;crystal superstructures via hierarchical assemblies of giant Rubik's cubes as tertiary building units</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intricate superstructures possess unusual structural features and promising applications. The preparation of superstructures with single&#8208;crystalline nature are conducive to understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship, however, remains an intriguing challenge. Herein we put forward a new hierarchical assembly strategy towards rational and precise construction of intricate single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Firstly, two unprecedented superclusters in Rubik's cube's form with a size of ~ 2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2 nm3 are constructed by aggregation of eight {Pr4Sb12} oxohalide clusters as secondary building units (SBUs). Then, the Rubik's cubes further act as isolable tertiary building units (TBUs) to assemble diversified single&#8208;crystal superstructures. Importantly, intermediate assembly states are captured, which helps illustrate the evolution of TBU&#8208;based superstructures and thus provides a profound understanding of the assembly process of superstructures at the atomic level.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Regulation of Aptamer Affinity through Mechano&#8208;Chemical Coupling</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The capacity to precisely modulate aptamer affinity is important for a wide variety of applications. However, most such engineering strategies entail laborious trial&#8208;and&#8208;error testing or require prior knowledge of an aptamer&#8217;s structure and ligand&#8208;binding domain. We describe here a simple and generalizable strategy for allosteric modulation of aptamer affinity by employing a double&#8208;stranded molecular clamp that destabilizes aptamer secondary structure through mechanical tension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with a thrombin&#8208;binding aptamer and show that we can alter its affinity by as much as 65&#8208;fold. We also show that this modulation can be rendered reversible by introducing a restriction enzyme cleavage site into the molecular clamp domain and describe a design strategy for achieving even more finely&#8208;tuned affinity modulation. This strategy requires no prior knowledge of the aptamer&#8217;s structure and binding mechanism and should thus be generalizable across aptamers.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is vital for clean and renewable energy technologies, which require no fossil fuel but catalysts. Platinum (Pt) is the best&#8208;known catalyst for ORR. However, its high cost and scarcity have severely hindered renewable energy devices (e.g.,&#160;fuel cells) for large&#8208;scale applications. Recent breakthroughs in carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrochemical catalysts (C&#8208;MFECs) show great potential for earth&#8208;abundant carbon materials as low&#8208;cost metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts towards ORR in acidic media. This article provides a focused, but critical review on C&#8208;MFECs for ORR in acidic media with an emphasis on advances in the structure design and synthesis, fundamental understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and electrocatalytic mechanisms, and their applications in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. Current challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Classification for the Prediction of Catalytic Activity of Organic Photosensitizers in the Nickel(II)&#8208;Salt&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Phenols</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic systems using a small amount of organic photosensitizer for the activation of an inorganic (on&#8208;demand ligand&#8208;free) nickel(II) salt represent a cost&#8208;effective method for cross&#8208;coupling reactions, while C(sp2)&#8211;O bond formation remains less developed. Herein, we report a strategy for the synthesis of phenols with a nickel(II) salt and an organic photosensitizer, which was identified via an investigation into the catalytic activity of 60 organic photosensitizers consisting of various electron donor and acceptor moieties. To examine the effect of multiple intractable parameters on the catalytic activity of photosensitizers, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were developed, wherein we embedded descriptors representing their physical and structural properties, which were obtained from DFT calculations and RDKit, respectively. The study clarified that integrating both DFT&#8208; and RDKit&#8208;derived descriptors in ML models balances higher &#8216;precision&#8217; and &#8216;recall&#8217; across a wide range of&#160;search&#160;space relative to using only one of the two descriptor sets.</dc:description>

To examine the effect of multiple intractable parameters on the catalytic activity of photosensitizers, machine-learning (ML) models were developed, wherein we embedded descriptors representing their physical and structural properties, which were obtained from DFT calculations and RDKit, respectively. The study clarified that integrating both DFT- and RDKit-derived descriptors in ML models balances higher &#8216;precision&#8217; and &#8216;recall&#8217; across a wide range of&#160;search&#160;space relative to using only one of the two descriptor sets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Melt&#8208;quenched&#160;glasses of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid crystals, i.e., hybrid glasses,&#160;have attracted increasing attention as an emerging&#160;class of hybrid materials with beneficial processability and formability&#160;in the past years. Herein, we&#160;present&#160;a new hybrid crystal, (Ph3PEt)3[Ni(NCS)5] (1, Ph3PEt+&#160;= ethyl(triphenyl)phosphonium),&#160;crystallizing&#160;in a polar space group P1&#160;and exhibiting&#160;thermal&#8208;induced reversible crystal&#8208;liquid&#8208;glass&#8208;crystal&#160;transitions&#160;with relatively low melting temperature of 132 oC, glass&#8208;transition temperature of&#160;40&#160;oC, and recrystallization on&#8208;set temperature of&#160;78&#160;oC, respectively. Taking advantage of such mild conditions, we fabricated&#160;an unprecedented&#160;hybrid&#160;glass&#8208;ceramic thin film, i.e., a thin glass uniformly embedding&#160;inner polar micro&#8208;crystals,&#160;which exhibits&#160;a&#160;much enhanced intrinsic&#160;second&#8208;order nonlinear optical effect,&#160;being&#160;ca. 25.6 and 3.1 times those of poly&#8208;crystalline 1&#160;and KH2PO4, respectively, without any poling treatments.</dc:description>

         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;alternant non&#8208;benzenoid hydrocarbons exhibit very different optical and electronic properties than those of their well&#8208;studied benzenoid analogs. Yet, preparing such structures with extended conjugation length, remains challenging. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulenes derivatives using a two&#8208;step sequence involving a four&#8208;fold aldol condensation between aromatic dialdehydes and readily available&#160;tetrahydropentalene&#8208;2,5&#8208;(1H,3H)&#8208;dione. Molecules with bandgap values ranging from 1.69 to 2.14 eV and molar extinction coefficient (&#949;) of nearly 3 x 105&#160;M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1&#160;have been prepared. These annulene&#8208;like structures exhibit significant diatropic ring current (aromatic), as supported by&#160;1H NMR and DFT calculations. Field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) using azuleno[2,1,8&#8208;ija]azulene derivatives as semiconductors exhibit charge mobility values up to 0.05 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Biotechnological Frontiers of DNA Nanomaterials Continue to Expand: Bacterial Infection using Virus&#8208;Inspired Capsids</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elegant geometry of viruses has inspired bio&#8208;engineers to&#160;synthetically explore&#160;the self&#8208;assembly of polyhedral capsids employed to protect new cargo or change an enzymatic microenvironment. Recently, Yang et al. used DNA nanotechnology to revisit the icosahedral capsid structure of the phiX174 bacteriophage and reloaded the original viral genome as cargo into their fully synthetic architecture. Surprisingly, when using a favorable combination of structural rigidity and dynamic multivalent cargo entrapment, the synthetic particles were able to infect non&#8208;competent bacterial cells and produce the original phiX174 bacteriophage. This work presents an exciting new direction of DNA nanotech for bio&#8208;engineering applications which involve bacterial interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective 3,3&#8208;Rearrangement of Azobenzenes upon Complexation by a Frustrated Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of the oxygen&#8208;bridged frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (1) and tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (2) with azoben&#173;zene, promoted by UV irradiation, led to a selective complexation of the cis&#8208;isomer. The addition product of 2 is stable, while the adduct of 1 isomerizes in solution in an ortho&#8208;benzidine&#8208;like [3,3]&#8208;rearrange&#173;ment by cleavage of the N&#8211;N bond, saturation of the nitrogen atoms with hydrogen and formation of a new bond between two phenyl ortho&#8208;carbon atoms. Similar rearrangements take place with different para&#8208;substituted azobenzenes (R = Me, OMe, Cl) and di(2&#8208;naphthyl)&#173;diazene, while ortho&#8208;methylated azo compounds do not form adducts with 1. All adducts were characterized by multinuclear NMR spectro&#173;scopy and elemental analyses and the mechanism of the rearrange&#173;ment was explored by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Investigation, Storage, and Separation of Pyrophoric PH3 and P2H4 with &#945;&#8208;Mg Formate</title>
         <description>Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphane, PH3 &#8208; a highly pyrophoric and toxic gas &#8208; is frequently contaminated with H2 and P2H4, which makes its handling even more dangerous. The inexpensive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) magnesium formate, &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], can adsorb up to 10 wt% of PH3. The PH3&#8208;loaded MOF, PH3@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2], is a non&#8208;pyrophoric, recoverable material that even allows brief handling in air, thereby minimizing the hazards associated with the handling and transport of phosphane. &#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] further plays a critical role in purifying PH3 from H2 and P2H4: at 25 &#176;C, H2 passes through the MOF channels without adsorption, whereas PH3 adsorbs readily and only slowly desorbs under a flow of inert gas (complete desorption time &#8776; 6 h). Diphosphane P2H4 is strongly adsorbed and trapped within the MOF for at least 4 months. P2H4@&#945;&#8208;[Mg(O2CH)2] itself is not pyrophoric and is air&#8208; and light&#8208;stable at room temperature.</dc:description>
